Transcript:  It's time for Twig this week in Google.  Stacey Higginbotham, Matthew Ingram, and Jeff Jarvis are all here to talk about some Google-y stuff.  Google's gone all solar. DeepMind has an ethics board, but no one will say who it is.  And it looks like they're dropping the drone deliveries.  I hope it's not on your head. Coming up next on Twig.  This is Twig.  Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by Cashfly, C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y dot com.  This is Twig, This Week in Google, episode 382, recorded Wednesday, December 7th, 2016, last media.

That's because we have such a smart, fun, interesting panel.  We like to get their opinions starting to my right with the wonderful Stacey Higginbotham, who's done double duty this week.  She, of course, is on the Stacey on IoT podcast, but she was also on Twitter on Sunday and has returned on Wednesday.  It was fun having you and Ohm together again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We had a good time.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We should have had Matthew Ingram on too, another Giga Ohm veteran.  He's now at fortune.com.  Hey, Matthew.  Hi.  From the Great White North.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it snowing?  No.  No.  In fact, we've had no snow at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's misnamed.  North of the 49th parallel.  That's all we need to say.  And visiting us from just down the road a piece this week, which explains why his sound is so poor.  Jeff Jarvis.  It's always better in Germany, Jeff.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think something happened.  You sat on your headset or something.  That's all right.  The picture is superb.  That's why I know it's not a bandwidth thing.  It's not a Skype thing.  No, it's Google Wi-Fi.  Jeez.  Yeah.  Google has enough Wi-Fi.  Hey, you know what?  That's kind of cool.  All of that Wi-Fi, solar powered.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I am stunned.  This is the Google keyword blog.  We're set to reach 100% renewable energy.  As you might imagine.  Actually, I don't think people think about this, but when you do a Google search, it uses energy.  When you watch a YouTube video, it searches energy.  When you upload a YouTube video, it uses energy.  By next year, Google is going to be 100% renewable energy for every bit of their operation, including data centers.  What about buses?  That's a good question.  I don't know.  Look at this though, because this graph tells you something.  Let me zoom in a little bit so you can see.  The yellow part of the graph is solar.  It's really just a fraction solar.  It's almost all wind.  Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a lot of wind.  Wind is plentiful and cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is.  You can put it where a lot of their data center operations, they've been planning and putting their data centers in places where they have access to easy wind power.  That's been part of their planning strategy.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that true that they kill birds?  Aren't birds smart enough not to fly into the spinning?  It's not like they spin like a fan in your house.  They're stately.  Dumb birds then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'd have to be a dumb bird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are issues there, but it's better than killing birds with coal oil.  Facebook looks like it's 100% wind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does Google do geothermal as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This graph, they have an 80-megawatt project in Chile.  They just bought all the electricity from a 100-megawatt wind farm in Iowa.  They currently buy 2.6 gigawatts of power.  Gigajigga or giga?  As Urs Holtzl, the Senior Vice President for Technical Infrastructure writes, that's bigger than many large utilities and more than twice as much as the 1.21 gigawatts it took to send Marty McFly to the future.  That's how they said it in the movie, gigawatts, but obviously it's gigawatts.  Is it the old JIF?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to say, I'm not going to be Jigga Stacey.  We're sticking with Jigga.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Excellent point.  The question is, are they using this directly or are these with credits?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Subsidies. Is it offset or is it direct?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It kind of implies that it's direct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some of their data center stuff is direct.  I don't know if it's all direct.  Actually, this whole post is basically that it's direct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It implies that it's direct.  They're not saying we're buying offsets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the graphics says renewable energy credits.  We were one of the first corporations to create large scale long term contracts to buy.  Oh, the graphics says credits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, RECs.  So the green lines are RECs.  Those are the renewable energy credits.  And then the yellow line is electricity.  And then the mix are bundled energy and RECs.  So yeah, you're right.  You're right.  It's still good.  I just did here.  Tapped the button too many times.  Double tap.  I'm supposed to be able to illustrate this.  Yeah, because you don't necessarily have wind farms next door to the Mountain View offices, things like that.  Although, you know, it would be nice if we did.  Twenty agreements to purchase renewable energy.  Six new agreements last year.  Eight hundred forty two megawatts.  The largest aggregate purchase of renewable energy ever made by a non-utility.  Three point five billion dollars in capital investments worldwide generated by renewable energy products from which we buy electricity.  So that's not Google money, but they're kind of subsidizing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they said in 2015, they consumed five point seven terawatt hours of electricity across all their operations,  which is nearly as much electricity as San Francisco used in the same year.  Wow.  And that's from their white paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What that tells you, I mean, you know, you never think about the fact that you're doing a Google search, you're using energy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do.  Good for you.  That's because you're.  Well, it's part of their cost.  It's part of their cost of goods, basically.  So you've got to they've got to take that into consideration.  So making it clean is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember a few years ago, a few years ago, I was I was reading an interview with somebody I can't remember who now who was sitting beside Larry Page at some event and asked him what is the single biggest challenge Google faces in the future.  And Larry reportedly said power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that makes sense.  You know, they design these network's operations centers, which are the chief users of power.  They design them to play be in places where power is cheap, like Oregon, where wind and other renewable resources are plentiful.  A lot of times they don't they put them somewhere because cooling is the other big use of power.  So they put them somewhere where they have seawatered cooled.  I think Facebook at least has some seawater cooled network operations centers as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A bunch of downtown Toronto is cooled by water from the harbor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really? Interesting. So birds are killed in Canada.  Luke Liam says annually 214,000 to 368,000 birds are killed, according to treehuggers.com by windmills.  But the Smithsonian says it's 10,000 to 600,000.  So it's but we've got lots of birds, right? Am I wrong?  How many birds are killed by cats annually?  I think it's a lot more net and we ain't getting rid of cats anytime soon.  And they don't provide power.  All the cat does. Well, there's some purring involved, but that's not.  Look at the cat behind me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to say, Matthew, there's a cat right behind you. How's he handling?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No power. Powerless. I should ask.  Sleeps for 23 hours a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me ask. Let me use some of this cheap energy and ask Google.  How many birds are killed annually by cats?  How much power does a cat produce?  3.7 billion birds are killed annually by cats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. Wow.  How many birds are killed by wind farms?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we're debating. How many birds are killed annually by wind farms?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  573,000 for the 880,000 bats are killed every year by wind.  Kill all the bats you want. I don't like. No, bats are great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, they eat bugs. They mosquitoes. We love bats.  How many birds are killed by office towers? I know that's a big number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What they fly into the windows? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chicago has a big program because there are migratory routes for some kind of bird.  So they black them out at night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, I don't know how. 988 million die in window collisions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's almost a billion.  Okay. Wow.  Okay. So that puts the number in perspective.  Yes, a lot of birds are killed by wind turbines, even with, you know,  Smithsonian, the lowest estimate is 10,000 annually.  The highest estimate is 600,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's a tiny fraction. A fraction of the number just fly into buildings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I had two killed last year who flew in our windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So bird killer. I know it's how many turkeys are killed every year for Thanksgiving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  According to PETA, like chickens,  the 300 million turkeys raised and killed for their flesh every year in the United States have no federal legal protection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't ask you about that. That's an that's an overanswer.  Thank you. But that's you're over answering.  We're going down a rabbit hole now.  She's so preachy. Google's time lapse.  So Google is actually now it's good PR.  It's good for their business.  But I think they actually do care about renewable.  And I'm glad to see they're doing this.  They have put together these really interesting time lapses at the Google Earth engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those are fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These are zoomable videos that let you see how the earth's changed over 32 years,  because that's as long as we've had satellite pictures.  This is Miami. So you can see as it as it gets built up.  What do you want to look at San Francisco?  I wish we had I wish we had this for like 100 or 200 years,  because that's when you'd really see like these cities appear out of nowhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  After you build your time machine, you can go back and put up satellites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's or go into the future.  Here's the Sharay's glacier.  Go which one do you want to see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to say go look at like Greenland or Iceland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this is an Antarctic glacier.  Over 32 years, which pretty much looks the same.  That looks fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you could try down in like Chile or Brazil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the Columbia. Columbia.  Columbia Glacier, which is in Alaska.  Up above the 49th parallel.  You know, these are not as well, there's a melting going on there.  Yeah. How about Vegas?  Vegas has changed a lot. No more glaciers.  In the desert.  I don't know. I just kind of cool.  It is and it's limited totally.  Oh, boy. That's a lot of growth in 32 years.  This is totally limited, of course, by the prevalence of satellite pictures.  But this is a cool idea.  So this comes from NASA's Landsat program, most of them.  The Copernicus Sentinel program from the EU and other the US Geological Survey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it struck me speaking of power, looking at especially driving through Philadelphia or anywhere in Pittsburgh area,  anywhere there were sort of steel mills.  A lot of those spots are where Google and other companies have put server farms because they get a lot of power.  They're sort of by a dam or something.  And in many cases, their orders of magnitude larger than the steel mills they replaced.  But they take, you know, 10 people to operate, whereas the steel mill employed like 20,000.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I just discovered at Bethlehem, PA, they took the rusting old hulk of Bethlehem steel and built a bridge next to it so you could walk along.  And it is awe inspiring, the huge amount of energy that it took to burn things, to push forced air into it.  It's amazing.  The energy we do use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and this is where you know, this is what Google's mission is, is data, right?  And it's very interesting to see how data is used to learn things.  Hour of code. This is the week of the hour code.  Are you taking your daughter somewhere, Stacey, to code?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Her school does it.  Although every time she comes home with her, I did my hour of code.  She's kind of like, I'm like, and how did you feel about it?  And she's like, hey, she made it every.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you remember President Obama said I want every child to learn how to code.  I don't mean I actually what I believe is that and I think there's a lot of research to show this.  And I've talked to people who agree that coding could be taught in math classes, that much of the benefit you get in math, which is rigorous thinking, problem solving, you could get from coding.  And they're very closely related and you could integrate easily integrate coding into math curricula all around the country.  And I think, you know, a lot of times when kids are doing algebra, they go, why am I why am I doing this?  What am I going to ever get out of this?  I think code as would be equally probably challenging and maybe uninteresting to some.  But at least you could look at it and say, well, I could see what the value of this is.  You know, I mean, I may not be that interested, but I could see why you would want to learn that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it would be for kids a better way to do it.  And her school does it this way.  They code using Minecraft.  So they're actually making Minecraft mods for their hour of code, which shows them, hey, this directly applies to something you care desperately about.  Does she play Minecraft?  Oh, God, yes.  So she watches the videos too.  So much so much happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no. Well, this is a Microsoft course on Minecraft and they're doing a whole bunch of our code stuff.  And I'm sure her school is using the curricula that Microsoft offers for free for probably for grades two and up.  How about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's important that they see this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You think they got a good deal on Minecraft?  What was it?  Three billion?  Three point two billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, I think it's worth like ten times that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and also the mind share that they get as a result of this has got to be huge.  I mean, these kids love Minecraft and now it's a Microsoft thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do they get licensing deals based on all the Lego things and all of the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, we have Minecraft stuffed animals in our house.  So is Microsoft getting a cut of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It all goes right in Bill Gates' pocket.  OK, so the chicken.  Here's the chicken is frozen.  Place move and turn blocks in the when spawn shot to get it to move.  Chicken, when spawn, move forward.  You put that in here.  Uh huh.  Turn left.  Put that in there.  Snaps and then play a clock.  Let's see.  Did I program my...  Let's get that snapped in there too.  There we go.  And let's run my code.  Go chicken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See how fun this is?  And what's nice, they're smart.  You're a programmer.  Yeah, I'm a programmer.  Look, I'm going to write a billion dollar app.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  This is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They show a hip young woman doing it.  Hi, I'm Lisa.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm a software developer on Minecraft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm telling you, the sparkly shoes, they would win over like actually me right now.  I wouldn't be like Jim.  You can see why they showed it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that's...  Oh, she's hip and cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the ocelot will sneak towards you and if you feed it the fish, you tame it.  And the ocelot is your own cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my God, my daughter wants an ocelot so badly.  Not a real one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A Minecraft ocelot, I hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A Minecraft ocelot.  She's got...  Her menagerie in Minecraft is pretty intense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I have a little...  I think it's cool if people are building like hard drives or like functioning processors  inside Minecraft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  There's some really amazing...  There's a...  Let me see if I can find it.  There's a wonderful video.  This is kind of old of a Minecraft computer using redstone.  This is...  I don't know.  The guy who did this...  Wow.  Spent a lot of time.  But Minecraft is Lego.  It really is the...  It's Lego for the 21st century and it's getting kids...  I think in a lot of ways, even just playing Minecraft teaches you kind of fundamental  concepts that are useful in later life in technology in a lot of ways.  This is huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, did I show you guys...  I think this was my pick one week was the little bits Minecraft mod that you can actually...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  It really needs stuff.  That's cool.  We've talked about...  In fact, we had...  Karsten's son came and Zach came in and reviewed the Piper computer kit, which is a kit that  you...  It's actually going to be...  I'm sure it's a hot Christmas present.  Look, he's typing on the...  He types and it's coming out on the terminal.  Wow.  In Minecraft, folks.  What you have to understand is that terminal is like 800 stories high.  It's gigantic.  It's huge.  Let me show you the Piper.  This is for parents of kids around maybe 8 to 12.  I got that.  Did you get the Piper?  Oh, you have that.  You have that child.  I have a child from 8 to 12.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've played with the Kano, but not the Piper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is playpiper.com.  If she's into Minecraft, because what's neat is it's 300 bucks, a little pricey, but what  you get is a whole computer, a Minecraft computer that you assemble, but also with it, and this  is the really cool stuff, comes little assignments that you...  Because it also has switches and buttons and knobs and buzzers and breadboards.  You get little levels like freaky fungi, build an array of buttons and switches, physical  ones, not in Minecraft, to navigate your way across giant mushrooms.  So it's going to use the actual physical buttons that come with the kit plus the switches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I sort of wish I had younger kids now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.  Wouldn't this be fun?  It really does probably need a little help from mom or dad, but I think this is really  neat.  I don't know.  Are we overburdening Minecraft to make it responsible for teaching our kids everything  now?  It's like, oh, you're going to like it.  It's Minecraft.  Yeah, yeah.  I heard that before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Whenever I get my daughter some of these things, she looks at me and she's like, I see this.  This is just one of your STEM toys, mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did a big review of children's software, like educational software.  This was years ago.  So they were CDs and stuff.  I remember talking to this professor and he said kids are really, really good at finding  the fun parts of whatever you give them and avoiding or finding ways around the educational  parts.  Well, don't you remember that as a kid?  Right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You have to trick them into doing something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's less tricky, but giving them the opportunity to say, because some kids are, they're going  to be like, holy cow, I can totally own this game.  Those are the same people who 20 years ago played, learned how to code on their own.  So I think it's important to have the exposure.  But yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that was always my attitude is I don't know what's going to stick, but I want to  get my kids, I'm sure you guys felt the same way, exposed to as many different things as  possible so that they can find the one that sticks because you don't really know ahead  of time.  You do not?  You don't.  You can't tell.  Although.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although.  I was going to say next week, I'm going to bring it.  I got my daughter a Anki Cosmo, the little Cosmo robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you're going to love it.  We had one here.  It's so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're so excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You told her already?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, so her grandparents are giving it to her and we're doing Christmas this weekend at  their house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, nice.  This is really interesting because this is a programmable computer, but the design was  by some former Pixar engineers.  And so it's very much personified, kind of like WALL-E.  And that's to me what makes this kind of interesting.  And then you program it.  You can actually write Python code for it.  It's got an API, but it also plays games.  Yeah, I think this is, I think, a really interesting.  If I had to pick one of these toys, this would be the one that would be the big one  this season.  It's got a little companion cube he could play games with.  Place high to seek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was trying to write a piece.  I really fear that we're going to see a huge backlash to technology when populists discover  that it's not immigration that costs their jobs.  It's this little thing.  It's robots and automation.  That was the Luddite revolution, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ned Ludd, who may or may not have existed, led weavers to destroy the Jacquard Looms because  they were losing jobs to the Looms.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and if you think about it, I was just the other day I was looking at the number  of long haul truck drivers in the United States.  That job is effectively going to disappear.  Literally hundreds of thousands of people.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And those are...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you look at the map of the map of states, the most common jobs in most American states  is truck driver.  Yeah.  Yes.  So humanizing automation like that, I think is really interesting.  And I wonder what impact, if any, it has on kind of the national conversation around it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Amazon Go, which I don't know if we're going to talk about, but the grocery store  concept that they just unveiled in Seattle.  Oh my God.  My first job was a cashier.  And I'm like, now I think there'll still be customer service kind of jobs, like people  in the store, but not as many.  If you think about automation and stocking, then oof, oof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the idea of the store, and they only have one right now, it's kind of a beta, is there  even an automated checkout?  You just put stuff in your bag and it has cameras.  It's kind of like in Vegas, the honor bar in Vegas, where if you move the peanuts, you  get charged for the peanuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's exactly what we can...  We talked about it on our show for tomorrow and that's exactly what I was like, it's the  hotel mini bar fridge.  Yeah.  I think it's a little more sophisticated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You saw in this video that when you go in, you use your smartphone to check in so it  knows you and it's clearly got to associate you with the purchase.  So there's cameras following you around, I would guess, and sensors, because it's got  to know that you're the one that moved the cheesecake cupcake from the refrigerator and  put it in the bag.  But then you just want...  I mean, as a shopper, you love this, right?  As a worker...  But this is coming.  Can you legislate against stuff like this?  I guess you could.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're going to need someone to repair the sensors, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  The economics of doing this are really interesting because you turn your wage expenditures over  time into an upfront capital expenditure and then you think about where down the value  chain...  Who affixes the RFID to the packaging?  Right now, it's not integrated.  I'm not saying all these jobs are going to be instantly replaced, but there is just a  shift and so figuring out where that shift is will be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was talking to a German and trying to hear and explain what's happening in retail in  the US and how we only have one bookstore left and one electronic store left.  I said Amazon is going to bring down everything that can be commoditized into same day delivery  and Amazon delivery.  And then the fresh...  Now they're attacking the only thing left which is fresh.  And when it comes to pick stuff up and Amazon is going to be the future of all retail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So politicians at this point have chosen an easy kind of straw man to blame for the loss  of jobs which is international trade and offshoring.  And furlures coming in.  I don't see...  I really don't see anybody saying the truth of the matter which is that automation is  going to cost far more jobs and really the jobs it costs are lower skilled jobs.  Yeah, entry level jobs.  Entry level jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, truck driver.  Truck driver, that's a great job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the really well-paid, one of the few well-paid jobs that you don't need a college  degree to do.  And those are going to go away.  Those are going to go away first.  So that's problem one.  I don't see anybody saying well...  And what would you say?  Well, let's stop automation.  I don't know what you would say.  Well, that's what the effort around basic income is.  Basic income though is a really bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not...  But this is Silicon Valley people there are trying to push this.  Politicians can't go against automation because yes, it's going to take our jobs away but  it's also going to make our goods incredibly cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what Mark Andreessen says.  He says, yeah, he says, well, but everything's going to be so cheap.  But it's not infinitely cheap.  It's not free.  Right.  We're still going to have to figure out what to do with people.  If your Amazon is in your interest to maintain a large middle class that can buy goods because  because if you become so efficient that you eliminate your customers' incomes, then it  doesn't matter.  So I think even companies like Amazon need to think about this.  And of course, right now, the only groups that are thinking about it are unions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it seems to me from a political point of view, if automation starts getting rid  millions of jobs, who are people going to look to sort of target as the to blame for  that?  It's going to be Silicon Valley and technology companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then the other blame piles on Matthew.  I think you're right.  Then surveillance and privacy and taxes and all kinds of things pile on.  And I think Silicon Valley is in for a rough ride going ahead.  And they're not prepared for it.  They're...  They're as hubristic as ever out here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I do love the idea of, well, you'll only work at stuff you find interesting, that  the robots will do all the unpleasant work and people who don't have a higher skill  set who haven't been to college or haven't been trained in more advanced technologies  will just have a basic income.  They may not have the frills, but they'll be able to survive.  Is that...  What's wrong?  I should take a step back because I said that's a bad idea.  Is it a bad idea?  Maybe that's not such a bad idea.  That sounds almost like a utopia.  Why is it a bad idea?  It's a bad idea.  Is a basic income a bad idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually don't think it's a bad idea at all.  And it's funny, you can get people on the far left and you can get people sort of libertarians  on the far right agreeing that basic income is a good idea.  If you can't guarantee people sort of a shot at a reasonable job or living, then you have  to give them something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the one concern I've read about a basic income.  And I don't know enough about this and this is of course a matter of debate.  But when Obama's chief economist and chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers talked  He says,  Replacing our current anti-poverty programs, and that's the part I want you to pay attention  to, with universal basic income, would in any realistic design make the distribution  of income worse, not better.  Our tax and transfer system, in other words entitlements and things and, you know, poverty,  anti-poverty programs, is largely targeted towards those in the lower half of the income  distribution, which means it works to reduce both poverty and income inequality.  Replacing part or all of that system with a universal cash grant would mean relatively  less of the system was targeted toward those at the bottom, increasing income inequality  because they replace everything from Head Start to food stamps with a check, to medical  care with a check.  And then it's your responsibility to pay for everything out of that.  I don't know enough about it.  I'm just, I mean, Furman is the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.  He's dead set against this for that reason.  And I would suggest reading more about it because I don't know.  That's where that comes from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, aren't they doing experiments right now in Canada?  Is it Vancouver or Matthew, somewhere in Canada, they're doing a basic income experiment for  a couple of months?  We should.  We should.  To see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of, well, I guess the devil's in the details.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Matthew is talking, but he's not saying anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How many times has that happened to me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think if it replaces other things, your point is a good one, if it replaces other  things that are valuable.  It kind of has to.  Right.  But it doesn't, but it leaves people worse off as a result.  Then that's probably bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This strikes me as the typical Silicon Valley utopianism, which usually involves a lot of  hand waving.  Like, oh no, no, no, it's not a problem.  Stuff's going to be, goods are going to be really cheap and you give everybody a basic  income and it's utopia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The government ends up buying all of our surfaces for people.  Yay!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but where does the government, so the government's tax base comes from where?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This reminds me of, so the dystopian view would be that episode of Black Mirror where  people who didn't have the means just provided power for people by biking.  So somewhere in the middle, maybe we can come up with something.  Think about all the services we still need that involve people and robots are never going  to take over.  I think teaching, while you can augment that with computers, I think children and people  still need people around them.  So elder care, I think, could be an option.  Any service where you have to teach people things, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the hard part is that a lot of those jobs are relatively skilled in the sense that,  so cashier jobs and delivery truck driving jobs and loading and unloading warehouse jobs  are great jobs for people who either can't get or can't afford to get skills where they  could get better jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the debate around what kind of education you need for things is also something worth  talking about going forward because right now we have a very old set of thought processes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  basically about knowledge.  It's very simplistic and out of date, I agree with you.  And that's why the political conversation right now is on loss of industrial jobs and  offshoring when really the smart, the prudent thing would be to look to the future where  it's really going to be about automation.  And what do we do now?  What kind of training, what kind of preparation, what kind of programs can we put in place?  Because frankly otherwise, if you have a large unemployed group of unemployed people...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody wants that.  No government benefits when you have a large group of unemployed people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's bad for everybody.  Bad for business, bad for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Education isn't just about the job skills.  It's about understanding how to have a civic civil discussion in society and that's what  we're lacking right now.  That's true.  It's about understanding the value of facts and the value of rationality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So did you know...  So anyway, I agree.  I think this is this...  I don't know what the answers are and this is why I brought this up kind of is what we  need to think.  We need to start preparing for this future though and that's what everybody seems to  agree.  And by the way, we do a lot of interviews on this kind of stuff on triangulation.  One of the things, one of the books we interviewed, I can't remember who it was.  Maybe you do, Karsten, talked about the fact that it's not going to restrict itself to  less skilled jobs.  Lawyers and doctors are going to be out of work or reduced work because of automation  as well.  There's a...  You know, the highlight from...  It was a father and son who wrote this book.  The highlight of it was that just that these more...  Like a lawyer, well, you won't have to do all the busy work.  You can do the stuff that a computer can't do very well, but what we're seeing is computers  going to do more and more stuff pretty well.  And I just think there's fewer jobs in every category, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But in the case of a doctor, it won't replace, but it augments.  It makes diagnosis better.  But I don't know that it's going to be more efficient than that.  Well, if you're a radiologist...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me put it this way.  If you're a radiologist today, you should be thinking about what else you're going to  do in five years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What if you think about it from this...  So when I talk to industrial internet, like about industrial IoT, one of the big things  that they're thinking about is the centralization of expertise.  And you're seeing this happen with doctors, with telemedicine, is you can now send data  wherever you want.  So maybe we're going to get pools of places where you have people who are really good  at what the automation isn't.  And maybe we can get to a place where you can really fine tune and get to things that  otherwise people weren't able to do.  So maybe it's deeper, crazy, more esoteric surgeries that computers can't handle.  I don't know.  What I'd worry about though is when you can have those things anywhere, where are those  things going to pool?  If you don't have access to broadband, then you're out of that loop entirely.  So this is tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually think that's a huge element is a lot of the things that we're talking about,  whether it's automation or sort of knowledge networks enabled by the internet, a lot of  that stuff simply isn't available to people because of where they live.  They have something that amounts to dial-up access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's another reason there's a huge gulf between the urban elites and liberals  and the rural disenfranchised.  And boy, you see that gulf in this country and it's just widened and widened and widened.  Well, in the election, I think it highlighted that.  Reflected some of that.  Yeah.  And boy, that's as crystal clear that that's happening.  And it has been happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll also see at a government level licensing requirements about people being in the mix.  That for sure is going to happen.  So we're never going to have a robot doing surgery without somebody present and probably  several someone's present for a long time to come.  And that's how the government's probably going to help ease some of this out.  And there will be people who are like, oh, that's so unfair.  It could be cheaper and better when robots could do everything.  So it'll be kind of an interesting, fun debate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and I can definitely see there's no way they're going to let massive amounts of  tractor trailers drive across the country without human beings sitting in the cab.  What if it's safer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What if you get better medicine because it's automated and it's cheaper and we can't afford  it to have humans do it?  What if there are fewer accidents because robot trucks are safer?  But if a robot kills you, it's very different.  I think it's going to be increasingly difficult for regulations to enforce something that  has such a high cost in other areas.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I hate to think that government's going to protect us from automation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's less government and more like licensing zeros and agencies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or think about safety regulations.  Think about the airplane, that industry.  Pilots are needed for a relatively small portion of the average airplane flight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Still fewer pilot jobs, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Many of them fall asleep during the flight because they're simply not necessary.  Planes could easily take off and land themselves.  But I don't think we're prepared to accept that for a whole bunch of reasons.  So we still have human beings in the cockpit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stuff that I wish we were seeing more of this kind of conversation going on in the public  forum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've got a good segue if we want to take it.  Let's take it.  To Google Wings program because that is delivery jobs, possibly.  What is the Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A wing, you mean wing marketplace?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wing marketplace, sorry.  There's an app that takes you to the airport here in Austin since we don't have Uber and  Lyft that's called Wings.  And so my brain just went wings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is chicken wings from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a Google drone delivery thing.  Is that what this is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Wing marketplace.  Is that what it's called?  Not for chicken wings.  Not for chicken wings.  Maybe for chicken wings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although that would be a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Am I right?  Looking at the wrong article.  The Wall Street Journal, Google X Plans Wing Marketplace.  It gets me the wrong link every time.  An online exchange for $6 drone deliveries for what though?  This is why when people say, oh, well, this is years off and then you read stuff like  this, oh, radiologists, we got another couple of decades and then you read stuff like this.  This stuff's happening pretty fast.  So drone deliveries for $6, I don't understand.  But now remember we were talking about the Chipotle deliveries in Virginia Tech, which  were discontinued, right?  Starbucks pulled out of the negotiations because Starbucks wanted the customer data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they're working with Domino's.  They've reportedly met with Domino's Pizza, Whole Foods and other fast food chains to  get the program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And yes.  They have been approved for test flights, but only at a special location, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they haven't yet been approved for general drone deliveries.  What's the interest in drone deliveries?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was just going to ask that because I'm sitting here.  I understand the logic, right?  UPS trucks are too big to get places.  The air is relatively uncongested for now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, wait till every package has a drone attached to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if you think about sending a drone through a warehouse, it can pick up what it needs  because it's tagged automatically.  Because it's computerized, it can be scaled to massive deliveries, right?  But yet because it's small and lightweight, it can do it at a personalization.  So you combine scale, yay, plus personalization, double yay.  So I see why it's intellectually appealing.  But would you picture the world like this?  It's not really appealing at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess what this is looking at is the continued trend towards the distribution of intelligence  into every little small thing.  And drone technology allows it to be mobile intelligence.  And it's kind of like nanobots, right?  have millions of tiny intelligent things, all acting, avoiding running into stuff.  And so you had millions of drones just like you said, Stacey, flying into the factory,  getting the thing and flying it to me.  I guess that's more efficient, but it's kind of a sci-fi future.  I mean, there are places where it makes sense.  I think it just sounds cool.  Delivering drugs in Haiti.  Well, see, part of what we do is because it sounds cool, right?  I feel like Eric Schmidt's going, not Eric Schmidt, Sergey Brin's going, well, how  did it be cool?  Let's do that.  So I was talking to somebody, maybe now, Jeff, close your ears because you're at Google.  I was talking to somebody who had a friend who worked at Google who said everybody's  dispirited at Google because Ruth Porat, the new CFO, apparently Larry and Sergey are out  smoking blunts.  They're just kind of dialed out.  Ruth Porat's in charge and she's been slashing everything, including, by the way, this drone  project.  In fact, this is exactly what it says.  This article from Bloomberg Technology last month, the project wing is the latest alphabet  project to be targeted financial restraint, aka Ruth Porat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There do seem to be a lot of cuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This person was very dispirited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Google was always the one that funded stuff that seemed futuristic and probably  unmonetizable.  And that's part of what we liked about it, I think, was that they were the ones who were  willing to take on these massive programs.  Go ahead, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're right, Matthew.  Where else is there pure research going on?  Well, everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We just don't talk about it.  I'm sure Apple is doing a lot of pure research in a lot of interesting areas.  Facebook clearly is.  Mark Zuckerberg is building Jarvis in his house.  You call that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not...  Yeah, but Google always felt like the research and sort of making the world better or whatever.  Maybe I'm just naive, but like that was part of what they were doing, not just trying to  create something they could sell for a bunch of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  According to this journal article, the reason wing, the wing project kind of got clipped  is because they were aiming for a thousand successful flights and they couldn't get without  accident, they couldn't get past 300.  They kept running into trees and falling out of the sky and stuff.  So really it wasn't Ruth Porat, it was a technology problem that clipped wings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the drones, have you seen the pizza delivering drone?  It's just a little cooler with wheels and it drives around neighborhoods and comes to  your door.  It seems way more realistic to me than things flying through the air and dropping pizzas.  Like why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, imagine if you're trying to take off from SFO and you have to wait till 300 drones  carrying pizzas get out of the way.  Forget birds and drone, bird strikes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wasn't there a drone accident with a plane?  Was there?  Has there been now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think there was one.  No, I think it was almost, wasn't it?  I think yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Could have been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's take a break and then we're going to talk about Deep Mind.  As long as we're talking about deep things.  But first, how about some deep sleep brought to you by Casper, the world's best mattress.  Casper offers free shipping and returns in the US and Canada of the best mattress ever  made in the US of a live the dream.  It's the perfect mattress.  The technology behind the Casper mattress is amazing.  I magazine named it one of the best inventions of 2015.  Fast Company Design Finalist 2015, Big Innovation Award winner 2016.  Because these mattresses are made in the USA with some really sophisticated technology  so that they breathe.  Actually I love, let me see if I can find, they talk about the technology here on this  is the website.  How they designed the mattress.  They had the criterion that they used.  See the design story.  Yeah, here it is.  So they were looking for a mattress.  These are the factors.  Firmness, density, the factors they considered.  Rebound speed, airflow, transition temperature.  If you've ever had a smart memory foam mattress, you know that they get hard when it's cold.  It's weird and odor because nobody wants to smell latex.  So they solved these and I can tell you from experience because I have a Casper mattress.  I like it so much.  I gave one to my son.  Our nephew has one as well.  These are great mattresses made in the United States.  They did 1000 different formulations of foam.  3240 hours of testing.  Delivered 108 prototypes before they came out with the perfect mattress.  An award winning combination of latex, memory and support foams and combined in such a way  that you get this amazing night's sleep with no springs, no coils.  It has just the right give, just the right firmness.  Look, here's the deal.  You got to try it and the beauty part of this, it comes in this great box, surprisingly small  box and you just open it up and the mattress emerges which makes it easy to get into the  bedroom.  Now you might say, well, but what if I don't like it?  Well, good news.  You have 100 days to return it.  If at any time in the first 100 days you don't like it, Casper sends along a courier who  will take it off your hands and refund every penny.  So there's no risk in getting a Casper mattress.  We love our Casper and I want you to try it for a great, a great sleep.  100 night free trial awaits you and we're going to get you $50 off your mattress purchase  when you go to Casper, casper.com slash twig, casper.com slash twig.  Use the offer code twig at checkout to save 50 bucks on any mattress from Casper.  Terms and conditions do apply though.  Casper.com slash twig.  If your mattress is more than 10 years old, it's time for a new one.  You should not keep sleeping on it.  People do not replace mattresses often enough.  So I didn't realize this, but when Google acquired DeepMind, the artificial intelligence  lab, they created a board, according to Business Insider, a mysterious AI ethics board.  And earlier this week, DeepMind's co-founder Mustafa Suleiman was speaking at Disrupt,  TechCrunch Disrupt in London.  And he refused who said who's on the board.  It's a secret.  The ethics board is ongoing.  It's something we have internally to oversee some of our efforts.  We've tried other approaches.  Most recently, we got together with Amazon, Facebook, IBM, Microsoft and Google to start  the partnership on AI.  You know, we've often said, oh, Google's Skynet and blah, blah, blah.  But I think even they're a little nervous.  They've got an ethics board.  Last year, he said he wanted to publish the names of people who sit on the board.  But for some reason, pulled back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is the rationale for not making that public?  It's a secret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  But why?  I don't know.  See, that's what I wonder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The benefits of making it public would be wonderful because you could actually say things  like, hey, look at your board.  It's all white men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's probably why, right?  Exactly.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That has a very different effect on the types of algorithms and how you're training things.  I mean, how you think about ethics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John C. Havens, we interviewed about his book, Artificial Intelligence, Embracing Our Humanity  to Maximize Machines, wrote on Medium DeepMind, where's the AI ethics board?  He said exactly that.  Okay, great that you have an ethics board, but you've got to tell us who these people  are so we understand what your guidelines are.  You've got to reveal guidelines regarding ethical considerations.  What if Peter Thiel's on there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm not going to go there.  Not today.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you.  So he says, I'm tired of being angry at Google.  Here's my appeal.  Googlers, please announce some specifics about the AI ethics board.  Delight us all with the experts you've asked to be part of this groundbreaking group that  aren't all on your board, Silicon Valley types or technocrats.  Please us with your choices of multiracial women, heavy, globally represented voices  that can spark a conversation about humanity and ethics.  Because if all you got is a bunch of people reading science fiction, it ain't going to  do it.  Well, good point.  I didn't even know they had a board.  I'm glad to see they have a board, but it doesn't mean much if it's not a board.  Who should be on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, Jeff, turn it into a positive.  You know who'd be great?  Just because I love his writing on AI and just the world.  It's Ken Liu.  He's a story.  He's a writer.  Gosh, Ken, Ken, let's see.  Is that how you spell his name?  I'm trying to think.  No.  Did we interview Ken?  I think we did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That sounds familiar.  What does he do?  Ken, so L-I-U.  Yeah, he, grace of kings and the paper of menagerie.  I think you're right.  Sometimes writers might be the right people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not saying he should be the only one, but he writes about this and he follows research  very closely and then clearly is spinning it into these kind of narratives that put  people at this core.  And that's so essential.  So, I think Nicholas Carr would be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nick Carr would be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I also think you want people, I think Stacey's instinct is right here.  You want people from outside the field too.  You want a, a clergy and a historian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's get a Unitarian on that board.  A Unitarian.  What, are you laughing at my faith?  I was brought up Unitarian.  The thing I like about Unitarian is because the message, at least when they told me, is  worship the God of your choice.  Yeah, Unitarian, anything goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anything goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the least religious religion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's good.  That's for me, baby.  Yeah.  I'm glad they have an ethics board.  I'd like to know who's on it.  And I think we can think, I think you're right, Jeff.  We can think about, there's some people you would want on there.  You'd want a Nelson Mandela.  You'd want, you'd want some people who are great humanitarians on that board.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who's the writer for Weapons of Math Destruction?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cathy O'Neill would be great.  Cathy O'Neill.  We want Cathy O'Neill.  Larry Lessig.  Oh.  Larry Lessig.  Dana Boyd.  David Brin.  Neil Stevenson.  We can go on and on.  There are lots of people who should be on that board.  Margaret Atwood.  She'd be great.  I like that a lot.  Wouldn't she be great?  She would be.  And she's written a lot about these issues.  She's thought about these issues.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, gosh.  We should have the AI ethics board episode of TWIG and just get some of these people  in the room and we'll ask them questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be fascinating just to record, show a meeting of this group and what they're  talking about and thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But here's the thing, Leo.  Actually, I don't think it's a membership that's a problem.  I'll bet that there is discussion of capabilities that they just don't want out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be scary.  Probably.  Because Google knows better than anybody what these things can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Remember when they said they weren't going to enable facial recognition even though they  could?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and my complaint then was, well, government already has all that.  Why can't we have it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Government doesn't know how to implement a lot of these things.  Thank God.  Sometimes the lack of competence is a saving grace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we had on Monday the most mind-boggling interview with the director of Jason Matheny  of the IARPA, which is a government.  It's like DARPA, but it's under the Director of National Intelligence.  It's the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects activity.  And if you look at the things they're investigating, it's all of that.  Frightening, I bet.  Frightening.  Well, yeah, actually I was kind of a little reassured because they were paying attention,  I guess.  But yeah, I mean, it's automatic speech recognition in reverberant environments.  In other words, speech recognition in less than favorable acoustic environments.  They had this great thing, this challenge called Jedi Mind.  Who can you trust?  And what metrics would you apply to find out if somebody you're talking to is trustworthy?  And what they do is they open it to researchers, scientists, universities.  If you didn't hear the interview, it was, wow, it was kind of the stuff that the government  is investigating.  And this is for pretty blue sky research.  What Jason Matheny said is this is high risk, high reward investigations.  High risk, high payoff research is very, very interesting.  So yeah, I mean, I think a lot of the things our government even is...  What made me think of this is the Janus program, facial recognition under real world conditions  of off-pose, low quality, obstructed images.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, so what you're...  People are wearing the refl...  We saw the videos, was it two weeks ago?  Those reflective sunglasses, yeah.  You could put that into the snap goggles or snap glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We actually, Colleen was going to make this for us in the studio because people would  come into the studio and be on camera and they didn't want to.  And so we were going to have hanging on the hooks a little collar you could put on that  had infrared lights, so they're invisible to humans, but they would blast the cameras  and you would look like a glowing head floating in the studio.  Nice.  I know, I thought that was a great idea.  That is.  Why didn't you build it?  Oh, she had other things to do, I guess.  And now she's working at Facebook where she is like one of the most important people  over there in Blue Sky Research.  She's doing some amazing stuff.  Is she Facebook now?  I didn't know when...  She went to Google.  I do that.  And she's been at Facebook for a couple of years.  I am told that she's the woman who designed Facebook's 360-degree camera.  She's an expert in video streaming, which I might say she learned from us here at Twitter.  No.  No, not at all.  In fact, we benefited more from her.  How about IARPA's OSI program, automated tools that provide early warning of societal  instability and disease outbreaks more than a week earlier than traditional methods?  So Twitter.  Twitter.  How about this, the ACE program, crowdsourcing to reduce the error of geopolitical forecasts  by more than 50%.  Turns out the wisdom of the crowds ain't so bad.

Transcript:  Did you see DNA to face?  They're seeking information on using genetic information to predict facial structure.  So if you have someone's DNA, you could theoretically predict what they look like.  Oh my God.  It's a brave new world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just saw some fascinating research here in the public.  I'm talking about from the Gina Davis Institute about time on camera and time speaking men  versus women.  Oh dear.  Major entertainment.  Oh dear.  And it's fact.  I mean, it's exactly what you're talking about.  I'm sorry, Stacey.  And Stacey will know well how often men interrupt.  And I'm sorry, Stacey, every time I do it, I just reflex.  I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He interrupts me too, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's for a different reason, Matthew.  Sorry, Stacey.  So anyway, but to watch the representation of the facial recognition go by, they had  a scene from my big Greek wedding and the number of faces that it's figuring out which  is male or which is female.  Forget LGBTQI, but it's just fascinating to see what this stuff can do on the fly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was actually thinking this morning that I wish that my Amazon Echo would listen to  me and my wife talking and at the end of the day say how many words she spoke and how many  words I got in edgewise.  Do you want to know?  I think it's the opposite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, Leo, I'll bet it's the opposite.  At home, it's the complete opposite.  We men think that we, you know, no, no.  Yes, dear.  Right, Stacey?  Yeah, the stats are hilarious.  But Stacey hasn't got a word.  I'm just going to let y'all talk.  The last time I said anything about women, I actually received some of the negative attention

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that Leo is so.  Welcome to the club now.  I was like, oh, you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was told that I man-signaled.  I was told that I man-signaled.  I was told that I man-signedaled.  I was told that I man-signedaled.  I was told that I man-signedaled.  I was told that I man-signedaled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't worry about it.  By definition, if you explain something, you did.  I'm a man and I explained it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm just kidding.  I try not to be condescending.  I think mansplaining implies patronizing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the study I saw showed that...  Oh, honey, you just don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me explain it to you.  Oh, I would have stopped you there.  I think you would have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  If a woman speaks more than I think it's 23%, men who are surveyed believe that she hogged  the conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, jeez.  That is so true.  Yes.  That's why I don't...  Sometimes I just shut up.  I'm like, nope, not worth it.  And that's self-censoring.  Don't do that here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, don't do that.  Just interrupt.  We want you to talk twice as much.  Just cut Jeff off.  I could never do it.  One, you guys actually have good things to say.  So, yay.  And two, the more I talk, the more negative feedback I get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not from us, but from the outside world.  I'm not saying that.  I'm saying that.  I'm saying that.  I'm saying that.  I'm saying that.  I'm saying that.  I'm saying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm saying that.  Not from us, but from the outside world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  From the outside world who are like, oh, either you don't know that or you talk too much or...  And the more likely I am to say something that people don't want to hear, which is,  again, me self-censoring.  Yay.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This went in a weird direction.  Let's take it away from you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just ignore them.  Just ignore them.  Did you know that you can now tweet emoji at Google and get directions to tacos?  I saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, now we're talking real progress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am so old.  When I saw that story, I was like, dear God, I am old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is Devendra Harderar writing in Engadget.  I hope you would explain this to me.  You tweet a taco emoji at Google and then Google will respond.  I got to try this.  Apparently it understands 200 emojis.  I don't...  Oh, look at this.  Oh, look at this.  So Devendra tweeted an eggplant to Google, which is the first thing I would do.  The first thing?  Yeah.  Well, just to see what...  Okay.  All right.  Well, Devendra and I apparently think alike.  Devendra, you were looking for baba ganoush recipes, right?  Here's a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Wow.  I think that is...  That's what you should do, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And now there's a dumpling emoji thanks to Jennifer Lee.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And Jennifer Lee.  Okay.  So then Devendra got complicated.  He's tweeted a poop emoji at it and Google said, need a breath of fresh air?  Well, that's fair.  Well, yes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Taco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't the eggplant emoji used to represent other things as well?  Yes.  It is.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry.  This is where having guys on your development team...  Because I probably wouldn't have thought about that for at least a while.  So there you go.  Diversity, it matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You see, you do need men on your team, don't you?  Exactly.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they need to talk.  I wouldn't have gotten there for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I heard another great diversity story today.  Yes.  It's public.  So when YouTube started...  So who's right here?  Is anybody here left-handed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Matthew, you're right-handed.  Stacey, you're right-handed.  I'm right-handed.  So Stacey, take your phone and show how you rotate your camera in your right hand to be  able to watch horizontal video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I go...  Okay, I won't poison the well yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  I'm horizontal video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you do it in your right hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She does it counterclockwise, as do I.  How do you do it?  Counterclockwise.  I go like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you see, they found that left-handed people did it this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you know what?  This is more disinformation about our sinister friends.  Fake news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fake.  No, it's funny.  So they found that they had users who were looking at the video was coming in upside  down and they didn't know why because the whole team was right-handed.  Nobody thought...  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  I am influenced by where the home button would be.  Me too.  So I always try to get that to the right.  Yeah, me too.  Apple having been trained by Apple.  Oh, that's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.  That is interesting though.  It is, isn't it?  Diversity of another...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you should have right-handed and left-handed and people with no hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it just shows you, yeah, we have to kind of think outside the box.  This is a big problem in Silicon Valley.  It's very much a bubble.  Huge problem.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And as a white male, I feel I'm underrepresented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, wasn't it Snapchat?  They did filters and they came up with these...  Oh yeah, the racist filters, yeah.  Filters and how could that have gotten all the way through meetings and approvals?  Presumably they do those things and no one said, wait a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey, you have the Eero.  Oh, right now I have something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's what I was going to ask you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you've got the loom.  Those are the plumes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These are the plumes.  This is a non-FCC approved one so I can't sell it.  Is it power lined or...  No.  No.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you're the plumer.  So the cool thing about these...  Now I'm going to just shut up from now on and let Stacey talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, this is your show, man.  I'm a newcomer.  So this is a Wi-Fi router, comes in a pack of six and what's cool about this is most  Wi-Fi routers do...  Their brains are in the box along with the brains that handle the routing and then also  the radios.  Plume has the brains in the cloud and only the radios in these things.  So right here you plug this bottom port into your modem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Only one has to be plugged in there, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Only one.  So you plug it into an outlet and then the rest of these you just shove in to outlets  around your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you're supposed to have one in every single room you'd want Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  But a six pack is what, $330?  Yeah, they're 75 bucks each.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of expensive.  So I've got seven in my house and it's a 2,500 square foot house.  The cool thing is because the brains are in the cloud, it learns.  So I was going to actually tell you about how they work, but mine hasn't been installed  long enough to actually start performance testing yet.  What it does is it's gathering data on the types of devices I have, where things are  being used and how things move around my household and it's going to start to optimize for that,  which is really cool, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is cool.  I have ordered...  I have been using the Eero with great result.  I ordered the Google and that's supposed to come pretty soon.  We're going to do a review of the Orbi, which is Netgears, Google, Eero and maybe Plume  2 with Dave Hamilton on Saturday on the new screensavers.  I feel like the Plume is the most interest.  All of them, by the way, claim they're sending information back to the home office for analysis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they all do.  So Eero just boosted some of their features based on some of the analysis they had done.  But this is interesting because it's supposed to be real time.  One of the issues with Eero's and traditional mesh networks is that as you do hops, you're  decreasing your throughput.  So as you're hopping from hub to hub, so mesh to mesh, unless you've got it plugged into  a LAN.  So with Plume though, they say that you don't have those because they will move from different  channels and this is really techie.  So I'm sorry.  Well, get techie, please.  So we'll see how it works.  I mean, I'm going to start doing performance testing and I can report back next week, but  you have a show on it too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you may not...  No, I want to get...  I'm very interested.  By the way, Eero also says we're better than just Wi-Fi extenders because as you get...  Those do attenuate the signal as you go down the line.  And so Eero also makes similar claims.  I have to say I've used them...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I was just going to say, I talked to the CEO of Plume about Eero and I've talked to  Eero about Plume and they both make kind of contradictory claims about each other for  what it's worth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they're in deep competition with one another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes they are.  Okay, Matthew, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I tried...  I spent a bunch of money for a range extender for my house and I don't know if I'm doing  something wrong, but my devices, like particularly iPhones and iPads seem to have a problem.  They drop the network, they can't reconnect automatically for some reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As you move around or as you stay still?  What's that?  As you move around or as you stay still?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, just staying still.  This extender...  I tried renaming the networks, the extended versions.  I tried using the same name.  I don't know if it's a problem with this extender or if it's a problem with Apple.  Wi-Fi...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I know that iPhones are sticky from a Wi-Fi perspective.  So they tend to pop onto one network in one access point and try to stay there as long  as possible.  So a lot of times if you're moving that can be an issue.  But if it's popped onto one and it's not the closest one, then you might still be getting  issues if that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you have bathrooms as rooms?  No, no.  But don't you want to use the...  Well, no.  Sure you do.  I'm trying to figure out how many plumes I'd need.  I think I'd need like nine or ten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I've got my house, which is a garage, the first floor, which is an open floor plan that's  really big, and then the second floor and then a rooftop deck.  And I have Wi-Fi requirements for all of my floors.  So because Wi-Fi signals travel down easily compared to up, I worked with one on...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so you should always put them high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're like heat.  I don't know why that is.  I had no idea, Stacey.  That is the factoid of the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was just asking this question this morning because I had about two more euros, so I have  five now, and I put it on the low shelf of the bookshelf and I thought, you know, I bet  it'd be better on the high shelf just intuitively because...  Because you're there.  I didn't know that.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I promised I wouldn't make big gestures because my sink...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got to stop reading the Twitter.  Now you know why I don't like the Twitter.  You're reading too much of the Twitter and people giving you bad ideas.  It's like if you're getting a...  I'm sorry, turning to O Doctor for a moment.  What just happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I just saw myself on the screen.  I went back to the screen and I'm like, oh, I'm so far behind how I'm talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  Do not take feedback.  I don't accept your feedback.  Be yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So up there, let's see.  So there's one on the roof.  I put one in my study because there's all this gear.  One in my daughter's room.  Wait, you put one on the roof?  Yes.  I have a cabinet in the roof where I have a router in because I've got Sonos on the  roof.  Is there anything...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, is there a room up there or just on the roof?  It's a rooftop deck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's a deck.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got a little putt-putt green up there.  What?  Oh, wow.  What?  Yeah, it's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have a putting green on your roof?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there a tiki bar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is not a tiki bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is the view?  Do you see Lake Austin from where you sit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I see the bridge over it, the 360 bridge in the lake.  It's nice.  Do you have a drone watching pad?  I could.  Still, though, even though from there I don't get great, what's it called, digital TV signals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you need a plume for your guest room?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I put one in my guest room.  As I test, I'm going to see how that works.  I definitely need one in my garage, though, even though the Wi-Fi signal travels down  because the Tesla needs it.  I've got the MyQ garage door opener and then I have a...  I need like 12.  So I've got seven.  And so far, we haven't encountered much drama.  Although when I created the network, I gave it the wrong SSID.  I did anyway.  And then I realized everything failed.  So I had a hard time getting my Sonos and my Philips Hue lights back online for a little  bit after I switched networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because you changed SSIDs or because what they're used to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I changed it back.  It was very easy to change the SSID back because obviously if your SSID is wrong from all of  your connected devices, none of them are going to hop on.  But once I changed it back, I think...  Is it DCHP?  I can't remember.  DHCP.  DHCP.  I think all of those leases had to reset and they hadn't yet.  So I had to reboot just about everything.  That's kind of normal.  Yeah.  Half of my devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm going to get 12 of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Geebus.  I would start less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or just...  Well, actually, what I should really do is wait till I hear from you.  So you're using even though it hasn't done the intelligence thing yet.  Is it working okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's working fine.  Like for example, Don't Hate Me.  This actually may be why I'm late and I just realized I'm on the Wi-Fi and not my...  That's exactly why you're late.  I'm sorry.  It's okay.  It's because I am...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, this is the one person in this group that doesn't need any of this because  she's got ethernet in every room of her house.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But this is actually a great test because this one, I guess I could plug it into my  land in all my rooms.  But this is one of the first times I'm going to be working without having the land backup.  So it should be fun.  I'll see what everyone else's Wi-Fi is like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to wait and see.  So you have the Eero.  Have you tried any of the others of these?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have the Almond 3, which is a mesh.  It's not a great mesh so far.  But yes, I have that.  I could try the Orbeez if you want me to try the Orbeez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I know why I can't use the Loom, a plume.  Why?  Because I need to also connect to a switch for hardwired ethernet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I have a switch for hardwired ethernet.  I have three switches.  I have the one up here.  Let's see if I can print something actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because each of those plumes has one ethernet jack.  Yes.  So what I need is one with the Eero or the Google that has at least two ethernet jacks  so that I can connect to my router modem and then to a switch, to a big ethernet switch  so I can get other hardwired ethernet in there.  How do you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's a good question.  Everything's working.  So how did I do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess you could go to another plume and plug into that.  But that's going to be Wi-Fi.  I don't want any Wi-Fi.  So all the 4K stuff, I want to have hardwired right into the wall for best...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it must be going through my actual modem instead of my router?  No?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You may have a modem that has multiple ethernet jacks in which case...  I do.  I have a modem with multiple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, so that's where it's...  Wait a second.  What is the architecture?  My hub closet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In which case, that means your modem is probably doing routing, in which case you want to make  the plume's bridge.  Can you do that?  You can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is an option.  Because otherwise you'll have double NAT.  You don't want double NAT.  You don't want that.  Yeah, I don't have that.  Bad.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Double NAT.  Double NAT.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Done.  Okay.  It's amazing how we've all had to become network nerds.  It's sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I find it amazing that it's probably 15 years since we had ubiquitous connectivity and Wi-Fi  and whatnot.  We still have problems where you talk to a network guy and you're like, well, then this  happened.  Why do you think that happened?  I don't know.  Oh, all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All the time.  In fact, this was kind of an eye-opener when I realized how much trial and error is involved  in this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, let's see what happens.  Yeah, it's huge.  Yeah.  I went on a support forum and there were a bunch of network engineers, like IT guys.  This is their job.  They're guessing.  One guy said, I tried everything.  I still can't figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's because it's hardware and wires.  I mean, interference in radios.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because networking is very complicated is really why.  It is.  Well, I think we're making progress and I think the plume is good.  Okay, I decided not to pull the trigger.  I'm going to wait till your review.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait until, yes, I'll figure out my actual network.  I'm very happy with the Eero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, wasn't that the one that had the very detailed review?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Verge, a lot of the Verge, I think.  And the Verge, by the way, which was reviewing the Google Wi-Fi, and by the way, Dan Seifert,  who did it, is very good.  I mean, I trust Dan implicitly.  He had a different result than, remember Google's announced that in their independent survey  that the Google device had the best throughput.  Dan's result was not the same.  He said actually the fastest device that he tried was the Orbi of all things, the Netgear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The wire cutter actually named the Orbi the best mesh networking router too.  Interesting.  Believe it or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, here's the graph.  Actually, if you look at the graph, the light red is download, the dark red is upload, and  the brown is ping.  In all of the graphs, the leftmost bar is the Google Wi-Fi, the middle one is the Eero,  and the right one is the Orbi.  So when you were nearby, you're all in the same room, they're all roughly equal, but  as you get farther away, the Orbi really starts to outpace in speed, in download speed, both  the Eero and Google Wi-Fi.  In his test, the Eero and Google Wi-Fi were pretty darn close.  There was only one test where the Wi-Fi was significantly faster, but the Orbi-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why is Orbi so much better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It could be that Netgear's been doing Wi-Fi for freaking ever, and they finally just decided  to get on this bandwagon, and when they did, boom.  They did a good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So anyway, yeah.  Plume seems like it could be the best, potentially, because you've got a radio in every room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if it actually learns, that would be-  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so we'll see.  Next week, you guys, next week.  Okay.  My bad for not- when I set it up, I was like, oh, cool.  And then I'm like, oh, I'm not going to be in time.  I suck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the plume looks like it's less expensive until you realize how many you need.  It's only 75 bucks per unit, but you need a whole lot of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They also require an outlet.  So think about that.  I have tons of spare outlets running around because we went crazy when we designed our  house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just bet you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm like, the wall where I knew I was putting my desk has three, plus ethernet on both sides.  So yes, most people probably did not have that luxury, and they may want to think about  the fact that they're going to have to use an outlet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember the days of trying to do the extender through the electrical system.  Those were the worst systems.  I tried that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, they got better.  Powerline is better nowadays, but there's a lot of loss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I couldn't get it working at all.  I'm in a room on top of the garage.  I tried powerline networking.  I tried an extender.  And finally, believe it or not, I ran an ethernet cable out the window downstairs from the router  and up across the roof and through the window of my office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I should mention, I forgot to mention, I apologize.  The Eero is a sponsor.  So just for your own disclaimer purposes, got to mention that.  Moto.  I'm very intrigued by this.  Lenovo has announced that they're going to do a Moto mod a month.  Those are the snap on backs for the Moto Zs.  I'll do this in deference to Matthew Moto Z, Moto Z Force, and the Moto Z Play.  And they plan to do a whole bunch of mods.  And these are third parties.  There's a Kate Spade mod.  There's going to be all sorts of mods from all sorts of groups.  So that's kind of-  Mods just designed or mods functionality?  Well, there's a Hasselblad camera back, which I've heard is only mediocre.  There's a Lofi mod, which is a battery mod.  Incipio makes a docking station that clips into your car.  All sorts of things, game controls and more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're going to need a backpack to carry around all the mods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is the Kate Spade one?  It just doesn't do anything, but it looks great.  I don't know.  They don't say.  It looks expensive.  Yeah, it looks expensive.  Yeah.  Kate Spade's been very involved.  She's of course a women's fashion designer.  She's been very involved in cases and phones for a while now.  A breathalyzer mod?  Color sensors for the blind?  These are potential ideas.  Additional storage?  That's kind of an interesting idea.  A lot of people really like these, the Moto Z.  The battery life of the Moto Z Play is very good.  It's a $400 phone.  Well, as a result, it's thick and heavy.  Then of course you snap on these backs.  The backs snap on magnetically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love magnets.  That's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, isn't it?  This is a speaker back if you're looking at the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is why I was excited to remember the...  You like Project Ara.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you.  I was like, it's not Arlo.  It's...  Project Arlo, the Thanksgiving project.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, I don't know.  I think this is kind of funny.  Anything with magnets.  Anything with magnets because snapping magnets together is just so satisfying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should have a Pixel C. Pixel C magnet is the best.  What?  The Pixel C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, the way that keyboard...  You pry it off the tablet.  That's the Google tablet.  By the way, I keep hearing rumors there's going to be another Google tablets, Pixel  tablets soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There should be.  There should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The C just wasn't quite it.  I would love that.  I do love it though, yeah.  How are you feeling about the Pixel now?  I'm liking the Pixel a lot.  Better and better and better, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, so the horror story for me to tell is that on my Pixel laptop, I finally...  It finally came out for the version for Android apps.  You can guess where this is going to go.  You can guess where this is going to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't work on yours because you have the 2013-14 model.  No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to do it.  No, no, no.  His accounts.  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You win, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So because it's G-Spot, I have to go through unbelievable efforts to approve and approve  and approve and approve.  I have to prove the whole organization that I had to create an organization to put myself  in it.  I got three people on this G-Spot.  And then I had to approve that and go through all these levels of work.  When I did all that, then you have to approve every single app for the organization.  There's no way to give me as the administrator and user the opportunity to just download  a damned app.  No, I have to go approve the individual app and then force it to install on my laptop  to get it to use.  It is un-effin'-believable.  Good times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here endeth the weekly Jarvis-Rand-Rant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Les Moonves has added again.  Man, somebody's got to...  This guy is the...  I guess Rupert Murdoch used to kind of let slip a lot of stuff.  Les has taken over.  He's the head of CBS.  He has apparently confirmed accidentally that CBS has done a deal with YouTube, which confirms  the supposition that YouTube is doing a TV package, an over-the-top TV package, rumored  to be called unplugged.  On Monday, Moonves was speaking at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference  and said, well, yeah, we've made a deal with YouTube.  And then he said, well, I probably shouldn't have said that.  Thanks, Les.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But we knew that was happening anyway.  Yeah.  And CBS, I'm trying to think, where else has CBS TV seen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The interesting thing, I actually wrote about this when there was a rumor that CBS was involved  CBS has been notorious in the past for not doing these types of deals.  Yeah, they're not on DirecTV now.  Right.  And at one point, I think it was Apple's venture, Moonves basically came out and said they weren't  going to pay us enough, so we told them to F off.  So the fact that they are participating with YouTube is interesting to me because they've  kind of been the holdout in lots of these streaming services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  CBS also owns Showtime and CNET.  They apparently have a deal with PlayStation Vue because you can get Showtime on PlayStation  Vue, but you can't get it on Hulu or can you get on Hulu?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can buy Showtime on Amazon Prime as a standalone channel.  Yeah.  So interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And is Homeland on Showtime?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  And that's the big thing that PlayStation's advertising is Homeland.  That's the reason you would want to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should note that Les is also the guy who said Donald Trump is terrible for America,  but he's great for CBS.  Great for CBS, that's right.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very famously.  I think we're actually starting to see the logjam break in over-the-top TV subscriptions.  We're getting closer and closer to a time when you can get all your TV over the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although you will pay the same amount as you paid for your clients.  Or more.  So I think we have found that medium point.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's probably why it's all coming together.  Although I think cable is right to worry that their grip is going to be weakened once content  creators can go directly or can find other avenues to go directly to consumers.  The tight monopolistic grip that cable has had on these guys.  People have been very reluctant to do deals with anybody else because they don't want  to make the cable companies mad.  Well, as that slips, I think that really it's almost like the cue ball hitting the rack  on the beginning of a pool game.  Everything starts to scatter and lots of things can happen now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think we're at or close to that tipping point.  I mean, if you look even at Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, they're cutting content deals  directly with creators.  Lots of those deals are probably going to be as lucrative or more lucrative.  So I think there's probably lots of opportunity for those alternate OTT providers to go direct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some great quotes from Edward Snowden.  Edward Snowden, he spoke extensively to Katie Couric, who flew to Moscow to talk to him  and to a magazine called Turning Points.  This is from the New York Times quoting Turning Points.  Actually, it's a discussion between Stephen Erlanger, who's the Times London bureau chief  and Edward Snowden.  And of course, one of the reasons I think we're seeing a lot of Snowden is because the drum  beat is ramping up for the president to pardon him.  He only has about a month and a half left to do so if he's going to.  I think the general consensus is at this point that it is unlikely.  I wish he would.  I wish he would, too.  I don't think it's going to happen.  Snowden makes a strong case for why he should be pardoned.  He said, I never published a single document on my own.  I partnered with news outlets.  This is why we have a free press in democracy.  The government has many great powers.  But is the press charged with determining what information is truly within the public interest to know?  And he said part of the reason he hasn't turned himself in, Daniel Ellsberg turned himself in  so that there would be a trial and so forth.  He was Daniel Ellsberg, the leaker of the Pentagon Papers back in the 70s.  He said, Ellsberg himself has argued that I made the right decision not to present myself to the court  because things have changed so much since the 70s.  The law today, and this is true and it's sad, does not allow you to make a defense against Espionage Act charges in front of a jury.  I am legally prohibited from even speaking to the jury about my motivation.  Can there be a fair trial when you can't put forward a defense?  At the sentencing phase, you can express to the judge why you did what you did, but that's not democratic.  The jury system was created so you can discuss with your peers what you did and why you did it and let them decide.  And I completely agree with him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And look what happened to Chelsea Manning.  Just get railroaded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Obama administration has been terrible, terrible for freedom of the press, press access, and whistleblowers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've been one of the biggest, most secret, the one that's cracked down the most on freedom of information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, yeah, it does not look good, sadly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sad noise.  Being patriotic, Snowden wraps up, being patriotic doesn't simply mean agreeing with your government, being willing to disagree,  particularly in a risky manner, is actually what we need more of today when we have this incredible, often fact-free environment  where politicians can make claims and then they're reported as truth.  How do we actually steer democracy?  If we have the facts, we can help facilitate democracy and this is my role.  So he's unchastened and I don't blame him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he's right about the news environment.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google fixed the...  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I was going to say, and his entire life has been ripped apart.  So he better be, I mean, I can't imagine second guessing that.  That would be just terrible.  It would blow into your self-esteem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Time's asked him about that.  And he said, well, I'm kind of an indoor cat.  I'm fine.  Oh, this was an interesting website.  I'm actually going to save that maybe for my pick.  PewDiePie.  PewDiePie.  I can't figure this one out.  PewDiePie says YouTube is killing him because he's white.  Yeah.  PewDiePie is complaining because viewership of his, the number one YouTuber, viewership is down.  He says the site has, YouTube has changed its algorithm so that fewer people see his videos.  This has led to his popularity falling.  He said in a video...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about they're just sick of your shtick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe they're just sick of your shtick.  The problem might be that he is white, he said in the same rant.  That's offensive.  I'm white.  Can I make that comment?  But I do think that's a problem.  It's more than offensive.  It's unbelievable.  And then he says, he claims YouTube wants to put someone else on the top of the site,  someone extremely, this is a quote, someone extremely cancerous.  And this article from the UK, from the Independent in the UK, thinks it might be Lilly Singh,  who's a Canadian YouTuber with an Indian...  Oh no, he said it.  Lilly Singh.  He said it.  Lilly Singh, a Canadian YouTuber with Indian heritage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OMG.  So I mentioned this online and I had a number of people respond to me saying he's just trolling.  Like PewDiePie does this apparently routinely.  He doesn't actually think that.  And that's not why he is talking about deleting his channel.  A lot of it is just attention seeking behavior.  And he knows that if he says something dramatic, it'll get picked up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It seems to be an excuse for a lot of bad behavior these days.  Yeah, true.  Oh, he's just attention seeking.  He's just trolling.  He doesn't mean it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Doesn't matter.  You've said it.  Doesn't matter if you meant it.  And if his numbers are down, I think PewDiePie, you need to look in the mirror.  Cry minute.  The problem, I mean, this happens to everybody.  This is called being, you know, this is popularity.  It rises and falls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And he had a much longer run than anybody would have ever guessed.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's just because we're old and we don't understand what the kids watch.  That's true.  We watch Homeland.  Yeah, we're into that other stuff.  Congratulations to our friend, Anil Dash, Gina Tripani's former partner at ThinkUp.  He is now the new CEO of Fall Creek Software, the software startup created by Joel Spolsky.  I didn't realize this, but they kind of spun off Trello and Stack Overflow,  two big creations.  But Fog Creek still does a developer tool called Fog Bugs.  And its new project will be relaunched under Anil Dash this week, GoMix,  the easiest way to build the app or bot of your dreams.  So congratulations, Anil. Love, Anil.  He's really widely regarded everywhere, I think.  Anybody who knows him knows what a great guy he is.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  He's spectacular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's spectacular.  And he and Gina...  I mean, like he...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I was going to say he's a genuinely nice fellow.  And then he also does so much work for advocating for diversity in tech  and just different, like being thoughtful about how you build your tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep. I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And I mean, he's been a part of so many other amazing things.  Six apart, right?  TypePad, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  TypePad. That's where I met him, I think, was when I first started using TypePad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There were a lot of smart people there.  I spent the Monday at Facebook and got to see Andrew Anker,  who's now in charge of news products there, and he was six apart.  There were some really good people at six apart for me back in the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. They came out of Petaluma, you know.  Yeah? Did they?  Yeah. TypePad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The founders, what's their name?  Yeah.  Mina?  Yeah, Mina. Yeah.  Yeah, Mina Trot and Mina.  Whatever happened to them.  Good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, good question. I used TypePad for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would become a great feature on the click network somewhere,  as in whatever happened to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, there's this thing called Wikipedia.  Yeah, there it is.  There's Mina, Mina Trot, Ben and Mina Trot.  I think Ben wrote the original TypePad software.  I used it when it was still in beta.  And, oh, I guess they're no longer together.  Oh.  No.  Ex-husband, it says.  They started in 2001.  She started blogging at dollarsshort.org, which is a great site name.  It's still her Twitter handle.  Dollarsshort is awesome.  She's doing a sewing blog, I guess, or maybe she was.  And it stops at 2012. We don't know.  I hope she made. I hope she and Ben made so much money.  They've just retired.  That would be my hope.  That would be nice.  Yeah. They were the sweetest people.  I really liked them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they sold the company to Say Media, I think it was,  and then it shut it down.  It was some sort of dodgy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember they did Vox, which was kind of,  that was kind of their easy to use blogging platform.  Six-Apart Purchase Live Journal.  Wow, I didn't realize that.  They sold that at a profit.  Then they started Vox, which I used also.  I used all their products.  Then Say Media bought them in 2010.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wasn't it TypePad, I think, launching a for-pay version that helped jumpstart WordPress?  Maybe that's the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, more than that, it's actually, I find, a fascinating story.  So, Movable Type.  That's what I used, Movable Type.  Yeah, Movable Type.  Movable Type had its platform, and then it wanted to have a hosting service.  And so they enabled the platform to be licensed,  but they limited that license so that you couldn't compete too much  with the Movable Type hosting platform.  And all the hosts said, no, along comes WordPress.  WordPress says, no, no, no, no, no.  We're going to make open source the underlying code.  Yes, we're going to build the first for-profit on top of that.  And they got VC funding for this entirely new model to do that,  because they didn't own the IP.  The IP was all in the .org.  The brand is now owned by the .org.  And it was wildly more successful because it enabled scale.  And everybody used Movable Type, and that hurt TypePad and Sixpart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We had Ben and Mina.  I'm looking at my blog because I ran a Movable Type blog.  It was one of the first platforms I used.  We had them on the screensavers in 2002, way back when.  Way back.  Way back when.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I used Blogger first.  It's amazing that Blogger is still around, by the way.  And then used Movable Type and then used WordPress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think my first blogging program was a program called Grey Matter.  Yeah, Grey Matter. That was great.  Noah.  Yeah.  Noah had some health issues, as I remember.  Noah Grey.  It was great, though.  So I started doing that in 2000.  And he stopped maintaining it in 2002.  And I think that's when I moved to Movable Type.  And both these, I was hosting it.  And then TypePad was a hosted solution.  Yeah.  I think I moved it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  First Grey Matter, then Movable Type.  Grey Matter was so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you know where Sixpart came from, the name?  No.  Ben and Mina's birthdays were six days apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's cute.  Oh, that's cute.  That's awesome.  You know, I'm on Squarespace.  They're a sponsor.  I'm happy.  But I'm always looking for, I would love to host.  What's the best blogging software these days?  I would like to host it myself.  And I think WordPress is still the best.  WordPress is the king, isn't it?  Yeah, I'm still using WordPress.  Are you self-hosted?  Me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're not on WordPress.com.  You have your own server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I have two different hosts.  I just was making sure that that was true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember when people blogged and stuff?  That was great.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I try to blog at least now two or three times a year.  I'm so ruined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm ruined.  Yeah.  I used to blog five times a day.  I know.  Yeah, me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No way, Matthew.  No way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What?  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you calling him out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm calling him out as a former Matthew editor and colleague.  I'm like two posts a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacey believes I am incapable of writing anything shorter than like 800 words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you don't do short posts.  Which is mostly true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I did do a lot though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're 20-inch columns twice a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did do a lot of shorter posts and now I just tweet that stuff.  I used to do blog posts that were a paragraph.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess I used Blogger.  Yeah, I used Blogger.  I think maybe I did use Blogger first.  What's nice is I've been able to import all the posts, the old posts to my Squarespace  blog so I have all these old posts.  I don't think any of the imagery survived.  Yeah.  That's often a problem.  Yeah.  But that's okay.  I can live with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I called my original blog.  I started right after 9-11.  I called it World War III.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  In some ways, that's why I'd like to still have all this stuff because it really is your  history, your life history.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I started at Giga Home, which used WordPress.  I hosted the VIP, but it would often swallow posts and not give them back or other things  would happen.  So I started writing in my own hosted version of WordPress and then cutting and pasting  it over to the Giga Home version.  I do that at Fortune now too, so I have a copy of everything I've written.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When did you first start blogging?  Let's get our blog birthdays, everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it was 2002 or 2003, but I don't know that I called it blogging.  I was keeping track of links and stuff.  In fact, I had a blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a link roll.  That's what blogging was originally, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I had a blog, if you want to call it that, or I had a site in 95.  I think it was 94 or 95.  I just kept track of links, interesting links.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess that's kind of what I did with my first site too.  But it wasn't, I guess, when did it become?  A blog is the idea of blog is kind of a sequential series of chronological series of posts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a weblog tour.  It was a log of your tour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Torn Bargers was a link blog, right?  One of the first bloggers.  How about you, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When did you first post?  The week after 9-11, 2001.  Mine is February 28, 2001.  And I have it right here.  This is the new Leoville weblog.  I'll be posting random thoughts here.  I don't want to be making things too short or stupid to make it to any of the other media I work in.  I guess there's going to be a lot of stuff here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice.  You sound exactly the same.  I'm like 15 years later, your character is still similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would hope so.  It's not like I'm making it up.  When did you start, Stacey?  You're a lot younger than the rest of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When did you start?  Yeah, I think 95 is when I got my first email account.  That's pretty early.  Okay, I was a junior in high school.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  And then I had a website in college.  I did more stuff on IRC and chat rooms.  Did you really?  Yeah, because I don't know, because I'm a nerd.  The idea of posting any of my stuff publicly on the internet just felt really not great.  You were smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You were right.  I wish I'd learned that lesson sooner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so my first blog was professional.  I started it when I worked at The Deal in 2006 or 2007.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're all old timers, even for a youngin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We are digital media people.  We are digital media.  Where's your first stab?  That's really what we should know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just learned about that stab thing.  I just got it.  It looks pretty cool.  What do you do with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I found a piece of paper, speaking of blogging, I found a piece of paper on which I had written,  I was cleaning up my office, and I had written down the specs for two internet service providers  that I was thinking about getting a dial-up account for.  It was mind-boggling to me how much money I paid.  I think it was like $45 a month, and I got five megabytes or something, and I got FTP access, I think.  It was just ridiculous.  Anyway, it reminded me.  It felt like it was a thousand years ago.  Is it on the way back machine?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Might be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you searched?  Might be.  I should, actually.  I think you have to know your URL to do that.  You do, yeah.  My website was on a long-defunct ISP in San Francisco called crl.com, but I don't remember my domain name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The first one I used called Interlog was run by a 17-year-old who started with IRC, I think, in chat rooms.  He eventually sold this ISP for millions of dollars a few years later.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, if you get in early, you can make some pretty good money on this internet thing.  Just got to get in early.  That's the key.  Anything else you want to talk about?  What have I missed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you want to talk about Intel, well, Qualcomm's new server chips?  ARM server chips?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Woo woo.  Well, this is where you feel for Intel.  Go ahead, tell us about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm like, oh, yes.  So basically today, I think it was today.  Was it today or yesterday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it was today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it was today.  Qualcomm basically announced the Centric 2400 series, and this is going to be a chip for  servers.  And it is also the first, well, it's actually not Qualcomm's first 10-nanometer chips built  on a brand new, it's not brand new anymore, the FinFET 3D kind of building up the transistor  process.  So there's a couple of things here.  One is Intel's not going to have, it's not going to be on that process node to the middle  of next year for its server chips.  So these should be more energy efficient.  They should run, you know, they're denser.  And this is also ARM based chips coming into the data center, which is like Intel's motherhood  and apple pie.  So kind of scary.  I will say reality check here.  I've been writing about ARM going into servers since 2009.  Every year was supposed to be the year.  We do have now software that's actually compatible with ARM, because that was always going to  be a big issue was getting things like VMware, etc.  We're not so worried about the internet.  We're not so worried about that.  So this is kind of interesting.  Kind of interesting.  It is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and they're also beating Intel to the 10 nanometer FinFET by something like six  months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was gotta make them kind of crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does it?  Yeah.  Does it tell you use FinFET or do they use their, they have their, they don't have a  FinFET yet.  Right.  They have 3D planer or some other 3D.  I can't remember what it's called.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to test you all to see how up you are on your YouTube stars.  Oh, God.  We need a 12 year old.  This is it's time for the YouTube rewind 2016 quiz.  Who is this absolute legend unbeatable champion and a man with a very sore face?  Is it Scott Sterling, Dan Howell, Squeezy or Fondue?  I don't know who any of those people are.  I don't either.  Wow.  I'm going to guess Dan Howell.  That's incorrect.  It was Scott Sterling, sketch comedy group, Studio C.  Well, let's try another one.  What is T-Rex's hidden talent?  I'm guessing it's not pushups.  Handstands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Handstands.  I like it.

Colorful balls that grow in water, filled up bathtub swimming pools and the view counts.

Mike Senatori stunned the nation in May when he athletically threw a water bottle at his  talent show.  Six million views.  Yeah, I watched that one.  I got a pen.  I got a pineapple.  What else do I have?  A confused grocer, artistic fruit, a pineapple pen or a stick?  I think a pineapple pen.  Absolutely.  I think that's I think I vaguely remember that.  It was a fever dream.  No mountain, no problem.  Which city streets where there's new CNN star Casey Neistat?  Which city streets have the greatest but who is now withdrawn from YouTube right to  devote his attention or from blogging at least draw for vlogging.

Graphene?  Graphene?  Yeah.  You can't crush graphene.  This is all the guy does is crush stuff with his hydraulic press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the Will It Blend of 2016.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think these, I mean, so they got a lot of views.  Are they culturally significant?  Just because they get a lot of views, does that make them culturally significant?  In a year, will anybody think, know, or care about this stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's like any internet meme.  I think it's culturally significant for a while.  I mean, people drop it into conversation.  It's not that different from people dropping sort of Game of Thrones references into conversation.  It's on that level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think a lot of people think of it as the next big thing in media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and it is in a way.  I mean, I certainly...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it is, because it's not, well, I've said this on the show before, but it's not media.  It's people passing things around as part of their conversation.  It's chief conversation.  It's culture.  In fact, it is conversation.  Exactly.  I was on Facebook, I said stop calling what you do content.  Then you get compared to the Washington Post.  What you do is conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's YouTube Rewind time.  The video is out.  We're going to play it now.  That's your reward for getting all these answers right.  By the way, the only one I recognize, I recognize faces, but I don't know who they are,  except for Marques Brownlee, who is featured in the thumbnail.  We love.  We love.  Let's see who we got here.  YouTube Rewind.  Let me turn up the sound.  Pump up the volume.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who is it?  Whose fanny pack is it?  Oh, it's the Rock.  They always have to have one real celebrity amongst all these people I never heard of  because I'm old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I try to go into YouTube and discover things, but it's such a horrible discovery platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to know more teenagers, really, is what you have to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hope the daughter will send me all of hers so I can just get the recommendations from that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These don't become big because they are on the top of the YouTube page, I don't think.  No, no, not at all.  I really think it's just sharing.  Shared among kids.  And not on YouTube, ironically, or any Google platform, including Google+, but Twitter, Snapchat, all of that.  So I'm glad I took the quiz because now I'm recognizing a lot more of this than I might have earlier.  And you feel richer for it.  Well, now I know what the Orbi challenge, here come white vans.  I mean, I kind of now know.  Is that Justine?  I can't tell she's making a face.  There's the volleyball hit.  There's the white vans.  There's the Casey Neistat.  $25 million he sold Beam and his celebrity to CNN.  Good deal for CNN, you think?  Yeah, but they don't ruin it.  I don't think it's...  I guess we'll find out.  I think you can't translate this kind of success.  Hey, there's Trevor Noah.  Will PewDiePie be in this?  Of course he will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that him?  I can't tell.  Was that him?  I think it was.  It's hard to tell without the emo haircut.  There's some construction workers break dancing.  Oh, this is that dance that we were supposed to know.  I feel like YouTube's a little bit coasting now on...  I don't feel like it was as important this year as it was in years past.  Am I wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they're going to be doing a lot more live.  If you look at what Young Turks is doing, they're doing live.  They're rolling out, getting it on everybody's face.  This was the year Facebook decided live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I even saw NFL ads for Facebook Live.  Why?  Okay, here's the pen and the pineapple guy.  And then the weird mannequins.  And then actual Olympians.  And then dancing T-Rexes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's all inside references to a society that knows them.  We don't.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure if you're into YouTube, is it only teenage?  What age demographic are we talking about?  I think the 20s.  I guess my son would recognize a lot of this, right?  He should have better annotation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's the whole point.  It's inside baseball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't let the old parts know what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know, but if you could turn on annotation, that would be awesome.  I've had a lot of people do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So just have somebody do a wiki around that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure they will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That should be easier to use too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I only know if...  Is that Marquez?  Yeah, that's Marquez Brown in a white room.  Here's the bottle of water guy.  Oh, this is a take off on the Kanye video, right?  They're all sleeping in bed.  Yeah.  This is...  I don't know.  I think there's more competition now, isn't there, than YouTube doesn't dominate as it did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think Snapchat has really taken a lot of the...  I mean, Snapchat videos are the way that lots of people communicate now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What you're going to have on YouTube is you're going to have 5 million subscribers.  If you're a star of YouTube, you're a star.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  You're a star within that...  Within your 5 million followers group.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the end of mass.  Do we see one of the Green Brothers there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your guess is as good as mine.  I don't know.  I'm guessing that's Lilly Singh, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's Beyonce reference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got that one.  Very good.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All I do is I look for people like Marquez and I just Dean that I know and the rest of  it is like...  And then I can say, oh, she had three seconds or one second or two seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The interesting thing about Snapchat is it's also private.  You know, you don't have...  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't have this mass.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I think maybe the era of mass media is dwindling, is it not?  Oh, it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's just models that with it goes mass media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Is what we do here at Twit, is this kind of last media?  No.  Last media.  This is the beginning of bitch.  The end of mass media.  It's kind of the last gasp.  No.  You never wanted to be mass, right?  I don't want to be mass in that size, but...  You're niche.  Yeah, but I mean...  Five million is more mass than you are.  No, we do about seven million a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We do about seven million a month.  We have a reach of around five million.  No, no, but I think for an individual show...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For an individual show, yeah.  For an individual show, yeah.  For an individual show.  For an individual show.  For an individual show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For an individual show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For an individual show, we're talking tens or hundreds of thousands, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  So you're the future.  You're about...  So we're...  Small media.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Focus.  Small media, sustainable business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Artisanal media.  Well, that's...  Yeah, we called our ad agency Artisanal for that very reason.  I've always thought it was kind of handmade.  So there you go.  And then now there's a behind the scenes and then there's a 360.  That's new.  I got to head off.  Well, good.  You just...  The show's over.  So I'm going to...  I'll tell you what.  I'm going to do an ad, but if you...  I shouldn't have played that rewind.  I didn't realize you had to get going.  Do you want to do a number before I do the ad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sure.  Sure.  So Matthew, what about this too so we can talk about it as well?  The wonderful Craig Silverman at BuzzFeed, they did a survey of I think over 3,000 people  looking at people who believe in false news headlines.  Now the problem with the methodology here is that the majority of people had never heard of the false news story.  Among those who had heard of it...  So it was dead down to like 300 or fewer respondents.  But among them, 70-some percent believed these ridiculous false news stories,  including Democrats in majority believing false news anti-stories about Hillary Clinton.  So it does not bode well for the judgment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think the important takeaway here is that most people didn't even see those.  Yes, that's what I agree.  And that the people who saw them wanted to believe them.  And this has always been my contention, is that you don't fight fake news by censoring it.  Because really it's being shared by people who want to believe it.  It's more a statement, just as sharing a YouTube video is.  It's a statement of your ethos than it is anything else.  Exactly.  It's about membership in a tribe.  Membership in a tribe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  FBI agents suspected that Hillary email leaks found dead in apparent murder-suicide.  There were 1,800 respondents, 22 percent had seen it.  Among those, which is to say 389 respondents, 72 percent believed it.  It was interesting though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wrote about the survey and I picked up on something that Marcy Wheeler, who's on Twitter,  is Empty Wheel, mentioned, which was exactly that.  The vast majority of people in that survey actually could not remember fake or real headlines.  So it was below, I think, 25 percent who even remembered some of these incredible clickbait headlines.  Which just says to me, people either don't remember lots of the stuff they see on Facebook  or don't see Facebook as a place where there's stuff like news where you might want to remember what it said or where it came from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you get a tone.  I mean, you may not remember.  It's like those, oh, I don't remember where I read it, but Hillary Clinton was a real jerk.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the lasting impact.  And it definitely has an impact, for sure.  But I think it's mostly confirmation bias.  Well, that's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat room says, but those people already were Andy Clinton, so it didn't change anything.  Maybe that's a better question to ask.  Whose mind was changed by fake news?  Whose mind was changed?  It entrenches you further into your beliefs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the filter bubble.  Your filter bubble.  Yes.  I mean, so I don't know.  This is not something we're going to solve.  I have a link related to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A filter bubble link?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Hank, is that for your closing?  For my thing, yes.  Closing thing?  Okay, then hang on.  Jeff, we'll let you go.  I'm going to head off.  Bye, Jeff.  Back to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's great to see you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll scroll out this headset and get another one.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll send you a new one.  No problem.  No, no, I'll get one.  They're cheap.  They had one that came in a case, so it didn't get...  That's a good one.  Yeah.  It's already been sent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to go to my forum.  It's too late.  We already sent it.  On its way.  Aren't you nice?  All right.  You're too nice.  See you all later.  Bye.  How about applying for the loan at the open house and getting your approval then and there  in minutes and getting a loan that's tailored for your financial situation?

So when you go out and do a little Lucke-Luen at Open Houses this weekend, you'll know where  to go.  Rocket Mortgage at QuickAndLoans.com, slash, twig.  Who's eating chips?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was me.  Sorry.  It's my thing.  Show us your thing.  It's Encelophane.  It is Encelophane.  Oh, now I'm hungry.  Okay.  Outdoor switch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this what's on your deck?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is my secret to automated Christmas lights.  All right.  So if you are someone who has SmartThings, Wink, any Z-Wave hub, like a VeroLite system,  this is about 35 bucks and you can buy it a lot of places.  It is super simple.  It's outdoor capable.  It is one of the only outdoor switches out there.  So you plug in your outdoor lights and then you can hook them up through your Echo.  Is this it?  This is it.  40 bucks.  It's so easy to pair.  If you have problems, I can help you.  But that's that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you come over to my house and help me?  Yeah.  Can you come over to my house?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can just find me on Twitter.  I have troubleshooted so many of these things.  So that is for people who are like, have a hub and are comfortable with Z-Wave.  If you're not, this is not the outdoor version.  This is the indoor version.  But iDevices also makes an outdoor capable switch that works with HomeKit.  That is $80.  So much money.  So there you have it, you guys.  For outdoor Christmas lights, you want to automate the heck out of them.  Two products for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Describe for me how you would use these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I plug my outdoor, a string of outdoor lights in.  And then I plug it into that guy.  Oh, before I do that, for the Z-Wave one, I hook up the Z-Wave first.  Oh, and I should say that this has two outlets.  The outdoor one.  So I don't particularly love it because I only run one strand of Christmas lights on  each, well, I run three.  You can connect three strands, but I run one to that plug on each.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could also have them daisy-chained, right?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why I'm not keen on the two.  But if you're keen on the two, that's the one to get.  Anyway, you connect the outlet to your platform first inside because of range kind of issues.  So I just, and then you plug your lights, you plug that in outside, then you plug your  lights in and it's weatherproof, which is why you use this.  It's one of the only weatherproof ones on the market.  And then I can control it with my phone.  So let me show you my Christmas lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is for turning them off and on, not for like elaborate displays and things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is just so I can turn them off and on for my phone.  I can make rules and schedules.  And then I can also talk to it via the Echo if you do it through the Wink Hub.  If you do it through SmartThings, you can do it through the Google Home Hub.  So these are my Christmas lights right here.  Oh, that's neat.  There's the group and then like upper balcony, lower balcony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you could presumably have like an if this then that that would automatically turn them  on at sunset and turn them off at sunrise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have mine set to turn on 10 minutes after sunset and then turn off at a certain time.  So that's what these are for.  And you can also do things like, hey, hey, hey, gee, turn on holiday and then boom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're working on Amazon Echo as well.  Yeah, that's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. So that's what I that's what I do every year.  And I actually do normal holiday.  And then I have Christmas Eve holiday because or in Christmas Day holiday, which is indoor  for daylight lights.  So I have my indoor and outdoor lights all running through the same place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So impressed.  I I keep thinking I should set all this stuff up.  The closest I ever did was setting up some Hue lights and put it in a Nest thermostat.  And then we moved and I didn't bother doing it again.  It seems like it's a lot of work, but yet I would love to have that capability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really I mean, like connecting.  You're going to do your Christmas lights.  The beauty of not of doing it at the outlet is you don't have to mess with like 18  different things.  So really.  It's like an extra five minute process to pair that to a house.  So all I have to remember to do is just have my phone on me basically.  Right. And then you set up a rule.  Actually, my rules are left over from last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's really not my ethics are left over from last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So someone in the chat room said their Google Home responded to you saying, hey, gee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What? I did that on purpose.  So it wouldn't. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you can't even watch TV anymore because it all.  I know what. Yeah.  You asked me. No, I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about.  What? Hello. Not you.  Matthew Ingram, what do you got for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we sort of touched on it, I guess, the fake news issue or problem, which is  obviously got a whole bunch of different facets to it.  Some of them are behavioral.  Some of them are, you know, structural.  There's the influence of Facebook as a platform, which I think is is a hugely  complex issue in a bunch of ways, the way we use it, how it impacts us.  But anyway, there was when this sort of exploded recently, Eli Pariser, who  wrote the book, The Filter Bubble and coined the term, I'm pretty sure, went on  to start something called Upworthy.  He started at Google Doc and the link is in the.  It's kind of ironic. He started up worthy.  Yeah, I know. I know.  Well, he's OK.  He's seen things from both sides.  Let's put it that way. Yes.  But so the Google Doc was basically an open document for kind of suggesting ways  of dealing with the fake news problem, specifically on Facebook design.  How could sort of technology be used to help people identify what's fake and what  isn't that sort of thing? And it just kind of spawned this massive  collaborative sort of after the discussion, which is which continues on the doc.  I thought it was interesting.  Some of the ideas in there are interesting.  Some are strictly technological.  Some of them are kind of behavioral or  some require things of Facebook.  Some require things of sort of users of Facebook.  Anyway, I thought it was interesting if you're interested in that topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I kind of like this idea of a collaborative document with all these people.  It's a Google Doc. So everybody's in.  I mean, it's you can watch it.  It's one hundred twenty three pages already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And and I got into it and posted something.  I think it was a single page.  So it's really exploded since then.  The only problem, of course, is that the the  entity that isn't part of this discussion is Facebook.  They don't they haven't really talked about, you know, they said they're concerned  and they're working on stuff. But there I would much rather that this was a sort of  as open and collaborative as possible.  Maybe we could you know, there could be open source things that Facebook could implement  that could help kind of plug into a lot of the fact checking and and  verification stuff that's already out there.  But so far, Facebook hasn't really shown that it wants to be part of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've started to see a lot of posts from a variety of sources  on how to find how to detect face news, some of fake news, some of their intended  students, which I think is really the the real sweet spot for this,  because students have to have to learn this.  You know, how do you know if the they do the source you're citing for your  theme or your term paper is legit or made up or  and it's really useful for them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is disappointing. But if you I wrote about a study recently,  if you just Google fortune and and fake news, I saw it.  Yeah, there was a study that showed that a fairly  massive proportion of students in high school and college  could not distinguish a fake news story or a piece of sponsored  advertising from a real news story.  Yeah, we actually talked about it last week or the week before.  Yeah, incredibly depressing.  So clearly, there's a huge amount of sort of news literacy,  you know, required education, required about how to do.  And in fact, I made the same point about Google, not like years ago  when we were talking about  how to determine whether a source on Google is is trustworthy or not.  We need we need more education and teaching people  how to determine sort of trustworthy from not trustworthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here are some of it makes you if it makes you feel better.  My daughter, actually, they have media literacy starting in fourth grade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So great. Well, point their teacher to this from all tech considered on NPR.  They did a really simple checklist for everybody  on if you read something, here's how you could just quickly,  you know, here's what you should look at.  Pay attention to the domain and the URL.  Read the about us section.  Look at the quotes in a story or rather look at the lack of quotes.  Look at who said them.  Check the comments, because a lot of times on social media platforms,  people will say, oh, that's fake.  Here's the Snopes link.  Oh, I love this one.  If you see an image to a reverse image search.  You may find that it's a clip art that's been slightly modified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The really depressing thing from that survey was that there were obvious clues.  Yeah, like, say a piece of sponsored content said sponsored content on it.  And they miss that.  Or there was no verified checkmark and they missed that.  Or they said the site looked really professional.  So they thought it was trustworthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is kind of a related.  This is one of the things I want to talk about.  This is from dark patterns dot org.  We've talked before about dark patterns.  You see it in software all the time.  A user interface that's been designed to trick you into maybe, you know,  downloading an additional bit of malware or signing up for a recurring bill.  Or, you know, when I sign up for 18 or try to sign up for AT&T's direct TV now,  I inadvertently got sucked into a hundred fifty dollar charge.  So this is a site where you can browse the library of dark patterns.  I think this is a great thing that high schools could probably do is just to make  people aware of a lot of a lot of what the games you play, the sites you visit  are really intending to trick you into doing something they want you to do  using human psychology.  So this is a UI professional who's designed a really great site with  bait and switch disguised ads, something the far away bill, which is you.  This is from Capital One.  When you check your credit card balance, suddenly a physical bill will  no longer come to your door.  You know, there's just these are tricks that I guarantee you every one of us has  been bit by at some point and may not even know about.  So they've they've there's one called Privacy Zuckering, which is a Facebook  technique, the Roach Motel, the site that's you can easy to get into, but  pretty hard to get out of.  Yeah.  The sneak into basket where they sneak something into your shopping basket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that happens on hotel bills.  Have you said that's that's in the real world where they're like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well, this is all real world.  These this library are actual sites, programs, you know, stuff you  might have been sucked into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My favorite is when you install something and it automatically checks boxes that  say that, you know, redirect my search to Bing and load this thing and add this

The first one was an OS, then a desktop, then a gem, the free gem.  Remember gem, the gem desktop.  Uh, here's a tower of Hanoi written in fourth 3.6 kilobytes.  All right.  Here's an entire operating system and 660 kilobytes.  So you have to have QEMU to do this.  Here's a tribute for the anniversary, 35th anniversary of the PC.  Remember Donkey base, donkey.base.
