Starting to my left with Gina Tripani of  smarterwear.org.  Hi, Gina.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Hi.  Great to see you again.  Playing with my Nexus One.  Are you?  I am.  I'm setting up something we'll talk about this episode.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Froyo.  We got Froyo.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Official Froyo.  Jeff Jarvis got his Froyo too from buzzmachine.com.  Professor of Journalism at the City University of New York.  It got pushed to you, eh?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Finally, Saturday morning.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yep.  I got mine Friday night.  So yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, Saturday night.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  So for those who don't yet have 2.2 on the Nexus One,  you'll get a message.  I presume everybody does.  But you'll get a message that says there's a system update.  You don't have to go check every five minutes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know what?  I didn't get the message.  You didn't?  And then I went to check because I'm just neurotic  and having a life.  And that's when it said, oh, it's been downloaded.  Oh.  We'll install it now.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Cool.  Yeah, I got the dialog box of the cute little robot.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  You want to go ahead, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So now that we all three of us have it,  I guess it's FRF91 is the official release.  What do you think?  Are the reviews in, Jeff?  Have you noticed the speed difference?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I haven't noticed enough stuff.  I mean, it seems a little faster.  I'm just happy I have it.  But it's the kind of letdown once you yell for it for people  to edit and say, OK, what's the big deal?  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I have to say, it's little things, though,  like having the phone icon and the browser icon always there,  which means you could pull it off your screen.  And those are the things that you really do want always there.  Little things like that.  The speed.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it's much faster.  That dock is great.  I don't know how I lived without a portable hotspot.  Like, I've been traveling a lot.  So I've had the test build, and I just use it all the time now.  Just pop it up.  Make a hotspot, especially traveling.  So I have to pay the $12 in the airport, whatever.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And still no word from T-Mobile about whether they  want to charge for that.  I mean, AT&T now has tethering.  Sprint has tethering.  But both cases, they charge you $20 to $30 extra a month.  It's so far, we don't pay for this.  It's just part of your bandwidth.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  And I mean, I haven't used gigabytes and gigabytes.  I literally just kind of use it just a little bit here  and there on traveling.  But I haven't had a problem at all,  and I haven't seen any effect on my bill.  So I'm just going to not say anything.  Be happy.  Happy while we can.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, T-Mobile's in that position  where they really do want to make people happy,  because they're kind of an also-ran network.  They've been upgrading their 3G network in New York.  Have you noticed that yet, Jeff?  Higher speed uploads or downloads?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Not really.  I've been out in the burbs pretty much,  and I get no coverage at home.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's too bad.  Are you tempted by the iPhone 4?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Uh-oh.  Are we going to switch back?  Are we?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We put so much pressure on.  Let me let you off the hook.  No, here's my thought.  I'm using the iPhone 4 right now.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh.  The robot is sad.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The robot, sad robot.  What's your thought, Jeff?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, my thought is that I'll cancel my AT&T laptop card  and use that to pay for keeping the T-Mobile,  because it's a business expense for being on this weekend Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Google.  Yeah, right.  You've got to review the phone.  And with the $60 plan, it's not a whole lot more  than on MiFi, for instance.  It's the same.  No, it's not.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right, and I do still use the Android for my mail and everything.  I prefer the Gmail client there.  I like it better.  Here's what I did touch.  I saw Clayton Morris at Fox, and I touched the X, the Verizon X.  It's nice.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, big screen.  He thought the screen was too large.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I like large, because I'm old.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's not the only one.  There's also now, and T-Mobile has one of these,  the Galaxy S Android phones.  And these have a four inch.  So they're in between the Nexus One and the extra large screen  of the Droid X or the Evo.  They're four inch screens.  And they're these new Samsung Amoleds, which are supposedly  just incredible.  And they're kind of thin.  The T-Mobile one does not have a slide out keyboard.  There are versions with a slide out keyboard.  It's a whole line of Android phones from Samsung  that people are also raving about.  So there's some good choices.  But I have to say, I still like having 2.2,  which you can't yet get on any other handset, legitimately.  I like the slimness and the form factor of the Nexus One.  It's small.  It's easy to carry.  And I have to say, now having carried around the iPhone  for a couple of weeks solely, I do miss Google Voice  integration.  I miss that hugely.  I don't even know how to get.  I mean, on the iPhone, all my messages are in Google Voice,  and I can't even figure out how to get them.  It's like, well, what do I do?  I have to go online?  What do I do?  And then I also miss the better notifications  that Android offers.  It just does not work very well on the iPhone still.  So there are some legitimate reasons  to say stick with the Nexus One.  Tethering is free.  I think while the screen is not as high res as the Retina  display, it's the next best screen out there.  Google Voice integration, notifications, what else?  Are there any other things?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Morals, ethics.  It's open.  Making Gina happy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, that's the only reason that Jeff and I use it,  Gina.  It's because of you.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I also really, I like the widgets.  I like home screen widgets.  I never thought I'd say that, because I'm not  much of a widget or gadget gal in general.  But now I just love the search box kind of front and center,  which you have on iPhone.  But I use the Mint widget.  I use the Pandora widget.  I use the Power widget, where you can toggle on Wi-Fi,  Bluetooth brightness really easily.  I use the News widget.  I mean, I've just got widgets.  I've got to use the Foursquare widget.  So I really like that.  Your phone's just not just like grid of things.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Show us your home screen.  This is one thing I miss on the iPhone,  is the ease of taking screenshots.  You're going to have to tilt it a little bit because of the  gore.  You have a lot of icons in your home screen.  You're not heavily widgetized.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Not too much.  That's that one.  I got to be clear.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I only have one row of widgets on my home screen.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't want to show you my Mint widget because it shows my  net worth.  I know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In fact, I'm kind of amazed that you have your Mint widget  on there.  I tried it for a while.  I thought, wait a minute.  Do I want to broadcast that number?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it's personal.  Well, this is the thing.  I have it on a screen off to the side.  So you kind of have to really dig into my phone to see it.  But yeah, I've got one page that's just widgets.  You know, the search box, the Power widget, the Mint widget,  and then the Pandora widget.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I use the Buzz widget, which I like.  The camera in the iPhone is a little bit better.  But the Nexus One's camera is pretty good.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Have you tried any video editing on the iPhone yet?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it's hard to do with your little fat fingers.  And they just shipped an update that might fix it.  But there were a number of bugs and crashes.  But they just shipped out 101 of iMovies.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Does that update have more bars?  Not yet.  It's my theory of spinal tap.  They're going to have 11 bars all the time.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  My phone goes to 11.  Yeah, they said the fix for the antenna issue is we're going to...  We talked about this a lot on Twitter and other shows.  I don't want to belabor the point.  But we were stunned, says Apple, stunned to learn that we've  been doing it wrong for the last three phones.  We've been showing you too many bars.  You are hypnotized.  You will believe anything we say.  Does it, on the face of it, seem like they're kind of saying  we were misrepresenting the figure at first?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They definitely were.  And what, AT&T did a whole ad campaign around bars, right?  I mean, this whole bar indicator is kind of a human...  I mean, users can expect it now, right?  But it's really like you either drop the call or you don't drop  the call, it's more binary, which is what you were talking  about on Twitter.  This was Jerry Pornell.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  His point was it either works or it doesn't work.  What's with the bars?  Just a light that says you have a connection or you don't.  That's all they need.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right, right.  You know, I had a reader write me and say, or listener write  me and say that he could make the Nexus One lose bars if he  put his finger on the bottom right of the phone.  And I'm actually able to reproduce that.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah.  So, I mean, every phone has this issue.  So we'll give Apple kind of the pass on that, maybe not the  pass on exposing the antenna.  But yeah, their response was funny.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're stunned.  We're stunned.  Oh, we were shocked.  It reminds me so much of Casablanca.  Claude Rains, I'm shocked.  The gambling is going on.  Here's your winnings.  Here's your winnings.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I am shocked.  So one of the stories in the pile today is there will be no  Nexus Two.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is a surprise.  Yeah, it is.  Maybe not as much a surprise because they've kind of been  leading up to this.  They said a few weeks ago they weren't going to sell it.  Google was going to stop selling it directly.  Did they say why no Nexus Two?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Just kind of they didn't need it.  The Nexus One did its job and taught them all these lessons  and set a standard.  And that's fine.  And now we move on.  I guess they learn businesses they're not good at, even  Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I am reading in Android.  It's funny.  Times change so fast.  We don't remember six months ago.  I'm reading an Android book that came out in January.  And it kind of made the-

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You have all the fun, Leo.  I think I took a little time back and time off.  I'm going to read an Android book.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  An Android book.  I'm sure Gina's doing the same thing.  It's an Android programming book.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They move too fast.  You can't get a book.  Things have changed by the time it publishes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is the first one.  It just came out that has 2.0 in it.  But what they say there is between the G1 and these  other- They really were mostly talking about the  Droid and the G1.  And it's different.  And they were kind of celebrating the fact that  Google was going to put out a phone with a kind of define a  Android experience that would then be the standard.  Then we still don't see those phones.  When you get it from HTC, you've got HTC Sense.  When you get it from Motorola, you've got Blur on top of it.  Even this new Samsung has some Samsung sugar on top of it to  make it look like a different from the Google experience.  And that is one reason why I kind of want to stick with the  Nexus One.  It is at least kind of a pure experience.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I really like the Nexus One.  I'm sad about the no Nexus Two.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, DroidX, anyone?  Yeah.  But then you have the- Is it the Moto Blur?  You have good news, bad news.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You have CDMA, but you have a network that works.  Exactly.  You have a network that works.  Expensive network, but it's a network that works.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It is a tough one.  It is.  So Google acquires ITA.  What is the meaning of the $700 million to basically buy a  database that they were leasing before?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, it appears-

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, ITA is the airline booking company, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So in the past, that airline data has been available, I  guess, by rental.  But now Google owns the data.  Is this a response to Bing?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think it's a response to a business opportunity.  I think that it's a huge transactional area.  It's probably the biggest e-commerce  area there is, travel.  I don't know how much advertising they get from  airlines.  Are they going to piss off the airlines by competing with  them?  Are they going to make the airlines happy by giving them  business?  Marissa Meyer, I'm trying to look for the clip now, made  some reference to being able to create new kinds of  searches, like how far can I get for this much money in  seven hours?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  She says, we anticipate being able to build in some flight  search capabilities in terms of flight tracking and in terms  of being able to buy particular flights.  Where can I get within seven hours and within this price?  But can't they do that by renting the data?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, they don't do it at all right now.  They send you over to Priceline or somewhere else  if you do a search.  But you're right, though, Jeff, when you say it's a  business possibility.  It's more than just adding to their search because I'm just  looking at who their clients are.  The airlines use it.  Kayak uses it.  Bing uses it.  This is the ITA database.  Orbitz uses it.  Hotwire uses it.  So they may make money is what you're saying, even though it  was $700 million.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's like when Nokia bought, what was it, Navtech?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  They bought the map.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's a similar kind of core data.  Google has to be careful not to get in antitrust trouble.  But that's where the thing makes its money is by still  serving all those companies.  And the question is, what can they do on top of it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Reading an article from Clint Bolton's Google Watch and  eWEEK, he quotes Eric Schmidt on the call when they  announced the deal on July 1.  I think it's unlikely that anything we do with this data  will look anything like what's available today.  So it sounds like a new product maybe from Google.  Marissa Meyer says, we anticipate being able to build  in some flight search capabilities.  This is what you were talking about in terms of flight  tracking and in terms of being able to buy particular flights.  The quote that you used, where can I get within seven hours  and within this price?  That is exactly what Bing does right now.  It's what Kayak does.  It's what other companies do as well.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This Google Alerts idea for travel is interesting.  If you search yesterday for a flight which is about to sell  out today, you get an alert.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, I like that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's sweet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you know, oh, there's a seat left.  Go.  Does anybody want to?  OK, I'm not exactly footloose and fancy free.  Neither are you, Jeff.  But maybe Gina, would you ever make a search for,  I got this much money and I got seven hours, where can I go?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, I really want to be the kind of person who  does that type of thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a bizarre search.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Go ahead, Gina.  Go ahead.  Search now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're young.  You're footloose and fancy free.  Ride your bike to the airport.  Go to Bora Bora.  Like that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I know.  It makes me feel like I should be acting a little more.  But you know, Kayak did that thing, Kayak.com slash explore,  where it would kind of give you possibly places  that you could travel right now.  I can look at it again.  But I remember looking at it and I was like, I swear,  I almost booked a flight to Hawaii.  Really?  I'm, I'm, it's close.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's the equivalent of those recipe programs where  you say what's in your refrigerator  and it says what you can make.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Exactly right.  Where can I fly for how much?  There's a little slider.  You say, I'm going to take off from Los Angeles.  I've got, you know, 600 bucks.  And I'm thinking about, you know, summer to 2010  or fall of 2010.  So that's pretty cool.  It's pretty, I mean, it's pretty cool just to kind of,  you know, fantasize.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's gimmicky, but it's cool.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's gimmicky, but it's cool.  But no, I generally don't say, where can I go in the next seven  hours for 500 bucks or something?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I just want to because you hear these kinds of things all the time.  People and you know, you could get emails that last minute,  you know, $50 flight.  Do people really do that?  Do they say, oh, good, let's go.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, I mean, there was a business, it wasn't called Last Minute.  And it started in the UK.  They did that well because I think the UK and Europe has had the really  cheap airlines, so you suddenly, you know, let's go to Croatia.  It's only $10.  And you can do that kind of thing.  You know, our equivalent is let's go to Indianapolis.  They'll pay me $10.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No offense to who's here.  My wife briefly in her youth was a courier.  I don't know if you could still do this, but you used to, as long as you could  drop it, a drop of a hat, go somewhere, you would get a call in the morning  that said we need you to fly a courier bag to, you know, New York.  And you get the bag, you have to be able to leave immediately.  And then you get to be in New York for as long as you want.  And you have a return flight.  I guess if you're young.  Nowadays a mule.  A mule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, you didn't have balloons of cocaine up her butt.  This was just, it was like a courier bag.  What are you talking?  Actually, I don't know.  I should ask.  I shouldn't assume.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Those were the old days, Leo.  Yeah.  I shouldn't assume.  I mean, the other thing is I had to fly to Montreal to do a conference about two  months ago and I couldn't believe how much the price was going up, up, up, up, up.  And there's some arbitrage opportunity here that, you know, usually it's  done on the empty seats one way, but I wonder whether there's another business  opportunity here because the prices can go wacky and if you really know how many  seats there are available across the market, what new transparency can you  bring to that market?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  That's a good point.  This was the promise of the internet, friction-free commerce.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It sure ain't with airlines.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Perfect information makes you a perfect consumer.  And if you're a free market fan, you should love this because it makes  the market work better.  You know, supply and demand works better.  It should.  And the airlines, you're exactly right.  They don't want anybody to know this because you could be sitting next to  somebody who paid one quarter what you paid for that ticket and they don't  want you to know that because they know you'd be livid.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Though I argued that if you, if you, of course, if they're making the real high  end on those last minute tickets, this is exposed as utter stupidity.  But I argued in my book, long times as I've made a plug, that at some point the  airline would be wise to let us have an open marketplace in seats.  Right.  That's one time a friend of mine died of AIDS many years ago and I, my flight to  Boston for his funeral was canceled and I was desperate to get to Boston and I,  and, and they weren't going to do any buyouts.  So I said, I'll pay, you know, anybody want a hundred dollars?  They'll take a seat, $200.  Take a seat.  Nobody did.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Huh.  It's like an auction.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.  But, but at some point there's a, there's a marketplace there that if the airline,  you mean where this really goes, I think if you had an open booking system where  you knew, oh, look at it this way.  Google's knowledge of the world comes from what we ask.  Do we have the flu?  Right.  Google knows best.  Right.  First.  Right.  So in this case, wow, a lot of people are searching for flights to X.  Why don't we get to the point at some point where the airline says, Oh crap,  I'm going to put on an extra plane.  No crap.  Nobody's going.  I'm going to consolidate these.  I'm going to do it early.  I'm going to pay you for this and give you discounts.  Right.  Do you, do you bring some, by having that uber knowledge and analysis, can Google  bring some sense to the marketplace?  But then of course I always read too much to this.  I thought that buzz worked.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  So what do we know?  Yeah.  We're the fools that like buzz.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I can fly to Yuma Arizona right now for $230.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, no.  Hmm.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I bet you could go to Indianapolis for less.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hmm.  You know, I'd rather go to, well, Yuma might be a little hot right now.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I bet.  I bet it is.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think we should just stay right where we are.  Finish this show.  Which we'll do in a moment, but first a word from Citrix.  You like that?  Yeah.  Jeff Jarvis, Gina Trapani are here.  We're talking about the Google verse and we have much more to talk about.  And just a bit before we do that, I do want to tell you about go to assist.  If you're in the support business, whether it's personal, you know, you  support family and friends, or you work in IT, or you have software that you  support, you should know about go to assist express.  It is, you know, built on that great foundation, that remote access foundation  that Citrix is so famous for, go to assist takes that and, and tools it for people in  support, for instance, your, your support is your clients or family or friends.  Don't have to have it installed at first.  They can be on a Mac or windows.  Doesn't matter.  Go right now.  You can install it.  You do need to install it first.  Go to, go to assist.com slash twig, and you can do it free for 30 days.  Now, when they say help, you give them a link.  That's all.  And they go there.  The software is installed 30 seconds later.  You're inside the computer.  And by the way, you could set it up for unattended support.  So they don't have to, you know, you don't have to wait till they're home.  You can help them anytime.  As long as they allow you to, obviously for security reasons, it does tell you what  operating systems on there, what security software, anything running in the background,  you could drag and drop fixes or installs from your computer to theirs.  And here's the best part for the busy support professional, eight, eight systems  simultaneously, if you need to start and install on one, never wait.  Go to the next one, go to the next one, go to the next one.  Some really nice features, the best 128 bit SSL, of course.  So you can use it on an open wifi access spot, but you don't have to worry about that.  It's completely secure.  You can share your screen with your support.  And if they want to show you what's going on, you know, you're seeing their screen,  but if you want to say, oh, this is what it should look like.  You could share your screen back.  I can go on and on.  I think you should just try it free 30 days.  Go to assist.com slash twig, G O T O assist.com slash twig 30 days free.  Boom.  You're going to love it.  But yeah, I should really warn you.  You're going to get hooked.  We thank Citrix so much for their support of this week in Google.  Uh, I can't read Hebrew, so I wasn't able to use it.  Do you read Hebrew?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, I said Google can for you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Google did a decent translation of this article, didn't it?  Um, it's a Cal Calist, which is an Israeli, um, I gather kind of like, um,  blog of some sort of financial newspaper sort of, um, they had an  interview with, uh, Galrav Jane, who is the Android product manager.  And he confirmed for the first time that Google's music service will launch  alongside of Android three gingerbread holiday 2010.  So, so now there's two things for you to demand Jeff, your gingerbread and just  a time for Christmas or Hanukkah and, and you can ask for Google music.  We still waiting for the other shoot a drop with Apple.  They acquired a streaming music service called Lala and I thought by now they  would have launched something.  Um, so there are continual rumors that Apple is going to do in a streaming  iTunes service, Google, can Google compete with Apple in this marketplace?  They really own right now.  Apple does.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I mean, Gina, are you, you're, you're using your Android for, and whatever that  let's ask the token young person.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hey, token young person.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, the iTunes to, uh, to, to, to Android transition was, was difficult for  me.  I spent years, I invested years into organizing my iTunes playlist.  And so I started, I moved over to double twist, you know, which can import your  iTunes playlist, but you know, double twist just, it's good.  It's not quite as good.  And, uh, you know, basically long story short, I don't use my Nexus one as a  music player very much.  I'm using the Pandora on it right now, which I like.  I would like to see better music capabilities in general.  I think that media is one of Android's weaker points and I hope that it gets  stronger for sure.  So I'm looking forward to this, but I got to tell you, Apple really has that down  a fresher as well as, as well as Google has the cloud stuff down.  I feel like Apple has the media playback stuff down.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So we were talking last week about, sorry, last week about the, about the curation  piece of this with the Google marketplace.  It's true somewhat, I think with Apple too, it's, it's partly seeing what they  recommend.  They've got an editorial function in the iTunes store, which is exactly what

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Google has resisted doing.  And as you said, we suggested they do this in the store.  Do you trust Apple?  I guess you do.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  With music?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think a good, good recommendations.  Have you seen Grooveshark?  I'm not that groovy.  I play with it too much.  Yeah.  I didn't know about it, but somebody, somebody sent me a playlist via Grooveshark.  And the idea is you can listen to streaming music.  It's free.  I think it's legal.  I think it's legal.  It uses flash, so it's not really very good for mobile, although they, well,  let's see, they do have a mobile.  Oh, look at Android.  Oh, look at Blackberry, Nokia, Palm.  They don't have an iPhone version, but they do have an Android version.  So that's interesting.  And this streams, this is streaming music.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Do you think that streaming is going to take over storing your MP3s  on your phone's memory card?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The thing is, is, I mean, you really have to have a good, a good network.  You'd have to be on that wifi or you have to have a strong 3G connection  really for that to work well.  Right.  I mean, I've been, I've been playing with the Pandora app and it's, it's,  it sticks and hangs.  Does it really?  It takes a while.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I get pretty good results on Android.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I assume that that was just a matter of bandwidth.  I was visiting family and found Edge network.  You know, I didn't have a 3G.  Oh, you were on Edge.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  I won't work on Edge, but it will work on a 3G fairly well.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, I mean, I'm just trying to imagine going to the gym and, you know,  bringing up my workout playlist.  Uh, you know, over 3G or the wifi.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think the reason, well, here's the, here's the arguments for streaming.  You, you, you, you've got the absolute argument against it.  It requires, you know, significant bandwidth.  The arguments for it, first of all, the music companies love it  because you can't steal, right?  So you never own the music.  It's a better, from an economic point of view, it's $3 a month  for Grooveshark, unlimited.  Um, so it's economically, it's much, much cheaper.  Um, you don't have to use scarce storage on the phone.  And even if you've got 32 gigs in your phone, which I do, you might say,  oh gosh, I wish I had that album.  Why don't?  Um, I, I like the idea of paying a monthly fee and just kind of having  access to the full, whatever it is, five or 6 million title, uh, library  that's now out there, everything but Prince apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you see that?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know what that was about.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So, so Prince is putting out his new CD 2010.  I think it's this week or next.  Yeah.  I knew he did this last time on the new, you can get it in a newspaper in England.  I think it's a mirror, right?  Jeff in England, Rollingstone, Germany, you know, so they're going  like glue it to the front of a page, a CD, but he says, but I'm not going  to put it on a, on the internet.  I'm not going to put it on iTunes because they don't give me an advance.  Which I don't get.  They won't give me an advance and the internet is a fad and it's like MTV.  Really?  It used to be hip.  He says, and now it's not anymore, but this is my favorite line.  The internet fills your head with numbers and that can't be good.  What?  What's, what's his head been filled with?  It almost feels like a put on and yet.  I know his whole life does.  Yeah, maybe that's it.  Maybe he just, I don't know.  Maybe I don't know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He's kind of the singing Andy Kaufman.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's kind of like that because it makes no sense.  And surely he knows, as we all know, that if you put out the CD for free on a  newspaper in three seconds, it's going to be on, on the internet for free everywhere.  So you are putting it on the internet in effect and by not making it available  anywhere in the U S online, you're guaranteeing it'll be online for free.  You won't make any money.  Forget the advance.  You won't make a dime.  It's all publicity.  I think he's brilliant.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think, oh yeah, no, he is.  Yeah, he is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think he, but then I would, I would say that this is a put on, but then remember  he sued people who put his music on YouTube.  So he's not that silly.  I don't know.  He, he seems like the kind of guy that would only put out his records on plastic.  Like CDs will fill your head with numbers.  That can't be good.  So we're going to go back to vinyl.  That's what I want you to do.  Prince listen.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I love curmudgeons.  You know, he's in curmudgeon.  In my, in my research for the public, this book, my favorite thing is that, is the  privacy didn't really come up as an issue in American law until 1890.  Really?  The reason was technology.  The adventure was the Kodak camera.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That was the camera that started this.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.  And so I looked at a bunch of really great old New York times clips and, and  they were called Kodakers and Kodak fiends.  No good would come of this.  You're a Kodak fiend.  Kodakers were lying in wait for JP Morgan.  They're just great stuff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  See, this has always happened.  Hasn't it?  Yeah.  Every step of the way.  All it takes is a little sense or knowledge of history.  And you realize where this is exactly what it's always been like.  People have always been uncomfortable with these steps forward in technology.  Well, we talked about Prince, I guess, if you talk about Prince, can Justin  Bieber be far behind?  So what is the story with this YouTube Justin Bieber hack attack, Gina?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, I'm too old for Justin Bieber.  Everybody's too old for Justin Bieber.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I, oh, come on.  You think he's cute.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  He is kind of cute.  He's kind of cute.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But he's what 16 when he's a kid, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  He's not of legal age, so I'm not going to say.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I think most of the resentment of Justin Bieber has to do with the fact  that you can't get away from him.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He's on YouTube.  He's on Twitter.  He's like a trending topic forever.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, he's just he's been a sort of fixture of the trending topics.  So there are a couple of Bieber stories that kind of came into my peripheral  vision this week, right?  There was something on Boing Boing that Jenny Twittered about, about him having  a tour North Korea or something.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, this was so this was a hoax that was  posted. So did Jenny start that?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I she she definitely wrote about it.  And then and then the other one was the YouTube.  Oh, so this is the same story.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. So so so I guess it was Boing Boing that started or Jenny Jardin started.  There was a website saying, where should Justin Bieber go next?  And this sounds like the kind of thing, frankly, that 4chan would do.  Six hundred fifty thousand votes for North Korea.  Oh, yeah, it was 4chan.  It was 4chan. Yeah, it was 4chan.  It was 4chan.  That's the only people who have that kind of clout.  I mean, Boing Boing is great, but six hundred fifty thousand votes.  And now the YouTube hacking happened  early in July.  Justin Bieber videos with the target for hackers, redirecting users to adult  websites or triggering a pop up message saying that he had died in a car crash.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, God. That's one way to create hysteria.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Geez. That was a cross site scripting vulnerability that was fixed by Google.  So that was a how how is that a shocking vulnerability?  Yes. Well, this XSS vulnerabilities are common,  but they require a flaw in  Mike. Is it in the CSS or is JavaScript?  Isn't it, Gina?  I think it's a JavaScript flaw.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This is interesting. I mean, if Google fixed it on YouTube side, that it sounds like maybe YouTube wasn't  escaping, you know, they were able to get an HTML and JavaScript inside the comment, right?  And that shouldn't have been able to that shouldn't have gotten into the content comment.  Right. So but usually XSS flaws are like browser specific flaws where the browser's  security model fails or like one tab can play havoc with another tab.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But it was a problem in Chrome, I believe, briefly.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. So this is interesting.  So they probably rolled out something to YouTube which disallowed that, you know,  client side code to get posted in the comments. Interesting.  I would love to know what the details of this is.  This is a more interesting story than I thought.  I heard Justin Bieber and I was just like, yes, stop reading.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right. I've gone to Wikipedia. There are two kinds of XSS cross site scripting  flaws, persistent and non persistent.  Non persistent is the most common type.  The whole show up when the data provided by a web client, most commonly an HTTP query  parameters or an HTML form submission.  So it would be YouTube's problem is used immediately by a server side script to generate a  page of results for that user without a sanitized response.  So an error in their scripting would allow a unsanitized response to cause a problem.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. So you can cause the YouTube page to do something that it wasn't supposed to do,  like redirect you to an old site or have a pop up saying he died in a car crash just by  submitting certain certain bits of HTML.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And that normally only happens, you know, per session basis.  A persistent one. Somehow the server saves that data and then continue.  And apparently this is what happened on YouTube and it continues to be served up.  So that would be that would be not so good.  All right. So, you know, these things happen.  Google fixed it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So is that the kind of thing that a geek just comes along and happens to discover and then  says, what should I do with this?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Bad guys, bad guys are throwing unsanitized responses at anywhere that you can enter data.  You can guarantee that there's a cadre of hackers going, hmm, let's see what happens when  I do this. Let's see what they even have engines that do it automatically.  Just feed it garbage, hoping to find these flaws.  But everybody's Facebook's had this problem.  MySpace has had this problem.  Microsoft SharePoint has had this problem.  Google has had the problem in the search engine as well as as well as on YouTube.  A bug in YouTube allowed attackers to create this is from Security Watch PC magazine,  allowed attackers to create malicious pages by putting cross site scripting attacks in  the comments. Attacks were widespread yesterday, according to Sunbelt software, mostly  spreading claims about Justin Bieber and messing with the comment feature.  Another popular hack was scrolling text, inviting readers to Korea.  It's not a virus, it's just a flaw in the in the form software that allows that to happen.  It's kind of embarrassing, though.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That is embarrassing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Oops. I don't know how hard it is to prevent.  Speaking of YouTube, a very interesting plan to crowdsource a documentary.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This is really interesting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What do you think of this, Jeff? Tell us about it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Ridley Scott is going to make one of those day in the life things.  There are those wonderful books that come out and he's going to make one on video.  And I think it is on July 24th, is it, Leo?  Yeah, a day in the life.  Day in the life. We can all contribute our video of our day.  I'm thinking we should just do a podcast that day and.  Oh, yeah, we can upload to a camera.  Yeah. And and then he's going to make a documentary out of it.  God knows what will come of it.  They're going to show it at Sundance.  If your videos used, you get co-director credit.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So they say as many as 20 people will be flown to Sundance to as co-directors.  So when you read the articles, it says things like people brushing their teeth.  So it's supposed to be like daily kind of normal activities.  A day in the life.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think we'll find people, you know, who live unusual days.  So we'll see that.  And I don't know how he's going to put it together.  But Paolo Coelho, the author who sold 100 million books,  the optimist, a a version of his witch book.  And I'm forgetting what the title is suddenly, where the  his readers created.  Various scenes and characters, and he put it together as a movie.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The Witch of Portobello.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And yeah, it was called the the  for the movie online was called.  I never saw the movie, but he was quite enthralled with  was doing this and I like it because it kind of gives respect  to this world of fiendish Kodakers out here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I really like you. I do like the Paul is amazing.  He's a guy we should get on.  I mean, he's a guy who's really discovered that the Internet can be a huge boon for his  his business.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, he did. We are a Palo.  Yeah, we could get him on. He's wonderful. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Very, very fascinating story. Oh, you know him. Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This is going to be really obnoxious. I'm going to get crap for this.  I met him at Davos. Oh, well, there you go.  Of course you did.  But yeah, he's he's made more by being a pirate  than anything else. And he loves this world.  He got caught by his editor, Harper Collins,  because he said, oh, somebody pirated me. What can I do?  And they looked at it and they said, Palo, you know, was the editor's version.  It was your version. You did it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You did it, Palo. But he sold.  But the book, but Alchemist was not selling any.  And it sold like crazy.  And it took off and it became a huge international bestseller because of that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He notices when somebody does a pirated version in another country, in another  language, it leads to sales there.  It's so it's Cory Doctorow just like it. Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, it's counterintuitive, but there's so much empirical evidence  now that it works that I think we should just accept that it does.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So we went to the next step of saying, let's make something together.  And so, you know, you have people like Queloz and Ridley Scott, who are big  guys who are now wanting to collaborate with the public. Right.  I am advertising event in New York.  Two weeks ago, I interviewed the creator of Heroes.  And, you know, he had the problem with TV is it takes six weeks.  Like I'm right or more. But.  He's trying to find new ways to collaborate with the public,  even in those artistic and creative ventures, even in a fiction fictional show.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So what would you do? Are we going to do this?  Are we going to July 24th? We're going to submit our.  You have a few days after the 24th to submit it.  I figure I'll use the iPhone and I movie.  And I'll make.  I don't know what I would do.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I mean, is it maybe the three of us should get on.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We should do something and do something together.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, that'd be fun.  You can all brush our teeth.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I want my video to be of me Google searching where I can fly in the next seven hours.  Yes. And then getting on and getting on the flight.  My bags and going out on the 24th.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You have to go somewhere.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'll foot the bill, Gina.  I'll foot the bill. I'll pay the ticket.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'll just fly somewhere random.  And just Gina.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Gina's going to fly somewhere random and film it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Gina's in West Covina.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I love it. Yeah, it might be a short flight.  Good.  I think that's a great idea.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I want to do a sped up screencast of everything that happens on my computer  desktop for an entire day and like 30 seconds.  That's a good idea.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, don't give away all your good ideas.  That's a good one. I like that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm hoping someone else will do it because I'm too lazy.  You don't have to do it.  It's good to give away my ideas.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We did. You know, we recently, you probably noticed it looks a little brighter in here.  We just we had Kelly came in with his all in one truck.com  and he re-lit the whole studio and put a new lighting rig up and stuff.  And John Slanina, our studio manager, put his time lapse camera up there in one day.  And it's a it's a shot was a shot every minute, I think.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Sweet. Is that published?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're going to publish it.  Cool. That would be perfect for that, you know, because it was like  and all this cool stuff going on.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah. Are you in the cottage both weekend days always?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, I am always here.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I saw your panoramic shot from behind the microphone  and it was fascinating seeing the other side.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  See the whole thing. I know I'll do that again.  Actually, I have the I have the one before the change and I should do it before and after.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is this what your bandwidth would walk you today?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Or no, actually it is.  Oh, actually, you know what? Well, we don't know why we  something really bad happened to Skype.  This is kind of embarrassing, but we weren't we had to stop the podcasts earlier today  and we'd been having problems for a couple of days.  And you're right, it did.  It all started when we rewired and really the studio.  So it's something to do with that.  But so we we pay seven hundred dollars a month in the studio  for a very high quality kind of T1 like thing called Ethernet to the first mile.  And it's supposed to be rock solid, super good.  And we don't know if it's our end or their end or we don't know what's wrong.  But we seven hundred bucks.  So today, all of our Skype is courtesy of Comcast, Comcast cable modem.  And it's better.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, it's pretty good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Calling Comcast cares, I guess I should probably tweet.  I tweet all the negatives. I should probably tweet the positive.  Yeah, you should give them a little credit.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We've got right now. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And we're still having trouble in the stream, which is still in the EFM.  So I think we're going to put everything on Comcast and I'm going to save seven  hundred bucks a month.  All right. I want to talk about a petition that is going on in just a little bit.  A petition to change Google Voice for the better and petition we want to support.  But before I do, I got to tell you, speaking of bandwidth about sling box,  do you use a sling box?  Gina seems like you should be using a sling box.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm very close to purchasing a sling.  I know they're one of our sponsors, especially.  I've been thinking about it for quite some time.  I want to do that East Coast, West Coast thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why I thought that's why I thought you want to do that.  Yeah, I do. We'll send you one.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Jake stole mine.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jake stole yours. He took it to college.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He's going to try to use it there.  So I got to get a second sling box now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, see, everybody has a sling box.  Sling box is awesome. I will send you the sling box.  HD, Gina, because that's high quality.  So what you do is you get the sling box, you get them at Best Buy  or sling box dot com.  And so you get the sling box, you connect your television setup at home.  So your DVR goes into it.  Your DVD can go into it.  Any antenna, anything you've got.  It's got multiple connections.  Wish I had one here. I'll bring I would have one here,  except it's connected to my house.  But I will get another one so I can show you.  So you connect that and then you connect your ethernet to that.  So now it's online.  And what it does is it puts your whole television setup online  and you can they have applications for Android.  In fact, people tell me that the Android app is the best app of them all.  Of course, iPhones, iPod touches.  You have to be on Wi-Fi for that, obviously.  But it does work on 3G on the iPhone.  That was a big deal when they got AT&T to agree to that.  Blackberries.  So, of course, your laptops, Windows or Mac.  So anywhere you are on these devices, you can you dial you enter the password  and it logs you into your sling box at home.  You can control the DVR.  You can playback.  You can watch what's on your TV.  So it's like you have access to your TV setup anywhere on the road.  Quality is really good.  It depends, of course, on your internet connection.  But you never have to miss, you know, stuff that's local  in the San Diego market, if you're in New York or sports people love.  In fact, it'd be great.  And I mean to do this to take it to a ballgame and then watch the instant replay.  The ballgame is awesome.  You basically anything that you watch at home, sports, news, movies,  any other program type you can watch on your iPhone, your iPod touch with Wi-Fi,  your BlackBerry, your laptop, your MacBook and yes, your Android phones.  I love it. I don't have my Nexus one here.  I was next week. I will show you on the Nexus one.  You can find an in-store demo at a Best Buy near you.  Just go to slingbox.com and you'll find one nearby.  And we love slingbox.  I think you're going to like slingbox a lot.  It's the it's kind of the geek thing.  We should get you another one, too, Jeff.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'll call you especially when I'm in Europe.  The weirdest thing is when I stay in a hotel in, let's say, London,  I think that the cable deal, they must pay the licensing or something.  You get three or four really crappy channels and then 10 Arabic channels.  That's it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You got to stop going to those hotels favored by the Arab world.  No, no, no. No, no, seriously,  because I go to a hotel in San Francisco sometimes and it's all Japanese channels.  And what it means is they have a lot of Japanese clientele  because they provide the channels that they want to watch.  And apparently you're the only American.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think I am.  I only go on expense accounts. I can't afford it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's really no kidding.  Slingbox dot com.  So this petition, by the way, we said it and we should say it again.  If you don't have a Google Voice account, go and get one  because it's open to the world now.  Everybody can have one.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  In the US. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm sorry. Did I say the world?  The US. I got in big trouble for that.  So you're right. Just watch now.  Right. Because, you know, a third of our audience is outside the US.  So a third of you cannot get this. Yeah.  Oh, yeah. This that's what the best.  Little tongue.  Yeah, you should do this show in German because we have a huge German audience.  A lot of Scandinavians, a lot of Brits, Canadians, Australians.  It's you know, it's the nature of the Internet broadcasting is not national.  And that throws everybody, including all of our advertisers for a loop and us.  Right. Because we'll say, go out and get Google Voice and they know can't.  Stop. Stop telling me about it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I didn't realize what a big fat American I was until I started writing online.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's very exactly.  It's really good for us to remind us we are not the only ones.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We are not the only ones.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, if you live in the US, do get Google Voice because it's really great.  And if you have if you're in fact, it's like I said at the beginning of the show,  this is the reason you use an Android phone.  It becomes your voicemail on your Android phone.  It's so much better.  I know people love the Apple visual voicemail.  I like the I really prefer it because I can get texts.  I get the emails. I can listen.  I mean, just better all around.  Anyway, so what is this this petition to do something different on Google?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, to to make a desktop app because it's become religion in Google,  according to the founders, that they will only do browser apps.  And now people say, no, we it's not good enough.  Browsers not ready.  We want a Google Voice desktop.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, the problem comes from the fact that they acquired Gizmo  and promptly killed the Gizmo app. Right.  And that was a great app.  It was a SIP phone that you could use.  There are other there are other apps out there,  but I thought Gizmo is the best of them all.  So they already have the app.  It's almost like you just release it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah, it's really interesting.  It's really a very hard stand that their platform is the browser  and they want to stick to it.  But, you know, Google has some desktop apps, Picasa. Right.  I mean, there are some installable Google.  That's a good point. Google, Google Earth, Google Earth, Google Desktop,  Picasa, what a smother.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Don't kill Google Earth. I'd be furious. Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, there are just there are some apps that just,  you know, work better on the desktop.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What happens if you go to a chromium world and the Chrome browser  is operating system? Right.  Are they going to have apps that won't work then? Oh.  So they're there for once.  They're thinking ahead in that way.  But I think what's really cool here is the opportunity for Google  to be the anti-Apple.  No one would ever think of telling Steve what to do.  Ever. Right.  But thousands are ganging up to think, well, Google might listen to us.  I think they should.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they should.  If there's a demand for it, why not?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. I feel like Google's had been really good about having this  about about showing that they listen and having this sort of continual  conversation with users. Right.  You know, unlike the sort of letter from Steve Jobs on high,  it seems like Google's been doing especially a good job  in the past couple of years of blogging and responding and changing things  when they didn't work. You know, when the background images rolled out,  they pulled them back immediately.  I mean, you know, they're.  Although you can do it now.  You know, you can still do it. You can do it.  But you opt in. Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it looks so much like Bing, but I actually did it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Some of the images are really. They're beautiful.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I kind of like having an image on my on my Google.  See, I've got the I don't know what that's the Casbah or something.  I don't know what that is, but it looks so much like Bing.  Yeah, it does. Unlike Bing, though, Bing, it changes every day on this.  You can't you have to change it by hand, which I think is not good.  I mean, it's pretty.  I can remove it.  And then you click change background image and then they give you some choices,  but you could do it from your own photos.  There's some really pretty images.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't see why they wouldn't just have a desktop app and a browser based  Google Voice, you know, like that.  You know, all their desktop apps have sort of web counterparts, right?  So like Google Earth is Google Maps, Picasso is Picasso Web.  Even Google Desktop kind of integrates web search results  with your desktop search results.  I don't see why they couldn't do both, especially like you said, Leo.  They have the app, right?  They have the Gizmo app. Right.  It'd just be a matter of rebranding it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Have you seen this Chrome fastball game?  Did we talk about this last week?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We did. It was down when we tried.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is it back up?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I hadn't tried it since we we couldn't try it before.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This this is because they build flash now.  Yes, it's up.  They build flash now into the into the browser.  It comes with comes with Chrome now.  What am I supposed to do?  What what what what's going on?  What help help?  What am I supposed to do? Is it just doing it?  Am I supposed to click on anything?  Oh, I see.  Choose the fastest mode of transportation between point A and point B.  A straight line. I don't know. Huh?  Bicycle.  Biking five minutes. Get there faster.  Car. OK, four minutes.  Yes, that's it. Chrome fast. OK.  That's kind of a stupid game.  Yeah. OK. What's happening?  I don't know what the hell's happening.  Tweet the fastest ball you could think of.  A a cheetah ball cheetah ball.  OK, that's the fast ball.  And then what is this tweeting?  It's not a ball, I recognize.  Fastball scene there.  Fastball, fastball. OK, there I'm tweeting it.  That speed depends on you, my friend.  We'll give you an average speed this time.  That's an average ball penalty of five tweets.  I don't even know what's going on.  Go. Oh, jeez.  Have you played this yet?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I haven't, but now I'm scared.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's OK. Translate text.  Translate that. That looks like it's in.  I'm going to say Hungarian, Hungarian.  Translated into English.  Translate. No close, but try again with fewer options.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If you get everything right, you get a job at Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He's it's not it's Finnish. It's Finnish. That's it.  I think the ball was lost in translation. Oh, jeez.  Oh, Icelandic. It's close.  I know it's making me crazy.  It says a ball in motion will stay in motion.  Do you think it's different every time?  I don't get it. I don't get it either.  It's very postmodern, Jeff.  Choose an artist. Selected artist. Bridge. What?  Help the ball by spelling bridge out of band names. Beatles.  You guys aren't helping me at all.  Rihanna.  Artist Iggy Pop.  Daba. Daba.  Daba. D. It has to begin with a D.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh D. I thought it was Rihanna.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, no, no. D. D. D.  Danger Mouse.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Danger Mouse. Danger Mouse.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  OK, doors. That was better. OK. G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gorillas. Gorillas.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  With a Z.  Oh, did I spell it wrong? Oh, two L's.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, two L's and a Z.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  OK, and finally, an artist that begins with an E.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Elton John. Enya.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is very revealing.  It is. It's way too revealing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I hope they don't collate this information.  So my time is two.  Wait a minute, there's more. Search for three things that have decreasing search results.  Jeff Jarvis.  OK, Leo Laporte.  Yes, so far so good.  OK, who's less than us? Jeff.  Dan. Jason.  There you go.  There you go. I like your thinking.  And we win.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  There's three minutes

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  of 25 seconds of your life.  You'll never get back.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  As they used to say, I'm David Letterman, network time wasters.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  My final time. Hey, that's pretty good.  I ranked 11,853 out of 39,449 players.  So they give you the record time on the tour to Twitter is five seconds.  Map lap, six seconds.  But see, I think next time I'll do better.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Next time you'll be way faster because you've got it down now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I didn't even know what the rules were at first.  I couldn't figure out what the hell I was doing.  I'm amazed I finished.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Like incorporated all these other services, you know, like Twitter and Last FM.  You know, these were their competitors essentially, and they're promoting them.  I think that's great.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What my initial concern with Twitter is, I thought that I would be tweeting  whatever I said. Yeah, it wasn't clear.  So it's just a phony Twitter.  It was fun. I like that.  All right. So am I going to be the guinea pig and get a droid?  I guess I am. Droid X.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Of course, you have to land one for now.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It was nice.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do you like do you like the ad that says, have you seen the ad that has  it says double antenna, hold it any way you want?  You got to like that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Problem is, it doesn't it's not going to have two point two.  You revert pre for you to one, I think. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Although and this really gets me.  So I see the article that says, no, we'll definitely be getting two point two.  But they don't say when or, you know, I mean,  could be next year, a little more information.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What's so hard about it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Go ahead, Leo. No, you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I just started the the Android book.  You probably read more of it than I have.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, I assume it's just because they customize  different carriers, customize the OS.  That's what I think. In different ways.  So there's like the distribution, but there's also the customization part of it.  And I assume it's the customization part of it that just takes a little time.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Actually, I'm going to correct myself in the ad.  It says Android two point two and Adobe Flash, which comes with two point two.  Late summer over the year update.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, late summer. That's not so bad.  It's like next month.  We've been talking about Froyo for a long time, but it just got open sourced  like last week, right? Right.  So the carriers basically are just sort of getting their hands on it now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Eight megapixel camera, mobile hotspot over Verizon.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  See, if I keep if I if I keep two phones.  I wonder whether I should have Android on Verizon as one of them.  Yeah, I'm an iPhone user in Europe. Yep.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I have to have the I have to have GSM.  So I'm going to have to keep either the Nexus one or the or the iPhone,  because I got to have GSM. Yeah.  I think this droid X looks pretty hot.  I'll tell you what, I'll be the guinea pig. July 15th.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Clayton thought it was too big.  But I like the size of it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, did he think the Evo is too big?  It's roughly the same size as the Evo, which I did.  Gina said the perfect thing.  She said it's it's what did you say?  It's it's almost too big.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's almost too big. It's right on the edge being too big.  Yeah, not quite there.  Almost to be one more millimeter.  Yeah. And I would have been too big. Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So I like it.  Well, when you get the whatever that Dell thing is called at five inches.  That's intriguing.  That's markedly bigger.  Well, somebody said it's like holding a waffle up your head.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And that's going to be like a tablet.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that's basically going to be a tablet, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, you're going to use Bluetooth and you're not going to hold it to your head,  which is probably a good idea.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I had my first kind of longing for a tablet this weekend,  reading Clay Shirky's new book in the Kindle app for Android, which is which is great.  I love it.  And in fact, if you if you with the Kindle app for Android,  if you change the background to black and the type is white,  it really is almost as good as the ink.  You know, it's not as hard on your eyes.  You still get the glare.  That's good to know the actual Kindle.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But on the on the OLED screens, that would be the most efficient energy  used to because black uses no energy.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I prefer a darker background.  I always change all my text editors to have a dark background and light light type anyway.  But yeah, I really thought to myself, wow, I want an Android tablet.  It was the first time that I that I really felt myself, you know, wanting a tablet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I guess Germany is out of the World Cup.  Jeff, is that bad? Yes, they are.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Spain's in. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Spain and Netherlands.  I don't know why I said that.  I just thought I'd throw that in.  I know why, because I want to play the Vuvuzela one more time before.  That's my last chance.  My last chance.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It is the final.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I said on my said  final on Sunday, right during my radio show.  Oh, well, what the hell?  So the Cisco tablet, the OK, how do you pronounce this one?  CIUS, CUS, CUS, CUS,  if it's James Bond, Money Prada, give me my CUS.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's it doesn't bode well that you're not.  You it's not immediately, obviously, at a CIUS.  I don't know.  I'd say CUS.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  CIUS from Cisco.  So it's going to be the CIUS.  Oh, I get it. You see us.  So it's not as it's only seven inches.  So it's not as big as the iPad.  It will run Android.  It is pronounced see us.  Some of the Cisco apps like WebEx and telepresence will be built in.  But Android developers will be encouraged to develop for it  using Cisco's own SDK and API.  Not good.  Eight hour battery life, according to Cisco, Firefox integrated.  This is not an Android experience, really, is it? Oh.  And it's running on an atom, an Intel atom processor.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  A second. 1.14.  Well, they are running on it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  On an atom, that's OK.  Firefox can run on atom.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Why would they do it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But why? Why not use Chrome?  You got WebKit. It's built in.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, you know, these these corporate clients, they could be.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what it is. You're right, Jeff.  Yeah. And it's absolutely what it is.  So this is really I think this is a corporate device.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, that's what it is.  That's the entire. I think it's more expensive, too.  It's in the higher margin.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In fact, docs into a Cisco phone.  Which is kind of interesting. Yeah, that's kind of cool.  This what this is, what this is, is it shows  the strength of the Android strategy because it's its license and royalty free.  So a company like Cisco is encouraged if they're going to develop something like  this, that is that is, you know, kind of a purpose built device.  It's not a general mass market device.  It's a purpose built device.  But why not use Android? It's free.  And you get all the benefit.  And you can you can say to developers, yeah, you have to use our SDK and API,  but it is still Android.  So you kind of know how to develop for this. Yeah.  I think this is really the strength of of Google's strategy here.  You'd never see iOS on this.  You the license fee wouldn't be allowed.  You'd be shot. You'd be shot.  That's right. You couldn't do it, could you?  So there's I think we're going to start.  That's the first enough.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Sure. I think we're going to see lots and lots of of of  of applications of the ability.  I saw the Google I didn't put this in the chat room, but Google  incorporated Google Checkout into Android for some devices.  So just as the Apple guys were using the iPhone,  or imagine if people in retail stores all over can use perfect  Android phones and doctors can use Android tablets and so on and so forth.  There'll be a lot of special use things.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Perfect.  All right, we're going to end with the the joke of the week  that one of our friend feed posters sent to us from Zany.com X, A, Y and I.com.  It is an iPhone case that solves the problem of how to hold it.  It's got a telephone handset on the back.  I've also seen one a mannequin hand that has you put it in the mannequin hand  and then you hold it on a on a rod.  All right, we had to rub it in just a little bit.  Time speaking.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Speaking of Android, there's a really cool Kickstarter project that I just  I want to plug really quickly.  Yes, this developer called Danny Pier in Denver, Colorado wants to build an Android app that will  take photos and also use the GPS capability and he wants to attach an Android device to a weather  balloon and send it up and try to get pictures of the earth.  And there's you know, there was this Brit back earlier this year, you know, use some duct tape  and a camera and a GPS and some weather balloons and got some incredible pictures from the sky.  So Danny wants to make this project.  He wants to use an Android device to do this and he wants to build an Android app to do this.  And he's raising two thousand dollars just to buy, you know,  weather balloons and devices that he can throw up and see what happens.  And depending on how much you you you pledge, you can get a photo, you know, print of the photo  that the device takes or you can get the app itself.  And he's trying to raise eighteen hundred dollars and he's at like a thousand  and he's got four more days left.  So to raise the money.  So it's on Kickstarter.  I also linked it on our friend feed.  I think it's a cool project.  Those photos that Robert Harrison got earlier in the year were amazing.  And I would love to try this out myself.  And maybe if Danny raises the money and gets to gets to do it, we will we will be able to do that.  So check it out.  Yeah.  Yeah, we could build one.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What's the minimum donation you can make on Kickstarter?  Is it a buck?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's five.  I think that each project sets it, but it's five dollars for this particular project.  Fair enough.  So if you get pledge five dollars, you get your name credited.  If you ten dollars or more, you get a print.  And if you pledge fifty dollars or more, you actually get a copy of the app so you can do it yourself.  And I think one shift your moral, he'll give you the eight by ten photo.  The he's calling it Asteroid, which is the name of the project, the app,  weather balloon recovery parachute and all the material that you'll need to replicate the flight  yourself.  So it seems like a really cool project.  And Danny's been and his friends have been bugging me for a couple of weeks to bring it up.  So I pledged I pledge 50 bucks.  So check it out.  I'm hoping that he's going to make his goal.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do you it's time for Gina's tip.  And I don't know if the your top article on Smarterware is your tip.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, you know, I probably it isn't.  And I probably should mention that.  And then, yeah, let's let's talk about it real quick.  Somebody emailed me, you know, we've talked about this Google Apps versus Google Accounts  disparity for a while.  Google accounts get get access to a lot of products like voice and Google reader that  Google Apps accounts don't yet.  So and we talked about just last week, Google is it wants to kind of bring parity where it  give Google Apps users the access to the same number of products that regular Google accounts  get.  And there's a trusted tester program going on right now.  I'm not I'm not a part of it, but a listener is an email me about it.  And so basically, Google Apps accounts are going to get access to all those other products,  which is awesome, like voice and reader.  Actually, yeah, I think voice is on apps now, but reader and analytics and all that stuff.  And you're going to be able to if you have a Google account and a Google Apps account,  which are tied to the same email address, they're going to resolve the conflict by adding  a plus personal.  This is brilliant.  Google account.  Yeah, it's your address.  It's brilliant.  It's a little confusing.  I posted this on my blog and I got a lot of people in the comments saying, wait, what now?  What happens to what?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So OK, I am currently I am Laporte at Gmail.com.  That's my personal account.  And let's say we have Leo at twit.com as a Google Apps account.  So it will going forward be Leo plus personal at twit.com.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, with Google accounts, you can associate any email address you want.  So your Gmail address, there won't be a conflict because your Google Apps account is at some other  domain. Gmail address isn't the problem.  But if you associated like Leo at twit.com with your Google account, and you also had a Google  Apps account, which was Leo at twit.com, then there'd be a conflict.  Then you'd have two Google accounts with the same address.  And to resolve that conflict, they're going to add the plus personal to the Google account.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  To the Google account, not the Apps account.  So the Google account becomes Leo plus personal at twit.com.  And the Google accounts is Leo at twit.com.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So the bad news is you can't like there's no one click merge.  You can't say these are both my accounts.  Now just merge all my data.  There was no talk of that and any of the help pages.  But looking through all these different products, I mean, you could export,  and pretty much all of them except Google Voice.  Google Voice is the only one.  With Google Voice, you have a phone number, obviously, associated with the account.  So how do you port that phone number over?  Right now, you can submit a request to port a Google Voice number from one Google account  to another.  There's a spreadsheet.  There's a request spreadsheet.  You can't transfer it to a Google Apps account, but I'm hoping that they're going to offer that  when this happens.  So there's going to be a little data import export action when this does happen.  If you want to move completely to Google Apps, which I'm definitely going to do because I'm  tired of juggling both accounts.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, we're about to corporately.  We've been using the free Google Apps.  We're about to move to Google, the full Google Apps.  We're using Google Docs.  We're going to move to Google Apps, I think, for all of Twitter.  It just seems like a sensible way to go, especially now that I can still log in with my,  or I soon will be able to log in with my personal account.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Gina, I'm confused, but I'll wait till it happens.  It's a little confusing.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We'll talk about it when it rolls out.  It is a little confusing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The upshot is you will never have full time.  If you look at her website.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's a multicolored whiteboard.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Red, yellow, and green.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's confusing.  The upshot is you will be able to have just a Google Apps account and do everything,  which is kind of the goal.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You can continue to use your personal Gmail account by adding plus personal to your Apps account.  Oh, never mind.  Gina, what's your tip of the week?  I just confused myself.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's a little confusing.  We will explain when it comes out at TrustyTester.  If you hear me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jeff disappeared.  We lost Jeff.  From the face of the earth.  I'll call him back while you give us your tip of the week, and then we'll get his number.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  All right.  I will.  I will.  Nexus One folks who have Froyo and who also use Chrome can use this new,  cool new app called Chrome to Phone.  It's a Chrome extension and a Firefox extension.  You install it and, uh-oh, Leo, I hope I didn't steal your tool.  No.  Okay, good.  When you install Chrome to Phone on your Chrome browser or your Firefox browser,  you get a little button in the toolbar and you hit the button and say,  send the phone.  It will send all your open tabs to your Android.  It's just Froyo 2.2.  Oh, and also there's a phone component.  You have to install the Chrome to Phone Android application as well and register your device.  Right?  So you're just telling, you're telling Google, this is my phone.  This is my Chrome browser.  It links those two.  And so, you know, if you're, if you're packing up your browser for the,  for the night and going home and you, and you got a few open tabs,  you didn't get a chance to look at, you hit the button,  sends those tabs to your phone.  And when you get home, uh, or when you're on the train, you can,  you'll, you'll get all those tabs on your phone.  It's pretty neat.  And if you get a little notification that says Chrome sent your tabs,  you know, on your phone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So, so you need the Chrome extension on your Chrome, which, which is a CRX file.  Right.  Download the APK file on your phone, on your phone.  And then you can right click or click on the extension.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  You click on the extension, you sign in your Google account  and on your phone, you tap the application to register your device.  And those are, those are one-time deals.  And then, and then once you do that, you can hit that, send my tabs to phone.  And it works with Firefox too.  There's a Firefox extension.  I love it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  I did it on my phone.  I don't remember right away.  I think when I got Froyo on there.  Oh, really?  That's, that's a Froyo feature.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's Froyo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's Froyo specific.  It's so cool.  Well, not so cool for Droid users, but, but, but cool nonetheless.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good point.  Yeah.  See, this is another reason to stay.  So you get this little button on your, on your Chrome and you just click on it.  Whoops.  Whoa, whoa.  There it is.  And it'll send those tabs.  Of course, I have to log into my account.  Cool.  We can't get Jeff back, but I know what his number is.  I wonder if I should keep trying or.  It sounded like he was saying, if you lose me.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it did sound like that a little bit.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, he gave us a number in his, in our friend feed account.  So I'll just, I'll deliver his number for us and we'll get Jeff back his number of the week.  Negative $5.3 billion.  And this is the stock plunge over the last year, 30% loss.  Which means if you're Larry Page, you lost 5.3 billion.  If you're Sergey Brin, you lost 5.2 billion.  If you're ex Schmidt, you lost 1.7 billion in the value of the, of the shares you hold.  Peanuts.  Peanuts.  It's nothing but 58.  I eat that for breakfast.  Why?  Why?  And I wish Jeff were here because I'm curious why you think that Google stock  over the last seven months has plunged 30%.  It seems like Google should be stronger and bigger and better than ever.  You would think so.  It's fallen for 13 consecutive trading sessions.  It rallied on Wednesday.  The stock had plunged so much.  Erasing.  Boy, that's just amazing.  That's a lot of money.  My tip of the week is something that has been around for a while, but has recently been  upgraded.  It is Google's mobile YouTube site, which is m.youtube.com.  Now, of course, if you're on an iPhone, this isn't going to do you any good at all  because the iPhone folks don't have flash.  But this works nicely on a Nexus one where we do have flash and it's designed for any phone.  Oh, wait a minute.  Maybe it does work on an iPhone.  They're showing it with an iPhone.  So you enter M.  I guess it's smart enough to say, oh, it's an iPhone.  I'll send you H.264.  Look at that.  So I take it back.  M.youtube.com.  They now have high quality.  It plays back in quick time.  And all the features.  Very nice.  Of YouTube improved and a lot more videos in there as well.  Of course, you have an YouTube application on Android and iPhone.  But I rarely use it.  Do you ever use it?  I rarely use that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, only when it launches when I've hit it in the video.  Right.  Otherwise.  But I don't I generally don't launch it standalone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This should make it possible not to worry about it.  Jeff Jarvis is the blogger at BuzzMachine.com.  He's also the author of What Would Google Do?  Which is available everywhere.  And he's working on his new one, Public Parts, which will be out soon.  He also is a professor of journalism at the City University of New York.  And I hope nothing bad happened to him.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  His last words, if you can't hear me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Gina Trevani, we shouldn't mock him.  Gina Trevani, she's the author of The Complete Guide to Google Wave,  TheCompleteWaveGuide.com.  Also blogs at a must read blog at SmarterWare.org.  And Think Tank is her project that she's working on.  It's been part of the federal government's plans to get feedback from real people.  It's a Twitter analyzer.  Is that going to be public at some point?  What's the?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And Facebook.  The code is available to download.  It's a self-hosted tool, right?  Kind of like WordPress is.  But we're hoping, like WordPress, to at some point kind of make a,  way down the road, make a hosted version available.  But if you're a nerd, you can download the code and install it on your server.  And the installer is on its way.  The installer is three step installer.  It's looking really good.  I'm going to merge it into the main code base soon.  So it's going to be easy to install.  It worked for me.

Transcript:  Oh no, but I'm running your instance.  That's why it worked so well for me.  It's nice if you can run it off Gina's server.  But only some of us get that privilege.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You got good test data, Leo.  You know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
