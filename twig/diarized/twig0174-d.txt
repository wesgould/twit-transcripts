Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina deserves all the kudos. Gina did a spectacular job and did heavier lifting than I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you did as well. Am I wrong?  Yeah, we both did. You both did. We shared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As is our want. In our kumbaya culture of Twig, we shared the Gina suggestion. We shared the hosting of the planet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ah. Jeff. I'm a collaborator.  That's good. I like it. Did you use Git to keep track of the notes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that would have been cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, a little code sharing. Gina is at SmarterWear.org. That's where she blogs.  She's also the author of Think Up and founding editor at Lifehacker. Jeff is, of course, a blogger at BuzzMachine.com.  The author of Public Parts and a professor of journalism at the City University of New York.  We have Aaron Newcomb, who by day is a slave at Oracle, but is also the host of a great open source podcast.  That's the best open source show. No, that's something else.  That darn open source show. The open source show. The source show.  That's pretty close. I'm working on it. Nice to have you back.  Thank you. You were in here earlier for TNT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess this is my Twit day. I was here for Floss Weekly this morning.  That's right. Wednesdays, Floss Weekly.  Yeah. Then I stuck around for TNT and I was just about to leave.  And didn't Chad grab you?  Yes. He got the big book. He was like, oh.  Aaron came from Sun.  I said, absolutely, I'll stay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you see our interview with Jonathan Schwartz?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no, I missed it.  He's great.  I think that was good. He actually is really good. He gets a lot of flack.  But if you've actually talked to him or if you know him, he's actually really, really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We always liked it when he was CEO of Oracle because he was always outspoken and said stuff.  In fact, the way he left Oracle was a haiku on Twitter.  Yeah, exactly.  It was very funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly.  Did you talk about the patent stuff a little bit?  He's great.  It's pretty interesting. Was that on triangulation?  Yeah.  Oh, so yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go back a couple of episodes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go check it out if you missed it because I bet that was really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's a good talker, a very smart guy.  And I think he did the best he could to keep Sun afloat given he talked a lot about what happened at Sun  and why ultimately they had to sell and how hard they worked to find the right buyer and so forth.  So yeah, that was fun.  Anyway, is Java your big stuff or what do you work on there at the Oracle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mostly storage.  Storage.  Yep. Storage for the cloud, storage for virtual environments, big data, things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ZFS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep, ZFS.  That's still around?  It is still around, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you came in on Flawless Weekly and talked about ZFS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was my first appearance I think on the Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The file system that goes with, well, does it go with any?  It goes with Solaris.  Does it still? I mean is there even a Solaris anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, absolutely. In fact...  Open Solaris.  Well, no, there's actually Solaris is still being developed quite heavily.  And Spark is still around. We just had a big Spark anniversary down at the Computer History Museum which was really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's neat. That's the original workstation from Sun. Not the original, but that's a workstation from Sun, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a server now. It started out as a workstation and of course all the old guys were there.  Oh yeah, I call them the old guys, about the same age probably.  Talking about...  The old guys now.  Yeah, the old guys now. But Bill Joy and all those folks talking about the development of the Spark platform. It was really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really like ZFS. It's a very modern file system as opposed to the ones that we are saddled with on both Windows and Macintosh and to a lesser degree on Linux.  I would love to see it more widespread. For a while didn't Apple say they were going to do ZFS and then they backed down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They did and then they backed out. I don't know what happened there, but you can still run it on BSD if you're interested. I'm running it right now on FreeBSD. I just set up a FreeBSD system at home.  Is that what you're running on this Mac?  I am not. This is Ubuntu for the time being. But I actually switched from Ubuntu server at home to FreeBSD just to try it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think BSD is in many ways a true Unix. It's really...  It is. It's a little bit more similar to a Unix system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Deserves more attention.  Anyway, we digress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We do because this show is about Google. But I like a little geek talk thrown in on the side there.  So I guess we should probably start with a changelog since I'm sure there's all sorts of exciting new developments in Google land.  Ladies and gentlemen...  Plus we like trumpets.  We give you the trumpets.  Now Gina Trafani with the latest features from Google.  The biggest change this week is that Google Tuesday announced that you can insert Google Drive files into your Gmail up to 10 gigabytes.  Yeah!

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, which is a lot. It's just very large files.  So in your Google Drive files, you can insert a lot of things.  I wonder how this impacts the file sharing services like our sponsors Share File.  Yeah, because I mean, 10 gigabytes is pretty darn big.  Throwing files away.  Yeah, which is a lot.  So in your Gmail Compose window, in the attachment area where you'd attach a file, there's a new button that says insert files using Drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you can send giant files. So they're really pushing on Drive, wanting you to store big files and share them through Gmail now.  So that's our sponsor Share File.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, because I mean, 10 gigabytes is pretty darn big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Throwing down the gauntlet for sure.  For sure.  Free.  Free. Exactly. Exactly.  We talked last week, I think, about how the Jelly Bean update, the new version of Jelly Bean, had a little bug in it where the month of December was missing in the People app.  So if you went to the People app and you tried to enter a date, there just wasn't a December.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  November, January.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  November to January.  Google is returning the month of December to Jelly Bean and a 4.2.1 over the air update.  I just got mine on the Nexus 7 and I believe it's coming to the other Nexus devices, which also got that Jelly Bean update.  Have you guys gotten this update?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I probably have. I haven't looked at my Nexus 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I haven't gotten a Nexus 7 or my brand new, thanks to you, I opened it, Nexus 4.  But wait a minute, does the 4 have the same problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, this is all the devices that have the Jelly Bean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute. So how would that be? So I hear as my Galaxy Note 2, this is running Jelly Bean.  Oh, I did get an update from Samsung recently.  Is it the 4.1 Jelly Bean or the 4.2 Jelly Bean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because there's two Jelly Beans. There's 4.1 and 4.2.  And it's only the 4.2 that's the problem?  Right. And the 4.2 is on Nexus 7, the Galaxy Nexus, the Nexus 10, the Nexus 4.  So I mean, truthfully, not a lot of devices had the new Jelly Bean, so they didn't have this problem.  But it was kind of a funny...  That's a great headline.  I thought it was more funny in comparison.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Taking a page from Apple's book, Google downgrades and removes features, taking December out of Jelly Bean.  Scrooge!  Now you're a programmer, that's a weird bug. Why would that happen?  Is somebody writing an array and just leave it out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I cannot, I honestly cannot imagine how that would happen.  I mean, normally you would iterate through a list of months, you know, kind of a pre-populated list of months.  I mean, you're generally not going to have a programmer typing out the months, right? And like forget December.  But that's what hap... it must be what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, there must be a line of code somewhere.  There's an array, January, February.  Someone put a comment in front of a line of code that they shouldn't have and then it goes December.  Maybe they commented December out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what it is.  Maybe they said zero to 11 instead of... or zero to 10 instead of zero to 11.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would make sense. That would make sense. It's the 12th month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, the 12th month. They might have just forgotten that last month.  So that update is going out. And I just confirmed on my Nexus 7 that December is now back in the People app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That makes perfect sense.  Because you don't hard code the names of the month in, but you might hard code... but you would hard code how many months there are.  But who's checking this stuff?  Well, you'd think that would have been caught.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's fascinating that their test suite didn't catch this, that their QA...  I mean, you know, this is a really big bug, so it's kind of funny that it got out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here's what the actual changelog says, according to Biggity Bong in the chat room.  Quote, revert number picker should adjust min and max when displayed values are set, AKA Santa is back.  It was a number picker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Min and max, yeah. That sounds like somebody cut the array off one month too soon.  The classification of everything continues apace. This time it's in Google Play.  Google Play reviews now when you leave a review on the Google Play Store, it prompts you to use your Google Plus account and use your full name.  And your prior reviews will just be from a Google user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the new reviews will now have your picture next to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. So your picture and your full name go next to your Google Play Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think that's a bad thing. I know some people said...  I agree.  We should be able to pan things anonymously, but I think that having your picture and name really makes you on the spot, to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  As a developer, I'm thrilled.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, exactly. It's really good for developers.  No more drive-by trolls reviews.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, I can contact someone. I'll know who they are, at least.  That's true. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ooh, that could be bad. See, now there's the other side of it, though.  So let's say you've got a piece of junk software, you write a bad review, and the developer harasses you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, not harasses. I would just let you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not saying you would do that, but some crazed developer...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina's even kind of might. But Gina certainly would not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. So, no, I'm not accusing you of doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I understand. Yeah, no, I totally understand. I think it's a good thing.  Look, if you're going to post in public something about something, especially if it's a strong opinion,  I like the idea of kind of owning your words and at least giving the developer...  The Play Store has some other tools for developers to respond to reviews, but I think generally it's a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Just don't ever give a bad review of a John McAfee software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google Maps is now giving out profile badges to helpful community members.  There's that Map Maker tool that let people report errors in Google Maps.  Google Maps just announced that they're going to set up kind of a reward system.  So the people who get the most edits get kind of badges to show off that they've contributed back to the...  That's so cool.  Which is cool. I want to see more of this. I want to see more of this sort of gamifying,  contributing back to the system and making it better kind of for everyone.  And we talked about this a little bit last week when we talked about Ingress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And so I'm looking in here in my area, there are a number of things that have closed or gone away.  And so people will fix that, you know, establish working hours added, phone deleted, address changed, geometry changed.  So now you'll get a little... Can you use that on your Google Plus profile?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wonder where this shows up. It must show up on your... Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You get like a special little Map Maker badge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It really is kind of Eagle Scout-y, isn't it?  I like it.  It is.  I like it too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It would be great if this showed up on your Google Plus profile. At the very least it shows up to the other Map Makers.  Neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  After Sandy, I wanted to get our neighbors together because we actually came together to do a group buy of a whole house generators, among other things.  And so I used the new service nextdoor.com, which sounds neat because you can delineate what your neighborhood is.  But then they yelled at me and said my neighborhood wasn't big enough.  And the next thing that happened was that they had all kinds of addresses. This is a 40 year old development.  They didn't have the addresses in there. And what's amazing was they didn't have the structure to let us fix it.  We had to appeal on every address to get them to fix it, which just shows the different way to think.  If you're really in platform think, you make something and you realize people are going to make it better with you.  If you're like Microsoft, you say, no, no, no, no, we control that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I've used that service too nextdoor. And I thought the same thing.  I thought it should be really open for people. Some things were, but I agree.  I think it should have been. It could be a great service if you were allowed to go in and do some more things, but it is.  It's kind of tightly controlled. And I don't know whether that's because of privacy concerns or.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I think it's just the map data they had. And I said, listen, you know, these these addresses are on Google Maps.  Yeah. Hello. Yeah. But thinking that way.  And that's where Google just culturally shows the difference is that it is that it's opening up those opportunities to fix things.  And then it's rewarding people for doing it, which just shows a different attitude from my colleagues in media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those old timers in media know nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Off our lawn because it doesn't exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Last change like item, you can now edit sheets, Google Sheets on the go on your iPad, iOS device or Android device.  You can edit Google Docs, but Google Sheets, which is their Google Spreadsheets project product, are now editable as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Every time I think I hear that, I think you're going to get the stains out of them and then set them out to dry.  I know Google Sheets does hang out the sheets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can edit your sheets right on the line of your yard.  Well, if you're crazy like me and you have a holiday spreadsheet going, you can you know, yeah, but not for Gibbs for the meal for the meal.  Well, that's even worse, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jesus. Men you planning to the spreadsheet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw somebody who had a spreadsheet for for seeding plan at the wedding.  This is the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My mom makes a seven course fish dinner, which is a traditional kind of Sicilian Christmas Eve dinner, and she had it all in her head.  And getting older now, my sister and I kind of wanted to take over.  So last year we spent the whole like time sort of and my mom has like the whole schedule in her head to you know, like when you stuff the clams and when you, you know, shell the shrimp and all this stuff.  So we actually we made a Google spreadsheet.  So the Italian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I am.  I think that's so cool.  I just love that.  Man.  So it's in a spreadsheet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is.  It's a spreadsheet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought maybe you had done a Google poll.  Who's going to bring what?  I mean, there's a lot of applications for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He has to use his Google Maps and Street View for the dining room table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's an ad.  There's a Google ad in here for sure.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's all I got for the change log.  The change log is now complete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's just like TNT is bleeding over into the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm so jealous.  You got you got posters.  Gina has an intro and an outro.  We got posters for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't Jeff on the posters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I wasn't in the posters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think so.  How did you get left out?  It wasn't every hoes.  Even my dog is in the posters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know.  What do you think?  How that makes me feel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What posters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, the posters.  The posters.  From what's his name?  D Martin?  What is his name?  Let me see if I can find them.  Those are really nice.  Yeah, give me a chat room.  You got a link to the posters?  They're on Google+.  So we have a graphic artist who...  MD Talk.  MD Talk.  M-D-T-A-U-K.  Oh, that's a common name, it turns out.  Search Google Plus for that.  I didn't mean to get off on this.  No, I want to show Gina.  She hasn't seen her poster.  Martin Anderson is his name.  Let's see Martin.  I'm going to go look through his posters.  He's actually doing other people.  There's a Tic-Tee Bartolo.  Look at that.  Can you see that now, Chad?  Can you see my computer?  There we go.  There we go.  There's Tic-Tee Bartolo.  There's my dog.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's some guy named Javier, but nobody named Jeff Jarvis.  I'm sorry to say.  There's Scott Wilkinson.  How cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, these are great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These are great.  He just has some technique.  They look like they're almost like a silkscreen letterpress.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is it?  What is the technique?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Andrew Maine.  Is there a GIMP filter for this?  Yeah, maybe that's it.  Maybe he's just pushing a button.  I don't know.  I think he's pretty good actually.  Yeah, I do too.  Yeah, look at that.  That's him.  That's him, yeah.  Now, if I go far enough down, I didn't realize he was doing so many now.  This is somebody in our chat room.  And none for us.  But there is one with all of the Twitch hosts, except apparently Jeff Jarvis.  This is Alex Gumpel.  I thought that was good.  Our Flowmaster studio engineer looking sharp in his tuxedo.  He rented that once, but he's got a lot of mileage out of that.  Tony Wang, edit this out.  Ozzy's is very cute.  Yeah, I thought Ozzy's was great.  Anyway, thank you, Martin.  Yeah, thank you a lot, Martin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you could just throw one in.  He made him for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He'll throw one in for Jeff.  Wait a minute, let's get a good shot of Jeff.  He's not pink today.  Let's get a good shot of...  Okay, ready?  Freeze.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  Wait, wait, wait for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait for it.  And bam, there we go.  Bam, we got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, there we go.  So now Martin has got...  That was good.  That was good.  Martin has got it and he will be, I'm sure, soon offering that for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And there's a lot of...  I saw the comments on those.  A lot of people want to order them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to order them.  He's sending me the originals, the raws.  That's great.  The one of me...  Okay, actually, Jeff, I just want to point out that you not getting one isn't so bad.  It could look like that.  I look angry about something.  It says King Leo.  I don't know, Tony Soprano?  That's what just leaps to mind there.  Do I actually look like that?  Maybe that's just me.  Anyway, for those listening on audio, this is meaningless.  So nowhere in here is a Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if Gina's in there either.  I don't see a Gina or a Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  Father Robert Ballas are looking a lot like Cy.  Yeah, that's what I was thinking too.  That's Robert Gangnam style.  What is that style?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's our producer, Chad Johnson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OMG, Chad.  What is that style?  Is there a name for that?  I mean, it's like vector-based cell shading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what it is.  Vector-based cell shading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what it is.  I don't know if that's a real thing or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Friction stir welding, actually.  It's friction stir welding.  It's a very, very good technique used for many of the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Martin, of course, poor Martin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now that I've used him on Twitter, he says,  I guess I should add Jeff and Gina to this.  Yeah.  I'm not saying anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a thing he's done for free for all of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's done it a lot of people.  So thank you, Martin.  That's a great one, I'll tell you.  I'm sorry you're asking this poor guy.  He does really good work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love these.  He's going to send me the originals.  I'm getting them printed out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Martin, help us on Twitter.  What is the technique called?  What's the button you push?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still have the flash on.  He'll respond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He'll respond.  He'll respond.  He'll respond.  He'll respond.  He'll respond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The problem with having a conversation with Twitter is it's not instantaneous.  Let's move on.  We're going to take a break, come back and talk about an interesting article about Google  and Apple and why...  Well, Apple's big problem.  Google is getting better at design faster than Apple is getting better at the internet.  And the solution, according to Patrick Gibson, by Twitter, we'll talk about it in just a second,  but first a word from Squarespace, the secret behind exceptional websites.  The new Squarespace is here and man is it fantabulous.  Everything you need to create an exceptional website.  It's hosting plus the best software, the best hosting too.  Squarespace hosting never goes down.  If you've got a Squarespace site, you could throw people at it.  They've got some magic sauce that when their bandwidth is needed, it's there.  And so it's just really beautifully done.  And then the software is absolutely the best content management software out there.  Everything you want, including something very modern.  They call it mobile responsive design.  You don't have a mobile site that's different from your desktop.  You have one site that works great no matter what platform.  Everything from a 27-inch screen to a 3.5-inch iPhone 3GS.  It looks fabulous.  And that's what Squarespace does so well.  What's good about this is you get to use the designer templates.  You get to customize it.  They handle the back end so it automatically scales.  For instance, when you upload an image to a blog post or a portfolio,  it automatically makes seven thumbnails, one of each size,  so it can choose the right image to display  depending on the screen capabilities of the device looking at it.  This stuff is very, very cool.  It integrates Twitter, Flickr, LinkedIn, Facebook, everything.  So you can make this a live site for yourself.  It'd be great for a basic personal homepage, a blog.  But also if you're a photographer or an artist, this is the greatest.  Look at the templates.  They've got some great portfolio templates.  And you could try this right now for free for 14 days.  You don't need a credit card.  Just name your site, give it a password,  and you've got the run of the place for 14 days.  Now what's nice about that is you can really see how it looks.  They've got importers for TypePad, WordPress, Blogger.  They just, all the stuff goes in, including all the images, all the links,  all the comments.  Everything's preserved so you can try something.  See how it looks.  And then if it looks good, like look, this is Qbert.  I like this.  This is a Pinterest-y style portfolio site.  Sophisticated portfolio template with a masonry style.  That's what they call that, the masonry style layout.  Designers and photographers choose it for its contemporary style.  Anyway, so try it.  And by the way, you could try every single template.  It's just a click of the button.  Remember CSS, Zen Garden, and how the content never changed,  but the templates would change and it would just be completely looking.  That's what they're doing here with CSS, HTML5, JavaScript.  You don't have to know that stuff.  It does it automatically.  Although, I should point out because we have a sophisticated audience,  if you do know it, they've got a code editor that does automatic syntax, color.  I mean, they've got all the features for a JavaScript, CSS programmer to get involved with.  Once you decide, yeah, this is for me,  check out the prices.  This is where it really goes. It's just crazy.  This is for hosting plus the software plus everything.  Always up to date, always secure because they're maintaining the code for you.  The standard is $8 a month when you buy an annual plan,  but the one you should look at is the unlimited plan.  When you buy a year's worth, and you can buy more and save even more,  $16 a month for unlimited galleries, unlimited pages, unlimited bandwidth.  So even if suddenly your site is mentioned on the Super Bowl and a million people hit it,  no problem, unlimited bandwidth won't cost you a penny.  Unlimited storage, unlimited, I mean, this is so great.  When you buy an annual plan, they also will give free domain registration.  You get a custom domain, link it up, do all that stuff too.  I just think Squarespace is so cool.  I want you to try it.  Do remember if you decide to buy that we've got a deal,  Twig 11 is the offer code.  So you don't need that just to try it.  But when you decide to buy, there'll be an offer code on that page, TWIG11.  We'll get you 10% off that first purchase.  Make it a year's purchase, you'll save even more.  Twig 11, the offer code, squarespace.com.  Did you guys read this?  Now, this is old, so did you talk about this last week?  Patrick Gibson's blog.  He says the problem, Google is getting better at design.  In other words, Google, traditionally Google were the engineers.  They understood the web and Apple was the design geniuses.  They understood product and there was a difference.  But the problem, according to this blog post,  Google is getting better at design faster,  and that's obvious, that Apple is getting at web services.  And he uses some examples.  Apple still can't update its online store without taking it offline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Web objects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's the problem.  Oh, I thought that was shtick.  I didn't think it was technical reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's because their framework, web objects,  which Apple relies on, is 20 years old.  Wow.  Gina, you knew it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, also the iTunes, like the developer portal for iTunes Connect,  which is where you update, same thing.  Horrible.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember when Game Center was down because everybody was playing?  Letterpress.  Yeah.  Brought Game Center down.  One game.  He says, I love this,  iMessage for Mac lives in an alternate dimension  in which time has no ordered sequence.  Because these messages come in just randomly.  Everything Apple does which involves the Internet is a mess, says Patrick.  And Patrick used to work at Apple,  so I think he kind of has an insider's perspective.  Except for Safari, which is awesome.  WebKit is awesome.  Meanwhile, Google has been steadily improving its entire platform.  And I think everybody will agree with Jelly Bean, especially with 4.2.  Yes.  Google's, I mean, for all intents and purposes, caught up.  It's smooth, it's elegant, it's simple.  Yeah, I mean, I'm happy to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We didn't talk about this before, and it's true.  I agree that Apple's sort of a mess when it comes to web services.  And I do agree that Google's getting better at design.  But my one thing...  They're still not Apple.  Oh, they're not Apple.  And the problem that Google has, and I criticize because I love,  and the more I use the new Android 4.2, the more I'm convinced,  it's just settings overload.  The two different shades.  I mean, I went to go take a picture of my daughter with the Galaxy Nexus,  and I hadn't taken a picture with it.  I've been using the iPhone because the camera is just so fast  and it's just better for babies.  But I grabbed the Galaxy Nexus, I went to go take a picture,  and I put my finger down on the kind of viewfinder,  and I was talking about this with Kevin, this like radial orb shows up.  And there's like the white balance and the flash,  and there's just all these crazy settings.  And my finger happened to move, and I missed the picture.  Like the picture was just this kind of blur because my daughter had spit up  by the time I had figured out that I had just adjusted the white balance.  But I was like, why? Why am I adjusting the white?  Like I'm trying to take a snap a photo of my daughter.  And I just worry that Google is stuffing like power user features into the iOS.  Like that photosphere and the sliding keyboard, really cool.  I love it.  I just question whether or not those should be in the core operating system.  And the window shade, the window shade thing, I'm not happy about.  The fact that there's two different window shades now.  There's like the user one and then there's the notifications one.  So I worry that Google is suffering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you, okay, so I don't have that yet.  So when I pull down from the top on 4.1, I get notifications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a single window shade, notifications.  They're awesome, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's two different things.  This one, the boxy one is going to pull down my Wi-Fi and stuff.  It will work. It will work right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I think Google is getting better at typography and color.  And that kind of thing and smoothness.  I don't think they're getting better at simplicity.  I think they're getting worse.  Kind of like Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was kind of like the Windows versus Mac thing.  Windows was always that way.  8,000 settings, four different ways to do any given thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. So I think this is a good post.  I just thought it was interesting that he, Patrick Gibson,  bullet pointed the ways that Apple isn't good at web services,  but didn't quite, but didn't bullet point all the ways that Google is like,  you know, is getting better at design.  I do agree that I think Google is getting better at design.  But again, I think it's more about look and feel and less about simplicity.  I feel like there's so many settings buttons everywhere.  And you see it in the web apps too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they did take the, for example,  developer options out of the settings menu in 4.2.  So, I mean, so, but I agree.  There are a lot of other things that that window shade thing drove.  My mom's like, where'd my settings go?  I don't know where my settings are anymore.  And I was like, oh yeah, you just have to pull down on this other part of the screen, mom.  And so I agree.  There are some things that they can clean up and those,  but I think those are iterative things.  I mean, I think that'll get better and better.  I think that they've shown that that they are paying more attention to design  and they're hiring designers.  I mean, they've hired a lot of, you know, top designers to work on user interface,  which they've never done in the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It seemed like remember the premise is not that Google is now better at design,  but they're getting better faster than Apple is making progress in on web services.  And what's going to be more important in the long run?  If you can, if you can have decent design and your web services work,  which is where Google is right now, he points out Google Now, which is just, it's the more I use it.  I'm in Australia.  It knows that I'm in Australia.  I'm so frustrated with Google Now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It won't, it's supposed to give you the weather every single time.  It doesn't give it to me.  It doesn't give me information.  Your Now is broken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your Now is broken.  I don't understand why your Now does not work because mine works great.  I get nothing.  And when, and for instance, there's a card on my Now that is, that came by default,  but I like it that said whenever a stock in your portfolio changes by more than 1%, flag it.  So Google is up 12, almost 13 bucks today.  So I see that.  That's what you want, right?  Here's my weather.  Here's my next appointment.  When the Niners play, I will see the Niners are going to play tomorrow.  Then after the game, I will see the scores.  Actually, during the game, I'll see this.  And this is mostly based on stuff I've searched on.  And then you can refine it.  There's a menu on all of them so that you can, I think this is a really good example.  I think the Google Voice has gotten better than faster than Siri, right?  Am I right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google Voice Search is fantastic.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It seems like Google's really trying to work on this, right?  I mean, they're actually calling people.  We talked about this on TNT this morning.  I think there's an article in The Thing about how to get Google's trying to find the un-Googleable.  They're actually calling people saying, well, what kind of things were you thinking about today?  What kind of things might you have searched for but didn't actually type into the search engine?  And so they're trying to broaden this out to capture more of this stuff and bring it into,  well, theoretically anyway, bring it into the mobile platform, bring it into Google now,  so that it can offer you more and more information that will be useful to you,  so that it keeps you locked into the Googleverse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is the point I've made in the show before, and it's now become fully true with me,  is that I've said in the show before that it's the services that led me to the hardware.  The hardware and the design are good enough to make me happy.  So I have not picked up my iPhone or my iPad.  Good enough. Good enough.  That's what the product really is saying is.  It's past, there's a critical mass point, it's past.  It's no longer so geeky you can't bear it.  The design has gotten so much better that I can now say this is pretty nice.  And the hardware is, you know, they're having some sense with hardware too, surprisingly, who would think?  So I'm now, you know, we'll talk about this a little later I guess, but I'm now fully in the Google world.  I'm my second Chromebook.  How's your Chromebook going?  It's great, in fact, because one thing Google is really, really bad at is running stores.  Radio Shack would do a better job running the store than Google.  So I went nuts.  It was like that time we were buying something, I forgot what it was, Leo, on the show, and we were all trying to buy it before.  So I couldn't get the 16 gig and I went nuts and I finally got the 8 gig.  And that's the Nexus 4 you're waving there.  Nexus 4, right.  And I debated whether to even open it in G and I said, how could you not open it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got a box there. Open it, you fool.  You know what? You can't get it now. You're good. You got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you can't. No, you can't. It's back up and see if you can get it.  A few weeks. You got to wait weeks, but you can get it now.  So but they couldn't even do that. They know it's on and off in minutes and gone.  And then the same for the Chromebook.  So all you could get in the Chromebook, which I had to go through, you know, all kinds of hoops to get the non wife, the non 3G version.  So I opened that, started using it, and then a friend wants it for his daughter because the 3G version, I think, arrived today with UPS at my home,  which I had ordered on Amazon ages ago.  And then suddenly out of nowhere, they said, it's going to be in December before you get this on the.  I got it. You can't get that. You can't get the Chromebook.  Now, having said all that, the report so far on this is that it works magnificently.  I mean, it's the Chromebook hardware is not the greatest.  We'll talk about some other advances in a second on that.  This trackpad is a little bit sluggish. It doesn't have a caps lock key and so on.  But the truth is that I am living 100 percent in Android and Chrome, and I have not had any need to do anything else.  The two times that I've almost fallen off the wagon were both stupid and wrong.  The first was was I was writing a piece for a German newspaper that wanted a character count, not a word count.  I couldn't get that in in Gmail.  And I should, of course, gone to Doc's instead. I thought I got to open up on a word.  Well, I was wrong. Doc's had it even better.  The second time today was I was trying to get a new book out of Columbia and NYU that's in the EPUB format into my damn kids.  My damn Kindle software. And I couldn't do it. I finally got that worked out.  But I thought I had to download an app outside of Chrome. I was wrong in both cases.  So so far, three weeks, I have been living purely inside Chrome and inside Android and been pleased as punch and had no reason, none to go outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're on Skype right now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the only the irony here is that this show is the only thing that's causing me to go out.  And Chad and I are going to do an experiment.  We're going to call him on Google. Google Talk. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. Let's do it right now.  Do you want to? Yeah, let's do it. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So are you set up, Jeff, to do that?  You probably can't use your mic and all that stuff.  Maybe you can. You can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let me walk through what Jeff is going to have to do.  You're going to have to add me to your chat contact list on your Gmail window.  And then we're going to start.  I'm going to start up the Google Talk within the browser.  It sounds like you've done this before. Yeah.  Not not on air, not on Twitter, just in general, just in general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, it's so it's true.  Now you can't get it anymore, unfortunately, because the Acer that they're selling now is not as well made.  It's cheaper. It's 200 bucks instead of 250 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a story coming out.  We might as well jump to it right now.  A story in the rundown that Google is reportedly working on its own branded Google hardware for the Chromebook with a touchscreen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although the Samsung, everybody agrees this is very nicely made, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's very nicely made. I like it quite a bit.  It's it's it's as light as an air fits in the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think you'd be as happy or maybe even happier if it were Android instead?  Part of my question is why does Google have to you said this, I think, Aaron, two OS's.  What's the point? Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was always keyboard, you know, that Chrome OS was keyboard and Android was for touchscreen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you can use Android with a keyboard as as a and many others have demonstrated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's the problem. File structure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a file system on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not very good. It's pretty crappy.  And I just went through today trying to get this EPUB thing in and it's real pain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so that's one. Second, is there a file system on Chrome OS? Is it exposed?  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, when you upload. Yeah.  If you if you put a camera card or at least on older versions, you put like say an SD card, you could open a file and browse folders.  Yeah. Right, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's pretty much it.  What am I getting here? You calling me? Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was that hit your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's supposed to hit your. I tell you the multitasking Jeff Jarvis is doing right now.  I know. Quite impressive. I'm very sorry.  Because as he's delivering a story, he's apparently setting up G-talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not. I'm not doing crap. And I'm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'll talk. I'll talk. You work.  China Times reports Google intends to launch Chrome OS netbooks with touch screens.  Now that I'm intrigued by.  Compal, which is in a Taiwan based manufacturer, talked or is tasked with the manufacturing, according to this report.  China Times. And it's not Acer. It's not Asus.  It's Google placing the order itself.  Internal components begin shipping to Compal this month,  which means the product itself will probably not ship, according to the China Times for 2013.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Chrome OS is not a touch operating system, though.  I mean, when you think about the way that the tap to zoom and gestures like none of that stuff is in there.  When you think about like maybe it's an Android notebook.  Yeah, I just I just don't feel like Chrome OS with a touch screen would make any sense because it just was never designed for a touch screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really want Android. That would be an ad. That would be now. Now we're talking.  Now we're cooking with gas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the thing about the about the Chromebook is when I've shown it to people, I've shown it to parents and parents go nuts for it.  In fact, in fact, Ms. Howell has one for her kid because her school is entirely Google Docs.  So parents of kids say this is the perfect first laptop for them, somewhat controllable, so on and so forth.  And then I showed it out on one of the media companies I work with.  And my first thought was, you know, local correspondents and reporters.  And then the head of the business came in and said, oh, hell, salespeople.  Jesus, 249. I want to get this for all my salespeople.  And and so it's it's it's again, it's a good enough thing.  It's credible to people. People aren't looking at this and saying, oh, that's a toy. Oh, it's nothing.  They're saying, yeah, I live in the browser. Yeah, 249. Yeah.  And I'm not even upset that Google make about with a new machine next year because the price is so reasonable.  Fine. I can buy eight of these for the price of a loaded MacBook Air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll buy a couple. I wonder if the acceptance is the netbook fact.  You know, there's a price factor and people will get by the, you know, a couple of months ago.  Oh, this was a mistake, as they did with netbooks.  Or if there really is genuinely something going, you think this is better made than the netbooks that you you saw this?  The Samsung? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it's still a bit plasticky. Yeah.  The screw, the cover can rub a little bit. As I say, the trackpad is is sluggish.  It's good for kids and dogs, but it starts up like that.  Yeah. And it's simple.  The beautiful thing is, so when I get a new machine tonight, right, I already wiped the old machine.  What did I do to wipe the old machine? I hit one button. It's wiped.  Yeah. Tonight I'm a machine. I'm going to put in two screens, put it in my language and password and then boom,  it is fully loaded with everything that I need.  It automatically downloads all of my Google Docs to the machine.  I use the Gmail app so I get all my my mail offline.  I mean, I've got to push some things. I got to try web video and things like that.  But it's just so incredibly easy.  I think it's also the ideal grandma machine henceforth.  Really? As opposed to, say, an iPad?  To install. There's nothing to do. Grandma, you use a browser? Yes, I do.  OK, grandma, here's a machine. That's all it does. Oh, thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What about photos? What about photos of the grandkids?  Right. Like Picasso Web.  But that right. So I'm thinking like my mother-in-law needs a new computer.  But photos is a big thing for her. So she would just have to upload everything to Picasso Web, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, or you would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or I would. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Chad thinks I have the Chromebook with me. He's been.  I don't have the Chromebook with me because I wiped it for the people I'm selling it to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I thought you liked it. You're selling it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because I got the higher end version.  Ah. So you don't have anything with you?  No, I don't have it with me. So I'm sorry, Chad.  No, no problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we're not going to do this then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We could have gone through the crisis. I also use the Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We could call you on Google Talk.  No, but there's no point. I want you to use it on the Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Yeah.  We'll try it by the next show. Next show you'll have a Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, let's schedule a time to test. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's no Ethernet port though, right, Jeff?  No.  Just wireless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, the weird thing is it has a HDMI port.  And it has two USB, one fast.  So you could hook it up to a big screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  So Padre SJ raises the specter.  And by the way, you know, I was on this crew, Sal Segoian, who works at Apple.  He's the Apple script guy and the Automator guy at Apple.  And he's a great guy. He's a lecturer.  And his nephew, I think, Chris Segoian, is a very outspoken security expert  who I think has raised Sal's consciousness.  And Padre SJ and Sal have both said the same thing,  which is the problem with cloud services is that enterprises are very nervous  that by putting your data in the cloud, you're essentially giving it to the government  or who knows, but the government at the very least  because of this precedent of search warrantless access to this data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And also it's an issue across borders.  So one of the stories that run down today is that Google is now allowing European  ventures to decree that their data shall be stored on a European server.  So a lot of people, even in Canada, Canadians can't stand the idea of their data being  on American servers because of our terrorism laws.  Yeah, exactly.  That's the basis of so much of the privacy talk out of both the EU and Canada  is American anti-terrorism and your data on Facebook and Google being here.  So Google just changed this today where European companies can say,  no, they won't know what country they're in,  but they'll know they're in the warm confines of the EU.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We should explain that Padre SJ's father, Robert Balliser,  who's the host of our Enterprise show this week in Enterprise Tech.  So Robert, he's in the chat room right now,  but Robert, when you talk to enterprises,  are enterprises leery of using third-party cloud services for this reason?  Because they're afraid that it in effect, I understand if you're in Canada,  but what if you're a US enterprise?  I guess he says the problematic precedent is the mega upload case  where the Department of Justice said, well, we didn't seize data,  we seized servers that happen to have data on it.  Therefore, we didn't need a search warrant for the user's data that was on mega upload.  So he says it means as an enterprise user,  I have to worry about every user on the servers that I share.  So if, in other words, if you're on a Google Docs server is subpoenaed by the DOJ  because of one bad actor on that server  and your data is on there, the DOJ's position is,  well, we got the server and we can look at anything that's on there.  That seems terrifying to big business, any business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's also compliance issues in general.  It may violate government regulations.  Right, right. I mean, it may or it may not, depending on how you define it,  but certainly companies that I talk to are worried mostly about compliance issues.  If you're a financial company, Citibank, something like that,  you're probably big enough to run your own cloud services inside your corporate network anyway.  And even if you wanted to go out, you probably couldn't  just because you would be worried about the compliance issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and that's what Chris Sagoyan was arguing, is that really,  if you're going to use the cloud, it should be your cloud.  You need to control those servers. You can't let some third party's cloud.  But I guess you could encrypt and then upload.  You could encrypt it.  It breaks a lot of the features, though, of some of these services  because they can't look into the data and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, not only that, but if you encrypt before you...  There are algorithms and things in the networking that compress the data, right?  Right.  So if you encrypt on your end...  It slows it down.  And then you can't compress it because all the numbers are jumbled up.  Right, it's random.  So you can't compress so it ruins your throughput, usually, up to the cloud.  So there's other issues as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting. I presume Google wants to address this,  that they're certainly making an outreach to enterprise.  I guess one way is to let companies have their servers in international localities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that a setting or do I have to call my Google representative to change that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. The story is in there.  I put together, oh, it was changed. I had a whole bunch of things together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here it is.  Google fights back.  A ZDNet story. Google Cloud lets customers park their data in Europe.  Jack Clark for CloudWatch.  Announced on Monday, along with a range of other improvements to the company's cloud services.  If you're using App Engine, Cloud Storage, Google Cloud SQL, and soon Google Compute Engine,  you can deploy your application's data and virtual machines to European data centers.  Customers will not be able to select where in Europe.  Just somewhere in Europe.  I guess if you're in the EU, you're in the EU, right?  Unless you're required by law to keep your data in the country that you are coming from.  Right, which is part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there's also the privacy stuff coming up is that one of the proposals is that  European's data must be held under EU standards anywhere in the world.  So one easy way to do that and firewall off the higher or difficult standards of Europe is to say,  OK, we're going to store European's data in Europe and we can do whatever we want elsewhere.  Very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's see what else is going on.  There's, according to Tom's hardware, a Nexus Chromebook for first quarter of next year.  Is that the same one that China Times?  That's the same one.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe the Nexus brand is going to be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google's hardware brand.  I think it is right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, by the way, the stupid thing, when I did open up the Nexus for my here's my confession.  Yeah.  I'm thinking, well, it doesn't feel quite the same, quite as good in the hand.  And I don't know what's going on.  There's a sharp edge here.  I know this whole thing about how they were plastic cover up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that was the top and the bottom off.  There were little tiny plastic slivers along the aluminum here on the side.  I didn't even know they were there.  This is so strange.  It's going to get dirty.  And I don't like that.  I'm stupid.  Now, finally, I messed it up.  And I said, oh, it's not broken.  That's the plastic.  Took it all off.  And it feels pretty good now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've been trying to get one.  And now it's now if you want the eight gigabyte version, it's eight to nine weeks in the Play  Store as I speak.  And the 16 gigabytes has four to five weeks.  So I know we were seeing seeing some people say, oh, no, it's available now.  We rushed over yesterday.  Supposedly was available now.  But I guess that's bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yesterday it was.  They sold out again.  Yeah, they had all kinds of trouble yesterday.  Yeah, by available, it was available to buy not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But nobody was able to buy it.  Well, no, we were able to purchase it.  You couldn't even purchase a place in order before.  So available means you can get it in four to five weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Tony already got one.  Tony's bought one.  Oh, he's already.  So I won't buy one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like it that they're taking a page from the Apple Book and they're selling a twenty  dollar bumper.  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're calling it.  I noticed that they're calling it the same thing that Apple called it.  Well, it's a it's a that's all profit, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a nickel worth of plastic right there.  Unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you've made it to supposedly be all so hand candy, then why would you put the rubber  bumper around?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It kind of makes me feel like they must have an antenna problem.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The problem is glass front and back.  So smart ass.  So, well, it's easier to break without the bumper.  Sold out.  Sold out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sold out.  Nine twenty bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like the look of that back, but I don't understand why they put a glass.  I don't either.  I mean, you already have a liability with the front being glass and then you add glass  to the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How could you be sold out of a piece of plastic?  I don't know.  I could call somebody in China right now and have a million of those ready by next week.  I swear to God.  That's kickstarted.  How could you be sold out?  That is, I don't understand.  I'm missing something.  This sounds a little bit like a marketing ploy.  How could you be sold out of a molded piece of plastic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because this is where they don't know how to take orders in advance and they don't know  how to do inventory.  There's a lot they don't know about retail.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like call somebody in China.  You know, just call Tim Cook and ask him.  Say, Tim, if you wanted to make a million bumpers by next week, what would you do?  They probably made 10 of them.  Not to be mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I feel like I'm being really critical of Google to show, but you know, between the Q and the  Chromebook, I mean, they've dealt with excess inventory.  They have not had the problem of being sold out really so far.  So, you know, they're getting there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're getting to the good part.  Sold out.  Well, I don't know.  I mean, I'm really happy with the Galaxy Note 2.  I am really, really happy with this.  So I don't feel too much of an urge.  What did you do in Australia?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you get a local...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I brought this.  I brought, you know, I wish I had.  And in fact, I found out later, I talked to a Telstra rep.  He said, oh, yeah, this works at sea for like miles.  I could have used it much of the trip.  But then we went to New Caledonia, which is part of the French protectorate or something.  And I don't know what I would have done there.  So I just I paid a lot of money for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Every time I think of New Caledonia, I think of McHale's Navy.  McHale's Navy. Everybody does.  Well, not our fellow hosts on this show.  Only us aged people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Our well-aged people.  We know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  On Wikipedia as fast as I can.  She doesn't even know what McHale's Navy is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No idea.  Captain Binghamton.  Aaron, help me out here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had this problem last time with Eugenia with Battlestar Galactica or with...  Come on, she's heard of that.  No, not Battlestar Galactica.  It was Buck Rogers and Twiggy.  I was saying, don't you remember Twiggy?  Because somebody was doing baby baby.  And I was like, oh, that's Twiggy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can see why you don't know this.  This ran from 1962 to 1966.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm like, Joel McHale? He does the suit. He's on Community.  No, no, no, no.  See?  Yeah, I wasn't born yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I saw reruns, but I never saw the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the idea was that the captain Binghamton, their boss, was stationed in New May and New Caledonia.  But that's because the entire United States fleet for the South Pacific was based there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That may be the worst detour I've ever caused on this show.  I love Joel McHale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you know that Fred Astaire introduced television audiences to the McHale character?  Did you know that? Because it was part of Alcoa Presents in 1962.  He was in a non-existent island, Taratupa.  Actually, that's a funny...there is a Google tie in there.  Because after I get back, there's a story that Google Maps has an island that doesn't exist in New Caledonia.  Apparently, we sailed right through it.  There's no island there.  And they can't quite figure out why.  All the maps have this island.  It's called Sandy Bar, Sandbar, something like that.  Doesn't exist.  I thought I was just there.  That's cool.  Yeah.  I didn't see it. I looked.  We did see a total eclipse. That is cool.  If you ever get to see a total eclipse.  In this day and age where everything could go on YouTube and watch a total eclipse, it's not the same, kids.  A total eclipse on the TV, on the YouTube, on the Twitter, it's not the same.  Because you're standing there, well, it's 6 a.m., almost 7 a.m.  You're standing there. It's getting a little dark.  And then all of a sudden, it was funny because there's so much power from the sun, even a sliver of the sun, it's still a daytime.  Then all of a sudden, it's like somebody turned the lights out.  It is actually kind of a creepy, like something's wrong feeling.  You can see why primitive peoples went crazy.  Somebody turned out the lights.  And you don't know if it's going to come back or not.  I mean, I knew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the same for us when the Internet goes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. That was another thing.  There's no Internet at sea.  Now there is, but it's very slow.  Might as well not be any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, sorry, doesn't it pay like 60 cents a minute or something?  Some ridiculous rate?  It's 25 cents a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't pay by the...  And the reason they charge you by the minute is because it's so damn slow that it takes an hour to get an email.  So they really got you.  It's fine. It was a very good experience for me.  But I'll tell you, you realize, and I think the Chromebook would have been pretty useless, that without Internet connectivity, even a normal computer kind of is reduced to useless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was predicted that you would say that, Leo. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But a cloud computer? Not so good.  So while I was down there, there was a case going on.  The Australian courts. Google was being sued in a libel case and lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The stupidity of governments and courts.  We're going to get to Germany in a minute again.  Shocking.  It's astounding, the lack of understanding of how this works and what this is.  They're holding that Google is responsible for anything bad that Google points to, which means that Google can point to nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Milo Rad Tricula is a music promoter.  He was... there is somewhere somebody put a website up that linked him with criminal figures in Melbourne.  He's never been involved in criminal activity, but he did get shot in a restaurant in 2004.  His lawyers wrote to Google in 2009 asking for the article, which included a number of images to be removed.  Google said, in line with our policies on content removal, you should contact the owners of the website because we can't remove it.  So he sued Google.  He sued Google.  Jury, jury, there's the problem.  Jury concluded the search engine was the publisher of the images of Tricula and related information.  And Google's defense was innocent dissemination.  How many times have I said that?  But it only...  I'm sorry.  I still have the mind of a 12-year-old. I'm sorry.  I'll stop before I disseminate.  Said that protected them only, that's right, only until they were put on notice that there was defamatory content.  At that point, the jury said you should have taken it down.  Now, this guy had already won a quarter of a million dollars against Yahoo, which did actually host the site, and Google had to pay $200,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I presume they will appeal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of stunning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It really is.  The idiocy is spreading all around.  And Google is constantly the bad guy in all this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, because they're the number one search engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wonder if they argued the cache that Google was hosting it because it was caching images.  I think they were sophisticated for them, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It worked more like this. I searched for his name and pictures of him showed up on the results.  So it's Google's fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You should have known that in an Australian accent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did, and I'm not going back.  Okay, thank you.  So now we fast forward to Germany.  Will you also find in the search what you're searching for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Leistungsschutzrecht is being read in the Bundestag tomorrow.  First reading.  By all accounts, it will go toward and become law.  This is the ancillary copyright that says that Google must pay publishers.  Google and others, unknown others, could be bloggers, have to pay.  There's no fair use, fair comment legislation on the books there.  And so for the privilege of sending someone traffic by quoting them and linking them, you're going to have to pay.  This is a horrible mashup of dying media companies.  And I know a lot of people who are doing this with government.  Now Google finally, finally, finally, finally decided to speak back.  And there's a video you may want to show with no sound necessarily on the shows what they're doing.  It's Defend Our Net.  Vertaigdige Deine Netze.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We can cut the music on this.  Cut the music.  This is showing people searching the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And in my post, I translate what it says at the end with only some reliability, of course, where they say, come on up, come on, come on post.  Why do I get these redirect messages out of sheets?  Very upsetting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You didn't hang them up properly.  Between the sheets.  My recommendation is a little bit of bleach.  I need some more starch.  And of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what we hear that somebody's business plan needs more starch in their sheets.  What a ten year, says Google.  Anytime you want, you can find what moves you.  A planned law will now change that.  Do you want that?  Take action.  Defend your net.  Continue to find what you seek.  And the petition, which they say I think I've gotten 25,000 signatures on.  But then a friend of mine in the German market said that this was actually a PR blunder on Google's behalf.  Because what the publishers are doing now and the lawmakers are doing now is that anybody who's against this stupid law is now, well, you're a Google friend.  That's a bad thing to be in Germany because Google is big and capitalistic and American and technological.  And I know all the Germans are going to come after me, get mad at me, but fine.  Prove it by getting rid of this stupid ass law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's because you're a Google friend, you little schticker.  Ich bin nicht Google.  Google friend.  What's wrong with being a Google friend, by the way?  Is friends fanboy? Is that the same as fanboy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It just means that you're like this big capitalistic American enterprise.  And I know people are going to get mad at me for saying this, but every time I go there, I get, well, Google makes too much money.  Google has too much power.  Google's to this.  Google's to that.  And this law is stupid and your publishers are taking you for a ride.  They're taking free speech for a ride.  They're taking the net for a ride.  They're going to devalue the link.  They're going to make Germany into a backwards of technological innovation because no technology company is going to want to develop there.  Damn it.  So if you think I'm wrong, fine.  Get this law defeated.  Tech people rise up.  That's not what's happening.  Yeah.  So Google trying to do nothing on this and on the ITU on both.  And this is really interesting to me that finally this week, Google is fighting back on a few fronts.  On calling alarm on the ITU, which we'll talk about in a second on the Leistung in Germany.  By the way, did you know that there was a reggae made of me saying that on this show?  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got to search for reggae Jeff.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We got to see this.  I want you to continue, but we got to see the reggae.  Stop the show.  Stop the show.  Everybody pause.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why reggae?  Here it is.  Reggae.  I got it.  I got it.  Let me find it here.  You tweeted it.  Reggae me.  This is YouTube.  Leistung.  Quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leistung.  Oh, skip the commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In three, two, one.  Now we're probably going to get pulled from the internet because of this, but go ahead.  YouTube blocked a show of ours.  Leistung.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Leistung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leistung.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Leistung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leistung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why reggae?  It actually works.  It really works.  It does work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leistung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This just came up today.  The pinkest reggae artist in the world.  Leistung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leistung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  October 6th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love the chat as the lights go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leistung.  I need a spleef.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Give me a bloodbath.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leistung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leistung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Done by a German.  Yes.  Yes.  Awesome.  What is Leistung?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stand by.  That's ancillary copyright law.  That's the law.  They don't even try to say it.  They just say LSR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's funny.  Okay.  Thank you.  Yeah.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's when you know you're internet famous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That beats a fake Twitter account.  Oh yeah.  Oh absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No doubt.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  So you got this thing going on.  It's spreading to France.  It's spreading elsewhere in the world, shall we say, where you have publishers saying,  hey, they're doing it in Germany.  Let's go after Google and stop them from linking to us.  Which of course any publisher can do today.  But they're trying to go and say, no, Google, link to us and pay us.  It's like cable must carry.  Now if every publisher left Google, Google's no worse off.  Google's news is nobody.  They've got other sources of news.  They'll be fine.  But the publishers will hurt themselves.  But worse, they're going to hurt the internet.  They're going to hurt the link.  Yeah.  And God, I want out of it.  Or else either that or I want a nice hit on some drugs.  It just seems obviously wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just amazing.  Yeah.  But it's spreading in quarters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't say, but it's spreading in quarters that surprise me.  And it's dangerous.  And it's the same with Google calling the alarm over the ITU.  They are now saying, watch out, your internet's at risk.  And yes, the ITU has to be.  We showed a video last week, Leo, of kind of what is the ITU.  The meeting is happening, I think, next week.  Actually this week, I think.  This week.  Governments, telephone companies.  The International Telecommunications Union.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And because it's a UN chartered group, people are saying,  watch out, the UN wants to take over the internet.  Actually, and Russia's been kind of pushing this among others.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  An email leaked with kind of a secret strategy for what to do here.  It's a step at a time.  No, out of this meeting, we won't lose the internet.  But it's a step at a time where our internet needs to be defended,  people, from these dangers.  And yeah, we don't want to raise the bat alarm, the bat signal,  every single time to the same level of alert and fear.  But if we ignore too many of these things,  then just one by one, it's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, I don't know if you, you probably didn't talk about this,  because Michael Geist, who is one of the really smart guys,  he's in Canada on this subject,  wrote an article in the Toronto Star that says the ITU meeting is,  actually, there is more at stake here than who's in charge of the internet.  It really is the issue of the European Union ISPs asking for a reframing  of how the internet works.  They want it, they're promoting something called sender pay.  This is something that's come up before,  and it's actually come up in the Google context.  I think it was, was it Verizon or AT&T who said,  you know, Google really ought to pay for all the internet bandwidth  that they're using.  Even though, of course, they already do pay.  They do pay.  Just as you pay for your access to the superhighway,  they pay for their access to the superhighway.  But what is happening is big ISPs, let's say Comcast, Verizon, AT&T,  would like Google to pay them for access to their customers.  And that's what sender pay is.  It's really double-dipping.  It's saying, yeah, you pay to get on the internet,  but if you want to talk to Leo, who's a Comcast user,  then you're going to have to pay us extra.  Otherwise, you're going to be on kind of a secondary channel.  Which is the essence of net neutrality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The essence.  Because you do have some net neutrality in the US of some sort  that's being challenged as well.  But in Europe, they basically don't.  And so the telecoms see an opportunity here.  So, right, so they may not, you know,  Russia may not take over the internet and change what can go over it.  But bit by bit, piece by piece, bits, if every bit is created equal,  and if any bit is detoured, stopped, tariffed, anything,  then no bit can be presumed to be free.  Right.  That's the essence of what makes the net the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this is against an open internet.  It's the European Telecommunications Network Operators Association,  or ETNO, they're 41 European telecoms,  and they want their members to receive, quote,  fair compensation for things like YouTube and Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't you love that word?  Fair.  The UK's been going after Google on of, you don't pay your fair taxes.  Well, we pay what's legal.  Well, yes, it's legal.  You're right, it's legal, but it's immoral.  You should pay more.  Fair is a word like creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, and it really, I don't think you should worry about Google or Netflix.  They can afford to pay.  I mean, they don't want to, but they can afford to.  What it really impinges on is companies like ours,  where we would like equal access to you so that you can listen to our audio  and watch our video and see our streaming.  And if we had to pay Comcast and AT&T and Verizon and Telstra and Orange  and everybody down the line for access to you, we'd be out of business.  So a free and open Internet promotes the kinds of stuff  you're listening to and watching right now.  That's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And on the tax end, too, if suddenly you had governments coming after you,  I mean, you should be so rich as to have them coming after you, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm not using the Irish sandwich or the...  Right.  The Dutch loop.  The Dutch loop or whatever, all these tricky little...  I'm not big enough to do that yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But nonetheless, at some point, someone may argue,  and I don't want this cat out of the bag,  that you're making money off people watching you in other countries,  ergo, you should pay these other countries money.  And the Internet just can't operate that way.  It's precious and it won't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Should there be some sort of regulatory body, though,  that's outside of all government purview that kind of oversees this country?  Well, that's what I wonder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Until recently, it was the U.S. Commerce Department, right?  Right.  Through ICANN and IANA before that.  But it was only governance in terms of domain names and IP addresses  and who gets what.  Do we need to govern the Internet?  And how would that be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, anyone can claim sovereignty over the Internet.  The Internet is not the Internet.  Period. Done. It cannot be.  I agree.  It's an architecture.  It's a free and distributed architecture that is protean and will change.  And if you try to lock it down and believe you know what it is,  then you're going to have that problem.  A lot of this talk is symbolic, right?  The China People's Daily...  In fact, I tried to send this link to you when you were on Twitter on Sunday,  was arguing that, in this ITU thing,  that because we in America control all these domains and things,  we control the Net and it's part of our propaganda war against the world.  So it's being painted that way.  But the truth is we don't control it either.  All we've done so far is do a surprisingly good job of protecting it from control.  And that's what our role has been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I can understand if you're another...  Now, of course, Russia and China want to control the Internet  in a way that actually keeps their people from seeing information.  I'm sure Egypt and others would like to do the same.  But I can also understand that Great Britain or France or Germany  or somebody that wants free Internet access,  worries about US control of the Internet.  I mean, we didn't invent...  The Internet, we invented TCPIP,  but Tim Berners-Lee, a Brit in Switzerland, invented the World Wide Web.  And this is a global phenomenon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's take the UK on for a moment.  Number one, people are getting arrested for jokes they make on Twitter there.  Number two, there's a huge 2,000-page report coming out tomorrow  that's going to argue, reportedly, the Levison Commission,  out of all the Murdoch sins, is going to argue to regulate the press.  Well, who's the press? We're all the press.  So you don't have a First Amendment there. You do here.  There's a preeminence of speech here.  I started reading a wonderful book, and I'm going to forget the title of it,  that does a...  It's a Canadian sociologist who's done field work with geeks in San Francisco,  and it's kind of wonderfully perfect.  And she... I'm trying to call it up here if I can get it fast enough.  But she talks about the competition of speech, coding freedom,  the ethics and aesthetics of hacking.  Gabriella Coleman, and it's wonderful so far.  But there's a war of speech versus copyright, of speech versus privacy,  of speech versus decency, of speech versus government control of things.  And the one thing about America is we've got a First Amendment.  And to me, that's a necessary protection for what the net is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree.  But I also am somewhat sympathetic of other countries who fear American hegemony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you just got brainwashed when you were out with those odds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I'm not impressed with how Australia or Germany or France  are handling the internet either.  So that's the problem. I think you need some basic engineering regulation.  And frankly, that's what the ITU is supposed to do,  the IEEE, which is some basic engineering regulations.  So you have an agreement about what an IP address is and how that works.  Stick with that. That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. I mean, that's kind of what I was talking about.  It seems like this shouldn't necessarily belong to any one government or anyone.  Certainly, governments have sovereignty. They can shut down things.  China does that, right?  But I think that there needs to be kind of a governing body or an agency  or an organization that protects the internet, right?  That puts forth standards and says, look, this is what it means,  and we're going to protect this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And should it be the United Nations?  But I don't know who else. There is no other multinational agency.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  Why does it have to be...  Backorder this. Build this from the end.  Is there any regulation besides ICANN? What regulation is needed?  What's the harm that comes if there isn't a body?  The internet is a protein beast that manages to work as long as we agree to TCPIP and DNS.  Right.  So what else do you need?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'm thinking there could be some things that come along.  If there's hackers or whatever, somebody's taking advantage of something,  there could be something that you want to put in there that says, look,  it's just like any other community, right?  I mean, you say, look, community members don't do these things to other community members.  I mean, and so I'm not saying that it should be regulated in that way,  but really it should be protected for everyone is kind of how I'm thinking of it.  And it doesn't even have to be an official international body.  I mean, why can't we set up something with memberships from all over,  people from all over the place that people agree have goodwill towards getting this done?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but here's the thing.  I don't, you know, I call in public parts, I call for a discussion of principles of what we're trying to protect in the net.  I think it's an important discussion to have.  I absolutely agree with everything you're saying in that sense.  But in the end of the day, I never want to have a constitutional convention of the net.  I never want to have a constitution of the net.  I don't want to have a legislature of the net.  I don't want laws of the net.  Because we don't need it.  Yeah, exactly.  And because once you have that, then someone has exerted control over the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The fact that the ITU has had control over the net.  This is not new.  So people are saying, oh, the ITU.  But they've always had the International Telecommunications Union.  They were formed in the 20s or maybe, no, 1890s to regulate the telegraph system.  They've always had some control.  That's an engineering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What control do they have over the net?  The internet.  Yeah.  What kind of control do they have over the internet today?  Telephone system, yes.  Telephone numbers, yes.  I think they control protocols.  Do they not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can is not.  Well, I can merely assigns numbers.  Assigns numbers, right.  I know many protocols are determined.  I don't know what the ITU's role is in the internet.  That's the ITU.  Part of the problem is that the ITU works in secret.  And it's heavily influenced by telecoms.  And so they're probably not the people you want to run the thing.  So for instance, who says the IEEE or the W3C should have domain over this?  Is it just by convention?  Other engineers go, OK, yeah, let this DCPI thing, this is good.  Let's do that.  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think a group of people say, hey, look, this is great, but we need to organize this somehow.  So let's develop this organization, whether it's, like you say, the VTC.  So maybe it is a grab, a power grab from the ITU.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is an attempt to grab indeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But again, one other story I read says that the ITUB and the UN body is a body of consensus.  That we have the European Commission.  So is WIPO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, the problem is that they're heavily influenced by big money incumbents.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we have to constantly try to throw light on them.  And no one's allowed into these rooms.  Ironically, Google is a big money incumbent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they're worried about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that was the argument that's being made in Germany right now, is that Google is haughty  and uppity and acting like it is the Internet and protecting the Internet.  And it's not the Internet.  Well, right, it's not.  I absolutely agree with that.  But show me somebody who's doing a better job of protecting it at this point from the  likes of you media in Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Three days ago, the European Parliament voted in favor of a strongly worded resolution that  calls upon member states to fight any expansion of international regulations of the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The US will also veto anything.  So there's no present danger.  There is an ongoing danger.  Right.  Just while we should be aware of it.  And we won't know what's happened behind the closed doors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The problem is, well, we'll see.  This December 3rd through 14th in Dubai.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That long?  Jesus, what do they have to talk about?  It's the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the World Conference on International Telecommunications.  I mean, you've got to you've got to have some agreement about how the phone system works.  And similarly, you have to have some agreement, I would presume, about how the border gateway  protocol works.  Right.  I mean, but maybe it's the engineers that do that.  But in an ad hoc way, it's not broken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, here's the other great thing about this.  We talked about this last week, Leo, that now Google is not only making phones, but  it's rumored to be in a deal with or talking about a deal with Dish to become a telephone  company.  Yeah, I don't know if I believe that.  But I want to believe it.  Definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But we know Dish is doing that.  They're creating an LTE based telephony to net telephony system.  We don't know if Google is being it's talking about being a provider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the only point at the end of the day is that is that the phone becomes the afterthought.  It's merely VoIP.  It's all VoIP.  Right.  So again, the reason the ITU becomes rather irrelevant.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So when is a one thing Google's not doing is buying ICOA wireless.  I was disappointed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wanted to buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a that was this.  This is the strangest.  So PRWeb, which is a press release service, you pay them thousands of dollars to distribute  your press release.  And Danny Sullivan has such a great article on Search Engine Land titled How PRWeb Helps  Distribute Crap Into Google and Other News Sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is a really good piece that made me feel like I never I don't trust any sort of clearly  republished news stories ever again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just I mean, he actually does some searches both on Google and on Bing.  He uses as an example a press release that comes out every month on PRWeb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've always thought the Google News was wrong to put press releases into the same feed as  news stories.  Now Google would argue that that if you don't have access to the press, your company, one  way you get a message out is by using press releases.  And they're labeled clearly press releases, aren't they?  They are.  But they kind of show me, you know, the argument is how savvy is the public and so on and so  forth.  In this case, it ends up on Google News.  People are going around, people passing around.  They're not necessarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But here's the interesting point.  It's not just Google News.  The Houston Chronicle.  Yeah.  Also publishes this press release in its business press releases section.  And then it becomes a news source in Google News.  And Danny shows us very clearly how this Viagra site, this drug site, gets its press releases  into Google News searches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So why is it?  Why?  How is?  Why is this getting reprinted?  Is PR web paying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, the Chronicle is apparently that that, you know, a newspaper site basically doesn't  have a business section anymore.  PR web comes along and says, you know, we've got all this stuff people can search for it.  It's there.  It's announcements from companies, you know, put it up.  And it's good for PR web or PR wire or any of these these companies because they want  distribution of the PR.  PR entity, you know, any old company that hires a PR person that writes a press release,  which is 99.9 percent of this, says we want audience for this.  The newspaper wants some content.  Yes, we clearly labeled it's labeled and it's just more stuff in a section.  That's all.  So there's no informator from the Houston Chronicle saying, oh, we've checked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it says press release.  Nevertheless, Google News then runs it because it's from the Chronicle.  I guess they could take it out.  They could say, well, we're not going to index the press release section.  So the whole point of this was a choice to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I like them early on.  And and they said it's just another source of information that's out there.  And, you know, companies in an ecosystem of information, legitimate companies are more  and more going to be expected.  I saw Craig Silverman was was was tweeting from some conference in the UK today about  about this kind of communication.  Companies are going to be more and more expected to put up reliable, timely, accessible information  about their stuff and what happens with them.  And, you know, press releases about things like stocks and that kind of stuff.  It's the way they get it out.  So, you know, as a journalist, I, of course, looked down my nose at press releases and  flax.  But if you just talk about information out there in the sphere, it's not necessarily  noxious.  It could be here's a product.  You know, we don't show all the time.  We want to see the original company's product release information or other stuff.  It's OK.  It's when somebody games the system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, in this case, it was stock market manipulators who wanted the stock of this company to go  up by the phony news that Google had just bought it for four hundred million dollars.  So they had incentive and they were willing to pay the thousand or two thousand bucks  to get this on to PR Web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The question is, can't you back up to that money source and go after the money?  I'm sure you could.  That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're PR was probably protecting them.  PR Web's response is that they follow an internal process designed to maintain the integrity  of the releases.  Even with safeguards, any theft occurs.  So they remove the fraudulent release.  But as Danny Sullivan points out, they apparently don't mind running this Viagra press release  monthly from this fake online drugstore.  So, you know, it's an interesting it really is interesting.  Now, in our chat room, TV's Egon says that you can fix this.  You can go to Google News and adjust the sources and take out a PR Newswire and PR Web and  any other PR source from your Google News.  Just just do it.  So I don't know how to do that.  Maybe he will tell us all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, maybe there's a way besides just doing the minus PR Web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I was going to say.  Just do the minus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's not permanent, right?  It's not permanent, though.  Adjust sources, just the frequency settings.  Is that where it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, but the fact is that people are none press releases right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Personalize Google News to reflect your taste in publishers.  You have blog.  There's only two categories you can turn off blogs and publishers on press releases.  Yeah. So I'm going to remove press releases now from my Google News sources.  Bada bing bada boom.  Is that is that blogs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those blogs can't trust them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can't trust them.  I don't want to see anything from a blog ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, they should have a Germany setting where you also don't have any publishers.  Then it's done.  No more lawsuits.  Let's see.  Any other stories before we go to our picks of the week?  There's lots of patent lawsuits.  Ignore.  Yeah.  That what's new.  You see everybody's using Twitter now.  FBI is using Twitter to look for securities fraud.  And President Obama tweeted today saying help put pressure on your congressman to solve this fiscal cliff.  I don't know.  I don't know if that's one of the opponents immediately bought the keyword.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They really bought the hashtag.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you see that article that Mike Elgin wrote?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Facebook, Facebook's of course in the news because they've changed their probably illegally.  I mean, the FTC and part of the FTC's judgment was that Facebook had to have an open process on its privacy policy.  That's when they instituted the voting and all that.  They said, we're not going to do voting anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because only 0.03% ever showed up.  And the rule was that they needed 30%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  300 million people.  300 million people.  Come on.  Most of them are fake anyway.  And dogs can't vote.  So yeah, understanding Facebook's monopoly.  Antitrust regulators says Mike Elgin are living in the past.  Here's why Facebook, this is in datamation, is technology's number one monopoly.  I didn't read it.  What is the thrust of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I haven't got through the whole thing yet, but I thought I got through the first page.  It was pretty interesting.  Basically what he's saying is he makes the case for why Facebook is a monopoly.  And it basically comes down to the fact that Facebook has a monopoly on users because the users are there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He says everybody's on Facebook because everybody's on Facebook.  That's Facebook's monopoly on everybody.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And he says in the past it's been for other reasons.  He goes in to document some of the IBM and Microsoft cases and why things were a monopoly in the past.  He says in this case, Facebook's a monopoly because even though there's equal types of mechanisms out on other social networks,  no one is going to go to those other social networks as long as Facebook.  Everybody hates Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He basically makes the point that everybody hates Facebook.  Everybody knows their privacy is being violated.  But he says when I suggest switching to a superior alternative, like I'm sure Mike is suggesting Google+, the response is always, what can you do?  We put up with Facebook.  I think he's got a good point.  It is a monopoly.  It's a de facto monopoly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a de facto monopoly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are many other choices, which is why it's not actually a monopoly.  And that's the issue.  And he may say this, and I agree with him, but the law is the law.  And you have to fit some legal standards before you can be declared a monopoly.  And I don't think that those legal standards have caught up with what's really going on.  I mean, there's Pinterest, there's Twitter, there's Google+, there's LinkedIn.  Those all have significant market share.  So maybe it's spiritually a monopoly, but I don't think it's legally a monopoly.  It makes a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, he says the highest purpose of antitrust and consumer protection laws is to, well, protect consumers.  Right.  And he makes the case for that.  It's basically what needs to happen here is that consumers could be hurt dramatically if Facebook were to do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're seeing that, though.  I mean, the FTC.  Now, the real question is, is the FTC going to stand up and say, hey, wait a minute, you have an agreement with us that you will allow?  That's what the FTC tends to do, yes.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The FTC says, it's really its best enforcement mechanism is we don't care what you promise, but if you promise it and fail at that promise, we're coming after you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Well, I hope they do.  That's pretty clear that, you know, on the other hand, you got to use Facebook because your family and friends are there.  He's right in that regard.  Yep.  You can't not use.  I try.  I quit.  I couldn't have to come back.  And so the answer, which I often give, and it's kind of flip of, hey, you don't like the Facebook privacy violations, don't use Facebook.  It's not a good answer.  It's like saying don't use don't use your credit card.  But you can't go after you just have to the FTC has to go after them and say, you got to improve your privacy issues.  They are starting an external advertising network like Google AdSense.  That will be interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This one will will obviously use the targeting opportunities it has out of Facebook.  Right.  Elsewhere.  But that's not terribly new itself.  Right.  I go to Amazon and I look for I don't know a Chromebook and then I go to sites elsewhere on the net.  It will show me laptops because it knows that.  So it's not terribly new.  I know we're going to hear a huge cry about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But and if and if you're Google, you should start to worry because Facebook has much better signals and Google does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, let's talk about that.  Do they do they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Google had your he's waving his nexus for for those of you listening.  Google has Android, which certainly is a signal generator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.  Google has your searches, which cares about what you care about more in life and things you're actually looking for.  Google has your maps and knows where you are.  Google has your Gmail email.  That's a big one.  Yeah.  If you started to add up that it would be really interesting story if you could start to estimate the data points, the value data points that were held by each company.  I don't know, Leo.  I think I might still bet that Google has more.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if I'm OK, so I'm just I'm a guy who's selling toothpaste and I want to buy ads.  I could go to Google, buy AdWords and they'd be on a lot of different sites or I could go to Facebook and Facebook would say to me, well, Leo, we could tell you age demographic.  We can make sure that a Facebook user when they visit these sites will get your ad.  Do you think that Facebook has better targeting or Google?  I think Facebook's got better targeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Facebook hasn't shown it on its own site much.  No, that's true.  The Facebook ads are terrible.  Yeah, that's what I was just going to say.  They don't have the expertise that they're going to export yet.  Now, you know, Google had to learn it, too.  But if you're if you're all I don't know, Dr. Zuckerberg, the dentist, Mark's father.  Yeah, you can argue you can advertise on Facebook and find people of a certain age in a certain geographic area.  That's true.  I think you can pretty much do that with Google, too.  And you can probably find people on Google who are looking up things like dentures.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  All right.  Well, both of them are valuable.  Yes.  Yes.  And both of them are going to annoy the hell out of the rest of us because our dentures.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK.  But how much irrelevance do you see now?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At least they'll be relevant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And they'll do it badly at first.  They'll they'll irritate people.  They won't be transparent enough and they'll be a human cry.  But at some point, they got to get better at it because otherwise it's not going to work.  If all it does is irritate you.  Well, I guess this is the more Park Sausages mom argument.  Another reference that's going to mean absolutely nothing.  And that even doesn't even mean anything to me.  Oh, then in the East Coast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This that I know.  That's a commercial.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And is she annoying?  Sausages mom.  This is horrible, horrible commercial.  Yes.  Where the kid would just shout it.  You wanted to slap this little bastard.  Yeah.  Sounds good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sounds good.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But anyway, the argument at the time was irritating advertising works.  Otherwise they wouldn't do it and it sells Park Sausages.  So, yes, I guess I'm wrong.  But I still think that when it comes down to trying to have a relationship with you of relevance and if all you do is irritate, then that's not going to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  More Park Sausages mom.  That?  Yes.  P-A-R-K-S. The Pleasinist Sausage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is annoying.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, what if it were Robert Scoble saying it in your chat in your browser?  That's going to be annoying.  More Park Sausages mom.  I think we have to condition people to say really this to say to like these things.  I don't mean we, me, but I think if I were advertisers, the goal here is to say, look, you could have random ads for hernia things that you don't need or you can have an ad for something you really care about like Park Sausages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  Which I think there are services that give you that choice.  Number one.  Number two, it's about compelling creative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you have to convince people that that's not creepy, that that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I agree.  You do.  And the way you do that, I think, and the industry has not done that, is by giving you transparency about what's being done, why it's being done, what benefit you get out of it, and some control over it.  The idea to say, hey, I'm kosher enough with the Park Sausages, you know, is an important control.  And by the way, only gives Park Sausages the benefit of not wasting its money on somebody who doesn't want to eat meat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And instead, companies like Microsoft are throwing fun around about Google saying you're going to get scrupled.  This is not helping.  Microsoft is just is even though Microsoft is in exactly the same business with Bing, exactly the same business with Bing.  They are there.  They're by throwing mud at Google.  They're they're ruining it for themselves.  I don't understand why they would do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think they're latching on to something that people have picked up on, you know, like, oh, I don't want to see all these Google Plus posts in my search results or whatever it happens to be.  And I think they're just latching on to that.  Say, oh, well, come over to Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but then people will go to Bing and the same thing happens.  They'll happen.  Except it's from Facebook instead of Google Plus.  And I don't see how they're doing anything differently at all.  Even, well, like even in.  You're going to get ads in both of them.  Yeah.  And and so what they're doing is they're doing the exact opposite of what I just said, which is educating people to the value of targeted ads versus saying, oh, it's creepy.  It's creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, this is not quite the same.  But but but I've noticed on on YouTube when I'm watching videos and I have the chance to what you know, skip after four seconds or whatever.  More often than not, I'm watching the darn ad.  I'm surprised myself.  There's really.  Yeah.  And, you know, a lot of them, by the way, are Google ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've been you've been beaten into submission.  I've been hypnotized.  Somebody sent me a link and maybe I can find it on my Twitter stream to a study on videos showing how impatient people are when they're watching video.  They don't wait more than a second or two and they'll click out of those ads.  If you've got a pre-roll, boom, they're gone.  It was actually very interesting.  But I don't know if I can find this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Conan O'Brien does that.  I don't know if you guys watch if you go to Conan O'Brien's website to watch anything that he does.  Boy, I mean, it's the same ad over and over and over in front of every three minute clip.  And it's just I don't understand how whoever runs his website hasn't gotten the feedback that this is awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because people really want to watch the Conan content.  They'll put up with that abuse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think no, I think I think it's no.  I actually think that the problem is that when the Web started, there were no frequency controls for ads.  Right. So you got that.  What it really means is a very bad media placement.  That advertiser is wasting a lot of money.  They don't want to be seen a hundred times.  The first they want a frequency control to be seen and no more times, probably just over the bar of irritating.  Yes, but not to the point of absurdity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, this has to do with quality as well.  Users are willing to wait for no more than two seconds for a video to start playing with each additional second, adding six percent to the abandonment rate.  I like that. The abandonment rate users with good broadband connectivity expect faster video load times are even more impatient.  Users who experience video freezing watch fewer minutes of the video than someone.  Well, that makes sense.  So this is actually doesn't have to do with advertising, but I would I think you could extrapolate it.  This is the first large scientific study of how people respond to poor video quality from Akamai and the University of Massachusetts Amherst.  Inferring causality using quasi experimental designs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's that science right there.  I wish I spoke science written in the science language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to take always. We don't need to take a break.  We're go right to your picks and tips of the week coming up in about seven minutes.  We're going to talk about a new picture sharing site on triangulation.  Our guest is was a tech crunch disrupt winner and we will be joining us.  What's the name of the site that I can't remember, but I'll what is it?  Never picks ever picks ever picks ever picks the founder of ever picks coming up.  Triangulation. Let's start with Gina's tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This one is courtesy of Chad. Thank you, Chad.  I was scrambling for a tip. You hooked me up.  Geek Matt Geek Matt dot blog spot dot com does a post on how you can bookmark direct links to your multiple Google accounts.  So you figured out that there's in the URL there's a there's a number that corresponds to the order in which you signed into your account.  So if you've got two Google accounts, I know Jeff does.  I know that a few of us probably do.  If you sign into your first one, your second one, there are direct links to your Gmail inbox to your calendar to your Google Drive,  which would you like, for example, Gmail's mail dot Google dot com slash mail slash you slash zero for your first user.  And then the second year's user at slash one for calendar.  It's off user equals zero off user equals one depending on the order.  This isn't translating very well over audio.  We'll have to put the link to this to this blog post somewhere.  This is really this is really useful if you just want to bookmark direct links to your drive or your Gmail inbox for multiple accounts.  The trick is you have to sign in the same in the same order every time you can go direct to it instead of switching in the user drop down.  So that's a geek Matt dot blog spot dot com.  You can get those get those links if you use multiple accounts, you add them to your bookmark bookmarks bar or or save them elsewhere.  That's kind of cool.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff has a number of the week, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually actually after doing this PR thing, I had somebody who was saying that there can be fewer nexuses sold than imagined.  But it's on this site that says it's NASDAQ, but it's all these people who just put up their own links.  I'm not going to do that one because we don't know how true it is about this.  Instead, I'm going to do one hour.  That's how long it took Martin Anderson to make a poster.  And thank you, Martin.  If you look at the right there, it's their opposed to a way you look at the right down in the chat.  There's a poster Martin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You rock and you roll.  That is awesome.  Wow.  Oh, there it is.  There it is.  Hey, that's pretty good.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis private parts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It pumps the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's a book is public parts, though.  That's OK.  I'll take the joke.  You should give that to Howard.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's working on mine right now, which I so appreciate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Martin, you are so cool.  That is beautiful.  It's a nice one.  That is great.  We can I got to talk to Martin.  He said he's going to send me the originals and a release form, which means we might be able to it be kind of release, which means we can use it.  Oh, so we might be able to like make postcards for everybody.  Yeah, we could have some sort of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they're vector images so you can blow them up huge.  I think we should put them on the side of the building.  Sure.  In every window, it'll look like we're a band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We are a band, a band of brothers and sisters.  Does anyway, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My days as a newspaper columnist.  Yeah.  The best thing to do is to be walking around town and you see your face on the side of a truck.  Feels good, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Feels good.  Good.  Actually, we wanted to put pictures of all the hosts in the lobby.  We've got 20.  What Lisa just told me 20.  How many is it?  Twenty four outside hosts.  How many outside hosts do we have?  Twenty eight.  Twenty eight outside hosts, four in-house hosts.  So we could put it regulars.  Twenty regulars.  We put 32 pictures in the lobby.  Just like the ice cream flavors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Thirty two flavors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we each ought to have a handle beneath us with a different flavor of yogurt.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's good.  You could just like soft serve.  Come over to our soft serve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to taste Jeff Jarvis flavor and then Leo flavor.  Yeah.  I think my flavor is sweaty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like sweat.  Flop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was about to say Gina would be mint.  She's mint.  Jeff tastes like public parts.  No, butternut.  Butternut.  Butternut.  Is that even a thing?  Butternut flavor.  Butternut flavor.  Yes.  And that sounds pink butternut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not going to do a tool.  I'm going to let Erin take the load here.  Erin, you've got a tool of the week for us.  I do.  It's called SmartWi-Fi Togler.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And I need to thank, this actually came from Lifehacker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw it this morning in Google+.  And I thought it was a really good tool.  I think it's a great tool.  I think it's a great tool.  I think it's a great tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's a great tool.  I think it's a great tool.  I think it's a great tool.  I think it's a great tool.  There are other tools that will do this, but this one's really simple and easy to use.  So SmartWi-Fi Togler, basically what it does is it will automatically learn your Wi-Fi hotspot  locations based on your network location.  So not your GPS location.  And the whole idea here is to only turn on your Wi-Fi when you are near a Wi-Fi spot  that you want to actually use.  So it won't actually try to connect to every Starbucks that you pass or every McDonald's  that you pass on the highway.  And so it does this automatically.  And there's just a few simple settings you go through to set this up.  And then it will automatically start learning which Wi-Fis you connect to, where they're  at.  And then there's some basic settings that you can turn on and off.  Like there's a disconnect timeout, for example.  So when I'm away from this Wi-Fi for more than X amount of time, then turn off my Wi-Fi.  And it'll do that automatically.  Similar thing with there's a trial timeout.  It'll tell how long it should keep Wi-Fi on when it suspects the presence of a nearby  hotspot.  So you can adjust that.  If it takes you longer to connect to your Wi-Fi at home, for example, you can adjust  that timing and all that.  So the theory would be it saves you power, saves you battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It saves you battery, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the fact that they did this without using the GPS sensor in your phone is really good  because that's another big battery drain right there.  So I don't know.  I'm going to try it out.  I just found this today thanks to Lifehacker.  And I'm going to try this out and report back and see how well it does.  But I think it's a nice little tool for people to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this is where Android developers have such an advantage because there's APIs and  access to all this stuff.  Whereas on the iPhone, I would be very shocked if there were API and access to this kind  of information because Apple really kind of keeps this locked down for security reasons,  ostensibly.  But that's the choice you make when you go to the Android platform versus the Apple  platform.  You get a little bit more interesting stuff.  Yep.  Thank you, Aaron.  Great to have you.  Yeah, thanks for having me on.  Aaron Newcomb at the Source, the source show.org.  The source show.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's better just to go to Google Plus and add me to your circles.  A lot of people have been doing that lately.  And that's where I really do all of my discussion about open source, Linux, Android, making  stuff, especially if Raspberry Pi comes up quite often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you a Raspberry Pyer?  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I've got to bring over my project once it's done.  It's a radio like the one, there wasn't one behind us.  But there's several radios from the 40s and 50s, little tabletop radios around.  I'm taking one of those, taking the guts out, putting Raspberry Pi in.  And when you turn it on, it plays old time radio shows automatically.  It just kind of streams them ongoing.  So you turn it on, you get something different every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And why is your Google Plus icon an A plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  When Google Plus first came out, there was like Google employees and others where the  Google Plus logo was like this.  And I thought, well, my name's Aaron.  I've got two A's in my name.  So I'll do A plus.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I've been following you all along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You noticed that the Google Plus Squib now has the world's tiniest little number in it,  in the tab.  In my Google Plus tab, it has the G Plus logo.  It now has the world's tiniest little number of how many updates you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where is that?  Really?  In the, you have the favicon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not the favicon, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The title.  Oh, right here.  Yeah, the hundred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Up in the favicon, up in the tab.  Right, right, right there.  Right, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's not the favicon.  Oh, what's that called?  That's just the window title.  So mine says a hundred because I think that's probably as high as it goes.  Right, right.  So it always says a hundred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's how many notifications you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, because I always have 99 plus, which would be a hundred.  Yep.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's similar to Gmail.  It's just like my inbox, 24,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wish it would just stop after 10 or 20,000.  Just say, you're never going to read that, just ignore it.  When I was in Australia, somebody brought over a Raspberry Pi project that was really cool.  They took the docking station from the phone.  What was the phone that docked?  Was it a Tiva?  The Atrix.  The Atrix phone.  So remember the Atrix phone, which is an Android phone from somebody, LG, somebody, which would  dock into a screen and a keyboard.  Instead of having the Atrix phone, they had a Raspberry Pi.  Oh, cool.  And they were running the OS and everything.  That's awesome.  It was really cool.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a little teeny tiny, if you look on my Google+, if you scroll down a little bit,  you'll see a little teeny tiny arcade cabinet that this guy made with the Raspberry Pi.  But it's only like six inches tall.  There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The main cabinet.  Yeah.  I mean, it's really, really small.  Six inches tall.  See, we have a big main cabinet.  Yeah.  I built one just like that.  It's running in a Mac Mini.  Yeah.  Yep.  Somebody brought that by, but this you could do with a Raspberry Pi and make it really  small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's so cute.  I thought that was awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the size of a cigarette lighter or two.  Wow.  That is really cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd like to show you my...  It has 128 by 32 OLED marquee along the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's crazy.  It really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, it's incredible what you can do now with this thing.  And it's only 35 bucks.  Go buy one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And there's a MAME emulator for it.  Wow.  All right.  Thank you, Aaron.  Thank you, Gina Trippani, SmarterWear.org, ThinkUp.com.  Anything else?  You want to talk about?  That's it.  To plug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  entity text, as always.  And the maker of ETA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maker of ETA.  ETA maker.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It was a big launch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  So recovering from that launch.  She's still living in the maker space.  She's in beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, she is in beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  We're all in beta, baby.  In beta for the next 20 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  Maybe longer.  Maybe longer.  Maybe longer.  Jeff Jarvis, you're the best.  Jeff Jarvis, you're the best.

Thank you, as always.  There it is.  Look at that lovely book.  There you go.  Available in better bookstores everywhere, on Amazon, and all that stuff.  We do this show 1pm Pacific, 4pm Eastern Time on twit.tv.  That is 2100 UTC every Wednesday, right after Security Now, right before Triangulation.  But you know, you don't have to watch live.  It's fun if you watch live, and we appreciate it.  And you can see the chat room is a great help to us.  So we'd love it if you're in there at irc.twit.tv.  But if you can't, you know, on-demand versions are as of all of our shows, in audio and video,  always available.  Best thing to do is subscribe in your favorite podcatcher, and that way you'll get it every  single week, automatically.  You won't have to even think about it.  That's at twit.tv.  Triangulation's coming up next.  Thanks everybody.  We'll see you next time.  Oh, oh, best of.  We've got to do the best of.  Is that what you wanted to mention?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we're coming up on the end of the year, and we want your input on what we should put  in the video that we like to throw together when we don't do shows during Christmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Christmas is Tuesday this year, so the day after Christmas, we're not going to want to  do it this week in Google.  So if you go to twit.tv slash best of, and you can, you know, just something you remember  from this year that you really liked, Jeff Jarvis doing reggae, that would be a good choice.  You should have been doing this all year.  Pick the show this week in Google.  If you know the episode number, it says required.  I think the episode number is, but everything else...  Oh, I don't think we should, because people don't necessarily know that.  I don't want that to slow people down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The hacks in your audience will put in 000.  Okay, they'll put some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah, just put in 0000 if you don't know it.  When did the show air again?  I know you're not...  And time code?  We're requiring time code?  What the hell?  Who put this up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could put in the middle or about at the end.  Okay.  You know, it says...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, this is a barrier to entry.  I have not...  I obviously have not vetted this.  Please put your answer in our colon minute, minute format.  What the hell?  All right.  You don't have to do that.  One of our engineers could do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Clearly an OCD...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a programmer made this, yeah.  Clearly an OCD programmer who didn't want to write the JavaScript code to validate it.  So, and then...  But just basically all we really need is for you to pick a show and say what happened.  And somebody will probably remember.  If you know the episode, that'd be great.  You do not have to put your name in there either.  Or your Twitter handle.  It's only if you...  I don't know why they did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe we're going to have credits at the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We want people to submit.  We don't want to scare them away.  Thank God they didn't put a CAPTCHA in there.  Oh, and please solve this puzzle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sign in with Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't have to do any of that.  Just whatever you know...  What's your clout score?  Whatever you got, just fill it in.  What's your clout score?  Oh yeah, you have to have a clout of 50 or more to submit.  Exactly.  Can we change all that stuff?  Just take that stuff back.  We should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The boss is back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, wow.  Put in a CAPTCHA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's make it hard.  I don't want robots submitting to the best of.  You must be a human to submit.  www.twit.tv  Pardon me.  Slash best of.  And please don't be discouraged.  That's just a Google Doc so we can easily fix that.  Pretty positive again.  Yeah.  Just put whatever you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the time you submit one, it will probably already be updated.  It'll be all fixed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you sure you want to close this tab?  Yes.  And I want to close this show.  Thank you for joining us.  We'll see you next time on Twig.
