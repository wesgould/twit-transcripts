Mike Elgin is sitting in. Nice to have you, Mike.  Glad to be here. I came all the way from over there.  Across the hall.  So glad to be here.  Also from his booklined study where...  Did you buy those books by the feet?  They're just props.  Okay.  It's a green screen.  Mr. Jeff Jarvis.  Somebody was saying, and I think this is true, that as we get to this digital world, books will become more and more precious.  In fact, books will never be as inexpensive as they are today. So buy, buy, buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right. I'm a big book collector.  I've had them in storage for a long time. It's really a great time to go to bookstores, buy old books.  Nice books. Look out for acid-free paper because they'll destroy them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you raise the exact point, which is I've got them in storage because it's not convenient to move them around.  No, it is not.  But it is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I went to the Strand Bookstore the other day and I was wondering what their business is like now. What's the used book business like now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I guess that's the point is that in fact, it's going to get very good because...  But there's less...  It's not a mass market anymore.  Oh, no. No, no.  But as a specialty market, it's going to be quite good. And I think that most...  I shouldn't say most people.  Many people, certainly the three of us, love books, right? So that's not going away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The reality is that almost everything being produced nowadays will be with us forever.  You'll be able to find Gutenberg the Geek in 300 years and just like search for it, download it and so on.  But before everything was being scanned and digitized, those copies are the only copies.  And my wife buys these books that are about food production, making wine and stuff at home.  And the content is amazing. This is lost information.  And there are also a lot of books in lost languages.  And the internet is sort of killing off lost languages as well.  So it's a great thing to collect not only from a collector's point of view, but also from a cultural preservation point of view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think that's kind of the point is that it's not really killing it off.  It's just as a mainstream interest, it is not huge.  But in fact, I think the internet makes it possible for us, those small few who care about these obscure books together to find them, to buy them.  I mean, in a way, it facilitates that as much as it's killing it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely. I mean, in the old days, if you had to go from bookstore to bookstore to bookstore asking questions, where do you have this book?  Now you can have a running search for, I don't know, Craigslist, eBay, whatever, for a very obscure title.  And you can wait for three years. I've done this. And then boom, it pops up and you buy it.  It's like it's a great. Let's not forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's how Amazon started was not only selling new books, but they quickly went into used books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep. So speaking of Amazon, I'm going to go to my closet for one second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll be right back. He's going into the closet, folks.  This is unprecedented.  Into and out of in one show.  He's probably going to get a book. He's going to have a cape when he comes back.  I'm thinking. But let's take a look at Jeff's office.  Well, oh, shoot, he's back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to. Yes, neither.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, we interviewed on triangulation on Monday.  We interviewed Michio Kaku and he has the most.  It's a typical. What do you expect?  A physicist's library would be with Professor Stacks.  He's at CUNY as well. Right, Jeff? Do you know Michio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, he is office. Oh, the other physics guy.  Dr. Kaku, the physics guy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  His books like worse than that.  I mean, like piled everywhere. Your office is a pristine wonderland compared to this.  But I could not help.  I could not resist looking at the spines, seeing what is he reading?  What is he reading? It's fascinating.  Spider-Man comics. Mostly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the stuff that gets me to this was like drinking game, folks, drinking game.  Gutenberg Gutenberg printed in 1476.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Jeff's now holding up.  You have a page from Gutenberg Press era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, Gutenberg era.  Fourteen seventy six out of Cologne.  That's so cool.  Somewhere there's a Conrad Vinters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somewhere there's a Gutenberg Bible with a page missing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what is it? A Bible? What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's this is a page from the.  Memo Trachis Superbiblium.  Oh, it's a super book.  So the movie.  Early commentary based on sacred scriptures, but it's it is sacred.  I wanted to have it for that reason.  I just wanted to have something that was this early.  Oh, absolutely. The printing press will be by the by the 600th birthday.  It'll be a museum piece printing press. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, today, this morning at 11, I got to just a couple of hours ago.  I got to interview the man who made that all possible.  Vint Cerf, who was one of the architects of the Internet,  the guy who with Bob Conn created TCPIP, he was at DARPA  in the earliest days of the Internet.  He then worked at MCI where he created MCI Mail,  one of the very early email implementations.  We talked a little bit about that.  Founded the Internet Society with Bob Conn, founded Ican  and was the chair of Ican for many years  as currently vice president and Internet evangelist at Google.  And it was just really great to talk to him.  And I had to say at the end, I teared up a little bit,  because at the end, it's like I had to say, I just want to thank you  because the work you and Bob and others did in those days,  not so long ago, 30, 40 years ago, literally changed the world.  And sometimes not.  Maybe books aren't as big as they used to be or whatever.  But it really did change the world.  He said one of the things that became very apparent to them, I said,  did you in the early days, did you envision what's happened now?  He said, he might.  He said the obvious try to answer be no.  But in fact, many of us, as we started to use this thing,  realized that it was it was not about technology or even computers.  It was about communication.  And that as we started linking up people, the power of what was about to happen  was very obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that's I think I think that's the key to it, Leo.  And we still in my business and our business, we still see the Internet  in media terms as content and as publications and pages and things like that.  And that's not what it's about at all.  It's a connection machine.  That's the that's the essential architecture of the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's what enables that interview will be out on a special.  And there's also it's already up on YouTube.  Yes, it will be instantly on YouTube because it was a YouTube Google Hangout.  You know, we've actually created a tweet Google Hangouts channel.  You finally got to me, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I can I can search.  Let's hang up, Chad. I'll go back to my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm surrounded by Google plus fanatics.  But that is a great technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of community, it really is. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Especially Hangouts on Air, if you think about what you can do with Hangouts  on Air and compare it to five years ago, what it would take to do a live global  broadcast in real time, capable of having an audience of hundreds of thousands  of people, you know, you'd need a truck and a license and a big van with the,  you know, the satellite dish.  I mean, it's like it's astonishing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Leo, if you started with today, what would your technology choices be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we're pretty much what we do now because we continually evolve  as technology improves.  When we started doing the screensavers in on tech TV in 1998,  even then we wanted to have video calls on the show.  We actually got three com to give us, I think, ten thousand  of those little ball cameras.  And we called it the it was then ZDTV NetCam Network.  I said they want to call them webcams.  This is not the web. You can't call it. It's a net cam.  You lost that one.  I've lost them all. Netcast, NetCam.  I can't win. But but I but I think strictly speaking, it isn't a webcam.  And then it was very such a primitive technology that we couldn't really get  audio and video.  So we'd say do the video and then be on the phone.  So all of our callers on the show were on a phone.  And then the video was one frame a second.  So you didn't lose lip sync because there was you could barely see their mouth move.  But it worked. And then so as that was what almost that was 12,  16 years ago, as the technologies advanced, we're using Skype now.  Are you on Hangouts or are you on Skype?  Skype, because I listen to you, boss.  Well, we'd like to get something better.  And, you know, we're always testing stuff.  The engineers are always in the basement.  That's what they tell me they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The biggest limitation with doing Google Plus is that if as a as a policy is that  you know, a lot of people that you can have on the show, you say, let's do a Hangout.  And then they're like, OK, so where is it?  The interface discoverability for new users of Hangouts is not great.  And Skype is, you know, everybody understands it at this point.  So that's the only thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that's a really, really good point, because it's it's so ingrained and built  into plus and mail and stuff.  But they almost should just make a Hangout thing just for people to get into it  and understand it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The future really is Web RTC.  And this is actually related to Hangouts.  And I suspect that in a year or two, that's what we'll be using.  And the the the neat thing about Web RTC, which Google has been supporting,  I don't know if they didn't create it, it's open, but I think that they've really  been the chief proponents of it, is that I could give you a website, a URL,  and you'd go to it and the communication would call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We did it on the show right after it was announced.  We did it. It was that easy.  It was that doable. Somebody wrote us an app for it.  That's the way it should be.  That is a webcam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a web.  Yeah, that's a web webcast.  Actually, it's not really using the web, just the web for the signal.  All right. All right.  But but but that I think is exciting because then any link can be a call.  You send people the link.  Yeah, it's done.  And remember, Kevin Marks has been talking a lot on the last couple of episodes  about Tantech Select and what he's doing to kind of create this,  you know, mobile page that allows you to just press a button and call somebody.  It should be easier. Yes.  You know, and so I think I think we're getting close to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But let's talk about struck last week when I was late for the show. Yeah.  And before we got on air, that was amazing.  See it. I got a call.  I got the call from from Chad and I was in the car and my phone is,  is, you know, installed on the dash and I hit answer.  And there I am driving the car and I'm hurrying, I'm hurrying.  But but it's it's that easy to be talking to somebody.  Well, that might boggling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is really.  At 1965, I remember going to the New York World's Fair in 18,  he showed his famous video phone on the future.  I remember 2001, the future, we'll all be seeing each other in focus.  And it didn't happen, didn't happen because we've everybody said, you know,  you don't want to see anybody in a phone call because we want to brush  their hair for a phone call.  And yet we see a lot of video calls all of a sudden.  Everybody's doing it all the time. We do it all the time.  Yeah, I think we've I think we've made Skype work for us.  Wouldn't have a network without Skype,  but there's going to be something to replace it soon, I hope.  Yesterday, 10 years ago,  boy, was that a revolution in Harry McCracken.  Great job on Time magazine's technologizer site.  The 10th anniversary of Gmail and he has the inside story with Paul Buchheit,  the architect and others from Google talking about it.  It was it was a near thing.  Almost didn't happen.  Folks at Google thought, well, we're really a search engine company.  I don't know about this email thing.  In fact, even when it launched,  you remember how hard it was to get an invite?  There were people I think Harry says in his article, he bought an invite on eBay.  There's a picture of Paul Buchheit when he was first at Google.  He was employee number 23 at Google,  then went off to start FriendFeed.  Who can forget?  Which I loved with three of the Google Gmail folks went and you and three other friends.  It was just me and my friends. That was FriendFeed.  I love FriendFeed.  Facebook bought it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then the rest is history.  Followed it, digested it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there was so little support at Google that even when they launched it,  it was running on, what did they say?  300 Pentium 2 computers that nobody else at Google wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's one of the things you learn when you learn about how Google works.  Everybody's jockeying for compute resources, and it's this big who gets what and where they move it around.  And Google historically has always made huge use of old and busted and lousy computers.  They don't care how broken down and busted the computers are because they're one of their early innovations  was to be able to use computers that fail with two digit percentages.  Right.  And so that was pretty interesting.  Fail over.  Actually it was Pentium 3 computers, I apologize.  Yeah.  But one of the interesting things about this is that of course, this launch on April Fool's Day,  they did it on purpose. This is something I didn't know.  Google did this on purpose and Larry and Sergey actually wanted to launch it on April Fool's  because they knew people would think it was a hoax and they thought this is like a double April Fool's joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sergey was the most excited about it, said Rakowski.  The ultimate April Fool's joke was to launch something kind of crazy on April 1st and have it still exist on April 2nd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the craziest thing about it was it was a gigabyte, a gigabyte of storage, which nowadays...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Even that wasn't automatic.  As Harry points out in his article, that was something like 300 times the amount of space Yahoo mail offered.  Yeah.  Yahoo mail existed, Hotmail existed. So it wasn't the first web-based email program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Those were the points Vint made about MCI mail, as soon as mail became interconnected,  charging for mail went out the window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, he's talked about that. I talked about that with him. He was in his old office at MCI  where he had invented MCI mail.  So that was kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had an MCI mail account, I remember that. That was pretty cool.  Oh, so did I.  So the other thing that was interesting about this is that everybody, when you tell the story of Gmail,  everybody says, oh, this is a 20% time project. And in fact, it wasn't.  This guy worked on it full-time for three years, more or less by himself. He got help here and there,  but it was essentially this single guy working on it. And he had this personal...  And again, this is a great story by Harry McCracken, who uncovers all this stuff very nicely,  but he has this obsession with making sure that whatever he's using is functional.  So after one day, he had a functional, essentially a search engine for email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He said that's the... He said, for him personally, but I think this is more than just Paul Buhay,  he said, I find I lose interest in a project if I can't use it right away.  So my first goal is to immediately make something I can use and then iterate on it to make it useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're so used to good search from Google that you have to pause and realize how much bad search is out there.  Even today...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  App... Just look for something on the App Store on Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Forget about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or, I mean, it's impossible.  Right.  I always think search has been solved.  Clearly not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But this is the great thing about Gmail and it's also the great thing about Google+,  which is everything on Google+, everything in Gmail is essentially a search.  When you look at your inbox, you're looking at a search result that is kind of set up for you by Google.  It's everything with certain attributes.  And that's how they go at these things.  And it's brilliant.  And this is one of the reasons why Google's products like Gmail are so good,  because they're rooted in search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and the key to that, Mike, is it was really revolutionary to think that you didn't kill your email.  Yeah.  Save it.  No, you want to keep your email because you can search it and you don't need to put it in all kinds of folders and stuff  because you can just search it.  And so it really took search out of just the web into your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As I remember, that was one of the selling points.  Don't delete any email.  Just save it all and we'll find it.  And that was a revelation.  Although now how much?  How is it?  Seven gigabytes, eight gigabytes you get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, now they combine it with Google Drive.  And so I have way over 100 gigabytes.  Oh, yeah, I have terrible.  I have one point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because we both have pixels.  16.9 gigabytes of one point or one terabytes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Another thing that Time notes, I should really give Harry credit,  Harry McCracken notes in the Time article, is this is probably for most of us the first time we ever used a web app.  Unlike Yahoo, Hotmail and other web pages, this was an interactive app.  In fact, really the debut of Ajax to the worldwide web.  Now, I said this on Sunday and somebody said, you know, Microsoft invented Ajax with ActiveX control.  I'm not talking about ActiveX control.  This is the first web app most of us use that you could use on a Windows machine, a Mac, on a Linux machine.  It would work if you had a good modern browser that it wouldn't rewrite the whole page when you open the compose window.  That was that was where Ajax came.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And of course, most users had no idea about that.  All they knew was that when you use Gmail, you know, 10 years ago, eight years ago,  went for since its beginning, lightning fast and just felt so good to use.  You know, everything you did was really zippy and it was really kind of thrilling to use.  And I think that most of most users assumed that it was because they had almost no interface.  It was all text and links with no typography.  Nowadays, Google is very good with the design.  In the early days, there was a spectacular absence of design of any kind.  And that was kind of nerdy for that reason.  But the performance was so good that everybody loved it.  Or not everybody, but, you know, nerdy types did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  McCracken quotes Buchheit saying the ambitious use of JavaScript is another thing most people thought was a pretty bad idea.  One of the problems we had was that web browsers weren't very good back then.  We were afraid we'd crash browsers and nobody would ever come back.  Just now, here's the here's the big story.  There were debates within Google whether it should be a paid service.  And Buchheit and others, according to McCracken, wanted the service to reach as many people as possible,  which was an argument for it being free and supported by advertising.  They wanted little unobtrusive text ads with Google search results.  He Rokowski says we weren't going to plaster it with banners.  We committed to that from pretty early on.  But the key was that the ads were keyed to the contents of your email.  And I was curious as to whether they knew what a explosive thing that would be.  Buchheit's, I'm sorry, Herrick says in this interview, I'm not sure who Herrick is, Harik.  We thought it pretty hard before doing what we did.  We thought, is this thing a perceived privacy violation or a real one?  And we decided it would be an issue of perception.  So they think they knew that there would be an issue.  But they also knew that it wasn't a privacy violation because it was just automated.  Boy, they underestimated the reaction of the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They underestimated the action of that.  But the funny thing is, and I've told this story before, when Priority Inbox came in,  because all they were doing and reading the email was giving you ads.  And the truth is, I don't know how much they make from that.  I mean, I don't even notice the ads on Gmail.  No, I don't see them.  Never kicked out one.  Priority Inbox makes some really critical decisions, obviously, understanding your email  and who's important to you.  And nobody mentions that because the value is so great.  Even in Germany, Google's own programming staff in Munich is a privacy programming staff.  And they've taken the brunt of everything about Street View and Buzz and all this stuff.  They said, nobody complains even in Germany about Priority Inbox because it's valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I disagree.  I think they don't complain because it's not to support advertising.  Everybody understands that if you have anti-spam filtering on your service, as everybody does,  mostly not as effective as Gmail.  But that means that something is reading your mail looking for keywords.  So people know that.  What they didn't like was that it was tied to advertising, Jeff.  I don't think it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well.  Well, yeah, yeah, OK.  I mean, I think that's a really good point in terms of how it ratchets it up.  I know, Leo, I also hear just this general complaint that Facebook knows too much.  Of course, everything you tell them.  They know everything, yeah.  They just know too much.  They're too big and they know too much.  So I hear that kind of generalized Eeyore-ish behavior a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think it's because it's tied to advertising.  I mean, spam filtering is a clear benefit where they...  So you just think it's not enough of a benefit.  The reason is because you'd look in your...  People who notice the ads, unlike you two who don't notice the ads,  just notice that you're having this conversation about snipe hunting.  And then you have an ad there for a snipe hunting rifle.  And it's like, oh my God, they're tuning into our conversation.  It's the creep factor.  And really, this goes back to search.  The way Google looks at it is that they have this huge advertising inventory  and then they use the content of your message as the search query  and they surface the most relevant search results within their ad inventory.  That's the way they look at it.  And they see that that's their job.  If they're going to serve up ads, they want to serve up the most relevant ads possible.  And it's a brilliant idea.  And it shouldn't freak us out.  And it no longer does, by the way.  We've all gotten used to it.  We've all gone on to be worried about much bigger things.  But it shouldn't freak us out because no human being is actually seeing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's another strategy for Mike that I think that these services could give us more value,  but they're scared of doing this.  I talked to a journalist the other day who was calling me about a story about privacy.  And he told me that he has MS.  And on Facebook, it's just private messages.  He was telling family, boy, I have these weird symptoms.  I don't know what's going on.  I can't feel my hands.  I can't do this.  I can't do that.  And then suddenly up came ads related to multiple sclerosis.  Basically diagnosed him.  Wow.  That's kind of creepy.  Well, your first reaction, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're problematic if they then inform an insurer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the other thing is the actual problem with it was that they were for grapefruit  cures and bad stuff.  But the larger point here is that in your communication, there's things about you that  that a smart algorithm could discern that could be of value to you if it's your choice to  turn that on.  And I think that the Googles of the world have to find ways to find these kinds of individual  benefits and give people control over them so that it's not just in Google's benefit,  in their view, that it's in people's benefit.  But you're going to have exactly what Leo's reaction was, which is the, it's creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The response from the world was quick and very angry.  Remember, this came out April 1st, 2004.  On April 6th, 31 organizations and advocates co-signed a letter to Larry Page and Sergey  Bren raising a gaggle of concerns about Gmail, calling it a bad precedent and asking the  service be suspended until their concerns could be addressed.  This is the quote, scanning personal communications in the way Google is proposing is letting  the proverbial genie out of the bottle.  California State Senator Liz Figueroa sent Google a letter calling it a disaster of enormous  proportions for yourself and all of your customers and then went on to draft a bill requiring  any company that wanted to scan an email message for advertising purposes, get the consent  of the person who sent it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And so let's now look back, folks.  Yes, Armageddon was torture, 2005 was absolute torture.  There was no privacy in the world.  Everything fell apart.  Oh my God, everyone was running naked through the streets.  Nothing happened.  It was OK.  It was fine.  We figure it out.  If Google had screwed everyone and done something horrible, they would have lost business.  They're too smart for that.  Who is the same guy who proposed don't be evil?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think that people widely know that Gmail scans your mail?  That's pretty well known, is it not?  I think it's pretty well known.  But you know, I was just looking through some mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm hard to find it very hard to find an email of mine that has any ad on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, mine tend to not have ads.  And I wonder about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they back down, frankly, a little bit, not completely, but a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because I don't think there's much of a market for it.  I think that's the real issue.  I don't think the ads perform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Advertisers have to want it for it to be.  So the point is that 425 million people actively use Gmail now.  Almost half a billion people actively use Gmail.  Obviously, I mean, if you assume maybe even only 50% know about this scanning, obviously,  people have voted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of the things that Google does, the big companies like Google and Apple do for a living,  is they build a better user.  And by that, I mean, they are trying to change our thinking and our behavior.  That's really nice, Mike.  Isn't that?  They're always edging toward where we're going.  And this is a perfect example.  But I always wonder about people who complain about contextual advertising.  Advertising has a bad rap for two reasons.  One is that in the Mad Men days, when there were three channels on TV and television advertising  was the leading type of advertising, they had to manufacture desire.  They had to tell you what you wanted because there was no way to know what you wanted.  And so advertising did and should get a bad reputation because they're always sort of  trying to manipulate you into buying products you wouldn't otherwise want.  The other reason is that advertising tends to grow and go in new places where it hasn't  been before.  Tattoos on people's faces, like billboards, every surface is covered with advertising.  This is bad and this is one of the reasons advertising is bad.  Contextual advertising in your Gmail is good because it will show you things you want.  It won't show you weight loss creams and tampons.  It'll show you stuff that you probably really are interested in.  Now, the biggest problem with it right now is that nobody is good at it yet.  Not even Google.  Facebook is terrible at it.  They show you stuff that you don't want.  They show you stuff you've already bought.  You know, it's horrible.  But the idea is a great idea.  It should get to the point where it's like, hey, every ad is like, oh, I want that.  Great.  There's a great price for it.  Click.  Buy it.  That's good.  We do buy things.  We do want things.  And so I think that in general, the complaints against contextual advertising is totally  misplaced.  I think that's one of the good types of advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I agree.  And not only that, but I know of news companies that spend a lot of effort to contextually  advertise and serve ads to you, but don't do the same thing with content.  And I'm having, I'm screeds about that these days.  And standard, you've heard on the show before, Google knows where I live and where I work.  My newspaper doesn't.  My newspaper gives me the same 300 to 500 pieces of content it gives everybody else  in the world exactly the same as if I'm a member of a mass.  It needs to know me as an individual and serve me with greater relevance.  And so the skills that we bring to advertising actually, to some extent, we now have to bring  to content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's really, you know, I had the same conversation in a less hostile, I mean, a  more hostile environment on Sunday with Twitter, because both John C. Dvorak and Angell and  Jolie O'Dell, I always want to call her Angelina O'Dell, Jolie O'Dell both feel like, you  know, there's all sorts of-  Jolie was practically crawling into a cave.  Well, she actually at one point retired from the Internet, but then found out that her  job as a managing editor at VentureBeat required the use of the Internet.  So she changed her tune.  Thank goodness.  Remember, it was the publisher, not VentureBeat.  Publisher said, you know, you really gotta be on the Internet.  You do have a choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't have to use Gmail.  You gave a really good defense of the Internet to the two of them, I think, on Sunday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just I feel like we get so much out of it.  I don't I do want targeted ads.  Yeah.  And well, I'm inspired by you, Jeff, because you're the one who's hammered this into my  brain.  You know, this is moral panic.  This is the what?  Well, what might happen should the government get this or insurers get this or whatever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's that's the great example from the you just have in time from from from Harry's  piece is that all the cries that this is disaster, what Gmail is doing is disastrous.  I have to pass a law to stop this right now.  I have to say stop the entire service because this is so terrible.  That's techno panic.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the final point on this is that what a success Gmail is not merely a number of customers,  but can you name another app that you still use basically unchanged?  And this is the point that many of the developers made with Harry.  It's pretty much the same code for 10 years.  There's not a lot of apps like that where you just get, you know, yeah, it's worked  and worked well for 10 years.  They built it right.  They built it to last and it has scaled like crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And its competitors like Hotmail have completely reintroduced totally new apps, totally new  sites and this one they haven't.  They haven't had to.  But at the same time, they've upgraded it for the modern world features, many of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  new features a lot.  It's still fairly ugly.  You know, Harry was singing the praises of it and I've always thought it was too many  buttons too difficult to use.  I never really quite understood why they called them filters, not folders, but that's that  search mentality.  This isn't a, this is a search, not a folder.  And speaking of filters, I'm complete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't leave Gmail now because I have so many filters holding back the ocean of spam  and you know, if I were to ever go without those filters, I just couldn't, I couldn't  function.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and the other thing that they've done really well is it is of all the email services  I use the only one that really stops the ocean of spam.  And they've really nailed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anything with Dr. Oz in it gets through though.  I don't know why.  They think you like him.  I think some, you know, the world is trying to tell me I need to lose weight or something  because I get weight loss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We talked on the change log last week about the new promotions tab and I applied then  and I finally got it.  This is what it looks like now.  Remember if you use the primary mailbox and by the way, this was the priority mailbox  didn't work quite well for me, but these tabs, social updates and forums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I never did them and so I forgot.  I like them.  And now this is how I get them.  I don't even know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It turns.  Oh, it's a setting.  It turns the, it turns the promotional emails, all of which these are not spam because there's,  you know, newsletters.  I said, okay, two things like that.  Turns them into kind of a Pinteresty magazine layout, which you know, it makes them a lot  easier to scan.  Yes, I know they are for the most part, bacon, which is spam I signed up for, but I can go  through it quickly.  It doesn't bother me as much.  And the fact that it's not in my primary inbox really solves a problem.  I think this Gmail has gotten better and better and better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff, it's the gear icon and then choose configure inbox.  I tried the tabs.  I don't like it.  Neither of you are using that.  I don't like it.  I tried it for, I really tried hard to like it, but I don't use it chat either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love it.  Yeah, me too.  Is there a way that I can manage my inbox because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If it gets to primary, it's almost always a person.  Primary, a person.  Right.  And if it goes by accident to one of the others, I just make it primary and then it really,  and vice versa.  And it really, I have a lot of filters.  As you see, I have a lot of folders.  I actually usually use a desktop client, Apple's mail client to read this because I fetch it  from Gmail.  So it has its own rules and folders.  But this works.  Frankly, when I need to see what's in my inbox quickly, I don't go to my Apple mail.  I go to this.  I go to the interface on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm a former fan of getting things done, the book.  Yes, former.  Well, I veered so far away from the whatever.  But I use my inbox as my one trusted place where I put things.  And so I want one trusted place for everything.  I don't want three or whatever.  So I just use, I don't want promotions.  I don't want the things that are in the other tabs.  But you don't have to look at them.  Well, that bugs me.  Maybe I'm anal retentive or something.  But it bugs me to know that they're there.  I want them to not be there.  I want, you know what I mean?  Oh, I'm confused.  And I'm also a zero inbox guy too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, we've ruined Jeff's mail now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, you have.  So I did it.  Now my priority inbox is gone.  Now I don't have the important and everything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh no, it doesn't do priority inbox.  It does primary instead.  Oh, screw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, screw that.  That's off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I hope you can turn it back off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at the benefit.  You don't have to any priority inbox email to worry about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've deprecated priority inbox.  Just don't worry about it.  Oh, it's going to be OK.  Oh no, it's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it gone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I can't get it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can get your priority inbox back.  All you have to do is hover over your inbox.  And then on the right side, there's a drop down and just choose priority inbox at the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  bottom.  There it is.  I see it.  You can show mine, Chad.  That's OK.  Chad, you saved my life.  You're welcome.  Inbox type.  Try them all.  Keep what fits so you can have default, which is what I'm using.  Important first.  See, I don't want I want them in chronological order.  Unread first, starred first or Jeff's Fakatka priority inbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Priority inbox is the see, I think beyond spam, priority inbox is the brilliant thing.  The miss rate, when I look down at everything else, the things that I ever want in there  are nil.  And it's not just bacon.  It's stuff I don't people don't pay attention to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  I use this.  I use this star feature of the starring email.  And you know, I have filters that automatically star certain things to determine what goes  into Google Glass and what doesn't.  That's all I use it for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or you aren't you the super user?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  Glass hole number one.  Right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unfortunately, you can't combine the tabbed interface with the priority inbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because priority inbox is the lifesaver for me.  That's that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That anything that does that.  It's funny to hear you say that because I could never get behind it because I was so  afraid that it would it would use an algorithm that would would miss something.  That's why I love the tabs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do it for no.  No, I'm telling you, do it for a week and you will be amazed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't do it.  I mean, like the moment that an email from, you know, my grandmother is sent to away because  it's actually everything else.  No, no, just check to everything else.  But that's an extra step.  Like if it's in the if it's in the tabs at the top perfectly.  Yes.  Twitter goes to social.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  YouTube goes to social.  Promotion is bacon.  Updates is exactly what I expect.  I'm totally in Leo's camp.  Like I feel like these are two different products for different types of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And me and Leo are one type and you and Mike Elgin are another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Leo is an old fart.  Don't be a young fart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's that's what I am.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  It's like Chad and I are the young farts.  You guys are the old farts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm telling you, I trust the algorithm more.  I trust the algorithm priority inbox.  This is a better algorithm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I don't think it's an algorithm.  All it's doing is is categorizing and you're never going to miss anything because it's  still going into the folder.  I don't trust algorithms.  That's why I like Twitter over Facebook is I followed people because I want to see what  they write.  I don't want Facebook to do its stupid Facebook algorithm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This old fart likes the new way.  I'm just telling you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good.  I'm using the new fart filter and it takes care of everything for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're going to take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mike Elgin is here ably filling in for a Gina Trapani who has the day off and Jeff Jarvis  as well.  We're talking about Google, Facebook, the cloud and more.  Lots more to talk about.  No changelog, though, because without Gina, it wouldn't be a changelog.  So we'll just have to leave that for next week.  Our show today is brought to you by 99 Designs.  Actually that's such a bad name because there's so many more than 99 designs.  It's a unlimited number of designs.  Look, the world deserves to be a better looking place.  If you're a restaurateur or you're a plumber or you're a web designer or an app or other  website guy or an app guy or gal, don't do your own design.  Just a tip.  So many people think they can both cook and design, program and design.  Designers it's a different breed.  They're not really human.  They're a new species.  They have aesthetic sense.  They could tell mauve from purple.  You know what I'm saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They use Macintoshes.  They use Macintoshes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They know what kerning is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My theory, Leo, is there is no such thing as mauve.  It is a color made up by women to fool men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why you should not do your own design.  Right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right there.  You're right.  I need mauve protection from 99 Designs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you don't know what kerning is, don't do it.  And you should go to 99 Designs.  There's a designer waiting to help you.  There's 2,91742 designers there waiting to help you.  The way it works, you put up a design contest.  That is you say, hey, look, I need a menu.  You say something about what you do, what you're looking for.  Then designers will submit ideas to you.  You go through them.  You refine them.  You pick the one you want and you pay, and often very affordable prices, low as $199.  Right now if you go to 99designs.com, you'll see there are 2,280 open contests.  They have paid out, and sometimes people will say, well, come on, does anybody get  paid?  They've paid out $2.2 million last month.  Last month to designers.  So designers, this is a great way for designers to get work and a great way for you to get  a great design.  This is how we did our twit hoodies.  We've been doing a lot of stuff at 99 Designs.  In fact, we got so many great designs for the twit hoodie.  We bought five of them.  We made the hoodie.  Wouldn't it be great if you could start your next design project right now, have dozens  of designers to choose from in just a few days.  Selection, speed, creativity, just a few of the benefits of having these designers work  on your project.  When you launch a design contest, you'll get lots of ideas.  You'll give the designers feedback.  You end up with a perfect design within a week.  The process is fun, fast, and 100% satisfaction guaranteed.  So do me a favor.  Go to 99designs.com slash twig and get a $99 power pack of services free.  The power pack gives you more designer time and attention on your contest.  They will bold and highlight and feature your design project in their marketplace.  You'll get nearly twice as many submissions.  And that's all for free because you went to 99designs.com slash twig.  Don't, don't kernet yourself.  Let a professional do it.  You wouldn't do your own open heart surgery.  Why would you do your own design?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Back away from the font, sir.  Back away from the font.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Get a step away from the font.  It is, it's really, I think I have such respect for designers because they have just some  sense that is that I just, I don't have that gene.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I heard something amazing yesterday at lunch that IBM is hiring 200 designers a year.  Wow.  That, that the belief is the technology is going to get easier and easier and easier  and all those CSTs.  But but experience and design, design broadly defined as architecture and such.  I think, I think it's very, very important and and young students should be learning  more design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's unfair.  It's unfortunate.  And somebody like Steve Gibson, an old timer like Steve Gibson will say this.  He hand codes his stuff for it's tight, it's fast, it's small.  He writes an assembler.  The problem is that programming has become a little bit more of a hack profession because  you just throw more power at it.  Don't worry about it.  There's plenty of memory, plenty of power.  So programming is not the the tight craft and art that it was, but design still is.  So and UI still is, you know, that stuff still is.  So I mean, I'm going to get in trouble.  I'm gonna get some nasty emails from programmers.  But there are plenty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I remember back in the day, I used to work on these things called Coyote terminals from  a company called SII back in the way back in the newspaper days.  And what a huge deal it was when somebody wrote H and J, hyphenation justification to  fit inside a terminal.  This was just beyond belief.  Genius to be able to it was like haiku to get that in there so that you can decide where  to put the hyphen and the word.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We were looking at where was that was that Mac Brickley was his original schematics and  designs for the floppy drive.  Oh, man, what an artist he was that because in those days, every chip, you know, meant  it was huge.  And he was he was so proud of the fact that he got the entire design into one.  I guess it was with Gibson.  Gibson. Yeah, Gibson was talking about that.  Just amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What happens? We should have Gina here for this.  But when code becomes when space isn't an issue and code becomes voluminous, is there an  issue to that? Is it all just become?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, I would guess that half the security issues we see today come from that  poor programming.  Something as simple as using when you're copying a string into memory using stir copy  instead of stir and copy where you don't check the size of the string, sloppy programming  or the or the assumption that we don't need to worry because we got lots of RAM.  That's where you get these buffer overflows that are a huge problem.  So, yes, sloppy programming leads to bad security.  Absolutely. Just look at go to fail.  That's all you have to look at.  One other thing Google has added, but not to Gmail on the desktop, but Gmail for Android,  apparently, according to Engadget, they're considering allowing you to snooze and pin  messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love that. I need to snooze messages.  I do it. I use something called follow up then.  Have you ever heard that? But it's a very simple way to make things go away and then come  back later. And it would be nice to just be able to do it in the app.  I'd like to see this on the desktop, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  According to the geek.com, Google's testing an army of new features for Gmail.  They always do. And that's why I always look in the labs to see what's there.  Pinning would make it sticky, right?  So it would never go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But snoozing, I don't get snoozing.  Just something comes in you want to deal with it day after tomorrow.  So you just basically say go away for two days and then it comes back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It doesn't it doesn't it doesn't stay in your inbox.  It reappears in your inbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. I would assume that that's what it is.  That's the problem here, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When it rolls off the screen, I'm screwed.  Right. If I don't deal with it, you'd love snoozing.  So I think I would.  But then then what's going to happen is I'll just I can see it.  I have this picture in my mind of 3000 emails at my window, like  fogging the window.  Let me in. Let me in.  Right. Right.  It's this is bad. I don't know.  Well, that's getting things done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Is the idea that you don't, you know, right.  You could defer it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's the tyranny of email.  The tyranny of email is that the sender controls not the recipient.  Bob Wyman at Google taught me that lesson years ago. Right.  And once the sender controls, it's screwed.  You know, you think about it.  It's actually pretty rude to send somebody a message and expect them to respond.  Just like it would be rude to just show up out of nowhere  at your front door and knock on the door and expect them to answer and let you in.  That's email. That's email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, remember now, that's a little more open.  Because remember, people didn't want the telephone in the house  because it would ring it. Yeah.  And and you couldn't stop it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So imagine a bell in your house that anyone in the world could ring at any time for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, that's a terrible idea.  It's a terrible idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wasn't it?  Chad, weren't you saying that you you like sleep with your phone  and answer things in the middle of the night? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Geez. No. So what I and all good Android phones do this.  The Moto X has a do not disturb that you could set either for a time  or when we're in a meeting or, you know, you can say, don't ring the phone.  I use do not disturb the HTC one.  It's not quite as elegant as the Moto X, but there's a do not disturb.  And I've actually written a schedule seven days a week for what times  I don't want this phone to ring.  And some of it's when I'm sleeping, some of it's when I'm on the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's how are you with the HTC versus because you love the Moto X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did. And I'm going to talk about at the end of the show.  OK, fine. It'll be my pick of the week this week.  What's the latest with Turkey?  Mike, I know you cover this on TNT every day.  And it seems to be an automatically updating story that prime minister of Turkey  got a little upset with social media and he started blocking Twitter.  So the graffiti on the walls of Turkey had Google's DNS eight dot eight dot eight  dot eight. So you could just basically instead of using the officially  broken Turkish DNS, use Google's. But now that's not working anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right. What they did was so first they blocked Twitter, then the viral  campaign. Then Turkey blocked Google DNS and some of the other DNS  services. And then they did something pretty astonishing.  They they spoofed it.  So they had the the the actual DNS service were in Germany and other countries.  They spoofed it so that at the ISP level, the any attempt to go to some of the  major Google public DNS or some of the major competitors to that would be  rerouted to a fake DNS page within Turkey at the telecom level.  And there was this not only prevented people from going to YouTube  and Twitter, but it also enabled them to harvest the IP addresses and so on and  essentially spy on whoever it is was trying to use the service.  So it's really an astonishing thing because this kind of thing has only been  done at the large scale by the Chinese government, but not in this exact way.  This is the first use of this particular approach to to spoofing it.  And it's called let me see. There's a there's a it's called DNS tampering.  First time it's ever state sponsored DNS tampering has ever taken place.  And so this level in this particular way, because because of the way they're doing  it. And so it's really you know, it's it's it's the horrible thing about it.  It's really effective. It's really a great idea if you're trying to control  information to make to to to hijack essentially the thing that people are using  to get around your block.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's a question, Mike. So so because of the graffiti, Turkey knows that 8888  everybody's going to that. But they can't control like every DNS or can they make  every single DNS in the country go to their DNS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're doing the major ones. So they've hijacked their two by Google.  There's level three DNS and open DNS are the big ones.  So they're you know, they're going after 80 percent or 90 percent of the usage.  And of course, what they're really tapping into is they're tapping into the viral  information about, you know, people sharing it and saying, hey, everybody go use this.  And then they're tapping into that information and then they're going after it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So which is what I feared when I saw the graffiti on the streets saying go to 8888  that you know, you're just saying to the government, OK, we know what to block.  Is there is there, you know, the idea that if there were if there were an explosion  of of good DNS around the world that the people in Turkey could go to,  is does it become a game of whack-a-mole for the Turkish government then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would be. The problem is that, you know, they're trying to they're both they're  both playing it for the masses, essentially, and the masses are going to be slow to find  these more obscure services.  So it's really a question of communication.  Plus, there you know, there's a lot of censorship in Turkey anyway over porn and things  like that. So they've really got quite an infrastructure to to to tamp down on this.  Now, the government itself is is divided as well.  So it's really a problem and it's probably going to lighten up after their election,  which I think is in a couple of days or something.  But this is this is a really hamfisted attempt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Once you figure out how to do this, it's tempting just to keep it up, right?  That's the problem with this is slippery.  Oh, we'll only do this till after the election.  And then, of course, they keep they keep doing it.  I asked Vint Cerf about this specifically and also about the move to end the US Department  of Commerce's contract with ICANN and this whole notion of the Internet, somebody controlling  the Internet, controls a funny word.  You can't really use the word control when it comes to the Internet.  But what he did say is the extremities, the endpoints of the Internet can be controlled  within a nation. You can control the Internet or your Internet service provider can act  inappropriately with regard to net neutrality.  But the Internet itself heals itself, protects itself, is designed to not to be susceptible  to this kind of stuff. So no one can no Turkey can't screw up our Internet, but they can  screw up their own Internet.  That's right. Yeah, because because it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because the government the government, you know, the ISPs are just companies that  have to have to function with permission by the government, theoretically.  And China has done, you know, if you're going to be a connoisseur of fine authoritarian  they're good at that. The great firewall of they have multiple things.  They have the great firewall of China.  They really go after the intelligentsia.  They don't worry about the bumpkins and the countryside and so on, but they really crack  down on the eastern side of the country and the southern part of the country.  They they have this 50 cent army where they have just huge numbers of people out there  just saying nice things about China and criticizing anybody who criticizes Chinese policy.  Plus, they have huge numbers of Internet censors on social media.  So this sense there, they're censoring social media, Twitter like sites and Facebook like  sites painstakingly, huge numbers of people going through all these messages and just  blocking and and and ratting out people.  And just it's a daily on top of all of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they have intimidation.  Yes. Those are all the known and seen things, even though we don't know exactly how many.  But those are the explicit activities of censorship.  But there is the more heinous implicit activities of censorship, which is government

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  intimidation. That's right.  And combined all of that combined is what makes their control information so effective,  essentially. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The my thought has always been this.  You're going to see this in localized areas, but it also hurts the country so much in  terms of because the Internet really is about free communication.  It's good for a country.  That's why we want to preserve the Internet.  It's good for innovation.  It's good for consumers.  It's good for commerce. It's good for so much stuff that you only do this at your own  peril. So I would I believe ultimately that the Chinese government will back down on  this because ultimately it's not good for China.  China wants to be a part of the global community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the Chinese Communist Party, which controls the government, doesn't what they're  concerned about is other political parties entering in and participating in in their in  their government. And that's really it's the same thing in Turkey.  It's a political party doing this to defend itself against another political party.  So you don't really have democracy in most countries.  You might not have it in any country, but in places like China and to a certain extent,  Turkey, you have political parties who are competing with other political parties and  using censorship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The party can control it.  Yeah. But ultimately it's bad for the country.  And if it's bad for the country, it's ultimately bad for the party.  And, you know, of course, you're going to have you're going to have totalitarian regimes.  Those aren't good for people in any respect.  But I think that that's that the Internet is a great threat to those in the long run.  And it's just I I feel like it is such a democratizing power.  And the people always seem to get around these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, as you as they're learning in Turkey and Turkey, Turkey is a functioning democracy.  And the party that's doing the party that's doing this is just going to get hammered.  I mean, it's just in addition to the fact that they that they were committing the  censorship to cover up some some some apparent graft and so on.  But in China, it's a different story.  There is no alternative political party in China.  So that's that's a different story.  However, what we're really learning is no history of democracy.  That's right. But what they're really learning in Turkey is you can't do this.  It doesn't work at all.  It makes you a laughing stock.  It brings attention to the things you're trying to to to hide.  We're sitting there on this tech show talking about a really inside baseball Turkish  political thing. Everybody now knows about this corruption.  In effect, yeah, we wouldn't have been talking about Turkish corruption unless they did  So this is a horrible idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nexus 10 might be coming back soon.  A listing on the Google Play Store.  Maybe that's a mistake.  Said coming still says coming soon.  Does that mean the old Nexus 10 and they're just going to they're out of stock?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's been gone for some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've been waiting for a long time for a new Nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they kept the price up there.  So so, you know, they're going to come up with a new Nexus 10.  And you think they would take some details out and just say coming soon.  It's a yeah, it's a bit odd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's hard to know what it means when they say coming soon.  But it's got to be a new one. It's got to be a revamped.  But the specs currently are not any different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Still says 16 and 32 gigs for 14 and 16 gigs for 399.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Five megapixel front.  I mean, five megapixel main camera and one point nine megapixel.  Right. Yeah, it's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have zero desire for a big tablet anymore.  No, I like my Nexus seven.  Plenty good. I'm a seven. Yeah, exactly.  My seven is just the right size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cats meow, cats meow.  Google normally, in fact, I gave him a little trouble  for this last year, really goes wild on April Fools.  Do you think they back down a little bit that they realized it was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's even more than that, Leo, because I hate April 1st.  I hate it. I just want to be April 2nd.  I cannot stand it.  Yes. My this year, my Twitter feed had virtually nothing.  I didn't see any of the usual stuff.  I just think maybe maybe last year was the Armageddon of April 1st.  And this year, it's calmed down.  Thank God. May not just be Google.  I do have to say that the Matt Cutts one was cute.  It was what was the Matt Cutts one?  There's it's a video. It's a video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. Let's say it's a visual.  He's not going to stop changing.  And it's a it's a visual gag.  So you probably won't.  Or our audio listeners for our listeners.  It's not going to be much fun, but I'll I'll give you the play by play.  Here's our much beloved one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm super mad. OK, Dave asks, when will you stop changing things?  Look, I'm sorry, Dave, but I can't do that.  The Web is always changing.  The things that we think we need to do for users will always be changing.  So and of course, spammers and their techniques are always changing.  So for our audio listeners, what's happening is his shirt is just constantly changing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is. I didn't even notice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. Look, nothing else has changed.  Oh, it's gray. It's purple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How do they do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know how they did it. It's kind of brilliant.  What its users are looking for.  And that's all that gives some leather and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I didn't even notice it.  It changes colors. That's it.  That's the gag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's OK. That's pretty subtle.  For Google, that's very subtle.  Let's see what else they got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought the Hasselhoff thing was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got hoffed. I got hoffsomed.  I couldn't get it to happen to me.  I wanted it to happen to me.  I mean, take a picture of what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was kind of the beauty of it is you can't force the hoff.  And they had a hoff bot, Dave Hasselhoff bot that would,  if you mentioned David Hasselhoff in a post on Google+, he would respond.  And then I'll show you some of the some of the things that happened to me.  Did you see the pictures? They they Hasselhoffed of me.  Let me see if I can find these.  It was hoffle. It was hoffle.  So here's here's well, here's some obvious ones.  Let me just show you the obvious ones first.  The first one that happened to me.  What is that, Chad? Who's that?  That's my this is my only hoff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hasselhoff some I got three. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so here's one.  I was testing out the HTC one camera, took a picture of Jason.  That's pretty funny.  I thought there must be a human doing this because this is too perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is Jason Jason's looking mournful and the hoff is looking like hoffish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Something.  And then but did notice that whereas would have the auto awesome mention,  it says April Fools.  And then this photo was created by adding David Hasselhoff to your photo,  which is so random as to be hysterical.  And then I got another one because I was testing this camera out a lot.  This is John Slanina.  Oh, wait a minute. This is a new one.  Yeah, this is one I hadn't seen before.  So there's there's new stuff because this is the one I saw earlier.  So they've put more Hasselhoff in with Jammer B.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if you if if if the listeners,  the viewers want to check out what has happened to other people,  you can go to Hoffs on the hashtag Hoffs.  You'll see them all. And you'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this one was my favorite.  And I thought, my God, this is got to be a human  because you see this chess set here.  Zoom in a little bit and you'll see Hasselhoff  is peeking out behind one of the bishops, a little tiny Hasselhoff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A mini has some great algorithmic work, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, I figured it has to be algorithmic  because these are not public photos.  So there's no way Google's going to go into my photos  with some humans going to go in and modify my photos, right?  Tell me that. But how do they do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But, you know, they do some amazing things with computer image recognition.  For example, they know the difference between a dog and a cat.  They know the difference between a baby and a child.  They know smiles.  It's smiles. They know facial expression.  So their their image recognition algorithms are killer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I will submit that this is I got the best Hoffs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is amazing. That is killer.  That blows me away.  He's exactly the same size as the chess piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's a size and he's peeking out from behind one.  Yeah. How can a computer know that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because a computer has to has to silhouette the chess piece  and have him behind his hand is behind another chess piece. Right.  It layered the photo. It layered it.  The layer of the photo in this case, it may have made what they would consider

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  an error. It may have thought those chess pieces were actual people.  It may have recognized them as humans and just putting them into a group photo.  But it's brilliant.  The way it looks is perfect.  If you were to if you were to do this by hand, it would actually be I couldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly. Exactly. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My wow. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That is anyway, stuff was nothing was.  Oh, there was one more good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I have to pull out my Android.  Well, actually, I could show it on Google Plus as maybe that's the best thing.  And I wonder if it's still in here.  They added a new translator to Chrome.  So if you go to a text page in Chrome, all it's gone.  Oh, it was only there for one day. How sad.  You could translate a page into emoji.  I'm glad I captured this.  I went to Andy and not Co's blog on the mobile and I translated it to emoji.  And they should have left that in.  I'm so disappointed.  And how do they do this without updating Chrome?  Maybe I didn't get a Chrome update in either respect.  It's like magic.  These guys at Google are good.  I didn't see some of these ways dates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ways will show you a single person ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's OK. That's that's another Hossop off looking out from behind people.  So maybe I'm not the only one who got that.  But are there any other chess sets with Hasselhoff on the that's a good one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It didn't realize that that was her hand.  Oh, he's eating her hand.  It caught the edge.  That's Hasselhoff zombie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not quite gruesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it didn't realize the table like,  OK, that makes me does feel better.  They're flipping off the half.  Oh, sorry. Yeah, I didn't even realize the content of that.  You young people, you're just in the end of profanity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, I thought that was pretty good.  That had but again, we didn't see the massive number of  Google April Fool's jokes and I, for one, am thrilled.  And the ones they did, I was delighted.  Yeah, they weren't, you know, wasn't like the toilet internet.  And I mean, yeah, yeah.  Let's see.  Oh, there was one.  There was a Pokemon game in Maps that was kind of cool.  Google is going to focus on portrait shots and effects  by offering in a camera app for everyone on on the Google Store.  And then you fancy HDC one people won't feel so I'm feeling already ripped off.  They're also working on raw support.  This is clearly one of the big differentiated  but the big battlegrounds in smartphones is not just the quality of the camera,  but computational photography, taking the photo and modifying it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they say they're going to be able to do what your new camera does  without the second lens.  They're going to understand depth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, Nokia does that with their refocus app and actually does a very good job.  But we did a review on before you buy yesterday.  Brian Burnett had the icon, the nine twenty nine.  He had a picture of raindrops on a windshield.  It did it did actually arguably a better job than the HTC one.  Really? Well, but the problem is you have to have a Windows phone to use it.  And I don't know if I'm willing to give up everything else. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The important thing, though, I think that companies like Google are  realizing that 98 percent of what people want from their smartphone  camera is to take a picture, upload it to social media and have it be like, wow.  Just have a wow effect. Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what Instagram realized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Instagram isn't doing it as well as Google is doing it.  Really, a Google Plus, the auto filters, the auto modification on Google Plus  is really astonishingly good. It's really so good.  I I take all these lousy pictures with Google Glass and I'll take them  and stitch them together and do all kinds of really amazing things.  The subtle improvements that it makes.  And hopefully this this feature of the blurring feature and so on  will make it to Google Plus as well, because they have the, you know,  the auto backup thing.  So every picture you take just goes right into Google Plus.  You can have every picture on your laptop.  Just go right into Google Plus. They'll modify it.  You can undo the modification with a single click.  It's really, really nice the way they do that.  And it's really improving photography, which is great because, you know,  the the Instagram process, Instagram wrecks your pictures.  Facebook wrecks your pictures.  I've done a lot of side by side pictures of what Facebook does  to your photographs with its with its aggressive compression.  And this is the direction we want to go in improvement of pictures  rather than denigrating them and making them look lower.  Res and all that kind of stuff. They are smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, the combination of Google Plus, a great Android app.  It's frankly almost so good that you don't even want to use your camera anymore. Yeah.  So four point four point three.  Oh, I'm sorry. That's not right.  That's out. It'll be, I guess, in four point four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's the camera stuff is supposed to be a separate update from for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Android update. And then you have to have a Nexus five or.  I don't know.  Hmm. But increasingly, they've put the Google apps on the Play Store,  which is really great for those of us who don't have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it'll become a default thing in four point four point three.  But in the meantime, they're going to come out with a standalone app, which is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Awesome. We were up early this morning.  It's been a long day. 8 a.m.  Actually, you were up early. I got here late.  Mike Elgin and Peter Kafka from Recode watched as Amazon revealed  a set top box, the fire TV. Ninety nine dollars.  It is Android. It looks like they didn't say the word Android,  but it's pretty obviously Android powered.  Yeah. Peter Kafka said he talked to developers.  Straight out was Android.  Yeah. Goodyay's just Amazon didn't say it.  But of course, it's just like the Kindle.  And it will have a quad core processor.  They didn't name the processor and a dedicated GPU.  And that's important because unlike the Roku and the Apple TV,  well, Roku has some gaming, but this is going to be significantly  a larger amount of gaming.  In fact, Amazon has a game studio they put together.  They will have all of the requisite Netflix and obviously Amazon streaming.  Hulu Plus, they mentioned Vivo.  I think they mentioned.  So it's another streaming box.  And it's the same price as the Apple TV and the Roku.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. With some benefits.  One of them is that it's an Xbox like game controller that you provide.  For an additional $40.  Yes. But to play casual and mobile style games as opposed to,  you know, Call of Duty and so on.  The other thing that I think is kind of a killer feature for parents  is this is this parental kind of thing.  You can you can sign your kids up for all you can eat content.  Free, isn't it? Is it free?  No, no, it's a special paid channel.  Yes. And but then they already have it for tablets  for for the Kindle Fire.  And you either parental controls and all that kind of stuff.  But now they're extending it to the TV.  So now if you have, you know, small children,  you don't want to expose them to the horrors of of TV commercials.  You can sort of turn them loose on this.  They get to choose their own content.  And it's it's a great idea.  And you know, we don't really pay a lot of attention to this  because it's like children's culture, you know, to a certain extent.  But this is really they really are hitting it hard in the same way  that McDonald's did with, you know, Playgrounds and Ronald McDonald  and all that kind of stuff, which really the secret sauce for McDonald's  is you you get small children loving your brand and then it becomes a lifelong.  They're hooked. Yes.  And so this is this is a big and they're kind of under the radar  because who else is really targeting children so aggressively?  What's the point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Plus, there's the voice command stuff, which I don't know if that's a gimmick

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  or not. You know, a lot of things have voice command.  I was pointing out that my television, my Samsung TV,  has a remote control with a microphone.  Of course, the Xbox one is a voice command.  This is not unusual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But overall, performance is something they're touting and saying,  you know, everything's zippy.  The voice search is very fast, they say.  And we'll we'll see the reviews.  And of course, you can hope here's a question about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll have one tomorrow. Yeah.  I was going to be here tomorrow, but  I guess I'm coming in.  You know what? I'll tell you what, Mike, it's coming here.  If a box from Amazon arrives here to me,  oh, you have my permission to open it and demo it.  OK, that's for you. Great.  So with any luck, we'll have it on TNT.  If not, I'm not tech news tonight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's a question.  After the Netflix  was it Comcast deal?  When you stream to the Amazon box,  are they going to have to be paying peering fees

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to make it perform well?  That's a very interesting question.  I mean, probably not. Roku doesn't.  But but Netflix does and gets the benefit on Roku.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Goes to the Amazon box.  Does that look to Comcast like it's Amazon or Netflix?  It's Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, that's what I believe, but that's what's different about  the Apple TV is that the Apple TV, Apple has its own CDN  and all content in the Apple TV comes from Apple CDNs.  I believe these are Akamai.  So that's very pricey for Apple.  But but it gives a much better user experience,  even if you're on Comcast.  Yeah. Prior to the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And Amazon.  And that brings up another thing that that Amazon is doing,  which is that they have a recommendation engine.  So at any given time, they say, based on what you've watched so far,  probably based on what the books you've ordered and things like that.  Here are the TV shows we think you're going to like.  And it starts to download them in advance.  So when you choose one, it just plays instantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We know you're going to want to see this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll tell you what, you are going to want to see this crazy Gary Busey.  Is Gary Busey actually crazy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or is he just making he has some I believe he has some brain damage  from a motorcycle accident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He does, but he's also just well, he's making hay on it.  I mean, he was on was an entourage where he appeared and was absolutely cray cray.  He mostly plays himself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you're like me, you're like talking to things.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Uh, hello, lab.  See.  Hello, pants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe the weirdest ad a major American company has ever made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thank you, bitch, for being here.  I wonder if that's really his house.  But it's frustrating when things don't listen, especially high tech things.  Find Gary Busey.  Find Gary Busey.  But this new Amazon Fire TV  listens to me and does exactly what I say.  Gary Busey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you press and hold the button.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes, Amazon TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it definitely gets your attention.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow.  And why do they pick on on Roku specifically?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's the direct competition.  And I know, but it's kind of the truth is this is just another,  you know, it's a it's a me to product.  I said I submitted, but I think I was wrong that maybe this was just  Amazon saying, well, we got to get the starting point  so that we are equal to all these other companies so that when the big deals  come down the pipe, you know, we can basically replace cable.  We want to be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the streaming boxes are going to get much more compelling this year.  And I think they're afraid that people who are using their streaming services  are going to say, you know what, I don't need Amazon anymore because I get  better deals with this other box.  Now they have a box with games and, you know, they're hitting all the high points  and a couple of vaguely unique features is enough to keep people  and keep the keep growing.  They brag to the beginning of the event of how fast they've grown and so on.  And they want to keep that going.  And they want to sort of hold off the competition.  And who knows?  You know, I think I think the real play here, ultimately,  as we were saying on the broadcast this morning, is they want to get people  using their TV to shop, to to engage with Amazon content,  to see advertisements and promotions on Amazon to, you know,  cross pollinate across the various Amazon.  Not a big market. Remember?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, the total if you include Apple TV, Roku and all of these set up boxes,  well under 20 million units.  How about the and Google, which entered this market and has left it?  I mean, the Chromecast is something completely different.  It's almost as if Google thought about and said, you know what?  Nobody really wants this.  What they want is a media.  Yeah, you you like the Google TV chat.  I like the Google TV, but it's dead. Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's one of the reasons I brought I wore this shirt today  is because I knew the Amazon announcement thing is just like, hey, Amazon,  don't forget that.  But the Chromecast, it's hard. It's hard space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Chromecast is a different idea.  The idea that it's whatever's on your smartphone or your computer  or your Chromebook, Jeff, can be sent to the TV  and that really the responsibility for it lies in the device  sending it to the Chromecast.  If you want voice, you do it on the device, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm happy with Chromecast.  I don't know why I just bought the Amazon box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you bought it, too, huh?  I was bemoaning the fact that I'd have to buy it just to review it.  I don't want it. I'm canceling.  Last thing I need is another thing attached to my TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. They certainly have the means to market the crap out of it.  And I know that people will, you know, Amazon has some real fans.  People love Amazon.  They love the prime service, the shipping and all that kind of stuff.  And this is a way for them to leverage that kind of fandom.  Sure. You can imagine little pop ups  popping up and saying your packages can arrive in the next 10 minutes.  And we get weird stuff like that.  Amazon is moving to having their own.  That would be interesting. Yeah.  But so there are a lot of opportunities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stop watching the Americans.  Your packages arrived would be interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's the other thing. There's data.  There's a lot of data here.  And they'll be able to look at people's habits.  They'll be able to remember this is a company that not only came out with a tablet,  but its own silk web browser, because they want to harvest data,  that more and more data.  And they were the original data harvesting company.  Their book recommendations in the early days was the first real glimpse we saw  of the world of contextual marketing and advertising, essentially.  Because they said, hey, you're going to love this book.  You're like, how do they know?  That's exactly the book that I would love.  And they do it through these algorithms and so on.  And they just want a lot more data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're paranoid, this is just another device watching what you do.  That's right. In your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They can deliver the Washington Post, right? To your TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do wish I keep waiting.  Because we own it.  I do wish that that flood of Chromecast apps that we keep expecting would happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's more coming.  Haven't there been in the last two weeks?  Yes. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, YouTube.  Yahoo wants to capture YouTube, a little of the YouTube glitter  by luring YouTube stars over to a no, a new video service,  presumably that they're creating this according to recode.  And they'll give you more money if you do it.  They haven't come to me yet.  I'm a YouTube star.  Oh, no, I'm not a YouTube star. There's the problem.  What do you mean you're not a YouTube star?  Oh, God, what is our total downloads on YouTube? Five thousand.  Because you have your own YouTube.  I need to start.  Chad and I both tried to figure this out.  Chad wants to be a YouTube star. I know that.  I know that fact.  Chad's crazy because you can't make any money on the YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But maybe there's a lot of the thing is I was watching something  Jim Latterback had to talk about, can you make a business on YouTube?  And he had a whole panel about it with course, he thinks so.  Revision three that that was their model.  At the end, the panel was no, no.  At the moment, you can't create a business on YouTube.  I think that individuals can create a business for themselves.  Barely with a lot of work.  You might make a lot of work with a lot of work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You might be working 50 hours, 60 hours, 70 hours a week,  and you make 100000 a year.  You're not going to get somebody like Marcus Brown Lee. Right.  But he is the exception that proves the rule.  I'm sure MKBHD pulls in, you know, six figures. Right. Right.  But I pay him six figures to work here and he wouldn't have to be  editing all the time. But the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But he would he wouldn't be able to be his own thing.  He wouldn't be his own thing.  He would. He would lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's a lie that's being told and propagated right now.  And not by Google, because I don't think they need to.  But but just that's the notion that you can become a rich YouTube star  if you just make videos in your kitchen. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a it's a it's a you know, everybody talks about Marcus Brownlee  and even his success.  And he's one success story  who you have to compare against a million, much less success.  We'll say with blogs. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not that's not that's not a bad thing. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But but the point is that even his income is is very he deserves more.  Well, he could get less if you know, when you succeed in an environment  like that, he's going to they're going to be 100 imitators. Right.  The market, the economics of advertising in an environment  like that are just completely unpredictable.  And they tend they always tend downward toward less and less valuable.  And there's such a glut of content on YouTube.  It's just it's not anything you can really build a business on.  You can't really count on it because you can't control the market.  If there's another recession or something like that,  you just never know what's going to happen.  It's not a good, reliable business model.  It's great if you're in college, you know, making a ton of money  and you can buy a convertible and like it's like, it's great.  But but it's really not a place, a good place to build a business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got to say, I really the more I as as much as I poop who this,  I still think YouTube is a million years better than mainstream.  Hello. Hello.  Getting me here. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On your computer.  God, I just your phone will ring here in just a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what? The problem is Hangouts.  Now everybody knows my hangout address.  So did you see the story on Tesla in 60 minutes?  So once again, mainstream media, let me play this.  See if I get this video going here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you play it, we're going to hear hangout music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know where that's coming from. I don't have a hangout open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can just do the audio.  It's closed everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That'll fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nothing. Nothing's making noise.  Let me let me pull that up again.  So apparently 60 minutes to the story  on on the Tesla in which they added car sounds  because it was too quiet.  It was too quiet.  And 60 minutes even admits this.  They said, well, it was an editing error.  Yes, an editing error.  Can't tell me that's an editing error.  We actually had the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You were going to start a car company and be successful at it.  Well, I didn't really say it would be successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like 60 minutes is the laughing stock of all.  It shouldn't be.  It's our most prestigious television news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  CNN is the laughing stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, you didn't expect the let's switch to CNN.  Oh, that that jet still missing. OK, thank you.  We still know nothing.  We still know nothing. But let's talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But in a in a semi related story, the EU has just ruled that all electric  cars have to make artificial engine noise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's because French people like to wander the streets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Miles on a charge.  And Musk is building a network of charging stations  where the driver pays nothing for a fill up.  We miss this.  He hopes to make the stations largely solar powered one day.  I've tried for free forever on pure sunlight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the end.  You know, message we're trying to convey.  So even if like this is still a great ad for Tesla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, breaks down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But come on, you don't have to add carnival.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's it's silent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This will be like he's going to drive into the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wrong.  No, I guess it was it was over here somewhere.  That looks like Google's charging station.  That's the superchargers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right before the two hundred and fifty miles on a charge.  Right there.  Right there. That's not what it sounds like.  Fifty miles on a charge or the sound of a chase car with a camera on it.  We'll go about two hundred and fifty miles on a charge.  And Musk is building a network of charging stations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's indeed that's there you go.  Thank you. Sixty minutes for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In my day, you didn't edit footage and add sound effects to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think maybe we did.  I just forgot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you cry on camera?  Yeah. What was that?  Who was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Broadcast News. That's right.  That was a movie that wasn't real, right?  No. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's more real than CNN.  I wrote a I rarely do this, but I wrote a just a spoof post,  not April 1st, just saying that they were going to rebrand CNN, the missing network.  Yeah, I saw that. And you're right on.  And they're missing people. Jesus.  Justin, I've seen it has been disgusting me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, obviously, they found out that people want to think about this jet 24 seven.  It's the only seems to be the only story they're covering.  There was a really good piece on Wired by an amateur  pilot that I actually think it is the is the true story.  And I don't know what they want to think.  Space aliens, they want to black holes.  Black holes. Now they're saying it's a criminal investigation.  But this piece in Wired seemed pretty straightforward.  The guy's a pilot. He said, well, first thing I saw when this plane  took this hard turn, I looked to see what was on that trajectory.  It's a it's a the nearest landing strip that has sufficient capacity to land at triple seven.  He said as a pilot, of course, one of the things you always keep in mind,  always keep in the back of my mind is should anything go wrong, where's the nearest place I can land?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They train you to do that every minute you say, what do I love?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So he says what it seems likely is there was a fire.  You know, there have been several cases of fires and tires  and then working their way up through the plane fuselage,  taking out the electrical system sequentially.  He says it makes perfect sense that once the fire was detected,  they immediately made that turn towards a safe landing place.  And he believes that they then were overcome by smoke inhalation.  And the plane continued on its course until it ran out of fuel and crashed.  Yeah, that makes no sense.  To CNN, Slate says, Slate said this makes no sense either.  So, OK, I guess we're now succumbing to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you go to CNN right now, guess what they're talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I have it in my office and it's almost comical.  It's all they'll talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. I think it's an Al Capone's vault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the problem is, it's it's a tragedy.  It's a terrible tragedy. It's a terrible tragedy.  It's a real tragedy.  There are real lives and it's being exploited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And by the way, the Google connection of the Goodfellow story  and why it is that he's Google Earth to find out where that plane was headed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the bigger issue with with news, just coverage like this,  is that they used to be for a while.  The mistake that that network news organizations made was that they  the amount of coverage they time they spent on a story was  how big of a story it was.  That to me is is kind of a mistake.  You want to if there's no information, you shouldn't be spending hours  on a story with everybody tap dancing and making stuff up.  But now it's like instead of what's the most newsworthy thing,  it's what's the most salacious or what's the most totally ratings driven.  And it's to the problem is that you attract more people, but they're  they're they're people who don't buy stuff like from a business model.  They're trying to like, you know, boost their advertising and stuff and so on.  But people who spend the whole day  hearing people speculate about black holes swallowing the airplane, right,  are not going to buy the Lexus you're advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Microsoft Build Conference going on in San Francisco.  Our build coverage is going to really happen on Friday when Mary Jo and Paul  come in here and do Windows Weekly Live from one to four o'clock Friday afternoon.  I think we have a full house already,  but that's going to be a lot of fun.  Windows Phone 8.1 was announced.  It'll appear on Windows Phone handsets at the end of April, early May.  And it will have a very Google Now like Cortana.  Yeah, I think they might compare it more to Siri than Google.  Now Google now doesn't have a personification. Right.  Cortana, though, does some interesting things.  The sounds like rich Corinthian leather. Yes.  We were watching Joe Belfiore do the demonstration and his sister called.  And he says, oh, yeah, and Cortana is reminding me to ask about her dogs.  And what they didn't show you is how does Cortana know about that?  That's creepy. Now, Jeff, the creepy line.  But, you know, I point out at the time that while Apple,  because of their conscious decision to respect users privacy,  cannot do a Google Now style feature very well.  Microsoft can. They've got Bing. They've got a search engine.  They've got they've got ways to gather those signals.  They could conceivably do a Google Now style. They could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think the public is ultimately going to embrace that kind of thing  because it's so cool. People love Google.  Now, the problem with Google now is they still are not really putting it  in front of you. And when they do put it in front of you,  they don't really give you enough stuff.  I want a torrent of Google Now. I want more.  I want more. And I want to keep on my face the whole time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there's some flaws and maybe they're still working on those.  I keep getting told I searched once a long time ago for a window,  a glass replacement company.  And I still to this day, my Google Now cards get it's only eight minutes  to Curtis windows.  I didn't want to go there in the first place.  But enough already with the windows. Enough with the windows.  And there's nowhere I could turn that particular thing off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had a really interesting experience the other day  where I got information about a flight in Google Glass,  which went from the Google Now app in Google Glass.  And I said, oh, flight so and so is on time and it's going to be leaving  at this time. And I'm like, what flight?  So I asked my wife about it and she said, oh, yeah, that's  her brother was flying.  She had received email from us.  So now they're not only looking at my Gmail, they're looking at  they know that my wife is my wife and they're looking at her Gmail  to tell me about that's weird.  Yeah. How do they know she's your wife?  Well, probably because I have your Gmail.  How do you know her brother?  I'm pretty sure it didn't.  But they you know, that's strange.  They they they tend to know that.  I mean, I'm also I've also got  her brother circled.  I've got her. I have a lot of communication with her brother.  So they they also know that I have a relationship with my brother.  So it's kind of I don't know.  They're doing so there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's that's I think that's one place you do get a creepy.  That's where you do get the creep line when you can't figure out how they know.  Yeah. Yeah.  That's really what freaks people out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's key is is they they have to reveal that and give you control over it.  Otherwise, you creeped out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's another thing at the build conference that we covered this morning  that I thought it was kind of interesting, which is that a website popped up  yesterday called Windows on devices dot com.  And I don't know if they've announced this yet at the build conference  by Microsoft, but this website called Windows on devices dot com popped up.  And then it went away.  But before it went away, people went through it and found all kinds of stuff  about talking teddy bears, robots, smart coffee mugs,  the Internet of Things running Windows.  And this is going to be powered by Intel's Galileo platform.  So they're going to be they're going to do something  roughly equivalent to Android wear, but but less about wearables  and more about the Internet of Things.  And it seems to be aimed very squarely at  makers and builders and educators and, you know, that sort of the hardware  hacker market, which I think is great.  And in fact, it has to be said, and it's probably more coincidence  than anything else, that ever since Satya Nadella took over Microsoft,  they seem to be a much better company.  I don't know if you guys have perceived that, but they seem to be doing all kinds  of stuff. How can you make that much change that fast, Mike?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I mean, this is this is this is the Queen Mary.  And and and so a guy comes on with a with a new paddle. Yeah.  I think that's wishful thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, could be.  I mean, the thing is that Microsoft is the frustrating thing about Microsoft  is they're always working on great stuff and they withhold it.  One example is Microsoft Research,  which just is one of the best research labs in the industry.  And you never see this stuff.  They withhold it somehow, either the internal politics of the company  or something prevents them from executing on many fronts  that they really could hit home runs.  And just for the last 10 years, year after year, they just fail, fail, fail  to execute on the stuff they have and have been working on.  And so here I don't know how much it takes to just turn things on,  to let things go forward, to announce things that have been  in the works for several years.  I really don't. I really don't know.  One one possibility is that Balmer suddenly achieved enlightenment  in his last year and got a bunch of things in motion that are now such  an Adele gets to take credit for.  But another one is that such an Adele is basically, you know, things like,  you know, not squelching Android  Nokia devices, things like, you know,  the big having an announcement almost entirely about an iPad product.  I mean, that that was they didn't see that even mention Windows.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, that was, you know, and is that can Balmer be given credit for that?  I'm not so sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Heck, Balmer was one holding back.  I think this is such an Adele is coming up was such an Adele is coming out party.  But it's a longstanding tradition in technology.  Remember the book Fumbling the Future, How Xerox Invented  that ignored the first personal computer was went to Hewlett Packard  and said, I've just invented the Apple one.  Would you like to sell it now?  They did that twice.  It's a longstanding tradition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They HP purchased Palm, which had the WebOS,  which which was a third alternative multitouch user interface,  a very innovative one.  Beautiful. Different from the others that had this huge future on all devices,  even into the desktop.  Once again, they had the future of computing in their hands.  And they're like, no, we spent a lot for it.  But you know what? We just can ignore it and then just sort of let it go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Idiotic. It happens a lot.  Unbelievable. Anybody as old as us has covered it long enough.  We've seen it happen time and time again.  Chad, you'll see it too someday.  Maybe with YouTube.  When you grow up, you'll you'll see it all happen.  Fumbling the future.  We're going to take a break. Come back and get our number, our tip.  Anything you'd like to submit, Mike, to our  Yep. Pool of stuff.  Sure. In just a second, our show today brought to you by our friends at Personal Capital.  I had Personal Capital's founder on triangulation a couple of years ago, Bill Harris.  He was a former CEO at Intuit and PayPal and learned a lot about how people use money,  keep track of money.  He wanted a solution for people to track their investments better.  And he realized that before you can even talk about wealth creation or investing,  you've got to understand where all your money is.  And that's so hard.  You've got bank accounts, charge cards, stocks, 401K.  Do people still call them charge cards?  I think I just dated myself. Charge cards.  Credit cards, 401Ks.  They're all on different websites with different usernames and passwords.  It's you can't see it all. You want to see the landscape.  So he created Personal Capital.  You set it up and within minutes you're seeing live real time dashboard of your financial  situation on your tablet, on your phone, and of course on your desktop.  And then, of course, you see to get an investment check out, see if you're paying too much.  You're in fees and investment advice.  They'll give you tailored investment advice so you can start building your retirement,  building your future.  And best of all, and this makes sense, it's free.  It ought to be free. Why spend money on this when you should be putting that money in your  savings, your investments.  Personal Capital dot com slash twig.  I think he created a great adventure, a great idea.  And if you're curious the way they monetize it, it's just it's like mint and other products  by giving you recommendations, by giving you personalized recommendations and taking a  commission if you decide to buy it.  It's very unobtrusive. They do a very nice job.  And they give you great advice.  Personal Capital dot com slash twig.  Replicant in our chat room says, too bad Mike Elgin can't share his brick pizza oven on  twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I could bring it in, I think.  I think it'll fit in the Prius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mike and I were talking yesterday about me.  I want to build one now.  So great. Great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we when we moved to Petaluma, we looked at a lot of houses and there are some my  wife liked. And this one, I just when I saw that pizza oven, I'm like, this has to be the  house. We were getting this house.  I don't even care if the roof keeps rain out or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's outdoors. You throw wood in it, it heats up and then you can just cook, cook, cook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right. It's got a big steel door when you open it.  It's like, yeah.  And then you'd like shove pizza in.  It's like fan 700 degrees.  It's fantastic.  Awesome. Yeah, really awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So, Jeff, I think you need to come back.  Pizza parties at Mike.  Are you coming back?  Look at that. It's his Google Plus.  What about the hat? Tell me about the hat.  What is that? Is that a chef's hat?  That's a chef's hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're wearing a chef's hat.  I want people to know who's in charge of this oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you actually own a chef's hat?  I own a chef's hat.  Now I have to have a chef's hat.  You're wearing a chef's hat parody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It gives you authority.  Is he wearing glass in that picture?  Yeah, Google Glass.  Of course he is.  And I posted a Google Glass video of the whole pizza process as well.  So it's it's really...  I want to film one of those.  Keep going down if you want to play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you don't follow Mike on Google Plus, you're missing one of the best, most prolific posters on Google Plus.  He really...  Keep going.  He really...  Now, have you looked at your views?  This is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, three hundred and thirty three million.  Jiminy Crikey Christmas.  It's a lot.  I was so astonished when I saw that.  I was like, what the heck?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't...  That's amazing.  But, you know, of course, the king of all this is Trey Radcliffe.  Let me see if I can go to Trey's page.  Will we see it if I go to his page?  Or does only Trey see it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You'll see it.  You'll see it.  Well, they put followers back up.  They took followers down for a while.  Now it's back up.  Now they have both, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they switch it up.  Sometimes they don't show any numbers.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Three hundred thirty three million views.  I've got forty three million.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm some pathetic number.  I don't even want to mention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really puts things in perspective.  Google Plus is...  There have been also some recent reports about...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It ain't a ghost town.  I take it back.  So Trey has four point five billion views.  Seven point three million followers.  He's probably the most followed.  I don't know who is, but he's probably one of the most followed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did I tell you about my Morocco story and Trey Radcliffe?  When I was in, I went to Morocco about a year ago and just was...  Everywhere I looked, I thought Trey Radcliffe,  of all photographers that I know of, should come to Morocco.  And I posted some stuff saying, you got to come to Morocco.  He just went to Morocco.  Good.  And my God, the pictures he posted from Morocco were just stunning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Larry Page has more followers, eight point one million,  but he's only got a paltry twenty nine million views.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he doesn't really get Google Plus.  Like Trey and I do.  I think he needs to work on it.  He needs to spend more time just posting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What was Trey...  Pardon me for asking this question,  but how well known was Trey before Google Plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was well known, but Google Plus really helped put him on the map, I think.  Yeah.  I have a mere sixteen point nine million views.  It's so pathetic.  And I don't understand how you all get millions of followers.  I have half a million followers on Google Plus.  I've never been able to crack that.  I don't know why that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was on a recommended list for some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm still on it.  It's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently, I'm not on a list.  I just...  Well, I feel better about myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Geno was on it too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.  You all have millions of followers.  It's not like I don't post.  I post all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it doesn't matter because...  What?  The algorithm still decides what to show to home.  It's very much like Facebook.  You can still have a huge...  But it's not business oriented.  And you know what?  And it works both ways.  Of course, I only see what the algorithm chooses to show me.  One feature...  Hey, Google, if you're listening,  one feature I would like to have  is the ability to turn on all for the people I follow.  Yep.  Oh, because you can't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like Facebook, you don't see everybody's...  All of everybody's posts.  Oh, that's not good.  I thought that slider, but you can't go all the way.  It doesn't go to 100%.  Slider, you still don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It goes to a lot, but not everything.  I agree with that.  The other thing is there's a 5,000 circle count limit.  You can't circle more than 5,000 people.  And that bugs me to no end.  Every other day, I have to go in and uncircle a bunch of people  so that I can circle the people that I want to circle.  So if you're listening, whoever...  More circling.  Here's the real test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How many does Scoble have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Followers or...  The interesting...  Oh no, Scoble only has 91 million views.  He's not even in the ballpark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The interesting thing about Google Plus though,  is that there's no automatic traffic.  Like as Jeff was saying,  you really see it in the comments and the engagement.  If you put a boring post up there,  which I do all the time,  you get hardly any traffic.  If you put something that's really hot, it goes crazy,  even if you don't have a bazillion followers.  So he's got 5 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Scoble's got 5 million, 91 million views,  which I think that that's a low number of views  for the number of followers he has, frankly.  I mean, when Trey's got 7 million,  he's got, what was it, 4 billion views?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  4 billion!  I can give Scoble a hard time about that.  I got 333 million views.  See?  See?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got a third of a billion, dude.  You really work it.  He, but that's how we got into this.  One of the most prolific and best posters on Google Plus.  And that shows you, it really is the quality of your posts.  You do good posts, you do consistent work,  people will follow you on Google Plus.  Mike, do you have a pick or a tip  or something you'd like to share with us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do.  Things a little bird told me,  which is the new book by Biz Stone.  This is a, it's not getting a lot of buzz,  but I think it's really a great book.  We recently saw the excellent book, Hatching Twitter,  which gave us the origin story of Twitter.  This is about Biz Stone's, it's a mostly,  it's like a cross between a manifesto and an autobiography.  But he talks about how he ended up as a billionaire,  almost by accident, at multiple stages in his life.  I wanted to point this out here.  It was the dumbest thing I've ever seen in a book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It says, if this book were limited to 140 pages,  it'd be over.  It would end here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How many trees had to die for that page to exist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and by the way, it continues on  for another 100 pages.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  But it's an engaging book.  It's pretty well written and I'm really enjoying it.  It's a nice story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is why, this is by the way,  why nobody's talking about this book  and why people don't hear about it.  Their impression of Biz,  that he maybe is a little bit of an egotist.  The first chapter has his business card,  Biz Stone, genius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he actually tells the story  of why he had that business card  and he got it from where most good ideas come from,  which is Roadrunner cartoons.  Wile E. Coyote had a business card, I think,  that said Wile E. Coyote, comma, genius,  something like that.  So that's where it came from.  And he talks about how he has,  it's a very personal book, actually.  He says that there are two Biz Stones.  There's the introspective, nerdy Biz Stone,  who just is kind of self-effacing and so on.  And then there's the egomaniacal Biz Stone  that he turns on when he needs to.  And he needed to when he was hungover  and had a bunch of interviews at Google.  And he was like, oh yeah, and started telling them,  started interviewing them.  But it's a really interesting book  that talks about how one person made it  from just an obscure blogger  to becoming this gazillionaire.  So you recommend it?  I do recommend it.  It's very enjoyable.  It just came out Tuesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what, we'll try to get him for triangulation.  I think that'd be a great idea.  Steven Colbert says,  in Things a Little Bird Told Me,  Biz gives away all his secrets to success.  I advised him against it.  If you're not inspired and informed by this book,  then you haven't read it.  That's pretty good.  Yeah.  High praise from Colbert.  Things a Little Bird Told Me.  All right, good pick.  Mr. Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Google has 49% of mobile advertising.  Wow.  Going to eMarketer.  Now who has the rest?  Facebook has 18%.  Oh, is that all really?  Wow.  Now they say that the time spent,  Google has 18% time spent, Facebook 17% time spent.  Oh, that's terrible.  Well, but I'm not so sure.  I question, I don't know what the methodology is  behind that.  Because it's the same problem with saying  the time spent on google.com.  Google puts ads in lots of places.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they're numbers brought down by the fact  that people see it in search results

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but I would just wonder.  Yeah.  So Google brought in 14.5 billion in mobile ad revenue.  Facebook generated under half of that, or 6.8 billion.  But let's not forget, Facebook was zero with mobile  not very long ago at all.  And now its stock is going up  because it's doing so well in mobile.  So I think that's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here is Wiley Coyote's business card.  Just in case you're interested.  Does say genius.  Certainly does.  Now Biz didn't put that half brain will travel on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good line too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's gonna be on my business card.  Might have brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What was Zuck's CEO sucker?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm a CEO bitch.  Bitch, right.  I'm CEO, bitch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was another guy who had a Google business card  and he was kind of an academic type.  And he was told at Google  that he can make up his own title.  So he came up with the title Jolly Good Fellow.  Which I thought was a great title.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think my title Chief Twit is pretty good.  It's pretty good.  Yes.  It's both aggrandizing and deprecating at the same time.  And true.  True.  And it's who I am.  The Twit, the Chief Twit, which carries no power.  So I'm sorry Gina's not here  because you remember last week  we were talking about the new HTC One,  the M8 I guess is what we'll call it.  And she had her old one had broken  and she bought the Google Play Edition  but she hadn't checked out yet.  Now if you do get the Google Play Edition  it's still gonna be a couple of weeks away.  So this is actually not a Google Play Edition.  This is the one and all it's HTC Sense Glory.  This is the Verizon one.  And I would tell Gina,  I've told her this before, she still doesn't buy it.  Don't be put off by the Sense skin  because actually it's pretty tolerable.  It's much more googly than the original HTC One.  Oh really?  Oh well for instance the original HTC One  had those capacitive buttons at the bottom.  They were non-standard.  Now they've gone to the standard back home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And by the way Leo, stay right there for a second.  As I remember.  I hated that.  Yes you hated that.  No, no you're the one who wanted the physical button.  I did and I was wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay all right fine thank you.  I did, I was wrong.  I didn't like the HTC One.  I at least wanted,  I didn't want something completely non-standard either.  But I did like the fact that all my phones up to that point  had had a physical home button  that I knew where the home was.  But no I was wrong.  I guess my complaint was I don't want to waste screen space  with a menu on the screen.  These screens now are so damn big that you can afford it.  And the HTC menu bar at the bottom  is actually smaller than the standard Google  Kit Kat menu bar.  So it doesn't take up much space.  And I do agree with the thinking behind it  which is as you rotate the phone and so forth.  Originally I thought they would move the menus around.  The menus stay where they are.  And that was my big complaint is you don't want menus  moving, remember that?  And they don't.  They stay where you expect them to be.  They're always here.  So that's fine I don't have a problem with that.  The screen is gorgeous.  It's five inches.  That's what the Nexus 5 is.  It's bigger than Gina's old HTC One.  Still 1080p, 441 dots per inch, really gorgeous.  And I think the camera,  that's what we were talking about,  is pretty remarkable in this.  In fact I wasn't crazy about the original HTC One camera.  She liked it.  It's four megapixels, the ultra pixel ID,  better low light photography stuff.  They've done things to tweak it to make it better.  So actually I'm pretty happy with this.  Now you asked the right question though, Jeff.  Do I give up the Moto X?  Which Mike and I both are Moto X fanatics.  The Moto X camera is so bad.  I think it comes down to how important is a camera to you?  If a camera were not important to me,  I wouldn't give up the Moto X.  Because I really like the always listening.  I like that it knows when you're driving,  when you're in a meeting, it will read you it.  This is, I'm gonna really miss this on the HTC One.  When you're driving and a text comes in  that reads you the text that says,  do you want to respond, and you respond.  That is great stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's great.  If somebody came out with a phone  that was essentially the HTC One,  with the Moto X always listening stuff,  and that plus the Lumia camera, the Lumia 1020 camera.  Then you've got something.  I would pay anything for that phone.  That's a $1000 phone.  I would pay $5000 for that phone.  What?  Well, it's easy to say because they're not gonna do it.  So I can just say that.  But I want, you know.  I agree.  Why do you have to pick between a good camera experience  and voice command?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do think there's hope for you.  Because Lenovo has said, or somebody,  I don't know, whoever owns Motorola now,  has said that this summer there'll be a Moto X.  And if I were Motorola, if I were Lenovo,  that's exactly what I would do.  I would say, okay, we got it down.  The Moto X was great, but the screen wasn't great,  and the camera wasn't great.  We want to make those better.  If they make those better,  I might go back to the Moto X this summer.  But for now, no, I've made the choice.  I'm gonna carry the HTC One.  It's hard to give up that great camera,  that great screen, which is,  I just, it's hard to give it up.  So, all right, we found somebody with even more page views.  I don't know how this is possible.  Burt's found a guy named Romain Guy.  Who's that?  Romain Guy.  Romain Guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You guys don't follow Romain Guy?  Who is he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's got 15 billion page views.  He's a guy from Romain.  He works at Google.  He attended, oh, he's French.  No?  He has 86,000 followers.  Is that 15 billion?  It is.  He must be a very, oh, he's,  I actually follow him.  He's in my photographer group,  so I guess he's a photographer.  It's not surprising that the great photographers  are the ones who get the most attention on Google+.  It's such a photogenic site.  Wow, is he number one Romain Guy?  I don't know.  It's astonishing.  15 billion views.  He's following you too.  Boy, that must make Trey feel terrible.  He's following me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the arrow goes both directions,  which means you're following him, he's following you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, now I feel better.  Even if I don't have a lot of followers or views,  at least I have Romain Guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not following him and he's not following me.  This is outrageous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, it's so nice to have you.  Mike Elgin, Mike is our news director here at Twitter.
