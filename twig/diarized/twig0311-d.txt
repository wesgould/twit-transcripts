It's time for Twig This Week in Google. He's back, ladies and gentlemen. Jeff Jarvis is here. Yay!  It's just not, I mean we had a great show last week. It was a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I watched your, I want to hear, are you still using Google Fi?  Yeah, yeah, got it right here.  I watched that, I watched that, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We had, you know, Ron Amadio was here and who else do we have besides Ron?  Kevin Toffle.  Kevin Toffle, that's right. So it was a great, but it's not the same without Jeffrey Jarvis, I gotta say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you fi'd it too.  Well, no, I haven't yet. I put the case on.  Let's talk about fi'd.  Then I'll explain that briefly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also with us, Kevin Marks, former Googler himself.  He's also been at Apple where he was instrumental in QuickTime.  He's been at British Telecom. He's a Tummeler. KevinMarks.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's not the same without birds behind him.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know, I'm sorry. It was going to be 102 degrees in San Jose today, so I came up to San Francisco early.  And I'm hiding in a cupboard in Mozilla doing this before Homeree Wait Site Club tonight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, good. Yeah, it's way too hot right now. Although San Francisco always has a little bit of air conditioning, thank goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, San Francisco is like 30 degrees cooler than San Jose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. So have you done fi? Are you thinking about fi, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here's my thing. So I got it. Oh, you got it, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't. I've got the next of six, but I haven't looked at fi.  Oh.  Because I've got a 10-percent on T-Mobile, so changing it would end up costing me money, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think you'd have an advantage if you're a T-Mobile customer, to be honest, as I was.  We harassed Matt Cutts until he harassed somebody else.  Strangely, we both got an invitation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Jason got an invitation, too. He's deciding whether to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did, yeah. And my lighting's all weird over here, so this is about all you get.  Okay. It's dark, Jason.  I know, I'm sorry. Yeah, no, I got the invite. And the more I look over it, the more I'm like, you know,  the $30 plan that I'm on right now with five gigs of, air quotes, unlimited data, versus what I would get on fi.  Like, I find myself on the fence suddenly, and I was dead set to do it initially. And now I don't know if I should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which makes me wonder if fi was going to be more, and for whatever reason, Google couldn't make it more.  Yeah.  Because it isn't spectacular in any respect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but I still want to try it. So here's my problem. I always have a problem.  I thought it was perfect, so I went and did a Google event in London, and to all the speakers, they gave Nexus 6s.  I thought, perfect, I have my Nexus 6 with my AT&T account.  Oh, you can do a fi 6.  And I can do a fi 6. This is just perfect. I'm so happy.  So then I find out that no, I had the international Nexus 6.  It only works with the US Nexus 6.  Now we could fix that. I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you sure it's different chips?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, maybe it is different chips. It is that you're screwed.  Because you can download a fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, it doesn't have certain antennas.  Oh, so yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the frequencies.  Yeah, so why would that be terrible? They gave you an iCall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Useless.  No, but it's very nice of them. Jesus, they gave them a whole Nexus 6.  So I call the fi people, and they say, we can't do it in the brain, mister.  I call the Nexus 6 people, they get a little bit, mister.  I wrote some stupid messages.  Beggars choosers, for God's sakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there anybody watching the show in Europe who would like to trade a US edition Nexus 6 for a European edition?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll figure it out.  So now, I'm looking with some greedy lust, we're going to talk about it, I think, at either the OnePlus 2, which looks really interesting.  I watched the entire watch.  I am excited about the OnePlus 2.  Oh, you made it through that without it crashing on you?  No, I did.  Good to know.  I didn't see any of the codes.  I know, right?  And also the Numoto X.  So I'm thinking, and they're both priced very well, under $400.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Samsung's having an event next month, soon, a couple of weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So do I get a OnePlus 2, which does look very appealing, and make that my AT&T phone, and then make my Nexus 6 my fi phone?  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so let me tell you the pros and cons.  Okay.  Jason already outlined one, which is it is not cheaper.  Jason has that oddball T-Mobile plan, the go play as you go plan, which at $30 a month is probably the cheapest plan I've ever heard of.  You only get 100 minutes, but who uses their phone anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And with Hangouts VoIP data calling, that's my way around it.  Right.  So that's all I pay is $30.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then you have unlimited text and data.  So that's not how Fi works.  It's $20 for unlimited voice and text, and then you pay $10 a gigabyte for data, but you only pay as you go.  And so that's maybe okay.  It still has the T-Mobile international capabilities.  It looks like they're exactly duplicating those.  Which is good.  Those are great.  I used that when I was in Europe, and it was fabulous.  It's not fast, but it's something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's throttled at 128 kilobits.  256 as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They switched it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was 128 last time I tried it.  And in theory you can upgrade it, but actually I couldn't get that to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I paid for the upgrade, and it wasn't much faster, so I don't recommend it.  But nevertheless, it's enough to check your email.  You know what I used it for?  It's for photos.  Photos, exactly.  So every night I'd get home and I have a phone that has Wi-Fi, so I would copy the photos over to the phone and just let it run overnight, because it'd take forever.  But at least they were backed up to photos a drop at a time.  And that was like a backup, which I like.  What about maps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of fun while you're cruising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can see where you are.  Although what I ended up doing is getting the here maps, which are free, and pre-downloading.  You can pre-download on Google Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just a bit hard to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it seems like they expire after a while.  You've got a lot to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I've used that before.  I've used that quite successfully.  But they hid it, so you've got to do some ridiculous search query and then hit a button that appears magically.  I suppose with being in Preface anymore.  But it is still there.  And it works fairly well.  It still can't do routing for you, because the routing requires them to talk to the server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's the kind of thing, the data might be sufficient for things like routing information and traffic information.  So if you have to download the whole map.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you've got the maps cached, then that works.  And basically you select an area and it caches that area.  So if you know where you're going, you can cache those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of fun, because you can see yourself going down the river.  Very slowly.  There's a point in which we are in...  We're going by Bratislava.  And we're in...  Whatever that country is, Slovakia.  I don't know.  It's the former Czechoslovakia.  It was Slovakia, I guess.  Slovakia now, yeah.  And so it's kind of cool. You go, oh, we're in Bratislava.  And when we got in the Danube out of the canal, the mine Danube canal,  I could say, oh, we're in the Danube now.  And that was kind of fun.  There was another guy doing the same thing.  So that's kind of fun.  Anyway, but that's off the point.  The biggest negative on PHY, I think, is that you kind of have to mess up your Google Voice account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Watch, I already did, because when I signed up for it, it asked me at that point, do you want a port?  You can't go back.  I didn't think I had a choice to get a new number, idiotically, so I've already done it.  But I didn't use many voice features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And some of the features are still there.  For instance, the forwarding is going on, but the call screening is gone.  I can't do the contacts groups screening.  I used to have different voicemails for different groups, family, friends.  What about the visual voicemail?  Visual voicemail is still there.  By the way, Google said there's a 49% improvement in visitor voicemail transcriptions last week.  And that's true.  Really?  They're perfect now, or almost.  Wow.  Noticeable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have they retranscribed the old ones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  But have you noticed that, Jason? Is it a lot better for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was stunned.  I have now that you mention it, because I actually did see one come through the other day.  I was like, wow, I can actually read that, start to finish.  Yes, it's language.  I just thought it was a strange deal, but then I put the story of the rundown today.  Oh, it's a thing.  Figured it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of stunningly accurate.  I couldn't believe it.  So I'm still getting, as you can see, I'm still getting visual voicemail in my Hangouts.  They do suggest, weirdly, that you not use Hangouts, but use the Google Messenger program.  I heard you say that last week's show.  I couldn't figure that out.  I said, screw that.  I'm not using...  And so I haven't seen any... I don't see any reason not to use Hangouts, frankly.  They say that, but I can't... everything works fine.  So even if you get a new number for Fi, even if you don't say, yeah, port my Google Voice number, you lose Google Voice.  So I feel like that's the biggest negative of all.  It may presage the end of Google Voice, or it may just be, well, we own these numbers.  Your Google Voice number is owned by Google, so we'll just use those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My problem with... I can't... A, I've got an AT&T Unlimited Grandfather, so I don't want to lose that.  You don't want to lose that.  B, so let's say I switch to Fi, and then I lost after the OnePlus.  Well, then I'm off Fi because it'll only work on the Nexus 6.  I wouldn't switch if I were you.  So switching entirely just doesn't make sense, but I do want to try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just don't get what Google is doing this for because there's no...  It's not like the gigabit internet, which reinvents internet and forces the other carriers or the other ISPs to go along.  This doesn't do anything.  Oh, one more thing that would be valuable.  If you work in some areas or go in some areas where Sprint is good, but T-Mobile is not, or vice versa,  the fact that it is T-Mobile plus Sprint plus Wi-Fi might be of value to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, here's the other question I have for you, Leo.  So I get pissed off every single time I walk into my Starbucks, I check my email.  Oh crap, it's found the AT&T.  I have to go to the web. I have to load Google.  I have to say, yes, I won't do anything horrible and illegal.  I've wasted four times. The latte is up.  I might as well not have bothered. It has turned off the Wi-Fi.  Will Fi at least automatically sign on to its own damned Wi-Fi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's an interesting question.  It says it will automatically join open access points.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's because those are open access points, but then they middle box use death so that it isn't actually an open access point.  Yes, but I'm wondering since it's Google's.  So Google's ones, I can't stand it.  I assume you'd not be like that.  But I suspect they will actually have a, there'll be passwords that will do it in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've had a very good suggestion for two years on Twig, if I do say so myself,  which is that they come up with this universal standard that says I hereby agree.  I will not do these 10 horrible things on your Wi-Fi.  And when my phone comes into your Wi-Fi, just go ahead and frigging sign on.  If you want to show me an ad on a web page, OK, but to make me stop.  Oh, you know what you want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You want a Windows phone.  No, Windows phone does that.  You're kidding. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just say yes to everything.  Well, the problem is that there's a sort of protocol problem here.  So the problem is when the when the zero-conf stuff was being invented,  the value was it lets you connect to things without having to type anything into boxes.  And this is this is brilliant thing that Stuart Cheshire came up with at Apple.  He basically said, why is IP networking so hard with Apple Talk?  We need to make it as easy.  And he sat down and worked out how to do it and wrote a bunch of specs and then shipped it and Mac.  And it's now universal.  But then a lot of people said, but but we'd actually like people to log in.  We like to know what's going on.  And so this this industry of hideous middleboxes sprung up where they will give you a supposed internet connection.  But actually, everything, everything you touch turns to shit because they've rooted all the way through their horrible browser.  And horrible things happen.  So your your phone thinks it has a Wi-Fi connection and starts downloading podcasts and it gets webpaged instead.  Yeah, it's not getting it right.  And all kinds of horrible stuff like that happens.  So now the OS vendors have had to put up their own websites.  And and when you say first connect, they try and load a page on their own site and see if it's if it's the page they're expecting.  And if it isn't, they don't switch the net connection.  They put up that little box that says you should log into this site now.  That's what's happening. That's interesting.  There was a couple of years back where the page that Apple was serving for that went down.  And every iPhone everywhere suddenly thought that that all Wi-Fi needs to be logged into even when they didn't.  So that this becomes this horrible single point of failure.  So they they fixed that.  But Google does the same thing.  If you if you actually look at the packets, Google tries to open Google site and then you get that little thing.  I had no idea.  Notification alert.  So the problem is, is that these people are explicitly breaking the protocol on purpose.  Now, back when Stuart was inventing this protocol, he did define a way for the them to put up a dialog box along the way.  But the only thing that ever implemented that was the Mac OS version that he shipped and no one else implemented that.  So that wasn't actually didn't end up as part of the spec.  And so we're stuck with this every Internet, half the Internet connection points you try and connect to a line to you.  And your phone has to sit there and sniff it and try and work it out before it does anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The term for this is captive portal detection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Captive portal. Yes.  Well, yeah, captive portal is a euphemism for crappy middle box that intercepts your connection.  But you but exactly you're a captive of the of the the Wi-Fi you're connected to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I have to say Google or Android does a better job of this than the iPhone.  The iPhone will often silently join it, never give you a notice that you're on this, not necessarily pull up the Web page, which I think it's supposed to do.  They do. They do do that. I think they will.  They will put up the thing that it takes forever.  No, it's slow and it takes forever.  At least Google puts up a dialog box in your notifications that says you need to tap this to log in.  Yeah. And it usually does it a lot faster.  I you know, because Lisa uses an iPhone and I use Android and almost always Lisa.  She was sitting there going, I don't know what's going on.  I'm not getting any Internet. And then I said, yeah, you just, you know, wait, it will pop up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But also a lot of those captive portals are crap and they're running on like some appalling little piece of nonsense on the router.  Right. And so they're not serving a very good Web page.  I've had that like, where was it?  How does it every hotel?  Yeah, hotels and railway stations are particularly bad.  Railway stations are particularly bad at this because they're like, oh, somebody sold them a box that they can serve ads to people.  It's like I'm in a railway station. I want to be here for three minutes, but I want to know when the train's leaving.  Airports do the same thing.  And I have to wait four minutes for you to connect to it. You're not actually serving me here.  Yes.  So, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Same here. New York Subways now have some Wi-Fi and you've got 30 seconds.  And I just want to do one thing. I just want to send out one message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you need to log into the port authority's special Web page.  So, you know, there is a camp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The EFF has a campaign for this saying make Wi-Fi actually open.  But no, it's not going to happen.  It's not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In the old days. What do we call it?  Not gun running. What was it called when you when you drove down the street and found Wi-Fi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Board driving.  Board driving.  I'm going to gun run.  I like it better than board driving.  That sounds good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Those were the good old days, huh?  Yeah.  Wow, cool. Another person has a router.  Wow.  Oh, neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're in the fraternity together.  Well, now Comcast is doing this, aren't they, with Xfinity?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, God. That's another nightmare.  I accidentally signed into one of those ones and it meant that every time I went out in public.  From now on.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, just forget it. Just forget it.  And half of them are down.  So, basically, it makes your phone unusable as you wander the world because they've joined an Xfinity hotspot that's not doing anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I have one answer here, folks. I just received it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google Fi. Oh, you got your karma.  I got my karma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's cute.  It's very nice looking.  I went down and they were nice enough to give me one at the karma offices in New York.  Oh.  And karma is very... So it's this, simple little turn on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was a Kickstarter, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Were they? I don't know. Karma's been around for a while.  Karma Go is what you got.  So the deal is that you pay the same thing as Fi.  And this is what you only pay for the gigs you use.  No monthly play. You buy this for 149 bucks, but then there's no monthly plan whatsoever.  You just pay for the gigs you use.  What's really interesting about karma is that it's social.  So let's say that you, Kevin, sign up for a karma account and you don't own one of these.  When you go sit in the airport and somebody around you has a karma on,  you go in and you use some of your gigs against, through their karma.  I won't even notice.  Oh, I see. So it's quite fun.  Yeah. So I won't notice.  But because I've made mine available to you, I get rewarded with, I don't know, like 10 megs or something.  And when I bring new customers on, if I use the code on Twitter and you sign up because of me,  I get like 100 megs or something like that.  Have you used this yet?  Yeah, I've used it.  How fast is it?  It's called Sprint.  It's Sprint. Gosh darn it.  It's Sprint.  Well, because they've got to negotiate with the other companies and that will come.  And I think the others will wise up and realize that they can't just sell you their own stuff.  I canceled my Verizon MiFi because it was wildly expensive.  I was pissed off of spending all this money on an in-case use that I didn't use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So how much? It's $149.  And then $10 a gig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because the challenge with all these MiFi type things is they think, oh, we'll make it really small.  And it's like, no, make it a little bit bigger. It's in my bag anyway.  Yeah.  I haven't fully tested it, but it goes on standby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It would be nice if it lasted 24 hours, 12 hours even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's good. I forget what they promised it is, but so far it's been good.  It doesn't need a screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could put a battery the size of the thing that I carry around anyway in it and it would still last a lot better.  But instead...  But I can also...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other truth is I have in my bag, now I have my Google Fi battery and I just plug it into there if I need to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the...  Start carrying those batteries around.  Yeah, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd do it anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're all carrying like 7,000 milliamp batteries around.  I know.  It would be nice if I had one built in.  They should do the Karma 2, which is actually a battery that also does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's a good idea. So here's the deal.  Well, you actually need one of those cases for the Karma that is a battery.  Each time you share the referral link, your friend gets $10 in their account and you get $10.  Each Karma connection is available up to eight devices, either your own or people around you.  Karma ties data to the person, not the device, a feature they call social bandwidth.  This allows each person to only share access to their network, never their data.  So everyone picks up their own tab.  Each time someone hops on your Karma connection, both parties get 100 megabytes.  You for sharing and them for getting started.  How much is data? Is it $10 a gigabyte?  $14 a gigabyte.  Oh, it's a little pricey.  But if you buy, that's if you want to buy one gig, if you buy 10 gigs, it's $99.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And again, after that, is it how much per like, then you buy it in chunks each time?  You buy another 10 gigs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Point is that it's because it never expires because there's none of that BS.  It should just keep, you know, so I've got like 20 gigs.  There was a special half off deal right before I got this.  And so what the heck? I got 20 gigs waiting for me and I can take three years to use it.  Right.  It doesn't matter.  Battery life, nine days on sleep mode, six to eight hours in use.  Yeah, it's like the other Microsoft.  That's the thing I like to double.  It's like make the days for us as quick as possible.  Speed, upload 2 to 3 megs, down peak 10 megs.  Download 6 to 8 megs, peak 25 megs.  So that's the Karma story.  Very nice people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd like to see that.  You know what? I'm going to order one and...  Yeah.  And you can let me know.  I'll let you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The point for both this and Google Fi, the only thing I want to say is that what they are pressing the industry to do is to forget this ridiculous arbitrage we are forced into where we buy things we don't use.  Like the cable industry does that, right?  How many channels do I never use?  And how much bandwidth on this stuff?  And how many minutes of phone calls back in the day did I pay for that I never used?  And that's what's BS.  And that's what these companies are pressing the industry to get up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I just bought one because I'm a sucker.  And I tweeted my code out.  So if you want to get 10 bucks off...  You're going to make a subscription.  Well, we'll see.  It would be nice to get some free data.  I got like 50 bucks.  I got like 50 bucks.  Yeah.  But I did tweet the referral.  So if you do want to buy it, you get 10 bucks off.  Go to my Twitter.  But so we'll reserve judgment on the Karma.  But I think it sounds like it's a good deal.  It's better than the Verizon Wi-Fi.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is what connects something.  This week Rosie, my wife, said she was fed up with her phone and wanted a new phone.  And it was like, OK, yeah, you've had it a couple of years.  Let's see.  And so we went through it like, well, what do you want from your phone that you haven't got from that one?  And she basically said, I want more space to read with bigger type.  Because her eyesight's not wonderful and you know, I have that problem too.  And so I said, oh, well, you can get your Nexus 6.  And she looked at that and said, no, I want something bigger than that.  It's like what?  They don't make phones bigger than that.  Then I had a brainwave.  But there's the Nexus 7, which I can get for $150 now.  I'll get you one of those.  And so now she's got something this big to read on, which will fit in her purse and battery last of day.  And she's still got her phone for phone calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then you put Skype on it or what do you have on Hangouts?  What do you use for the phone calls?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hangouts and the Hangouts dialer.  With the Google Voice.  That works fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As much like a phone as anything, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The annoying part is there's two things that are annoying.  One is that Facebook does not respect the make the text larger setting on Android.  So you have to run some third party hack to increase the text size in Facebook, which is classic.  And the other Facebook thing that is, what do you call it?  WhatsApp doesn't work on tablets because it insists you have a phone number.  Oh, that's so, yeah, that's right.  Which is crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which means there's a number of things like that.  There's going to be more things like that, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the SMS is get through with Hangouts, but the WhatsApp messages don't get through.  And Facebook, you have to like jury rig with random hacks to make the text bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I got one other question for phones and you guys.  Yes.  You too, Jason.  Which one should I lust after, if any one, the OnePlus 2 or the new Moto X?  Yeah, that was my next question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was my next question.  That was the other question was, I'm not buying you a phone this week because there's a whole bunch of new stuff coming out.  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, this is thrown to me.  Moto X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't get.  OK, here's the argument against.  I'm sorry, Jason.  No, I'm going to buy time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Answer and then I'll come back with my answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the argument against the OnePlus 2.  I'm a OnePlus 2 fan.  The argument in favor of, in my opinion, is it's a type C connector.  The argument against no NFC.  It is the same.  It's the same screen as last year, which is not a great screen, but it's OK.  They have improved the camera, but we haven't seen it yet.  So we're going to have to see what the camera is like.  To me, the biggest issue is crap customer service.  If you have a problem with it, you're out of luck.  So that's the biggest issue to me.  I'm going to their event in Times Square on Friday.  Well, you might know someone that might help you.  We'll see.  So but that's to me.  I now the battery life is going to be awesome.  They're increasing at 10 percent over last year.  Last year's model with the same screen got 20 hours easy for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is the dual SIM matter to you at all for international?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It shouldn't matter to you either unless you're in China.  Where is matter society in India?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They use dual SIM like crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what they had to do in India and China because you move around from area to area.  And so you need both SIMs.  I don't think you could use dual SIMs like, OK, I have a German SIM and I leave it in my phone when I'm in America.  I don't know if that would work.  Maybe it would.  I don't know.  With that, it's two phone numbers, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know how that would work.  So what about the Moto X?  I think that's going to be the one to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Now or the G.  So here's one way to go with go cheap.  The G is basically like last year's Moto X, it seems to me.  But cheap.  It's 160 bucks.  Is it little?  Is it like the little Moto X?  Yes, little.  It's only 720p.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a smaller screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there were people complaining that the Moto X is big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like little.  Yes.  So the little phone fans haven't got anything.  So the G would be the answer for them.  OK.  Then the Moto X is going to be bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They really made the, you know, one of the people reason people liked Moto X is because it was 4.7 inches, the original one.  Then they went for 5.2 inches.  So the OnePlus 2 is 5.5 inches.  The new Moto X Pure Edition, which is the only one you can get in the US, is 5.7 inches.  And then they did the thing that everybody does.  They went to a quad display, quad HD display, which means battery life's going to suck again.  Uh-oh.  Because the more pixels you push, the worse the battery life gets, right?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, that was the thing that was putting me off getting Rosie a new phone was that her problem wasn't that the pixels were going to be the same.  It was it was more the pixels were too small.  The device wasn't displaying them properly.  Right.  So getting even more pixels wouldn't help.  Whereas, you know, this thing's 1080p, which is which is plenty of pixels.  But you have to persuade it to draw big enough that you can read it, which is which is another little song and dance you have to do.  Yeah, you have to kind of trick it into that, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but Android does have a way to increase font sizes very easily.  And it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But as I say, not all that Facebook ignores it.  Yeah.  So if you're using Facebook, which he was, I had to run some larger thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the new Moto X does use an LCD display at this time, which is interesting.  So it's not OLED.  So I have to imagine that means some of the cool kind of touchless, you know, screen ambient screen stuff that the old Moto X is do that a lot of people love.  I'm not sure that you're going to see as much of that here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Another argument in favor of the one plus two is four gigs of RAM, which in my experience on Android, more memory does help.  I agree with that.  That helps with speed.  OK.  Argument against maybe pro or con is the Snapdragon 810 with the phones with Snapdragon 810s to date have been really bad.  This is a this chip gets too hot.  The HTC had to underclock in order to get it to operate coolly.  I just I don't know about the Snapdragon 810.  Samsung actually avoided it because they couldn't get it to work.  Although the Samsung Exynos that they used in the Galaxy S6 is just as bad or worse.  So we'll see.  They have a new variant of the two point one variant of the Snapdragon 810.  So we'll see.  I do like the various backs, but Moto X does that too.  No quick charging.  That's a problem as far as I'm concerned.  Although if your battery life's 20 hours, maybe that doesn't matter.  No wireless charging.  I do like wireless.  But again, if you're only charging it at night, not as big a deal.  The pure edition will have a three thousand milliamp hour.  That's a big battery for the Moto X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twenty one that we don't get the play edition, which is like thirty six or thirty seven.  That's the one I want.  Right. But that's that's outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why are they doing that?  I don't get it.  It's weird.  It's Lenovo.  They don't.  I don't know.  The pure edition would be three gigs of RAM.  There'll be a sixty four gig variant.  That's what you'll want.  You don't want to do 16 for sure.  You know, I would say 21 megapixel camera, rah rah, except that so does the HTC.  And that's terrible.  So the number of megapixels is not it's just unknown.  We don't know what that camera is going to do.  I think this is if you're thinking about getting one of these two phones, I'd wait till it comes out and I'd agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Neither of them.  To be completely honest, neither of them came out and I was like, oh my, you know, I'm I think I have to do this.  Like this is irresistible.  Even though they're both really priced really well, that's a good price point and something that we're kind of more and more kind of getting conditioned to expect high end specs and performance at a mid range price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're about half the price of the high end stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I mean, like last year with the OnePlus One, you saw what you got and you saw the price that it came at.  And it was hard to deny that that's a really good deal.  And I should just get one because it's a great deal.  This year, both of these, they're fine.  I just I feel like there's some kind of you have to make there's a little bit of a trade off as a result and not nearly as a lot of people have should look at the Moto G.  Well, Moto G is the most popular Moto Motorola phone in the past couple of years.  It's their highest selling phone.  So it makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo, you still like I there was a sale on the what's the little tiny moto the ear thing.  Oh, no, don't get the hint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've replaced that.  The new they've replaced that anyway already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I did order it and then I'm returning it as I didn't open it as I thought.  I looked at it.  I thought, no, it's not going to stay in my weird ears.  Nothing fits in my ear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not going to work in weird ears.  That's for sure.  So let's see.  Flip shell.  Should I get a flip shell?  Yeah, I don't actually get to order this now.  Are you?  Yeah, actually, I like I like the Moto the last Moto G engraved.  Let's see.  Take that, Jeff.  OK, put that on the back.  That'll be nice.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That'll be good.  Memory.  The key on this one is you want to go with the 16 gig, especially on the Moto G, to get  RAM.  What other options I can have a greeting when it signs on.  I like Moto maker.  I'm glad that they've kept that around and I can do seashells.  Hello, Leo.  That's so stupid.  How about Hello, handsome?  Oh, yeah, now I'm happy.  Hello, handsome.  $254 for that 16 gig version.  16 is a little light.  That would be the one thing that would really worry me on this.  It is light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My wife has a 16 gig Moto X, the first one, and is always running out of room because  of photos and videos, videos primarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you can make different designs.  Moto maker is great.  Not anymore in the US, of course.  The G, in a way, to me, hits the sweet spot for most normal people.  I was surprised at the number of high-end geeks who also have the G and love it.  It's water resistant, 13 megapixel camera with dual flash, color-bouncing flash.  It's a 5-inch 720p display.  5 is a good size.  That's a nice size.  They say all-day battery.  I wish they'd be better on these battery life.  Oh, slot for an SD card.  I didn't see that.  Up to 32 gigs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All of them have SD cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's funny because none of the feature phones, really?  The OnePlus has an SD card?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, sorry, all of Motorola's newest.  Does the X?  The X has a 2, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Up to 128.  Because everybody else is turning their back on it, and the rumor is that even Samsung on the Note 5 will.  I suppose if I watched all about Android every Tuesday night on this network, I would know this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Plug, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hosted by that great guy, Jason Howell.  I would know this stuff.  Keep it coming.  Kevin Toffle apparently says that this Nessus CISC camera is the same camera as the Moto G.  As the Moto G.  Moto G?  I'm happy.  This is not a bad camera.  That would be okay.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not amazing, but it's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the best phone camera alive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Galaxy S6.  Yeah, between that and the LG G4 right now.  And the iPhone 6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was underwhelmed by the G4.  I know that Miriam and lots of people really are crazy about the G4.  I was not impressed.  The S6 blows me away.  The iPhone 6 is pretty good, although it's only half the megapixels.  And then of course there's Nokia.  If you want to get a Windows phone, those Nokia cameras are very good.  How come you don't have an iPhone, Jeff?  You seem like an iPhone guy.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I live la vida Google.  I don't have my Chromebook, so my Chromebook microphone is not working right now, so I can't do hangouts on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Miriam practically slapped me because I said I liked the iPhone 6 camera.  She says, no iOS.  No optical image stabilization.  You must have that.  I don't notice the loss of that.  All right, let's take a break.  We've got lots more.  Kevin Marks is here joining us from the Mozilla headquarters in San Francisco where he's getting ready for an event tonight.  Tell us about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So tonight we've got an event called Homebrew Website Club, which we have every two weeks.  We normally have it at Mozilla in San Francisco.  We also have the locations in other cities.  There's one in Portland and there was one in Gothenburg, if you want to say in English, which has obviously already finished.  Juttenberg.  Juttenberg.  Juttenberg.  Juttenberg.  But also we've had them in Chicago, New York.  Basically it's based on the original Homebrew Computing Club idea, which was where famously the Apple was invented,  where you get together and talk about what you've built on your website, what you'd like to build on your website and work together on that.  So it's part of the IndieWeb staff.  And we've been doing it for probably 18 months now, maybe a couple of years.  And we normally get a handful of people coming around and trying stuff out.  The number varies a fair bit.  But I enjoy it and I recommend people come along if they're interested.  So San Francisco tonight, 530 at Mozilla, Portland, 530, I'm not quite sure where it is.  Look up on the IndieWebCamp.com website and it's at the bottom of the page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis also here from City University of New York where he teaches journalism.  I have a lot of journalism stories we can talk about.  It was kind of an interesting time the last few weeks.  I'm sure you...  Gawker.  Yeah.  And more.  New York Times.  The sad end of the line for the gray lady.  Or not.  Anyway, we'll talk about some more stuff like that.  But first, can I talk about JustWorks?  JustWorks.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amazing numbers there.  Amazing numbers.  Kevin, have you seen it yet?  You want to guess how many people?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't look.  Don't show them.  I did just say it.  I'm sorry.  Oh, shoot.  Monthly active users.  What do you think?  1.49 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What?  They couldn't do another 100,000?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So close to.  How many people are on the Internet?  That's got to be everybody.  10 million.  10 billion on the Internet?  No, that's the plan.  No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You need another 10 million to get to 1.5.  First 3 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  First 3 billion.  But they're close.  That's close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, that's 0.01 billion.  That's all they need.  800 million people use WhatsApp.  That's amazing itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Wow, that one blows me away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember when it was a big deal that Facebook had half a billion people?  That wasn't so long ago.  WhatsApp has 800 million.  Messenger, Facebook Messenger, big success.  700 million.  Of course, Facebook forced that.  Instagram.  You know, I thought they said 300 million last month.  So it's still 300 million.  So maybe not growing.  One and a half billion searches a day.  A billion people getting online through Internet.org.  Or I think it's all offered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Could get online.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like homes passed.  What's Facebook groups?  I didn't even know that existed.  850 million people do.  Leo doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's just the...  Pages.  The label groups.  It's not quite pages.  It's sort of somewhere between the pages.  Basically, it's a chat room that you can put together on Facebook.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, like every one of our classes at school has a Facebook group.  I never heard of it.  Yeah.  What I didn't...  I forget about is Facebook events.  You've probably got one you don't know about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I probably do.  450 million people use events.  This just shows you, you know, we're geeks and we kind of turn up our noses at things like this.  But real people go...  No, it's Facebook.  Everything.  It does everything you need.  40 million small businesses are using pages.  I like Mark.  In 1876, the year the first telephone call was made, there were 1.49 billion people on the Earth.  Now we've got that many people in Facebook.  Where's the money part?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, go to the other link when I put in the...  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the up your Twitter part where they go on about mouths and then the money part.  Yeah.  Where's the money part?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Second quarter earnings came in at 50 cents a share, 4.04 billion in revenue, beating  the forecast by three cents a share.  Okay.  Nonetheless, stock fell in 5% in after hours because of higher expenses, they say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really become the case that the stock market buys on the run up to the quarterly  results and then whatever they are, sells.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Daily average, I mean, average daily users came in at 968 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at this one.  This, to me, is the number that really matters.  We mentioned 1.49 billion monthly active users.  On mobile, 1.31 billion.  Yeah.  Mobile is...  Facebook is mobile.  Is mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Plus, get this one, engagement came in at 46 minutes per day on average across Facebook,  Instagram, Messenger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  That's a pretty linear graph, Kevin, Marks.  That's the kind of graph where you could pretty easily predict the future.  It's almost a straight line growth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's interesting because I remember them getting nervous as they were approaching the number  of people online.  Do you remember Mark giving that to them?  We just stopped counting mouths.  We just started counting interactions or something.  But I guess they carried them forward anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Internet.org does matter so much to them strategically because they've got to get more people on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've got a ceiling.  Well, how many people are online?  What is that number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's in the 3 billion now and another 3 billion coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK.  That's not right.  A billion of them Chinese.  Facebook daily active users in millions daily is well over 800 million.  Daily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's kind of expensive.  Expenses came in at 2.77 billion up 82 percent from the same period last year.  So that's what scared Wall Street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  That's what scared them a little bit.  But jeez.  Well, why are they up so much?  That's a lot of money.  Eighty two percent increase in expenses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Must be some one time stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Acquisitions?  No, I don't know.  So Q2 growth Twitter versus Facebook.  Twitter gained 2 million users in the second quarter.  Facebook 50 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mobile advertising 76 percent of total ad revenue for the quarter.  Wow.  No one else can figure out.  No one.  No one is advertising.  No one is doing that.  Media is killing us.  76 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did they break that down at all into what kinds of ads?  Because they've got different kinds of ads.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK.  I mean, I think they were happy installs at one point, but I'm not sure if that's still

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  working for them.  Oh, yeah.  Wasn't that the hot thing for a while?  Those app ads?  And then it was over.  Well, I'm not sure it's over, but I think I suspect it's over.  I didn't see.  I don't see them anymore.  My Facebook feed.  Do you still see them?  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It went away.  I don't read my Facebook feed much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's have a look.  I decided to go into Facebook.  I dove back in.  I really dove back in and got serious about Facebook.  And because I realized I've got three times as many followers on Facebook as I have on  Twitter.  And so I took it seriously, joined in and I'm loving it.  I got to say, it's it's it's very good.  You know, a few things irritate this.  The same meme will come by right now.  I cannot see the picture of that sad lion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, you know what, though, that there's that that tells there.  I think that that's not a bad thing.  That's what everybody's consumed with.  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.  So as long as it's accurately reflecting what's on people's minds right now, I can live with  that.  What I don't like is seeing the video that was viral a year ago.  Yes, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree.  I talked to the head of the feed and you know, you think there's some magic formula of why  to do this.  And he just said, yeah, we're working on that.  You know, I feel like they've gotten better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like they've gotten better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have gotten much better.  Remember the days when Scoble would take over your entire feed?  I must unfollowed him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm still there.  He's just not the same Scoble.  But actually, what I was thinking about this afterwards, what I wish is when they do bring  something back, make it obvious why you're doing that.  Because what they're doing, he said, we're doing it because there's some new activity.  But then I've got to go dig in for what?  Why is this here?  It's mysterious.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think on a sudden boost of comments or some new comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I see a lot of Jeff for some reason, because I must have given them a signal that I like  your posts, because I see a lot of you.  What do you got?  Is that an ad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a suggested post.  That's an ad.  Is that suggesting that I post it?  That's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's an ad.  And is that an app installer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's like, I wouldn't click this thing, but I don't know what it is.  What is it for?  InVision.  I don't know.  Speed up your design process.  Trust about one minute.  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think so.  And I'm getting one for Happify, which I think is a website in my ad.  Stop negative thoughts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I wonder how this compares with a media company or with Google.  The ARPU, I love saying that.  The ARPU.  What's that?  Average revenue per user.  Oh.  How much is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that interesting?  Is that a year or quarter?  That's for the quarter.  That's for the quarter.  So that means they're making maybe $10 a year on you.  That's a lot of money if you think about it, especially when you have 1.5 billion users.  That's making up on volume, yeah.  $10 a year, though, is what they make on you.  That's what you pay for that service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The company spent $1.17 billion on R&D for the quarter, up from only $4.92 million in the year ago, period.  That's what happened.  That's where it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's just investment.  They're trying to figure out how to do a better job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they're doing Oculus and they're doing other things.  They're developing.  They're investing.  It's impressive.  I mean, it's a hell of a lot.  And I just read from people who talk about it and talk about what a well-managed company it is and how good it is to work there and that kind of stuff.  So it's taken some of the mojo from old daddy Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like, yeah, I feel like for a while I was hating myself when I visited Facebook and lately I actually enjoy it.  I'm loving it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's Google's ARPU? How does that compare?  I don't know.  Because it's going to be so different, though, Kevin, because you just don't have the same kind of...  Google just has incredible volume of browsers.  Right.  But, you know, they...  The only board she had to me is to compare the ARPU of...  Oh, here we go.  OK, so this is in 2014.  Ooh, $45 a quarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What?  In 2014.  So here's Google's massive ARPU.  We just said $10 a year for Facebook.  Google's doing $45 a quarter.  Now, this is old data.  As you said, 2014.  Is this a quarter?  That's per quarter.  Google's doing OK.  This was when Twitter...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Facebook was then at $7.24.  Yeah.  And Twitter at...  Three and a half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You said it was two now. Is this per year?  That's annualized. OK.  Q1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, this is annualized. OK.  So the seven there is now $10 or $11 for Facebook.  Yeah. Well, not quite $10. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what's an ARPU for a time maker or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's interesting because people complain about how Facebook intrudes and stuff.  But if you use Facebook as a service, how much would you pay a year if you wanted to?  If you didn't want to have Facebook gather information on your Google or anybody else,  how much would you pay per year for what you get from them?  And I think $10 would be cheap.  Oh. Oh. And $45 would be cheap for Google.  Oh, come on.  Oh, come on.  Four bucks a month.  No, I can do four bucks.  Yeah, anything less than five bucks a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Versus what you pay to Comcast for what? For just bits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No value added whatsoever.  I was paying five bucks a month for Postaven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I see an article here from GigaOM. May it rest in peace.  Estimate... Estimating 2010 New York Times ARPU of $170.  Wow.  But you have far fewer.  But they have a lot fewer poos.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's also... Is that user as in subscriber or user as in...  That's really where it's at.  That's their website ever.  The user becomes a bit weird in that case.  It costs $600 to subscribe to the New York Times for a year.  So they're saying only four times as many people look at it as pay for it, which seems unlikely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. I can't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't ask math questions. You can do that in your head. We have to think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, this is why ARPU is a kind of messy metric because it makes sense for...  It does make sense for Comcast because you've got a customer who's paying you regularly.  But for something like Facebook or Google, it's a bit weirder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But in some ways more important because it's a question of, well, am I able to monetize that $1.49 billion?  And so it's a pretty important question.  I think Facebook's success in mobile... If I were the stock market, I'd be jumping for joy. I'm stunned.  This is, as far as I'm concerned, that's a buy opportunity.  Yeah.  Because...  I might even do that myself.  That's impressive. That is really impressive.  Okay. So there you go. Quarterly results in for Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As someone says in the chat room, the company we do pay annually is Amazon.  I pay them for products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  100 bucks a year. And that's just for second-day shipping.  And a few crappy music.  And I happily pay it.  Yeah, happily.  And some TV.  I like the TV, actually.  Prime justifies itself, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's said that it doesn't play on Android, which is a kind of pain in the bum.  I can't watch Prime on my Android.  Oh, I know. That drives me crazy.  And I can't Chromecast it.  So I have to use the built-in app on the TV to watch it on Amazon Prime.  Yeah, me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is kind of annoying.  Plus, the apps are very different.  Some TV apps allow you to buy stuff, some don't. It's very weird.  It's unpredictable what you're going to get.  Yeah.  I'm sure you talked yesterday about stage fright, Justin.  This is the very scary vulnerability on about 950 million Android devices  that can be literally owned by an MMS message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the amount of ownership depends on the version, I think.  Okay.  I think Jason probably knows slightly more than this, maybe,  but I think around 4.2, they started scrambling memory,  which made it much harder to actually take it over with a buffer overrun,  but you can still crash it.  You can crash it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's exactly what Google had said, is that anything post,  yeah, I think it's 4.4, has more checks in place.  It's still possible.  And stage fright, at its core, is system-level stuff.  So just using Hangouts is kind of like the delivery mechanism.  That's just one example of how it could be manipulated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Without even reading, by the way, the MMS,  in fact, you might only see that you received an MMS.  You may never even see it because the MMS could activate,  take over your phone, and then delete itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because these messaging apps, they auto-retrieve,  which is an option that you can turn off, by the way.  When they do that, they might process it for like a screenshot  or something like that.  They actually do some churning on that file before you ever even watch it,  just to kind of see what it is and pull some information from it.  What if the patch coming out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For an actual takeover, you'd have to craft it for the particular device, I think.  Yes, because it has to lead to an appropriate part of memory.  So you could probably crash any Android, but to actually take over the thing,  you'd have to have a crafted packet for your particular...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We did a deep dive on this on security now, of course, if you want to know more.  The big issue, really, is that there are many, many Android phones out there  running old operating systems, which will never be updated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the challenge is, what can Google do to patch this?  They could... And if the phones are getting some kinds of updates,  if they're getting the Google Cloud services updates or they're getting the app updates,  they could patch the mainline apps to deal with this.  I hope that that will propagate, too.  But when something is quite...  There are so many apps.  It's really hard, yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are so many apps.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there's an 80-20 thing here.  If the primary one is the MMS thing, then what you do is you patch the top ones of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, and this is why there's been a process over the last couple of years of Google  to move many of the Google services out of the system and into the Play Store,  so that they can update them through the Play Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's an updating thing.  Also, Google Play Services, the other thing they do is...  And I forgot the name of it.  Basically, there's an API library you can use,  which lets you call newer OS hooks for certain kinds of things,  and they patch it onto older OS versions.  So that means that if I call some new notification thing  that only exists in Ice Cream Sandwich and ARP,  they will make that work on the...  At least patch something through and not crash on the older version,  so you can call it.  So those libraries are deployed through.  Here's the workaround.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think it's such a bad workaround.  If you go into Hangouts, you go into the SMS settings,  and go down to Advanced, you can turn off automatically retrieve MMS messages.  That'll do it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, whatever your app of choice is in Hangouts.  Yeah, I'm in Hangouts, but MMS is the issue, so turn that off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See me this will hit WhatsApp as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, WhatsApp uses the rendering engine.  I don't know if it does or not.  Does it do its own?  It can't not do it.  Oh, it's part of the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, StageFright is at the core.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  StageFright is the core library.  So that's why it's got system-level access,  because basically it's got a right to chips.  Everybody uses it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although it wouldn't be a hard thing to do if you're WhatsApp to stop doing that.  Would you not be able to render at all if you turned that off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they've still got to deploy updates to 800 million people  if they've got the same issue.  Non-trivial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, this has not been seen in the wild,  despite the fact that...  And there's no proof of concept code,  because that's being saved for Black Hat or DEF CON.  But...  So it's nothing to freak out about,  but what it underscores is the difficulty Google is in  with Android being out there on so many devices,  so many old devices, and really no mechanism for fixing it.  Fixing those devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's unfortunate because you want to place blame somewhere.  And in this case, the blame lies partially in Google  for creating a system, an open environment that can be...  I hate to use the word splintered,  but can be divided up in so many different directions that it makes it difficult.  And then you can also blame the carriers and the other entities  that kind of get in the way of updating or decide,  you know what, that's 18 months old.  I'm not going to update that.  So anyone using a year and a half old phone,  which is not super duper old, is just kind of screwed.  It has to have a device that could be affected by this.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google is about to buy a fake hamburger company.  Well, it tried to.  It didn't get them.  They said, no, we're worth more than $200-300 million.  What?  It's made from plants.  Here's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't like the veggie burgers that try to act like meat.  I like the ones that admit they're vegetables.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What if it succeeded?  What if it tasted just like a real meat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would be good for the earth, I think.  It would be very good for the earth.  And for cows.  Never mind the cows on the billboards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this like the mayonnaise one?  Where they make mayonnaise out of peas and that's actually taking it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But remember, didn't Sergey put money into this guy  who was making fake muscle material?  Not fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was clone muscle.  It was real muscle, but it was cloned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  This is not the cultured beef project.  This is a company called Impossible Foods.  They make the Impossible Cheeseburger, which looked like a cheeseburger.  I don't know if it tastes like a cheeseburger.  Anybody try one of these?  And why is it...  Google says you're worth $200-300 million.  If you're worth $300 million, they say, no, no, we want more.  I agree with you, Jeff.  I've had many a veggie burger.  They fail to satisfy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wendy's is supposed to have one coming out that's like a black bean burger.  I love a black bean burger.  Black beans, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Little mushy, but I love a lot of them.  I feel like this is imminent.  This is part of the whole global climate crisis.  This is something we've got to solve.  Eating meat is so inefficient.  And yet, you're not going to get me away from that steak.  No way, no how.  So we've got to solve this.  So I'm going to say...  Who do you think is going to help me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like Germany, as you were just in, the idea of them going out without meat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my God.  I've never seen a country eat more sausages.  Yes, I love them.  Oh, I do, but I just can feel my heart peeling every time I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's probably not much trans fats in their sausages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're probably okay.  Really?  Sausages are okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a Brit talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Our British sausages have lots of healthy plant material.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One thing you can say for sausages, it does at least use the whole cow or pig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this week in diets.  But the whole saturated fat is bad for you thing is gradually being undermined.  And what they've realized is that what was really bad for you is trans fats.  And so when they try to substitute saturated fat with trans fats, that's when it got bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that funny?  We were killing people with margarine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, exactly.  So the sort of German style and Italian style sausages, which are basically tubes of pork fat,  are nowhere near as bad for you as American style sausages.  Well, good, because they're damn delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would eat tubes of pork fat all day if I could.  So Dr. Mom, it's okay if I eat salami?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Salami is supposed to be pretty good.  You're kidding me.  Read your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I was cutting out of my diet and pepperoni.  I love salami.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The other thing about salami and pepperoni is that you eat like 10 grams a number at a time.  You do not eat like a whole salami.  Well, maybe.  You cut little bits off it.  And so that's the other reason it's good for you.  Whereas if you're making any breakfast sausages, you do eat like half a pound of them.  So there's a big difference in the amount of intake you take.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of my favorite places in the world is the Food Hall at Kaufhaus des Westens, Kathe in Berlin.  It is palatial.  And the sausage area, there's just no end of sausages to pick from.  You can smell the smokiness of them.  The Debrechener is my favorite.  Oh, God.  And just a little bit of mustard on the thing and you dip it in the mustard and eat it with a little britschen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We went to the oldest Wurst Grill in...  Was it Nuremberg?  I can't remember where.  Nuremberg would be probably the little Nuremberg Wurst.  Yeah.  Oh, and those Nuremberg sausages.  You know, there's a battle over whether Nuremberg...  Maybe this was in Passau, but man, they were so...  I have a picture.  I'm going to make you all hungry.  But they put it on a sauerkraut.  So maybe that will turn some people off.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was so good.  But also, the hotel breakfast in Germany are like, here's a giant plate of firm sausages.  Make yourself a sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're saying, though, that I shouldn't stay away from the carbs.  That's just eat the meat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, there are diets that say that.  Basically, the broad advice that I've got from this is that the dietary pyramid has been  misdesigned for about 40 years and it has too much carbs in it.  And so you want to adjust the balance of carb, fat, and protein.  And the problem is that most of the time you diet, you cut the fat, you increase the protein  a bit, and you end up eating more carbs as a ratio.  So you want to look at the ratio between the three.  That's the stuff that I got from the diet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat room lives in Germany says, we don't eat a lot of sausages.  We eat Doner.  That's true.  There's a Turkish Doner shop on every corner in Germany.  That is also true.  So I'll agree with you on that.  And I do love Doner.  This was the sausage.  They look like those little Nuremberg sausages.  I can't remember where it was.  Wurstkugel.  And the beer was good.  But you know what the best part of that was?  The mustard.  I'd never had such a good mustard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The mustard is the greatest.  It's just to die for.  In fact, it is to die for.  It's the beer you should stay away from, though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the one with the carbs in it.  There you go.  You can't win.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You only got the little Stein.  You didn't get the mass one.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She actually warned me.  The waitress said, no, you don't want that.  They knew.  They knew ahead of time.  All right.  Enough with this vegan Wurst, although that would be a fun show.  Oh, yes.  My son actually is already bidding for that show.  He wants to do a show on cured meats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I always wanted to open a restaurant that was nothing but stuffed meat things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google is getting stuffed meats.  What's a stuffed meat?  Well, you know, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, meat stuffed into things.  Dumplings, broogies.  Stop it.  All that stuff.  Google Street View is now mapping pollution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Doesn't that make sense?  All the cars going everywhere.  They put sensors in the cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That makes sense.  Electric cars now.  What if Google had a deal with UPS or the Postal Service to put sensors on all their  vehicles?  What could they learn?  This is big data.  Let's have everything collecting data all over the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is big data.  Let's have everything collecting data all the time.  The initial trial was in Denver.  Three cars with air quality sensors drove around for 750 hours.  It was part of it.  Adding pollution all the time.  Yeah, I know.  Let's do electric cars.  Is it these electric cars?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  They're doing this in conjunction with Aclima.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What if you put sensors on all the buses?  Oh, wait, they're diesel buses.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  All right.  So, now that you're getting a smarter Google, Google search can now tell you if a store  is crowded.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How do they know that?  Because of maps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they know where you are.  Well, do they know where everybody else is, too?  Yes, exactly.  I mean, it's basically something to be done with traffic.  If you look at the traffic stuff, they tell you where people are in cars based on where  their phones are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They know that the best time to go would be like five o'clock or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Foursquare has done this for ages.  Oh, really?  I asked Dennis and Dennis said, yeah, we've been doing this forever.  If you look at the venues...  They know when it's busy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Foursquare only has Foursquare data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, Google has more data.  So, Foursquare has Foursquare and Swarm data, which is fewer people than Google has.  But they do now have ambient data as well as check-in data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Business hours and popular hours have been on the Foursquare web and mobile venue pages  forever, according to Dennis Crowley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if you actually sign up, if you claim your venue on Foursquare, part of what they  give you is here's the traffic from people and people check in.  Oh, that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I'd like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a very handy thing as a business owner.  You can see where they...  When people are coming and what people are saying about you as well and so on.  So, people are saying what you can see directly, but the traffic stuff is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, Google's gotten more powerful.  You can now use OK Google to send messages via WhatsApp, WeChat, Next Plus, Telegram, and Viber.  How do you do that, Jason?  You say, OK, Google, send a message via Viber?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, send a WhatsApp message to blank.  No answer message here.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That presumably means...  Is that unilateral on Google's part or does WhatsApp have to cooperate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the developers have to cooperate by building in the appropriate code.  Every Android app should allow something.  Is there an intent for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just to send a message in 10?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It must be in a 10, yeah.  Yeah, it must be in a 10.  Yeah, Google's been doing this over the last couple of months, kind of opening up the voice actions a little bit here and there to different apps.  70 apps now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Breaking News, Zipcar, Spotify, TuneIn, YouTube, All Recipes, Runkeeper, Job, and these will all show up on Google Now as well.  That's nice. Love that.  App integration makes it even more useful.  Let's take a break, come back with more.  Jeff Jarvis, Kevin Marks, Leo Laporte, we're talking The Google, running a little late today.  So we'll get through these next...  It's Clippy's fault.  I installed Windows 10 and I could not end Windows weekly until I completed it.  Which meant it was like a long show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I was trying to fix my microphone problem on the machine. I decided to rebuild it. It took about 38 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stop it. Shut up. You got Google Chromebook there.  That is one nice thing about Chromebook.  Although, you know, Apple still doesn't do this.  Apparently they're going to. But right now Windows, when you log into your Windows account, and you kind of have to if you're going to use Windows, it knows all your stuff.  I got my desktop wallpaper. I got Facebook connected. All the things that were connected just stayed connected, which is kind of nice.  I might be using more Windows 10. I have to say I'm impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple does that too. But you've got to tell it where it's getting it from, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You can go through your account. Add accounts, add accounts, add accounts.  Chrome does it brilliantly.  Chrome is so easy on a Chromebook. But the Chromebook stores nothing anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's just. Yeah. But also Android. When I got Rosie the Nexus 7, when I booted it up, it says, and logged in as her, it said, do you want to get everything off your phone?  So it was able to get all the stuff off a Samsung phone and install the apps from that and get most of it there without having to do much fiddling with it afterwards.  Which is how I found that three of the apps didn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, no, I like that. I, you know, that's one thing I do.  And I'm sure Jason, you do every few weeks is set up a new phone. And it's really nice. It's become easier and easier and easier.  It has become easier. I sometimes do it just for fun.  You would.  I'm going to watch Game of Thrones tonight. Let me let me wipe my phone and start over.  I just feel like sometimes it really sometimes like the S6. I keep doing that to the Galaxy S6 because that thing has so many problems.  And I just keep wiping and starting over and it's good for a while. And then it starts getting messed up.  Really?  I think it's something to do.  They're using this Exynos processor, but there's actually it's two processors, two dual core processors, and they default to the slow one unless you need more power than the kick into the fast one.  And I think the handoff isn't very good. And you can feel the phone get really hot as the and the battery.  You can almost watch it go down as it switches to the fast processor.  But I think the back and forth hand out handoff isn't done well.  That's my guess. I don't know.  Samsung is in deep doo doo. I'll be honest with you. I feel like they're just I don't know who's going to take over.  But, you know, they just maybe maybe Motorola.  Motorola is doing the right thing. They're making it a pure phone.  Our show today brought to you, my friends, by PagerDuty. Are you on PagerDuty?  Nobody I think nobody carries a pager anymore, but all of us have had the experience of being on call.  Maybe not all of us. If you haven't, you you are lucky.  Being on call is tough. PagerDuty makes it better.  Don't hate the pager. Hate the game.  If you're on call, you will love PagerDuty. Get the boss to take a look at this.  It decreases the alerting noise for IT operations for developers.  Make sure that the right person is notified at the right time.  It's nice because it integrates with everything you use. We use New Relic.  It integrates with that Nagios keynote app dynamics. You even have there's over 100 ready to use integrations,  but you even have the capability of rolling your own. They've got very nice APIs with PagerDuty.  When an incident occurs, PagerDuty actually looks at the on call schedule.  And then it looks at your personalized alerting preferences.  So the right team member is notified in the right way.  And if that person doesn't respond, PagerDuty will automatically escalate issues to another team member until it is responded to.  It's smart. You could dispatch alerts.  I guess you could probably still use a pager, but also automated phone calls, SMS, emails,  push notifications, which means you can be on call, but be there if you need it.  Decrease the noise too because incidents are automatically filtered and deduped.  So only actionable alerts are delivered.  Great analytics tools means you can proactively make system improvements to prevent future issues.  That's nice too. And boy, is it relentless when it comes to reliability.  You can depend on PagerDuty fully distributed across multiple data centers, multiple hosting providers,  multiple contact method providers per method.  Yeah, PagerDuty is robust, reliable and very smart.  You can fully customize it to fit you and your team, regardless of size or location.  That's why Microsoft uses them. GitHub uses them. Boeing, Nike, Pinterest, Box.  You'll see the list at PagerDuty.com slash twit.  Sign up for a free two week trial or just sign up for as little as 19 a month.  Increase your uptime with PagerDuty. PagerDuty.com slash twit.  And if you want that, don't hate the pager, hate the game.  Sign up at PagerDuty.com for a new account. You'll get the t-shirt for free.  It's a great t-shirt.  When you go to the PagerDuty site to watch the videos, they have some very great.  They really, it's the kind of company you'd like. It's great.  PagerDuty.com slash twit.  Google Translate now translates printed text in 27 languages.  I had it all set up. I had the sign reader set up when I went to Germany and Austria and Hungary.  I had the talk thing. Have you ever used the talk thing?  Oh yeah, I have.  So it's like you've got a simultaneous translator in your phone.  You speak and then it says it in German.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course you didn't have to use it in German because everybody in Germany speaks English.  Better English than I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Amazing.  We use it in Sweden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Same thing in Scandinavia. You know what?  What I realize now is everybody around the world has a better educational system than we do.  We used to have the best education.  Higher education is free in Germany.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know if you want to get a higher education, you can. It's free.  And you see the results because that is a well-run country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well the language thing is fascinating as well because something we've been talking about with IndieWeb is how do I mark up my page when it's in different languages?  Right.  And most of us are imperfectly multilingual.  We speak one language well and some other languages a bit.  And some people are very, very fluent in multiple languages.  But Google has baked into it this weird assumption that every web page is in a single language.  And if you actually go to their webmaster device, it says make different pages in different languages.  And then they don't respect the markup you put in the page to say what language it's in.  They run it through their guess what language this is program.  And then they'll say this page is in Japanese.  Do you want to translate it?  Right.  Which means if you've got a page that is generally in a mixture of languages, it will fail on you because it says this page is in Japanese.  It only translates the Japanese bits.  But also it doesn't take into account the fact that most people in the world do understand multiple languages to different degrees.  It has this sort of very monoculture, monolingual approach that is very American to some extent.  I mean English too.  Making it one of the worst speaking English was part of the British Empire.  Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you very much.  It made life very easy for me in school.  If you go to the first link under my numbers, I'm not going to use it anyway.  Don't worry.  It's the new Google News Lab has a right a way to see what languages are used for queries on search in what cities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, how interesting.  What is this?  This is Shanghai.  Number one search in Shanghai by a long shot is English.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this is also what is based on Google.  Oh, that's 2004.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's let's zip ahead.  You know, it's interesting.  Got bigger for a little while in 2008, 2009.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now in 2015, actually, English is kind of a weird one because like most people in China aren't using Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  English, Japanese, German, French.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The only people using Google in Shanghai will be tourists.  Oh, OK.  Google from.  So if you go up to the cities, let's use a different city.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What would be good?  Berlin, New York, Berlin.  Paris is going to be all French.  Oh, look at that.  A lot of German searches.  Wasn't that way in the early days of the Web?  That was kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I tell you what you should try.  Yeah.  Geneva.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What language they speak in Geneva.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, they don't have Geneva.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll try London.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just curious.  Paris has got to be like 100 percent French, right?  They don't even bother telling you they can't.  It's like I can't be bothered.  I'm busy.  Where should I try?  Delhi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That'd be interesting.  I was trying to try London because London's a very polyglot city.  I think I broke it.  You broke it.  Yes.  It's not rendering.  The JavaScript graphs aren't loading.  I broke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't like JavaScript too much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's another rant.  But I will stick my language rant for now.  I have London up.  The other thing that Google does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at London.  English is like not even, there's no second best.  There we go.  There's something.  Well, it changes over time.  See, in the early days of the Web, you didn't have much choice, right?  You had to use English.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  2011 English shrunk, Spanish grew.  And then, wow, English.  Yeah, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Should we just mandate that English is the international language and just leave it at that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there's this weird thing that Google used to do.  Still does to some extent.  When you travel, it switches you to the local website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it did that to me.  I was in Germany.  And he says, oh, you're in Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You obviously want Google.ge.  It's like, no.  And part of that is that they assume that everyone's browser is set to English by default.  So they'll try and give you a more sensible local default.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they don't pay attention to the regionalization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they do pay attention to the regionalization except when it's set to English.  So if you set it to German, I think you'll get German in America.  But setting it to English, you're out of luck.  But there is a lot of silliness around this.  So there is the assumption because they have, especially when you're logged in, they know who I am.  They know what languages I search in.  I've got a prep on my phone.  Yet somehow they decide that, oh, no, we'll give you a German UI for this.  The even funnier one is Switzerland, where I'm not sure this is still true.  But it used to be true that if you go to Switzerland and go to Amazon, they give you German.  Even if you're in the French speaking bit of Switzerland or the Italian speaking bit of Switzerland,  they decided that German was the language you have to speak if you're using Amazon in Switzerland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's a mistake, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's this sort of nice simplifying assumption that you make if you're an engineer and you're not thinking very hard.  Talking about chauvinism.  Country equals language, which is not even true for America.  Something like something where between 20 percent and 30 percent of Americans speak another language a lot of the time in the home.  And many more than that actually are able to speak them.  So it is this sort of strange monoglot assumption, which is based on the fact that that's the people who are executives of their company.  And so that hasn't been challenged strongly, up to now.  There is still this assumption that you're speaking one language, which is strange because as the companies grow, this needs to change.  But there's still this assumption that each web page is in a single language, and that's how things should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is the social web acid test?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The social web acid test. I'm glad you asked.  Swat?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Play the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Play the video. The video is only like a minute and a half long.  So play this. You need sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because it's got music.  This is a demo.  Ben takes a photo of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ben Wordmiller takes a photo of Aaron Pericke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ben Roberts, I'm sorry.  So this is the way he does tags.  And what's supposed to happen is that I get a notification that I was tagged in a photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even from a different website, not from Facebook, just from a website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is what happened on my phone.  So I get that notification.  And step three is somebody sees that photo in their reader.  This is already one of the remote participants.  And whoever sees that is going to post a reply in that reader.  I like the music.  So I really want to push my luck here.  Is anybody confirmed they're going to send a comment on IRB?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at all the comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And is that using IndiePub? I mean, SubPubHub, SubPubHub, SubPubHub?  I'll explain that in a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So he's got notifications on his phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So now if I go back to the computer.  Or you could just use Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There they are.  Hey.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hey.  Sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what reader would they use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They had Sign into Woodwind.  This is what they saw on their reader was this post.  And that is a fully functioning demo of Swat0 across three different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The social web asset tests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Three different locations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Kevin, explain it all.  Two locations.  Two personal sites, three locations.  Victory for IndieWebCamp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the music was actually composed by Aaron as well, which is kind of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's called An Ordinary Day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He composed it for a different film project, but then he decided it fit really well.  So the point of this is this is something that was defined in 2010.  At the point where we were talking about federated social networks,  which is back in the open social days when we were all trying to make these things work together  before Facebook was the hegemony it is now.  And the test is explained as that series of steps.  Ben takes a photograph.  He tags Aaron. Aaron gets notified.  Other people see the thing in the stream, comment on it,  and then both Ben and Aaron get notified that that has happened.  So it's this flow that happens very naturally on Facebook  because Facebook is a single system and does that.  And the challenge is how do you make this work across multiple different systems?  And so that's what's going on there is a set of different protocols we're using in IndieWeb to do that.  So there's there's micro power to post to the sites.  There's web mention, which is how I say I've noticed I've done something to you on my side.  I've tagged you with that.  So in the first case, Ben posted photograph.  He tags it to say it's a photograph of Aaron.  So he puts a person tag on it that says Aaron Parecki dot com.  And then he sends a web mention to Aaron's website.  And so then Aaron has a process running that detects he's had that web mention  and sends a notification to his phone so he can go and look at it.  The commenting bit that's done with another site.  There's a IndieWeb reader now. There's a couple of them.  But the one that we used in that demo is Kyle's reader, which is reader dot Carl WM dot com.  And you log into that with your IndieWeb site and then you subscribe to feeds.  And then it gives you a feed reading experience and it gives you a little comment,  retweet like box at the bottom, which uses micro power to post the comments and the retweets and the likes.  And they would go back to the person whose post you've given them on, which was the third stage of that.  We were Aaron got the notification.  Well, Aaron got the notification. Sorry.  Ben got the notification because it was his post.  And then Aaron got a notification because Ben put that comment on his post saying that these people  have commented and then re-sent the notification to Aaron that the post had changed so he could detect that change and show it.  So it's like the pen and teller thing where they do the three balls trick and you go, that's clever.  And then they show you how they did it and then you go, wow, that was really complicated.  It's a bit like that with this.  The point is that if you're doing it in a single system, this is just a bunch of database queries that happens within the system.  And you can build that thing and it's a known thing.  So if you're building something like Twitter or Facebook in a single system, doing this stuff is work.  I'm just saying it's not work and getting the user interface right is hard, but it's something that's straightforward to build.  Doing it in such a way that works between sites is a different kind of work because you've got to agree what the protocols are for these different pieces.  You've got to work out what different kinds of notifications there are and write things to handle that.  And so this has been this has been a test that was set up as a thing to pass in the same way that acid tests were set up for browsers to integrate to pass.  Five years ago and at Indy webcam, I think it was two weeks ago, Indy webcam in Portland.  We finally got all the pieces together.  I was just saying one place, but actually it was also distributed.  Ben was posting from New York.  Kyle, who responded, was in San Francisco and Aaron was in Portland.  And I think Amy responded as well when she was in the in the UK in Brighton.  So there was this whole like it was.  And it wasn't just a demonstration.  The point is that we've now got these protocols and we're using this stuff all the time.  So we now got the building blocks that we can put together to build these kinds of systems across multiple different sites.  So I think I think that's I'm excited by it because it's a demonstration, but it's also showing people that the kind of things they do every day and Facebook can be done elsewhere.  So we just got to work on the one point five billion users thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cool.  I feel like we've all given up on the Federated Web, but well, you're using it.  I love it.  But I just feel like most people are just going to say, well, why not just use Facebook?  It's like it's sad to me.  And I think you're fighting a good fight.  But sometimes I feel like maybe you're Don Quixote tilting at windmills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, the thing is that, you know, at the point when we when they wrote this test, you'd have said, why not just use MySpace in 2010?  Yeah, in 2010.  So that's the assumption that the silos are permanent is a mistake that we shouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We shouldn't. I agree.  We should fight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So making sure that the biggest is I talk about like a fragility debt.  So you've got the idea of technical debt where you build something and you sweep the bugs out of the carpet until it blows up in your face.  The fragility debt is the same thing where you rely on a particular system for a long time and you gradually move everything into that.  And then suddenly it changes and the world has been pulled out from under you.  And that is a problem that we have.  We've seen that in tech many times, whether it's a system version, obsolescing an app, whether it's the one that hurt me was Apple discontinuing iDisk.  And suddenly a whole bunch of data I had went away and my website went down and so on.  So it is this thing where you can you can rely on these.  I'm not saying don't use Facebook.  Indie Web doesn't say that at all.  What it says is use your own site and share copies out to Facebook and make sure to Twitter and make sure that you can read stuff back so that if those systems delete your account or go down or get acquired and change their idea of what they're doing,  you haven't lost everything. So it's a it's a it's a defense in depth thing.  It's the sense of having having only your own web presence is important.  It's not important to everyone in the same way.  It's important to those of us who publish on the web all the time.  But having that option is good and being able to store your store your things in a way that isn't completely reliant on one company continuing in the direction they're continuing is important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis, you were at VidCon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was. I was.  How was that?  It was cool. I wish I'd gone before.  This is your first time.  Of course, 99.9 percent of them are teenage girls, which is odd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say, you know, I'm I know I'm the old radio old media guy who's mocking YouTube and the YouTube fan base and they'll never fly.  And one piece of evidence that people like me use is all those teen girls in the front row.  But on the other hand, the Beatles teen girls kind of like the Beatles and they seem to have legs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it's so so I I Howard Stern, as you may know, makes fun of podcasts and the Internet and I were on Stern.  So I called Stern.  I think it was on Monday.  Yeah, people were telling me, hey, Jarvis mentioned you guys.  I plugged Twig because I said, listen, these are these real businesses.  And what did he say to that?  No, they're not a size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he because what he does, I would know, but he's on satellite radio and I've never been able to listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He does say, oh, watch it, watch it.  He does an old fart thing where he says, you know, his podcasting is BS.  And if you really want to work in radio, you have to get a job in broadcast and you have to get an audience there.  You have to prove yourself and learn your ropes like I did.  And I called it and I said, Howard, you're the one who killed radio broadcast.  You killed it. You're the man who killed it.  And for you to expect people to do what you did after you've already killed it and pulled the ladder up behind you, that's that's gone.  And I said, plus, this stuff is really big.  And I said, I went to VidCon.  They all started laughing.  You know, what costume did you wear?  I said, it's not Comic Con.  Yeah.  And and I said, these things are based, you know, like who?  So I mentioned PewDiePie at all week.  He's been ever.  He constantly has some kind of beauty pie.  He's been pushing PewDiePie.  The joke was PewDiePie just bought Howard Stern.  But he's you know, they don't think how much money makes seven million dollars a year, seven point eight, five million dollars a year.  And oh, and how many followers does he have?  Thirty eight million people follow him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And and, you know, granted, I should point out that at his peak in radio, Howard had about 20 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And and Sirius is approaching 30 million total subscribers.  Granted, those people pay every month.  Right.  You know, not at all comparable, but pretty amazing.  And I mentioned you and I mentioned, you know, check Jake Uygur, who I interviewed on stage about the Young Turks.  And you both have fairly similar businesses in size and scale.  And they're good businesses.  And and there's a future here.  And so I also yell at Howard saying, why the heck do you want to be a wage slave if he and I long before Jason Calacanis ever said this just recently?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very nice by Jason, in which he said, how would you just do on demand on Spotify?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I've been arguing to the for.  You know, I think I reveal this when his country last time was to be renewed.  His people contacted me and I introduced his people to the top echelon at Google.  And nothing came of it.  But but imagine Stern on YouTube, imagine.  So I said, well, why are you sharing?  He said, I got a paycheck.  I said, yeah, but you're sharing the value and the revenue was serious.  You should have your own empire.  You should own your own thing.  People like me would pay.  It's really true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If Howard did an app.  I would think he'd make more money because I would listen to Howard Stern, but I can't because I don't have serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He would keep more money.  Yeah, I pay I pay 12 bucks a month or whatever it is.  Now it's probably 15 bucks a month for all I know on three autos, all kinds of things.  Plus for the online to serious for one reason.  Howard Stern.  Yes, I'm not that devoted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if there were a Howard Stern app, I might listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Though though, the thing is, I imagine if Stern did leave his contract is about up.  If he did leave, what I keep serious a year or two years ago, I would have said, yeah, because I don't listen to broadcast.  I said to him, by the way, he said, well, broadcast is still big.  I said, crap.  And it's crap.  It's well, yeah, it is.  That's not that big.  No.  The thing is, three years ago, I was getting into broadcasting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So again, well, yeah, but as a last ditch effort to save a dying business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the book costing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I heard from a perfect example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A public radio executive had listened to me on Stern.  I love it when NPR people love Stern to Ira Glass, love Stern, an executive from elsewhere in public radio and said that he gives millions of dollars a year in fees to podcasters.  And now he's at the point of putting podcasters on the air just to make the air cool.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's the flip that you want to see at VidCon.  That's the flip.  That's when these guys become bigger than broadcast.  And I got to tell you, it's going to happen any minute now because just about them touring.  That was weird.  But just look at what kids are.  First of all, anybody under 18 is not watching TV at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My daughter took me through all the things she watches.  There's amazing.  There was one with big red lips and she interviewed Jerry Seinfeld.  I can't remember her name.  So there was a great moment when Katie Couric interviewed Ze Frank on stage.  And so Ze just looked at it at one point and said, what happened with the world?  Ze is there running.  He's an old timer now too.  Yeah, he's running motion pictures for BuzzFeed and he's trying to like like vice.  He's trying to create shows on broadcast.  And Katie is on the Internet.  He said, what happened here?  They crossed streams, so to speak.  And so VidCon also.  Here's what got me, Leo.  My epiphany from VidCon was it wasn't my epiphany.  It was from the stage.  It was from the Green Brothers and others on stage.  And I think Ze Frank too.  It's not as if what they said was when you share video of this sort of YouTube,  you're not saying to somebody, this is very good content.  You should watch this content because I recommend it.  What you're doing is social signaling to say this says something about me and my relationship  and what I think of you by sending this to you.  And the content is a social tool.  And Jake Uygur realizes that you realize that broadcast will never realize that just as newspapers can't realize it.  And it makes you think differently about what video is and why it's there.  It's a social token.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That sure ended the conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it is a well, it's exactly it's a thing that you use as a shared currency of experience.  As you say, I saw the thing to use this thing, which is, you know, you used to be network television was the way you did that.  And now it's the Internet and it's memes and it's things like that.  But it is also all these other channels and things that we have no idea existed.  The one that got me was the digital stuff.  You know about that.  So digital is that there's a good article which I'm trying to find.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're talking about Digital Equipment Corp. I remember that.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Digitore, D-I-G-I-Tore.  Basically, this is a company that set up the idea of taking these video online video people around to do live shows, which they sell tickets to.  And they also sell a meet the star experience for two hundred dollars or something, which is basically you line up and get to take a selfie with the star of this video show.  And they they're calling it and it's it's and they're not like they're not selling out stadiums, but they're doing lots of tours around lots of towns and lots of parents are bringing their teenagers to the shows to see this.  And the shows don't even make any sense. It's just the point is that you have you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This reminds me a lot of in the early days of rock and roll, entrepreneurs would put together these kinds of tours where each band would play three songs and be screaming girls.  This was a very this was in the early days of rock.  This is what was going on exactly this.  And it wasn't a huge audiences, but it was the beginning of something.  You know, I don't know if I don't know if this is it, but I do feel like there's something's happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I watched I watched one of the grandmothers of this world is I just seen and you know, 31 and a grandma.  I know she's been around. I just I adore you. I'm not. I'm just joking.  But it was one I just sat in one of our sessions from the entertainment weekly stage, by the way, at VidCon and just watched her interacting with her with her people.  She is amazing. Yes. She's just so warm and so enthusiastic.  And the combination of the girls who adore her and the boys who have terrible crushes on her, obviously, and she's been doing this for years and she turned into a book and she turns around and she's doing, you know, the slaps.  The thing that VidCon is that there's three layers of VidCon.  There's the community level, which is the fan, which is the twenty three thousand girls.  There's the creator level. And then there's the industry level.  The industry level is old white men like me all trying to divvy up the money of the two floors below.  And the and the news layer. I mean, the the the creator there was fascinating.  I went to a news panel with people on there who, you know, was one snippy journalist.  I saw a symbol journalist with a lowercase J.  These people are reinventing news. And then on the lowest level, they're they're they you you sign up at a lottery, as I understand it, and you give your top choices for the YouTube stars you want to see.  And then you get you in and you get a wristband and the wristband cannot be mangled in any way.  If you if you want to give it to a friend, if you want to trade with a friend, the friend has to be with you at the moment they're put on.  And once they're on, that's the star you're seeing and nobody else.  And then they go and they line up as Kevin just said, just to have the selfies.  This is just all about teenage girls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just put the link in the in the chat. But this is there's a great article on BuzzFeed by Ellen Cushing about this, where she went on the road with this digital thing around different places with these with this crowd.  And it's fascinating, fascinating read to me because it is this thing makes so this you know they sold one hundred and twenty thousand tickets for this thing.  And it is a bunch of teenagers in a van going on stage and saying hi to people. They're not really, you know, there's no performance really.  But the performance is at a school talent show level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's also like a key rock. It's like a radio van going around and you can watch the watch the jocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a showcase. It's not. Yeah, that's all it is.  But it's so it's a sign that something's happening. It's not the end of the line by any means.  I'm the wrong guy to ask, because I, you know, and I think Howard, frankly, I know with all with all due respect, Jeff, I know you love Howard, but he's oh it's he's he's it's it's like saying, hey, Ed Sullivan, I think there's something going on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But he's got his thing and he's done and he's made plenty of money. He doesn't need to do it. He's sixty one years old. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. But as you know, as am I. So it's not we're the wrong ones to talk to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I'm saying to him, I'm saying to you, but there's one more.  There's one more big innovation left in him.  There's one. He's there really.  He's a guy. Push him. Yeah. And the reason I push him is one big star like Howard, one big star like Howard could prove the business efficacy of the Internet.  Yeah. And as as entertainment.  And I think that, you know, the satellite was nowhere.  He came. They had a couple hundred thousand subscribers. He came on. They're approaching 30 million.  He built that. It really was Howard who did that.  And then the same thing can happen.  I think if it is as Howard, it's Oprah, it's, you know, name who it is.  A big name star who says, screw it. I'm not going on the Internet.  I'm going to own it all. I mean, the one person who's gone come the closest is Louis C.K.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would say. Yeah, I don't really even I think that's sort of irrelevant because whether Howard Stern gets involved or not, it's going to happen.  This, by the way, this stuff is all hormonal. This VidCon stuff.  It's just hormones.  But so T and as is most teen culture, as was Beatles.  And so was it. So was the Beatles.  So but I do think that you're really close to the transition right now.  And I'm sure network television executives are well aware of this where people just aren't going to watch TV.  They're going to watch YouTube. They're going to watch, you know, six second Vine videos.  They're going to. And what's interesting to me mostly about these guys is they're learning how to create for a new medium.  No one ever told me that you someday six second videos would be the platform.  If had they, I would have said, well, good luck with that.  Yet it divine stars, as we've talked about before, are genuine stars.  There's no question about it. I would hate if when you tell me, oh, YouTube, you should build your business on YouTube.  I would say to you, yeah, until Google decides to cut ad revenues in half or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, right. Well, that's the IndieWave argument again.  It's like you want you want take advantage of the platforms that exist and put your stuff on there, but use them as a stepping stone to build a broadband, you know, which I just seen is a great example of that.  You know, she was bootstrapped herself on Justin TV.  She was the justine of the replace Justin, but has gradually moved herself across a bunch of different platforms because she is, you know, she is good at this.  She's a consummate performer and a very nice person who does relate to people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that is part of it as well. It's all about, frankly, from her end and my end, and we just interviewed justine on triangulation last week, if you want.  And I think I could take a little bit of credit for discovering justine.  She says, and I agree, and it's true for us that what we do is a community building.  It's not viral video. It's community building viral video has is something that a lot of people and a lot of these teens are good at viral video.  But, you know, if you look at her views, some of her things have 15 million.  Some of them have one million. The vast majority are in the tens and hundreds of thousands of views.  That's not where the money is. It's in a lot of other things. It's community building.  Howard has a community will follow him anywhere, but he's already built that that's done.  He doesn't. He's sharing it with serious. Yeah. Well, that's his decision.  I think he made a little money on that deal. Four hundred million. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, I see. Here's the thing. A lot of that money was made in stock that they didn't give him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, how much did he make? A hundred million? Yeah, probably. OK.  So he's OK. He's not hurting. No, no.  He's not going to be the guy who changes the things and it's not going to be Seinfeld comedians.  No, it's somebody who comes along. No, that's it's going to be somebody you never heard of.  And it might not even be these kids going around in these showcases at VidCon.  But that's going to happen regardless. It will happen because how we consume content has changed dramatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And back to to. So I'm trying to buy a new car now because my 10 year 11 year old Toyota is near its death.  No air conditioning in this weather. I'm about to do it. By the way, I think I'm getting an Audi. Oh, you'll love it.  But I talked about this when you were gone. The problem I have with Jason problem I have is the only car that now has Android Auto is the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hyundai Sonata. Don't get that. And Android Auto is not such a it's gingerbread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no. Android Auto, I thought was OK.  You're a fool. So we talked about this last week with Kevin Toffle and Ron Amati.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ron wrote his review. You should read his Ars Technica. Very nice review of Android Auto.  One of the things he discovers is that the operating system and running in the car is Android Gingerbread.  Wow. And and this is to me more telling because everybody has to work with the highway transportation safety board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very limited what it can do. Yeah, that's the problem. Better to put your phone up and just put it in the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Phone will do anything you want. Right. Don't don't worry about getting it to come show up on the screen in your car.  That's I think a mistake. Well, that'll come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you what you want is a Chromecast like thing, which which to be fair, it is close to being the Android is that but you want this thing that is showing from you from your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'll never see, for instance, you'll never you'll never see a lot of apps on that screen because they won't let that happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. I agree with that. But all I'm saying is this. So my the car I have now doesn't even have it does not even have an aux plug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yes, you can get better. Just Bluetooth is all you really need. If you get the audio, you're good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So at that point, do I need serious when I have if I have no data?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why do you think I don't pay for satellite radio? I have it in every car. If I want music, I listen to Spotify.  And by the way, T-Mobile gives you unlimited data. It doesn't charge you for data for 30.  Was it for most music, including Apple Music and Spotify or Google Music?  Streaming free. Yes. Wow. Anybody who nobody.  Nobody. This is radio's dead. Satellite radio's deader than dead.  The whole thing is completely changing because we we consume media differently.  Last night, I was watching a TV show on cable because I'm an old man and Michael comes in who's 12.  And we start watching YouTube videos on my big screen because I have an Android TV device, the Nvidia Shield.  And that's what we watch is YouTube videos. That's what he wants to see.  I don't think Michael has ever watched a TV show ever.  How about you, Chris? Do you ever watch TV? Chris is 17.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do watch TV. I don't. I watch HBO. I watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so he's watching some cable cable channels. But you're too old.  You're 17 now. You're too old. Oh, you don't watch it on cable. You watch it on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I watch it on Netflix. Yeah, my sons will like my son got into.  It's always sunny in Philadelphia. So he watched the whole thing on Netflix from beginning to end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chris, what do you watch on YouTube? You're not you're not watching the VidCon stars.  You're watching something else on YouTube. What do you watch on YouTube?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I watch a lot of radio content. I watch. He's too old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I watch that Let's Play stuff. Let's Play. That's what he watches. Yeah, of course.  You're a gamer, but everybody I think of your generation. I watch some blog stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you? I watch like a pretty huge variety. I look at my son. He's 21.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He grew up watching grew up watching a lot of YouTube video stars.  What's the the ones where they make disgusting meals? Epic Meal Time.  Stuff like that, which I think is juvenile and stupid and not particularly well created or funny.  But that's because I'm an old fart. I find it's fascinating, isn't it?  Hey, we got to take a break. There's so much more I wanted to talk about.  But we'll just have to come back and do this next week. Is that OK? Yeah. OK.  It's one of the reasons I really like having a weekly show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, the first one can be a little challenge for you.  So let's see if we can get this working.  Okay.  Reader.KyleWM.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Say it again. Reader.Kyle.  Kyle. I'll type it in the chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kyle. WM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is that news reader that you guys were talking about or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, that we saw in the video.  Woodwind. Yes. So go to that. You got to log in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So log in with your known site.  I have my known site set up and I have all of the right links and the rels and everything done.  So that should work for you.  Okay. This is...  Yeah, the rel equals me. Yep.  You don't have to blur my phone number. Everybody knows it.  Okay. Because I can get a verification code. Let me do that by a phone.  And that's the fastest, easiest way to do this.  I love that system, by the way. Yeah.  That is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you about it afterwards, but there's some twisters on that coming too.  But log in with that for now.  Known is the easiest way to get this done. So now you've got a feed reader.  And you have to follow somebody. You have to put your rel into follow.  And then it gives you feeds and it'll follow H feeds from IndieWeb people.  So I should join...  You need to go back to where you were. Hang on. Where did you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've successfully authenticated. Congratulations. What's next?  Create a sign in form to use indiauth.com to sign people in. No.  Did I something wrong go wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, go back to...  It should have redirected you back to reader.carwm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sign in to Woodwind.  Okay, keep... Just talk about it.  These things happen.  But it's RSS feeds that it reads?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It reads H feeds and it reads RSS and Adam feeds.  Okay, so I've authenticated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Allow IndieAuth access.  Is there a button I should...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You should just be able to pick one of those green ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've clicked a few of them now.  Oh, all right.  Oh, God. No, you don't log into that one as well.  I have to log into this. That's okay. GitHub. Okay.  IndieAuth. Sign...  Kate, anything else you'd like to talk about?  Oh, dear. This isn't working well, is it?  Well, it's early days yet.  So, okay, so...  I mean, let him talk, and I will pursue this a little farther.  Can I show you my screen?  No, don't do that. You will regret it deeply.  Okay.  All right, I'm going to use Twitter now to authenticate, or Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google+, it usually works fairly well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I keep getting back to this IndieAuth... I think something's broken.  You know what? Here's the problem. Everybody watching the show is doing it.  And we probably just broke whatever back end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I warned Carl that was about to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can warn people, but nobody really fully understands the power of Twitter.  Yeah, it's not working.  So, just describe it. I've attempted to authenticate on every platform. It doesn't work.  So, basically, it's a feed reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But once you authenticate with your site,  it also gives you the reply-like retweet buttons on it.  But those post to your own site.  So, that's what it does.  So, that's the advantage of that.  If you look at my feed now,  known.kevinbox.com,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you'll see that most of it is little responses I've written to other people's posts,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because that's how I'm using it now.  Nice.  I will stop there.  I'm going to go back to the chat.  I'm going to go back to the chat.  So, you can see the response to the post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then if you click through to those posts,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you'll see that my comments have appeared on them and so on.  Okay, so sorry that was a bit of a down-script.  I'll get to try it out.  One of the things that we are working on with IndieWeb  is improving that auth experience and making it simpler for people  who've got something installed.  Because the initial version of it was assuming  you're hosting your own site,  so you want to piggyback on someone else's auth like Google's or Twitter's or whatever.  If you're hosting with a site that actually has its own auth,  we're going to have a shorter path for that.  And Kyle, the reader, has been building that with SiloPub,  so that if you log in with a WordPress site,  it'll just use the WordPress auth for it rather than reading it through a second auth as well.  So, there's bits of that coming. When we've got that working, I'll come back and show you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what? I know what's wrong.  I have to use www.leoville.net.  So, that's my bad. My fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. That's an issue with known.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it an issue with known or an issue with hosted?  No, it's not me. I know it's...  Well, it could be me. I don't know.  Please enter a URL. Now it really is confused.  I think we did break it, actually.  Oh, good.  So, it's not working.  So, I can subscribe to my own feeds?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you could do that. That's kind of redundant.  You could subscribe to my feed.  But he likes listening to himself.  It's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, I'll subscribe to you. What is the URL I should use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  known.kevinmarks.com is me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, these have to be specially set up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you put it for HEDB.com slash in front.  Sorry. That's a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really? Come on, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, which feed of these?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The top one, the HFeed one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, look.  So, there's my post. Now, go to that settings page  link that you went to before.  The what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. Check MicroPub.  Yeah, I support that on my site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, I have to go through Authorize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've already done it once, so it should be quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll just do that right through NDEuth.  Yeah, and again, we're going to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This flow is going to get a bit more streamlined.  You feel like we're reinventing the web as we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  Let's try it with two slashes and a call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like it's all tied together with baling wire  and string.  It is a little. Okay.  Why not just use if this, then that, somebody asked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If this, then that is...  The point is we're putting a protocol that should work underneath all this.  Yeah, everybody is saying, oh, use Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you don't want to rely on any...  You don't want to rely on an open standard that will work even if Facebook  or if this, then that, or Twitter goes out of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. Part of the point is  at the moment it's running on your own site, we want to make sure that you can  log into these with Facebook or Twitter or WordPress or Tumblr  or whatever as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If I now go to the Kyle set, I do see...  I see Woodwind and I see a feed, and I should add more subscriptions to this.  Then I can interact with you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Once you've got the micro pub thing working.  I'll get the micro pub thing working.  I'm sure Kyle will look at this and go, oh, I should improve that process.  The other thing I wanted to show you,  which is related but kind of fun,  if you go to www.pestagram.com  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pestagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I put that in the...  I first hacked together three years ago  as kind of a joke, which turns  Instagram into Pinterest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You showed this on the show way back then, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like this.  If you click on...  You put a tag in at the top, then it'll give you the stuff about that tag.  If you put VidCon, that'll be a good one.  Then you can also click through to people  and see their feeds or click through to places and see the place feeds.  The thing I changed this week was that  I marked this up with hfeed, which means you can now subscribe to feeds  from Instagram per tag in the feed reader.  So if you put in...  Don't put into it, because that's not going to be a good tag.  Put in IndieWeb, that's a decent tag.  Right there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Should I put a hash in front of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, just do that new return.  So there's the IndieWeb post.  If you copy the URL from that at the top, it's pestacram.com slash tag slash indieweb.  Then go back to...  Go back to the reader  and subscribe to that, then you'll see you get the feed from that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah! So I go to Kyle M's again.  Reader.kylewm.com  Subscribe to... We'll paste that in.  Yep.  And of course...  Impressive return.  Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So now it's putting those in as well.  You can see there's a post from Tantec and so on like that.  And if you had the things set up, you'd be able to respond to those on your site.  I'm not sure that propagates back to Instagram yet,  but it gives you a way of following these things and tracking them around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's part of the problem is that it's not in Twitter or Instagram or Facebook's interest  to support any of this stuff because they want to silo everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they have APIs and bridges and things.  So the pestagram site I built by calling Instagram's APIs  and then just generate them a web page that implements these protocols.  And similarly, Bridgy implements posting back to Twitter,  which is cool.  I like Bridgy, which is cool.  And the silo.pub thing that Kyle built  lets you post to Tumblr and WordPress and Blogger.  So we're sort of gradually building the glue to connect these back to the existing silos.  But we're still using these relatively simple protocols underneath.  And the challenge is always, how do we make these...  How do we authenticate into more than one place?  If you've logged into Facebook, you've logged into Facebook once.  Whereas with these, if you logged into this, you've got to log in to your own site  and then log into Instagram or whatever.  So there's always going to be a little bit more friction  when you're bridging two things together than having one.  But I still think it's...  Can you give that another try?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why not? Maybe people have gone away.  It should work with IndieAuth, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, don't click IndieAuth. Go back.  That's what you're doing wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK. Micropub, Authorize Micropub.  And don't use Twitter or Google. I'll use Google.  It's my Google Plus page.  Yeah, I am.  Maybe I'm just impatient.  Maybe it's just a question of impatience.  Oh, it's waiting for IndieAuth. I keep sending.  I shouldn't hit it again and again. Poor IndieAuth.  While I'm doing this, Jeff, do you have a number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I could go on a rant about how a study has found  that the Spanish link attacks actually hurt media  and even killed sites in Spain.  Instead, what I'm going to do is the thing that's guaranteed  to bring phone calls in on any talk show anywhere in America,  and that's a discussion of pizza.  So I have ten best pizza places in the U.S.  according to comments on TripAdvisor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's such BS. Of course it is.  I already know it's wrong, because everybody knows  the best pizza place in America is Pepe's Pizza in New Haven.  No, it's Gino's East in Chicago.  I'll give you Gino's East.  When I actually did a story, I went around the country

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for People magazine back in the day.  You must have gone to Pepe's. I did, but I still give it to Gino.  You like a deep dish, though. That's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that was pretty amazing. Yeah, but it's a different thing.  It's not even pizza. That's a deep dish.  Juliana's in Brooklyn. I'll have to go there.  Pizza Time in St. Augustine, Florida, I can almost guarantee is not.  The best pizza place in New Haven, Petsaria and Anchorage, Alaska.  Number three. That's illegal.  That's not even pizza. That's a BLT.  Bacon. Moose's Toothpub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Srirame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cilantro, jalapeno mayo. That should be illegal.  This is what's wrong, by the way, with Yelp.  Even Zagat. The reviews are from people who live around there.  And I bet you it is the best pizza in Anchorage.  Which says nothing. It says nothing.  Have you ever been to Kesti, New York, New York?  No, but it looks good. I'm going to try that.  Nice looking calzone. That one looks nice.  Tony's Pizza Napolitana in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good one. I recommend that one.  I've never even heard of it.  If you want actual Italian pizza, it's really good.  It makes the dough fresh, makes Italian pizzas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I always go to Tomaso's, so I'll have to try Tony's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's more central than...  What do you call it?  It's not in the Italian neighborhood, whatever that's called.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's in the heart of San Francisco's Little Italy, according to this.  I didn't even know San Francisco... Oh, you mean North Beach?  It's not in North Beach.  Is that the one I'm thinking of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, it is in North Beach. You know what? It's where North Beach Pista used to be.  It's a different one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This used to be North Beach Pizza.  Now we're really losing the audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This one's at 11th Street, 11th and Howard.  This one's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's got to be good. It's under a freeway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I used to appear on Ron Owens' show on KGO back in the day.  Ron's an old friend. Love Ron.  Ron's great. Whenever the phone lines look dead,  I'd always say, you know, this town doesn't have any decent pizza.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Boom. There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are certain tricks that every talk show host knows.  Yeah.  All right. I think we're just really way out of time.  I apologize we had an hour late start. I apologize to everybody involved.  I will get MicroPub working and I will start playing with this  because I think it's very intriguing. If people want to know more about IndieWeb,  what's the best way to find out, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can come to Homebrew Website Club, as I said, or IndieWebCamp.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  IndieWebCamp.com.  Yes.  And then get a known site up and running, either self-hosted or at WithKnown.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The easiest way to get started is to go to WithKnown.com  and get your own site there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to give you one more number if I may, just to end off the week here.  So First Round Capital is 10 years old and they did a survey  of their companies and they found, I'll just give you this one finding,  it's a 10 years.firstround.com, that companies with a female founder  performed 63% better than their investments with all male founding teams.  No kidding.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No kidding.  Meanwhile, the chat room is now debating the merits of pizza.  Pizza, yes.  Does Lisa count as a female founder? I think she does.  So there you go.
