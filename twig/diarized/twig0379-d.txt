Stacey's beat now is IoT. She has the IoT podcast at IoTpodcast.com.  Stacey on IoT and she joins us whenever she's not in town, which is a little strange.  Hello Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry about that Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just teasing you. You were in the South Bay. You weren't even close to us for structure. How'd that go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It went really well. Learned a lot of fun things.  And then after that I went to Techonomy down at, where was it?  Half Moon Bay.  That was fancy.  And that was awesome. I actually saw a lot of really, really thought provoking presentations  and learned more about Estonia and their digital ID program, which kind of sounds fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wanted to join that. I was in Estonia a couple of months ago or a month ago and I just didn't get around to it.  But you can apply online.  You can.  You get a PGP key embedded in a chip card. It's an ID. It's not citizenship in Estonia. It's e-citizenship. It's very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you can start a business there. I didn't realize that. You can do everything there from your computer online.  Can you move there?  That would be physical world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'm not sure I want to move there to be honest with you because Russia's right over the border.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And she really did a bad job selling the country too.  It's cold and dark so we have nothing to do but program.  It's beautiful though.  Tallinn is a beautiful city.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, that's Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism at City University of New York or CUNY as it's known to the people in the environs.  He is at BuzzMachine.com, writer of many fabulous books including what would Google do.  I almost said what would public parts do.  But that's conflating two different books.  I see it behind my shoulder.  There it is. I see it.  And it's on my shelf. All your books are on my shelf too.  Bless you.  So before the show and those of you who are watching live know we kind of discussed politics because I haven't seen Stacey since before the election.  And there is a little political news.  Donald Trump is back to his Twitter account.  For the week or so before the election this story was, I don't know how accurate it is, that they had taken away.  Some said his password, some said his phone.  Jeff, you always said if it's from Android it's from the president-elect.  If it's from Apple it's from his team.  And it's all been from Android lately.  For the last three or four, really criticizing, yeah, nobody can say no now, really criticizing the New York Times.  He's been going after the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait, Donald Trump is an Android user?  I have to pause for a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no, he was an iPhone user until he called for a boycott of the iPhone after San Bernardino.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And everyone, okay, yes, that's where I was like, he used to be an iPhone guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He switched to, we believe, the Samsung Galaxy S7.  Now, I'm not sure, remember when President Obama took office they took away his Blackberry.  I don't know who they is.  Who can do that to the President of the United States, the most powerful person in the world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's the Department of Defense, isn't it?  They're a secret service.  They can't secure the channels.  I mean, it makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I hadn't thought, well, he can always do desktop Twitter, but he doesn't use a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I will see what happens January 20th, but you know, this is one of the problems in general with government.  And I've talked to people who worked in the Obama White House.  The systems are not very sophisticated or advanced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's why, dare I say this, that's why Clinton had separate email because it was a screwed up system.  She said...  You are looking like Steve Bannon, you know.  You saw the scruff?  Yeah, you got to go one way or the other, either shave it or get it longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, I haven't shaved in a week.  I said I'm not going to shave until a woman wins the White House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  I was thinking about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're going to be David Letterman before you go.  Can you trim?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I can trim, I just can't shave.  You're right, I'd be ZZ Top at the rate we're going anyway.  Who knows?  I think Elizabeth Warren is my personal vote for 2020.  Kamala Harris.  Kamala Harris, who is our new senator in California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you think of her?  I've seen her at events and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this will confirm everybody's belief about California.  Our two candidates for senator were both women, both Democrats.  I don't know if you were Republican how you felt about that.  You didn't have the choice because of the way the primaries work in the state.  The top two vote getters run against each other, regardless of party.  Kamala Harris was Secretary of State.  I actually, truthfully, I don't know that much about her.  But she is one of four new female senators who are not white men.  The rest of it is white men.  But she's one of four new female senators, which is pretty exciting I think.  Bows well.  Let's see here.  Let's see here.  Anything to say?  We're just going to watch with interest as Mr. Trump tweets.  He is now twice left behind the press corps.  And the press corps, as one would expect from a hive of bees, is hopping mad.  That may not be a bad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm just going to throw this out here.  Okay, so yes, getting rid of your press corps.  Reagan and the Hilton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  George Bush in 9-11.  So that's the press corps argument is if something like that happens,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  President Reagan getting shot or President Bush reading to a kindergarten class  when 9-11 happens, then there's no press pool coverage.  And it's pool coverage, by the way, not individual press coverage.  But then you don't have to pander.  You can be like, screw it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This guy doesn't like us.  Well, that's different, Stacey.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would argue that if he kicks you out of the press room, then go do your damn job.  But how do you do your job without access?  Everything that happens in that press room is shown to the world.  We all see it.  That's denograble.  That's not journalism.  I think the normal reaction, my reaction is, well, he's going to have a steak.  Let him have a steak in peace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought that was fine.  But they're standing outside.  They need a pool.  I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They should stop doing that.  They should stop doing that.  They should stop doing that.  They should stop doing that.  They should stop doing that.  They should stop doing that.  They should stop doing that.  That's just horrible.  That's all about the access and selling access, basically.  What celebrities do you bring and that kind of stuff.  I think there will be one thing that will be interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  President Obama did not like press conferences.  Held relatively few of them.  I'll be curious to see what happens in the next administration.  Will there be more press conferences?  I think there will be something we've never seen before, which is rallies.  I was going to say, I think he's rally specific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Someone asked what a press pool is.  I think it's a lot of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's a lot of people.  Someone asked what a press pool is.  Which is actually something to explain.  What is pool coverage?  We'll give it to Jeff.  You just have a small number of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have a TV and you have probably a print and a photographer.  You have a TV and you have probably a print and a photographer.  They are obligated to provide to all the rest of the press.  They are obligated to provide to all the rest of the press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Rather than have every single network,  and nowadays it's even more important because you've got every blog,  and nowadays it's even more important because you've got every blog,  everybody with their own cameras and their own reporters,  and you get a million people,  and they designate some reporters and cameras, etc.  and they designate some reporters and cameras, etc.  that they will share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't know that the jargon was  that they get a signal, there's a lid on it.  We're not going to do anything tonight.  We're staying home. You can go now.  So they don't stay 24 hours.  Up to 24 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If the president is out, they're out.  Different media organizations swap out their different people.  Different media organizations swap out their different people.  And then is it publicly available, the pool coverage?  And then is it publicly available, the pool coverage?  I know for a while Gawker had a...  They actually ran the pool coverage, which was kind of fun.  They actually ran the pool coverage, which was kind of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you can get it.  If you're in the press, you can get the report and then share it.  They're wonderfully boring.  Trump had ketchup on stake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Same thing happens in Congress.  Same thing happens in Congress.  It happens at rallies, frankly.  The pool coverage at a rally is that single camera on the candidate.  The pool coverage at a rally is that single camera on the candidate.  Which is the one he yelled about.  Right, he said, you never showed the crowd.  The single camera never was supposed to show the crowd.  The networks have additional cameras that they can use to do that with.  The networks have additional cameras that they can use to do that with.  And did.  I find, you know, look, my attitude is, let's give it a chance.  And did. I find, you know, look, my attitude is, let's give it a chance.  See what happens.  But as we move closer and closer to January 20th.  But as we move closer and closer to January 20th.  Things are happening.  It'll be interesting.  Here's my, you know, from a tech point of view, our biggest interest is going to be  What happens to crypto?  What happens to NSA surveillance?  What happens to network neutrality?  What happens to network neutrality?  Net neutrality, FCC in general.  One of the things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, the FCC today just said that they were not going to do any  They were stopping their orders.  They were stopping their orders.  So until the new administration.  That seems right.  And they did that for Obama. It is totally legit.  I know people are upset because a lot of issues are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, what you don't want.  And I suspect this, you know, Obama will do the same thing.  You don't want a lot of lame duck.  Posturing and stuff that just has, you know, that's just going to be retracted in January.  But we'll watch.  I just I don't.  Does anybody know how quickly the FCC commissioners can be replaced in the.  Isn't there a schedule for them?  There is a schedule for them.  I don't remember who is on the schedule next.  And by the way, only three commissioners can be of the same.  And I think that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's a good point.  I think that's a good point.  I think that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's a good point.  I think that's a good point.  Three commissioners can be of the six can be or of the five rather can be of the same political party.  So you have to have two Democrats and three Republicans or vice versa.  I do think he gets to replace the chairman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He does get to replace Tom Wheeler.  So I'm trying to look at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wheeler was a Republican appointed by Obama and serving since November 4th, 2013, and ironically, a guy who everybody was really willing.  I was so wrong about him.  Yeah, because he ended up doing, I think, many good things for the people.  He tried. We'll see how long he lasts.  Yeah, but that's kind of the nature of the pendulum.  It swings back and forth, I think.  So we'll watch.  I mean, those are going to all be things where we're going to be very interested in.  The encryption debate is hot and heavy.  At the same time, remember that one of one of candidate Trump's stands, and I hope that President Trump will be there.  The other thing that President Trump will follow is to prevent the AT&T Time Warner merger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, you know, he just said that he wasn't going to do that.  All right. Sorry.  Whiplash.  AT&T. It's not Time Warner.  AT&T. Oh, it is Time Warner.  Yes. Sorry. My brain stopped working for a second there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He just said he's not going to stop that, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, hold on. Let me make sure this is a legit new source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, OK, that's really going to be the subject of this show, I think.  Yes, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's the Wall Street Journal.  So this is a seeking alpha thing that came up.  So hard to say.  Told supporters.  Yeah, plot the deal.  Ah, I hit the paywall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we'll find out.  You know what?  I think the other thing is stuff doesn't going to move that fast.  I mean, it seems like.  Well, we'll see. I don't know.  Some, you know, of course, in during campaign speeches, Trump said everything's going to happen on day one.  But I think it's pretty clear that there's a lot to do and it can't happen all at once.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The story says that Jeff Eisenach said had said in the past that he was in favor of the Time Warner thing.  So we'll see what it was not Trump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that was a pretty clear campaign promise.  Not that that means much, but that was the wall.  Yeah. Yeah, but, you know, OK, anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry. Yeah.  Or offense. It could be offense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let's talk about that was a that was an architectural technology commentary was the political commentary.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How much was it going to cost the like 200 billion dollar wall, whatever?  Let's talk about fake news.  That's really probably the subject we should go down the road of.  Now, what I'm not interested in and I think you see a lot of this is, oh, we lost.  Why do we lose? It's your fault.  I don't think that's relevant.  So let's talk about it from the point of view of going forward.  First of all. And I think I'm very contrarian on this, so I'll be interested.  I know what you guys might want to say here, but I'll be interested in hearing it.  What is what is Facebook's obligation regarding fake news?  Mr. Mr. Jarvis, you may start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I've written a piece about this and I just met today.  I want to get your I want to get both your pieces of advice about this, but what we could advise them to do.  So I met with somebody.  So I won't mind saying I don't know the John Boothwick at Beta Works where we want to make some tangible specific suggestions.  And we're working on that now. So I'm eager to hear yours.  Facebook, I've done this before on the show that I don't think Facebook is media.  We can argue about that and put that aside.  I think that Facebook, I think Zuckerberg is wrong to say that it had no impact.  Wrong. It's glib to say 99 percent of what you have on Facebook is is is true.  How do you know?  But the simple point of fact to me is that Facebook, with the help of media and with the help of its users, could improve the quality of discourse.  And that is its obligation.  And so around this idea of people spreading lies, falsehoods and frauds, there are clear ways that they could help.  And I do believe that some significant portion of the time people share things that are mistaken and they don't know it.  And if they knew it was mistaken, they wouldn't do it.  So can we get in there earlier and help them with more information, more signals to them, say, you know, this comes from a site that's been around for about 10 minutes.  Do you trust it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, part of the problem with Facebook, it was purely economic, was that there were there's a small town, 45000 people in Macedonia.  And I guess the teenagers talk amongst themselves.  And they all came up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I kind of want to go meet them.  I know, very smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They all came up with this notion at once, which makes me think they kind of all talked about it, to create political sites with names like World News site and put fake stories on there.  But that would be click bait.  I mean, really, it's click bait because the point of it all for them was if you click at the link and you go to their site, they make money on the ads.  And a lot of these, I mean, things like the pope endorsing Trump.  And well, what's funny is this actually happened to me.  If you did a Google search, I'm sure they fixed it by now for what was the final vote count in the election, you'd find a fake.  A fake.  The first result was a fake site on Google, Google, not on news on Google, a fake site that said it was 60 Trump won 62 million and 60.  Which isn't true.  And but it looked true.  And Google even has this problem.  So what is standard past Facebook?  Does Facebook have obligations different from Google?  No, I think I think in both cases, we can help them help users no more before they share crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've done this before with click bait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Remember, Upworthy used to dominate the Facebook feed.  They did something.  I don't know what to prevent that.  They changed their algorithm and they based it on, I think, time spent after people click through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think Facebook has the means like the technological means to create a flag.  You know, like if you go to a site and Google's like, hey, yo, the site might not be secure.  You could get a flag on stories that come from just reputable sources and, you know, just a simple, transparent, hey, we flag this story as being questionable.  It would at least give you pause before you shared it, which would help.  And that's that's not crazy.  And they're not saying the the kind of things that you can't do.  And that's that's not crazy.  And they're not saying the content that maybe it's they base it on where the site is.  Maybe they prejudice themselves in favor of more, you know, longer standing media entities.  Right. Maybe it's a site that has track record.  And then that brings back to Jeff's idea of funding like legitimate.  Conservative media, because then you'd have much more like, hey, this is this is a real organization and you'd be trusted because that's the fact that Facebook was concerned about a right wing backlash, I think speaks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know, by the way, Facebook denies this Gizmodo story because Modo said that they they had the ability to kill the fake news, but we're afraid that it would kill mostly Republican favorite posts.  Well, because Facebook denies it out categorically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I know. But but but the reason that that's that's that might be fake news itself.  Maybe it may be. But the point is that that on the right Macedonian teenagers, whoever used Facebook in a way that media were too stupid to do.  You know, I've long contended that we've got to be you've heard my spiel about social.  Well, it was clickbait. Media has been media has used clickbait for Facebook started.  No, no, no, no, I'm not saying that we always say something very important.  This is a big important distinction is different.  Clickbait, which we do do up where he does every media company does it is come to my site where my ad is.  Clickbait. You click on this.  That's not what the the meme makers did.  A meme is self-contained, right?  Occupy Democrats or various things.  It is self-contained and people use it as a social token to pass around.  So my contention is one thing that we immediately need to do.  Forget Facebook. But we immediately need to do is we need to learn that lesson and we need to turn to turn out memes that are filled with facts and journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the problem that I have. OK, this and this gives motor stories a perfect example.  Fake news to whom? I mean, there's some stuff that's demonstrably factually false.  But this gives moto story Facebook denies.  Right. So I don't think is that does that mean it's the fake news or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why I agree, Leo. That's why there's two things about this.  One is that's why I know Facebook shouldn't say this is fake because we don't want them to be the arbiter of what's fake and real and false and true.  Number two, I object strongly, except in extreme cases to a blacklist.  A professor at Marquette University put out a black put out a list of fake news sites and included in it the onion and included in it Breitbart.  Now, I don't like Breitbart for a second, but if Breitbart is next to the president for the next four years, people are going to be sharing news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are people on Breitbart who argue what they're doing is satire in exactly the same way that the onion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. So what I'm arguing for is not that Facebook censors that Facebook kills that Facebook labels as fake.  What Facebook can do is give you as Stacy just said, they can give you more information in this process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, I want to be open to your proposal because in general, I think that it's not Facebook's problem at all that Facebook should just let people post whatever they want in the same way they can email you whatever they want.  They can tweet whatever they want.  It's the problem like Google's problem because people say what they want to say, and it's your responsibility as a consumer of news to judge whether it's true or not.  Period. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But why not give them helps with that?  That I mean, that's we're not saying Facebook should censor.  We're just saying, hey, help people out.  Just like I get a little security icon of some sites protected with HTTPS.  Right. So if it's got SSL, I see the security icon.  If I see this flag, I say, oh, well, maybe I should go look into this more.  I mean, the input that all that should do is say, oh, let me Google this and see what has anyone else said it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And yeah, so part of what you can do that now or you can go to Snopes or you can.  Well, you're not going to Google everything that becomes horrifying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, so do something for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they're part of the reason fake news works is because people read it something they want to believe and they like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You don't you don't share stuff that's demonstrably or even possibly false.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I shared there was a there was a post this week where somebody shoved a Trump protester down the stairs at a mall and I shared it and turned out it had nothing to do with politics.  The guy who did the shoving has problems and said that and I pulled it back immediately.  Now, what I wish I could do is send a note to anybody who read it, say, oh, I shared the wrong thing.  All I can do now is kill. I can't correct it. I can't do anything else.  There's other things to do. Do something for me. This is going to be a little controversial.  All right. Google search Daily Stormer, which is a white supremacy site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, exactly. So when you do that, I say the world's most goal law, it says the world's most goal oriented Republican website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Google pulls up the innards of the site, which it doesn't do with all sites.  It does it with kind of sites that have enough traffic.  So the first thing is Jewish problem. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that helps you. So this is the kind of help you'd like.  Well, no, I'm that's what I'm asking. I mean, I think the next entry, which is the Wikipedia entry for it, which says it's an American neo-Nazi and white supremacist news and commentary site,  which is the very second thing and still above the fold in most screens is probably even more useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I'm not sure what to do. No, actually, John and I were a little appalled that Google pulled this out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, wait a minute. But they do the same thing. If I do New York Times, they pull out stuff, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but they don't do it with all sites. If you do it with some other sites, there's only a certain size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are they trying to tell us something about the New York Times? I don't know.  I get the same pull out. I get it. Yeah.  I mean, are you sure that Google's doing this to say, hey, that's what I'm saying. No, that's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm not presuming. I don't know that I like this. I think this is this is giving them more space and more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you're saying it's not a big enough site to do that with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, kind of. And it's a it's a it's I think we can call this safely a hate site. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And and the hate if I search for it, for instance, they don't pull out content from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. So they got a special treatment that pulls out their kind of no, I don't think this is good to do.  OK, so this is not the solution. No, no, no, no, no.  Let me go over a list of some things because I want to get your reaction. Right.  One is is is trying to spread the ethic of verified sources.  And do you think verified sources has helped Twitter? No.  Do you think there's any any benefit that could be that only if Twitter's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, one of the things Twitter does, I don't do it, but it lets you look at only verified tweets.  Right. I mean, I guess that could be the way to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Even verified people are wrong. I mean, I'm verified, but I've had this every now and then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is to me the problem here is that this is it isn't so black and white as we would like it to be.  And I'm really bothers me to say it's Facebook's burden to do this. I think I'm not saying it's Facebook burdens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm saying that that listen, when Facebook when Google had crap and spam coming up, what do they do?  They hired Matt Cutts to say improve the experience value of Google.  I'm saying that nobody should be stopped from posting what they want to post.  They want to post apart from hate speech, they want to post a dumb, stupid, wrong meme.  That is their that is their privilege and right to do so.  And by the way, we can't know maybe they're going to make making fun of it.  They have their reasons to post it. They want to post examples of dumb, stupid, wrong things.  But all Stacey and I are saying is if people posted wrong stuff, inadvertently less, Facebook would be a better experience.  It's better for Facebook and better for the user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, let's take this back to the days of up worthy.  It's true. If people would stop posting that gosh darn up worthy crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what did Facebook that finally they did and they did Facebook did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So part of the argument part of the problem is that fool me once, fool me twice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  George Bush, people. Yeah, people didn't like it.  So I think the difference here is that if look at it as a customer service problem, if you're sharing and you have all this fake news, what if people don't like it, giving them tools to identify it a little bit more easily would be beneficial for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what Facebook's algorithm tells it and assuming that Facebook is fully algorithmic and not human, what's Facebook's algorithm is designed to do is is optimized for stickiness, right?  To keep you using the site. Right. But they could optimize. They're optimizing for what people like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they're OK. That is not necessarily true. They're optimizing for what people click on.  People don't always click on stuff they value. What other signal do you want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You want to read the video? Have you ever know Leo?  Have you ever posted something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you ever retweeted or shared something that you found out 10 minutes later was wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Probably. I don't remember. Yeah, I've done it all the time.  Well, I don't do it all the time. I'm pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. But it's happened.  Well, I mean, it's happened to me more than I wanted to happen to me.  Put it that way. Right. I would appreciate as a user.  So I've given the example the show before. I'm sorry, Stacey.  I over talked to you. I'm sorry. I apologize.  We'll finish your point first. I got excited. I got me too excited.  I know. Go ahead. All right. OK. I apologize. I shouldn't do that.  I gave the example of the show some weeks ago where there was a picture of Justin Trudeau and he was kissed  in a politician and looked suspicious to me and I started mousing over.  And when you moused over the related content was BuzzFeed saying this is a fake picture.  People were passing around and Stokes debunking it.  That helped you. Yes, it did. It did.  And let's say let's say that I was going to share that photo if Facebook just simply said,  you might want to see these other things about this photo.  And I'd say, oh, thank you, Facebook, for stopping me from embarrassing myself sharing this thing.  I can't see how you object. I'm not against. I'm not against that.  OK, Stacey, I'm sorry. I apologize. I don't know. That's that's a hundred.  A hundred times. I want a thousand. Well, I'm trying to get myself a hundred.  I'm just going to push him out of the show. It's all yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's all gone. I just I wanted to make the point.  Jeff, you're still talking. You're still talking, man.  I wanted to make the point that the algorithms, we have the sense that they're unbiased.  Like I'm hearing you speak about this like, oh, they've optimized their stickiness.  But yeah, well, that's the point.  And they can optimize for a better user experience.  Where they get that information from? From users, from users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but they're using the same as they have clicks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, but they have they have more clicks.  Think about how Facebook reacts every time they roll out some privacy infringing feature and everyone gets upset.  And they're like, oh, bring out roll out the Zuckerberg apology.  I mean, if people were upset enough about this and it became it was framed as a customer service issue.  And it may not be for the rest of the population.  It's an issue for me. It's for Jeff, for people who might feel embarrassed to say wrong things on Facebook.  But if it is actually an issue, then Facebook should deal with it.  If only because it will make the experience better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I accept Jeff's proposal that maybe there's additional information.  Your mouse hovers over something and it pops up a window or something.  I accept that. I really dislike the notion that Facebook somehow knows better than its users and needs to protect people.  Page rank. Right. It's like page rank.  Give us some more information. I don't have a problem with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Facebook needed Matt Cutts to stay ahead of people who are gaming their structure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So so this is the thing is I see headlines like this is from today.  Zuckerberg says Facebook will crack down on fake news.  That's not what your proposal doesn't sound like a crackdown.  No, no, I worry about a crackdown on users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Facebook doesn't want to do that. I don't want them to do that.  Let me ask you this question. So Facebook on January 15th, 2015, January 20th, 2015, added the ability to report false news.  Can you find that for me? Sure.  Fine. I report something I've written is false.  No, please don't do that. Go to the almost last step. Where is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me find it for you. I'm looking.  This is this January 20th, ironically, of last year.  No, no, no, but I'm going to look at the I'm going to look at the now you cheated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wanted you to go find the way you're saying user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I get we OK. I'm not looking. I'm not looking.  I'm going to go to my Facebook feed real quickly and see how I would report that.  So let's say this story I'm reading. Let's do scoble.  Let's do why I'm happy that Trump won.  So normally what I do is I click this down arrow.  I can hide post and follow Robert hide from Prince E a report post.  There we go. It's annoying. I think it shouldn't be on Facebook.  Let's continue. Why should it not be on Facebook?  It's harassment. It's hate speech. It's something else.  Let's see. Is it it describe? I think it's an unauthorized.  Nope, it's not there. It's not there. Well, where is it?  Because that's the logical. It's still supposed to be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the point is they buried it. It's annoying. How about this one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's annoying. No, no, not there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if we just made it if they just made it easier for users to say, hey, I looked at this and it's fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, maybe maybe I got it. It's annoying or not interesting.  Message Prince E to resolve this. Nope, nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right. It's not immediately obvious to give signals.  That's one. So Stacy, make it easier for the users to give Facebook signals and Facebook can judge them.  Maybe that's the best way to get the other way.  I think is media can say, you know, hey, Facebook, we went to the effort.  We call we on the phone. We called up. We found out this is not true.  The pope did not do this. And Facebook trusts that media outlet and says, OK, New York Times, if you say so,  we're not going to kill the post, but we're going to make sure we tell people, hey, the New York Times might want you to know this.  In both cases, you empower the users both ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stacey, you also then put a burden on real reporters to debunk all this crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and I can also see people using this to espouse a political point of view.  Oh, they'll game this. I could certainly, you know, and we've I mean, this is what the problem.  Dig ran up against and putting him out of business is these kinds of reputation based systems can be gamed and rigged.  Facebook is a difficult situation because everybody wants to game Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I don't think they're taking it. I think some people on Facebook are taking it seriously and others are not.  Stacey, let me go back to your question about putting that burden on media.  I actually I think that's media's job.  And I'm not saying they have to do it to all the crap that's there.  But if a substantial number of people believe X, isn't it a reporter's job to say, well, I picked up the phone and I found out.  And let me tell you, you should know that's wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, that's what we do.  But yes, that is that is totally true.  My concern is we get into these false equivalencies easily in media.  And I worry like if there are enough people who say something, it automatically kind of becomes true in some ways.  Like, God help us. Dr. Wakefield in his vaccination efforts or his anti vaccination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is a good example.  So, by the way, it's controversial.  It's still controversial because some people believe that childhood vaccinations cause autism.  The man who created the first study later admitted he'd faked the results.  But ever since that kind of set off a shockwave of people who don't know that he retracted it.  I don't even know if you could call it factual enough.  People are adamant. I have friends who are adamant that it's true and they have anecdotal evidence.  Well, my kid had four shots in a row and got a fever.  Is that actually a common side effect?  Well, I'm just saying it's complicated.  But can you give people more information?  And had you given people more information, would that have because believe me, if you're an anti vaccination crusader, you've been given a lot of contrary information.  Has that slowed it down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Has this worked?  Maybe a little. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The fact that the guy who wrote the study retracted it didn't slow it down.  I don't think your neighbor is saying you're full of it is going to slow it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I like the idea.  We're not really powerless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, we're not powerless.  But OK, well, some would argue you're powerless to change people's minds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you believe that, then then just shut down the halls of journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why would you have a job?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, if you're read The Righteous Mind by a professor named Jonathan Haidt, a very interesting book.  We've had him on triangulation and he talks about how reason and intuition work.  And intuition is instant.  And for good evolutionary reasons, it's got to be.  And reason follows.  He likens intuition as the elephant that reason is riding.  Reason has a hard time controlling intuition.  People make up their minds and then most often come up with reasonable explanations for why they believe what they believe.  This is why we all ad hoc.  Well, but it's all OK.  I mean, I believe in education.  Yeah, you believe that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not saying it's impossible.  It isn't impossible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Obviously, you can change minds.  It's a it's harder than you think.  And it is generally not done with reason.  He's got it.  It's a compelling book.  It's done with empathy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, that was exactly in sync.  You guys are empathetic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, but no, and that's why.  I'm not going to go there.  And the challenge is, thank you.  The news industry is not designed to be empathetic.  We're designed to report on facts.  And I think it's a huge instead of talking about fake news.  I would think that as an industry, we would talk more about how to convey empathy and to tell people other people's stories in a way that makes them compelling.  And I think that's going on.  I mean, that's it is, but it's it's relegated to the feature section.  It is limited helicopter out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't really stay in the community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, look, what's we're talking about with Facebook is challenging because Facebook is neither media nor a common carrier.  It's something new that the Internet has given us.  And media itself is no longer reportage presented in a who, what, when, where, why fashion.  It is something new.  It has to be something new.  And all of this is kind of precipitated by the Internet era.  The way people share information.  I mean, you know, let's let's go back 50 years, a pre Internet era.  There is plenty of fake news.  You know how it's shared?  Your neighbor told you.  So, you know, and in fact, communities, geographically proximate communities often have very similar beliefs and they reach consensus in a way that has nothing to do with the Internet.  It has to do with what you heard down at the cafe or at the mall and what your neighbor told you.  And so I think that what we're trying what we're really grappling with is a new world in general.  I like your plan of saying let's have more information.  At least give me some will ignore it.  So I would submit most would ignore it because again, we don't know until we try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's given to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's to the empathy point.  That's to the empathy point.  Now, Stacey, one of us, we had this conversation in our social journalism program last night.  One of my one of my students, one of our students under Professor Kerry Brown, had this great spiel where he said he has an aunt.  We all have an uncle or an aunt.  He has an aunt.  And the aunt came in and said, why are you always talking about how black people have problems as a white guy?  And he said, well, because there's a there's a problem of justice here.  You know, all lives matter.  And she said, don't you understand why that's offensive?  No.  So he went through four hours with her on Facebook, kind of, you know, in public to his friends and family, four hours going back and forth and back and forth and back and forth.  And finally, at the end, there was a breakthrough moment.  And she said, oh, I never thought about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK. But for every time that happened, I know 25000 times it just descended into a flame war and nothing happened.  Well, it just solidified, if anything, solidified people's opposing points.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm saying I'm agreeing with you.  This doesn't scale.  Yeah. He can't spend four hours in everybody's hand.  It's an outlier.  But the question is possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK. So then the question is, how do you create an online platform that promotes empathy, that promotes actual conversations?  And Facebook can be that platform and even Twitter can be that platform in the comments and other sections.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's a potential problem.  So somebody in the chat room said this election was about not having empathy.  And I would disagree.  The issue is not not having empathy.  It was about who do you have empathy for?  Do you have empathy for the other or do you have empathy for middle class Americans who have fallen from grace?  And really a lot of the anger coming from the Rust Belt was anger that, hey, you're all all worried about these Latinos.  When what about me?  I'm not, you know, come on.  And you know what?  There's no question there's empathy there.  The debate is over empathy for whom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and yes, yes.  And how?  I mean, this is where I've argued that we in journalism don't listen well.  We've got to get out there and give empathy.  I think this is this is absolutely critical.  So let me ask.  I'm trying to get your specific suggestions.  Let me try another one on you.  I think the trend.  By the way, I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, you did win me over because I was dead set against Facebook doing anything.  And I do like the idea of just providing more context.  It only works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's harmless.  This is Stacy's point.  One of Stacy's points, too.  It only works if it's built around improving the experience of Facebook for the user.  If it's shoving things down people's throat, if it's trying to censor for the sake of our own good,  if it's trying to censor for the sake of other agendas, no.  But if it improves the experience, if we can if we can stipulate that the experience of having crap at you that's all wrong and stupid all day is a bad experience and you can improve that, that's what sells it to Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what sells it to the user.  So, Stacy, this Thanksgiving, when you sit down with friends and family, and many of us will on Thursday.  Stacy, we've decided not to go somewhere to avoid this very issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I will be reporting and doing the show from my parents' house in Houston.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think there will be a great many heated discussions.  So how can empathy help us, Stacy?  How can empathy help us here?  Wait, are you asking me this because I'm a woman?  No, because you're the one who brought up the word.  This is your position.  You're defending it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I use this all the time with my mom.  I can't use it with my dad because he doesn't.  He just shuts down when we talk about politics.  But it's it's it's understanding the other person's point of view.  So when my parent when my mom and I talk about Trump or policies, you know, she actually brings up a lot of really legitimate questions.  So when I talk about I have a I am against religious exemptions for birth control.  And when a pharmacist doesn't do their job and doesn't give someone deny someone like Plan B, that's a I feel like that should be illegal.  And she basically when I talk into her, she she brings up these really good points and I'm actually willing to listen.  And basically, it's an individual rights thing for her.  So I understand her position now, whereas beforehand I was like, these people are all evil and against women.  I didn't really think that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's exactly what Jonathan Hite says.  And it's what you both came up with at the same time, which is you can't reason somebody out of their beliefs.  You have to start where they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you want to see this, that's what I'm saying.  I wrote I didn't write. I wish I had written.  The New Yorker had an article about Obama's negotiations in Cuba.  And it was this entire conversation.  Played out as world politics, and it was a really fascinating kind of.  It was a really good article, and it was really fascinating to put it on the like to view Obama through this lens.  And it kind of crystallizes how he dealt with people in conflict.  And it made me feel, I think, a little bit more sad because I don't see Trump so far exhibiting that kind of empathy.  And I really think in a world fraught with disruption and globalization, we're going to need that more than ever.  And so I would love to see Facebook, Twitter, any of our tech people try to promote this.  But I also think that tech has a role to play because tech is fundamentally really unempathetic.  It's our leaders don't think of others.  It's not diverse. It is very much drink the whole drink the Kool-Aid.  I don't know. It's very fun.  Even though it cares about users, Stacey, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They say they care about users, users first.  You're right. And how can you?  And all this work talk about design thinking.  Design thinking is all about user center and all about empathy.  We hear that a lot there, but I think you're absolutely right about the tech industry.  It's not how can you put out good products if you don't empathize with the people using them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think that's where social media really the promise of social media and the promise of the Internet in general was to help us hear other voices and to democratize media because media pre-internet was not democratized.  It was very much an oligarchy.  And it is certainly more democratized and ironically, as a result, there's more fake news than ever before.  I mean, you could argue the National Enquirer has been around a long time.  The star and there was a wonderful news of the world was just all fake news.  It was a fake newspaper.  And who didn't love the news of the world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Who didn't love the Bat Baby?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So there's nothing new about fake news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I ask you guys a few specific proposal questions to your reaction.  Certainly.  All right.  So this is again with the conversation with with John Boothwick.  One.  So the trending box sucks on Facebook, in my view, and they've tried to fix it with people that doesn't work.  They tried it and trending to me is useless on Facebook.  It's meaningless.  What I wouldn't want.  But why is it there?  It's there to give you something that's not going to come across in your feet.  Johnson.  I think he's right.  It's there to say, oh, don't miss this.  That's out there.  And curating it is meaningless because that becomes like media.  One size fits all product and trendy.  This is what everybody's looking at.  Well, so what?  I can find that elsewhere.  I don't think that's very interesting.  What if there were an orthogonal box?  You are always hearing these people.  You never hear from these people.  If you would like to make it optional, you would like to hear some things you're not likely to see.  Right.  It's the it's an explicit filter bubble.  No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's what he's asking is actually something a lot of people are thinking about, which is how to code for serendipity.  Right.  And you will hear this.  God, if you go to any tech conference where we talk about algorithms, serendipity comes up like a second second hour.  It's like, oh, but it's a legitimate thing.  And people are thinking about it.  The question is how to scale serendipity is ridiculously challenging because you're either going to pull stuff at random or you're going to pull trending.  So let's think about ways that we can actually bring that into people's lives in a way that promotes, I guess, legitimate news, but also things that they wouldn't see and might actually find interesting.  I don't know.  I mean, that's a tough problem that people are actually working on.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so and so trending doesn't do it.  John showed me a company that made it work says called Scale Model, which is really looks neat, where you put in my name and you see what the world is around me.  Right.  And then you see what's missing.  And that's an easy analysis for boosting this a million times where you're all talking over here.  And there's also a conversation over there.  Would you like to hear a little bit of the best of over there?  That's one idea.  Right. So here's here's another question.  Should you be able to edit tweets?  Part of the problem with tweets is you have it's binary.  It's put it out there or kill it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a there's a technical issue with that, of course, that once a tweet flies free, it's hard to pull it back.  You can edit it in some context.  But remember, a lot of people are reading Twitter and third party apps and so forth.  And you can't easily modify it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So could you have a structure where by tweet is held for 30 seconds?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, well, that's one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's more likely.  Oh, 10 people just told me I was full of crap and they're right.  I don't I don't think you can edit tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you could absolutely.  I mean, we do what we do now, which is release a second tweet that says, oops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, delete and release a tweet or don't delete.  And then now it would be interesting if you could post retroactively flag a tweet.  So if not edit it, but just flags a wrong tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Twitter rejects that because there because there's a fire hose.  There's all sorts of places they can't go back and change.  So just think of Twitter as like you.  It's OK.  So here's another idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's a different idea.  So let's say that you can work this either way from the sender or the recipient.  I'm not sure which way to think about it.  But basically, I get to subscribe to corrections.  I Leo, you you tweeted something.  I retweeted it.  I thought it was wonderful that you say because you're responsible and decent man.  Oops, I was wrong.  And I don't know that.  I don't happen to see your second tweet.  So I don't tell my readers that Leo was wrong.  Full of right.  Full of right.  What if there were a structure where basically if I retweeted it, I get a notification.  You get to send me a notification that says, oh, hey, Jeff, you might want to X day on that.  It's a tweet, say don't tweet.  Anyway, it's way.  Thank you.  X day on that.  X day on that each way show title.  Right.  And and you're informing me.  And then I know from you, boy, Leo is an upstanding guy.  I trust Leo more because Leo will send out a correction if something happens.  Thank you, Leo.  And I will in turn anyone who retweeted me, I'll say or go out automatically.  Whatever. What do you think of that?  What was this kind of a subscription service for corrections?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would create a tsunami, an additional tsunami of tweets.  Could you imagine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can we just can people just use their critical facilities?  You just told me a few minutes ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they can't.  I think they don't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I can't.  So it can't be forced upon them is what I said.  And I just we should just I think we should just accept this for all it is.  And I've got one more question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  All right.  You're being very glad.  I'm through with them.  I'm sure you're relieved right now.  No more.  I've got two.  I've got a lot of one is once something's determined to be irresponsible, fake news,  you just know it.  It's like pornography.  You know it when you see it.  But why did the Macedonian kids do this?  Because the story says they didn't know they didn't care left or right.  They don't give a damn.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They tried it on the left.  It didn't work.  So they were right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  And so you find out this stuff is made up just to gain the system.  It's awful.  But why do they do it?  Because they make money.  So there's going to be an ethic of pulling advertising from something that they already

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  did.  Google has announced that they are no longer allow AdWords on fake news sites.  And Facebook has said you can't use face fake news in in advertising.  Yeah, I agree with that.  The problem I still have with all of this is yes.  What is fake news?  I mean, right.  Right.  You know, somebody in the chat room said the Catholic Church has been disseminating  fake news for millennia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if your father, Robert Ballester, you may disagree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a second.  Wait a second.  Get get ready for your drinking game.  I'm reading a book right now about a brand Luther.  So Gutenberg comes up and what Gutenberg objects like, you know, all the relics.  It's water.  It's good thing.  Aren't you glad?  What are the relics that that Gutenberg locked up and sent away was a vial containing Mary's  breast milk?  Fake news of its time.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  And the church made quite a bit of money in a pre-adsense era selling selling relics,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  indulgences, indulgences in relics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait a second.  What is this Gutenberg drinking thing?  Oh, is this another thing that I like?  It's priestess.  It's a memo.  No, it's priestess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it used to be in the old days of this show that anytime Jeff mentioned Chipotle or Gutenberg  because Jeff and I agree with him.  In fact, I used to say these in my speeches all the time, you know, compare, you know,  the Gutenberg era to the modern times.  Jeff's even written a book called Gutenberg, the geek.  So and then what was it?  The other one was action, right?  Song, right?  Leistung Schutzrecht, which is which is something.  But which is it has to do with the German publishers and oh, God, you don't want to  go.  Oh, God, Jeff's doing it again.  It's a drinking game.  Yeah.  So you're supposed to drink.  It's a joke.  Nobody would do that.  They'd be on the floor before the show was.  I talk about Gutenberg so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I hadn't heard it until this moment.  So yeah, leveled off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  Last now.  So if you go to if you want to look up a meme like what's your name?  Jenny Yellen and George Soros in that commercial that was the dog whistle commercial.  If you go to Wikipedia and look up Soros Yellen, it doesn't know what to do.  If you look on Google and search for Soros Yellen, it starts to explain the memes to

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there is there a meme repository that would be beneficial that when you don't know  what's going on with the meme, you want to find out where it comes from, that there's  a place to go.  Oh, BuzzFeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's and there used to be a bunch of these.  I think they were acquired and shut down.  There was a I used to keep up on memes because I'm so old and out of touch.  I used to keep up with the kids.  There was a site with Know Your Meme.  Is it still around?  Oh, yeah. Know Your Meme is still around.  Is it? Yeah. Well, that's what that's for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I just I mean, you can if you see a meme, you just Google it and you're like, what the  heck is happening? See a meme, say a meme.  Know Your Meme is Know Your Meme on Twitter.  Yeah, there's your name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, there it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a site dedicated to documenting Internet phenomena, viral videos, image macros, catch  phrases, web celebs and more.  I think it's just become like yet another just place.  I think, you know, I think it was Ben Ha who started this of the Cheeseburger.  I can has cheeseburger.  I can has cheeseburger.  I can has cheeseburger.  Or did he buy it?  He's involved in some way.  I feel like he bought it.  He bought everything.  All right. Is everybody calm down a little bit?  Part of the thing I have to say that from the outside and I'm in the bubble, so I have to  use empathy to see this, is that it probably looks like this is a very bubble conversation,  that this is not really important to anybody outside the bubble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Well, but I went well.  I was on today's show yesterday morning, NBC News yesterday evening, probably CBS  evening news tomorrow, CBS Sunday morning and Sunday.  BBC media is going nuts for it because they love blaming Facebook for something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, my God.  But the media is not like real people.  No, the media is a bubble.  Right. But they're presenting this story to the world as if it matters.  Yeah. Well, that's because we love nothing more than talking about ourselves in the media.  Yeah. We just get so excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a little naval gazing, isn't it?  By the way, speaking of the Twitter, they have now suspended Richard Spencer's account.  And some other alt-right accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, people are complaining that this is too little too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or too much too soon.  Well, it depends on who's talking.  Richard Spencer says this is corporate Stalinism.  I am alive physically, but digitally speaking, there's been an execution squads across the alt-right.  There's a great purge going on and they're purging people based on their views.  It does feel a little bit like a reaction to Trump's election is like, OK, well, let's get rid of all these guys.  I mean, Spencer's been on Twitter for a long time.  Also, Pax Dickinson, Paul Town, Ricky Vaughn, John Rivers.  Were they suspended for an actual action like, oh, that tweet crossed the line?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is the Milo debate.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But if it's reactionary, I mean, it could be Twitter admitting some sort of role in what happened.  Or an influence that it does not want, a power that it does not want to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They do have a rule against hate, right?  On Twitter, that's one of the rules you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but getting to keep proving hate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is hate?  I mean, fake hate.  Well, and that's what some of these guys in the alt-right, like Richard Spencer, I mean, he's always smiling when he's saying this hateful stuff.  It's like, yeah, I'm joking. Come on. I'm tweaking your chain.  I'm yanking your chain.  I grew up, you know, at Yale.  I've always, like, wanted to know what the other side was thinking.  So I would go to these conservative events.  You would. Yes, you would.  There was a thing called the Political Union, which was great.  It had each. There was the Party of the Right, the POR.  There were all these different groups.  And there was a group of arch-conservatives, William F. Buckley Conservatives.  In fact, Buckley was kind of a prototype for this, who would say things with a smile and like, I'm joking.  But you always felt like there was that they meant it.  But they didn't. But they knew it was provocative and perhaps even racist or.  Anti-Semitic and.  By smiling, they gave you the impression.  I'm just joking. Well, Trump even did this, didn't he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A few times. OK, this is like every guy talking to a girl and insulting them about anything.  Right. Right. Or just kidding.  You can't take a joke.  So I called you a. Yeah. Can you say the B word?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No. Or it's worse.  Or it's when somebody when I was a kid, people used to say, no offense, but.  And I always knew. Yeah.  I don't want to hear the offensive thing they were going to say next, which was usually an insult.  No offense, but you have terrible body odor.  No offense. Mind you.  And they would say, well, I'm just speaking the truth, but I didn't want to offend you.  The Southern Poverty Law Center said that they had asked Twitter to remove more than  100 accounts of white supremacists who violated Twitter's terms of services.  So they may have simply used Twitter's built in reporting tool.  And Twitter may have just looked at the account and said, yeah, you're right.  And I mean, I don't know exactly what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I agree. This is a slippery slope, too.  Well, what's what do you think about this?  We've been on the run down elsewhere.  But so the Twitter finally comes out with efforts to deal with problems and harassment.  So so you can mute more things.  That strikes me as.  A paper tiger, because the harassment of you is going on all around you.  You just don't know about I've always complained about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Twitter's response to me complaining about trolling was, well, just mute them.  Yeah, so that fixes nothing.  That's putting your head in the sand.  That's yeah. What do you think, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think this is a solution.  I don't think it's something that can be solved because.  People are going to behave like jerks, I think.  Going like I know, Leo, you're like, oh, our advertisers,  you know, people are going to our advertisers and that sort of thing.  When people say bad things about you on Twitter.  I think your advertisers and people in general,  HR people, they need to have they need to take their information online  with a grain of salt, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, oddly enough, many of them don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just so we then we have to have to talk with them and then they do.  There was actually so this was a year ago or something.  Somebody tweeted something horrible.  No, I think what it was is I had said something about a sponsor  and they tweeted it in a way that it sounded like I'd said something else.  And the sponsor wanted to make it clear that I hadn't meant that.  And they wanted to put out a press release, a press release.  And I said, OK, so here's what you do. Go look at that account.  How many followers does that person have?  Hmm, none. When was it created?  Yesterday. OK, so who saw that tweet?  Us and and and who will see it if you have a put out a press release about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you did you tell them to go Google stress and effect?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I but I had explained that is the point.  And you'd think you'd expect people would know better.  No, they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My favorite tweet of yesterday is my friend, John Robinson,  who is a former newspaper editor, said, Boy, Jeff, people with 35 followers  really don't like you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Happy. But that's actually, believe it or not, a sophisticated point of view.  Oh, absolutely. He understood that is part of the problem I have with Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I really hate Twitter in this part.  Having nothing to do with me, you know, but it's just this is a problem  with Twitter, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's a familiarity with the medium and a willingness to think critically,  which people aren't necessarily able to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But isn't that what we're saying about fake news? Like.  People were saying give them give them tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Twitter gives us tools.  We can see that this egg that's tweeting with us, you know, is an egg  and has 10 followers, and then you're like, oh,  who cares what they think? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, anyway, I thought I'd just throw that Twitter story in,  and now we can move on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's let's talk about something that's about the Arnold router.  The the Arnold, no, almond router, our own router.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All router.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We should talk about it next week after I've had a chance to play with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why is it different than other?  Why is this router different than other routers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, oh, was that before the show?  OK, it was. I can't.  I was like, I can't remember when things happened.  I was before the show.  So this is a router that came out today.  And it is a.  Oh, it's pretty.  It's pretty. It's got a touch screen and it's mesh network capable.  And it has Zigbee, Z-Wave, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi radios inside.  So it can control a lot of your smart home stuff.  Or so you don't need a hub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it could be hacked in all sorts of new and different ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, so we can talk about that, too.  Z-Wave actually. Oh, no, that did not happen yet.  Zigbee. Zigbee.  We can talk about the Zigbee hack.  Yeah, Zigbee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hue lights were hacked using Zigbee as a as an intermediary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, people are really upset about this now, but.  This was actually a vulnerability reported over a year ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, it's an old vulnerability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's old vulnerability, and it's a manufacturer's.  It's actually Phillips Hue is bearing the brunt of this,  and they should be talking to their suppliers.  But this is a this is basically the tokens being put in chips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is like do about it, in other words. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nothing you or I could do about it.  I don't know why you're still writing headlines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You haven't stopped. There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So so this vulnerability, which is legit, is a chip thing.  And this kind of it's going to get worse before it gets better.  You guys, when it comes to the IOT,  because what we're seeing now is a bunch of people and you're going to hear about  this in the coming weeks are suddenly like, holy cow,  all the security stuff we said was part of our product that people should follow.  They're not following it.  So we're going to make them follow it as part of certifications.  So we're going to see that sort of thing coming down the pike.  And we're also going to see manufacturers get more diligent.  They're going to be their advice is going to get stronger,  I guess, to a company. So they'll be like, hey,  I noticed that you're building something that doesn't look quite secure enough.  Let me show you how it's done.  I like that. Wouldn't that be nice?  But that's the problem is that's not going to come to products for the next  like 18 months to three years, depending on.  And in the meantime, we've got all this old stuff.  It's kind of like Microsoft Clippy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Remember, he used to say, I see you're writing a shopping list. May I help?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I feel like it might be more like the protection squad  coming around your small business saying, I see that you're doing this.  Yeah. I think you're going to be forced into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, one more election story.  We had talked before the election about the Department of Homeland Security  going out, 40 states asking for help securing election databases.  There was worry about election fraud rigged system, et cetera, et cetera.  Nothing happened, right?  That we know of. We know.  Well, we would. Wouldn't we know about it by now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hmm. And it was it was really good.  And I can't maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, maybe that's it.  Maybe we lost because we were hacked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to stop talking about the election. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good. Good.  No, I got that note earlier, actually,  and ignored it.  You know me, I'm a rebel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to take a break. And then we do have there's so much.  There's a lot of other stuff happening.  Other stuff.  News from Google and one plus one and just just on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry, I got so excited when you said news from Google,  because we can talk about the photo scanning thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, that's one.  That's what actually they just handed me a photo so I could demonstrate it.  Oh, I want to understand it.  I want to get it.  We'll do that when we come back.  And let's see. Oh, a big a big acquisition,  a big acquisition, just an eight billion dollar acquisition just.  Oh, oh, you may not. Oh, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Expect. Are we talking about?  Well, I'm going to stay and listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I'm ruining your I'm ruining your stay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thanks. I'm sorry.  Yeah, we're talking about Samsung.  Anything else you'd like to say about that?  Oh, that's fine.  And why you might not want to use a cheap Android phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you open your Pixelbox? Did you keep it?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Do you like it?  Yeah, I had one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When we come back, I will tell you about my it was in the box.  I had one big problem.  Oh, when we come.  So that's also a tease. Another tease.  Jeff Rant. I'm sure they can't wait to hear me whine.  And a big anniversary that I want to celebrate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But first, let's talk about food.  Glorious food.  Stacey sitting there.  She knows after this show, she's got a big party.  She knows after this show, she's got a responsibility.  She's got a spatchcock of chicken or whatever it is she does.  Dinners, dinners, you know, it's almost dinner time.  And you know how it is. You work long, hard day.  You've been on podcasts all day.  Last thing you want to do, at least if you're me, think about a menu.  Plan a menu. Go shopping for ingredients.  Go home and cook the menu.  By then, it's 9 p.m.  And you'd wish you'd gone to Applebee's.  Or worse, you do what I do.  You go, there's a jack in the box on the way.  I'm just going to stop there.  Let's not do that. Let's go to Blue Apron instead.  In fact, if you go now to Blue Apron dot com slash twit  and get your first three meals free and the next time you're wondering,  what are we going to have for dinner tonight?  You'll have something wonderful waiting for you.  Blue Apron delivers seasonal recipe  with fresh, high quality ingredients right to your door.  Always exactly the ingredients you need.  Never extra so you don't waste.  You need one clove of garlic. You got one clove, not a whole head,  which is nice. I always hate that.  Seeing that clove of garlic rot there on my counter,  waiting for me to use it again.  Not with Blue Apron.  And all the menus can be prepared in 40 minutes or less.  They're delicious. Oh, they're getting ready for the holidays.  Roast turkey and cranberry sauce. Oh, that looks good.  Oh, Brussels sprouts.  I like Brussels sprouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what? Brussels sprouts become a Thanksgiving side.  Has that always been? Oh, yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And I love them.  But many people hate them.  But a great Brussels sprout recipe, you see, might be the ticket  because they're so good for you.  Those little crucifery just waiting to cure your cancer right there.  They're cancer fighting.  You'd take a cancer fighting pill.  Well, this is like that.  I'm not making any false health claims.  If you spend time eating out or maybe you go to those fancy grocery stores,  you're going to spend a lot less, about 60 percent less  with Blue Apron, under $10 per person for a healthy home cooked meal.  Plus, you get this great satisfying feeling that you made it.  There's nothing like cooking for your family.  It's like cooking up love.  And it's just great when they sit down to that Italian wedding soup  and they go, wow, this is great.  And they slurp it up in five seconds and they run out the door.  You could just say, mm, mm, mm, I cooked.  You also get this great feeling in the house because the house smells wonderful.  And by the way, the freshest, highest quality ingredients.  Seafood is sourced sustainably.  The beef is raised humanely.  The chickens are free range.  The porks are raised naturally.  It's the stuff you would buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the tomatoes are gorgeous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, did you get heirloom from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have never seen prettier tomatoes.  I don't know how they do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really, it's amazing.  Mm, mm, mm.  And sometimes you'll use ingredients you've never tried before,  and then you'll go, oh, I'm going to use that.  I found a new bok choy. It's not bok choy.  It's something else choy.  But it's like a bok choy, but it's so good.  It's my new thing. My new favorite thing.  Look at that. See a little tiny bottle of sesame oil instead of the,  you know, like a whole big one.  Just the right amount of, you know, soy sauce or whatever it is you need.  What's on the menu this week?  We'll take a look. Pan seared chicken with roasted fall vegetables  and butter caper sauce.  I guarantee you, you will be making butter caper sauce a lot.  All of a sudden, spicy lotus root and purple carrot stir fry  with sweet potato noodles. Yes, they have vegetarian meals.  You get to choose, though.  You go to BlueApron.com, you pick the menu for the week.  And that's what you're going to get.  They have plans for couples and plans for families with kid friendly ingredients.  And by the way, I love this research shows Blue Apron families  cook together nearly three times more often.  And that is what you want. Trust me.  Crispy shrimp po' boys, pan seared chicken.  Oh, look at. Oh, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy.  That looks delicious.  Sweet chili glazed cod, quinoa and broccoli burgers.  Chicken rollatini. Oh, wait a minute.  I want to know how to make that.  Oh, I'll be ordering that tonight.  My next box, chicken rollatini.  Oh, that looks good.  Blue Apron dot com slash tweet your first three meals free  and with free shipping.  Blue Apron ships to 99 percent of the continental United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Short rib burgers on pretzel buns. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you love pretzel?  Do you love the pretzel bread? Oh, yeah, I do.  Yes. We go to a pretzel.  We go to a restaurant that they fresh baked pretzel bread.  It's up in Healdsburg.  I'll take you guys there if you ever come visit.  It's up on Healdsburg.  Healdsburg and they Healdsburg is burger and they it's fresh.  So it's warm, fresh right out of the oven steaming.  And then they serve with it a lard and mustard butter  that you would just like flip your lid  and you eat that and it's heaven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right. I'm starving already.  I know. Blue Apron dot com slash tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know. I hate doing these ads.  They make me hungry.  At least I know it's waiting for me at home.  All right. So what should we start with?  The quick one. It's a quickie.  Samsung has just acquired Harman Kardon for eight billion.  Harman. Harman. Not Harman Kardon.  Eight billion. Thank you for the correction.  They're not called Harman Kardon anymore.  They're just Harman.  It's they do car accessories.  Harman International Industries, Incorporated, which is high.  They design and manufacture connected automobile entertainment systems.  I'm actually kind of interested in this because  Twitter is on the Harman Kardon radios.  They have podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's also it's also home stuff, too.  They do speakers as well still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Samsung. So Samsung acquired SmartThings.  They're really they they they want to be a player, don't they, in this  in this area. Connected home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they do.  And they also have a cloud service.  They also make modules, little connected chip modules  that you can build into products for IOT.  And. I look at this and I'm like, it's natural that  I feel like sorry, let me just let me just start all over again.  I feel like this is a natural deal for them.  The car is going to be connected.  The question is, who's going to do the connecting and what is the OS?  And so getting in there with this by makes sense.  And getting into speakers makes sense because your home's going to have to have a voice to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they also bought a Chinese electric  or a big stake in a Chinese electric car maker BYD company.  One one analyst said this is Samsung's life after smartphones.  Yeah, that's a good idea. Yeah.  Like, what do you do when your phone business blows up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not totally fair, because Samsung has a huge appliance business.  Oh, yeah. It has all these other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The mobile business was five percent of their overall market. Yeah.  So it's a small amount.  Nevertheless, it was their future.  You know, you can only sell so many refrigerators and bulldozers.  At some point, you got to, you know, you want to be in a big consumer category.  So apparently electric cars are going to be a big thing for them as well.  And all the things that go inside them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So many things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Harmon stuff is sold in BMWs, Volkswagens and GM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So who will buy Bose?  Does someone already know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, Bose. Bose was held by the family.  And of course, Mr.  Bose just passed. Dr.  Bose passed away fairly recently.  So that actually you may be exactly right.  I think MIT still owns a huge stake in Bose because Dr.  Bose gave them stock in the company when he created it.  He was right. MIT.  Amar Bose founded it in 1964.  You're right, Stacey.  I think Bose would be a good acquisition.  All right. And then you want to take a look at, you want to talk about this?  I got, I can demo it.  Say, why don't you tell us Stacey, what this is, this photo scanner thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I was like the phone.  What is this? Have you ever seen one of these?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The photo scanner, Google announced this this week.  It basically allows you to take a picture, but it's not actually a picture.  So you scan an old print picture.  So all of your old school print pictures, for those of us who are like older than 25.  You can use the phone as a formal scanner.  So it increases the high resolution image.  It's not lossy.  And it then stores it in Google's cloud where you can presumably organize it and do great things with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And as I'm about to demonstrate, the thing they say right up front is position photo within frame.  Tap button to start scanning.  Don't worry about glare.  Well, this is a very glossy photo.  So, okay, I'm going to position the photo within the frame, even though it's kind of weirdly angled, turns on the flash.  Now it says, I don't know, can you see it?  Move this circle over a dot.  So it's figured out what's what it wants.  It says, do this.  And I should be able to get a full.  So that was four or five images.  Nice work.  Your photo is being processed.  So this is the image, a very glossy image of my friend Winton and Vince Surf in their one in Vince wine cellar.  It looks like.  How well did it do?  Not great.  Not great.  I have to say that's that there's glare.  A lot of glare.  Yeah.  Well, you're also in a studio with a hell of a lot of that's true.  It's an unusual amount of light.  But what it did do is straighten it perfectly and stitch it perfectly.  So so that's impressive.  You can adjust the corners.  You can rotate it.  Let's see.  What else can we do with it?  Now, that's about it.  Looks like adjust corners, which is you see how it figured out what's squarish.  Figured out what's square on that from the initial image.  I bet you I bet you I could I could do another one and see if I'd do a better job of it.  What do you think?  Should I try again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did one last night and it looked good.  But again, I was not it was a glossy photo, but it was not your studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Right.  Well, and I think by moving it around, you can only get it so could do so much to ungloss it.  Right.  That's let's try one.  I'll give it one more shot here.  By the way, my thumb is going to be in the shot now.  Let's see.  All right.  Now it's processing it.  Let's see here.  Oh, yeah, that's much better.  Look at that.  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did it take your thumb out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, my thumb is still there.  So I'm getting these little kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But yeah, that's actually it looks like it did a did a pretty pretty good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This would be painful for doing this for like all of your photos.  But, you know, hey, now it is nice.  Like I might do it for a couple of my wedding photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because you have prints.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You don't have you don't have digital versions of actually have a CD, which I should probably move to something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  Guess you got married in the 80s, didn't you?  No, teasing you.  Teasing.  So once you do this, it gets imported into your Google Photos, where you do have, of course, many more edit tools.  That's pretty cool.  I think it's neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's free.  Yeah.  I have I have lots of and if you've ever done like family photos and wedding photos and those kind of things, a lot of times you have to pay a lot extra for the digital imagery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is this is a really evil thing for me to do for photographers.  All my friends who are photographers are going to be mad at me.  But now you have a way to like be like, oh, I got my one print.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah. They don't like that, do they?  No, they hate it.  No, that's how they make their money.  Legitimately so.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's see.  What else?  There's actually quite a bit of new Google news.  Google Translate is going to get better.  They're sending the so you first of all, Google Translate is already super cool.  Really good.  If you travel, you can fire up Google Translate and say or type a phrase and it will say or sometimes type the resulting translation.  It's very accurate.  Hundred and three languages.  It has the ability to do in some and many of those languages are conversational back and forth.  Jeff, you speak German.  Is it pretty good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's mistake.  You think it'd be better at recognizing certain mistakes, but some things are really hard.  German capitalizes nouns.  It refers back as an article.  A female noun is referred to as she.  Right.  Even though we would think of it as an it.  Right.  So there's things that you think they'd start to get to learn.  But no, I'm being quibbling.  The point is that when I get flummoxed on a sentence, which is very often, my German is very bad.  Google Translate will lead me the right way.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Awkwardly, but it might get better because they're now applying neural machines.  They're applying neural machine translation and statistical models to the text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They've been doing this for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it says today we're introducing the next step in making Google Translate even better.  Neural machine translation.  Oh, they've been doing it, but it hasn't been inside Google Translate.  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it's research.  I was like, Jeff Hinton, all of his stuff is CNN research is on translation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've had it, but they haven't put it into this nice free app yet.  Got it.  Today we're putting neural machine translation into action with a total of eight language pairs,  two and from English and French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Turkish.  That's about a third of the world's population and more than 35% of all Google Translate queries.  The advantage of this, of course, is it's looking at a larger chunk of so it can do sentences because it understands context better.  So here's a German phrase.  I'll let you read this, Jeff.  Problems can one never with the same Denkweise, consciousness.  Now, this is the old translation was no problem can be solved from the same consciousness that they have arisen,  which is obviously fractured, but you can kind of understand it.  The new translation, problems can never.  It makes any sense anyway.  Problems can never be solved with the same way of thinking that caused them.  That's a much more colloquial translation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, but let's philosophy.  Really?  This is what they're translating for us.  Well, if you can do philosophy, you can easily do which way to the bathroom.  Dundee a style, Banjo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And there's more coming today to this continue on in this blog post.  Google Cloud Platform, our public cloud service offers machine learning APIs that make it easy for anyone to use our machine learning technology today.  Google Cloud Platform is also making the system behind neural machine translation available for all businesses through a Google Cloud Translation API.  Wow.  Oh, oh, that is pretty amazing.  They're giving that one.  Well, maybe they're not giving it away.  But they're opening that up is pretty great.  And it's you know, a lot of this was done with community support in their translation community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So maybe, you know, well, if you want to if you want to catalog the world's information, it makes sense that you would translation is a key part of that.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can all get on the same page here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, is this our Tower of Babel?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We are in a tower of political babble now.  We all speak the same language, but it's got different meanings.  So bad news.  If you bought a blue phone, BLU, these have been very inexpensive phones, Android, but they also make Windows phones.  And apparently they're made in China.  Some security is about $50 for these blue phones and security contractors have discovered some of these phones had pre-installed software that monitored user where users go,  whom they talk to and what they write in text messages.  Now, the American authorities, according to the New York Times, say it's not clear whether this represents a secretive data mining for advertising purposes or a Chinese government effort to collect intelligence.  I'm going to bet the former.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  And this is I mean, Facebook does this, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is the name of the company is Shanghai Add Ups Technology Company.  700 million phones, cars and other smart devices.  BLU, which is actually I take it back an American manufacturer, not a Chinese manufacturer, said that 120,000 of its phones have been affected, but they've updated the software to eliminate the feature.  It sounds like it's really about ads.  You know, monitor everything the user does and we'll give you better ads.  They said that it wasn't it was supposed to be on Chinese phones, but not it was inadvertently put on American.  Well,  Blue said we didn't know we fixed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So can I ask a different question to a different topic?  Yeah.  Have you have you been using the new Android Auto on your phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not yet.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can now without Android Auto in the car, you can use it.  You can.  You're the current Android Auto will act like on your phone will act like it is in the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you'll have to download the app because it's a separate app.  By the way, you know what?  There have been auto Samsung's offered an auto app.  A lot of companies make apps.  All the Samsung phones come with an app that when you are in a car, that simplified user interface comes up on your phone screen.  And it limits the kinds of things you can do to music, you know, ways, stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have I have like a freaking computer in my car, so I don't really worry about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we drive a Tesla, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'll humble bride.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do want an echo in my car.  I find myself because I can talk to my Tesla, which is nice, stupid, but it's dumb.  And now I'm like, holy moly.  You know, I'll be I'll have like a legit question.  And I'm like, oh, but in January, hopefully the Pebble core comes out and that's supposed to be like a little wearable Android button.  I'm sorry, a little wearable echo button.  So I'm hoping I'll be like, boop, boop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's using the echo interface.  So far. Oh, that's neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It has it. Yes, it has Alexa capability. Alexa voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's really cool.  So so I'm firing up the Android Auto right now on my Pixel.  Boy, it asks permission to do everything it wants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because I don't who wants an app in their car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a sucky way. Well, if you don't have Android Auto so that you put your, you know, your phone in your car and you see it on the car screen this way.  What you do is you you you have a mount and you put your phone there and then it's like what I do in ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, which would lead us to our story about the Pixel in a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So let me just turn this on and see what it looks like.  Permission needed. Oh, you have to connect it to.  I can't do it because I have to connect to the car.  Yeah, I should have got the other phone.  Oh, wait a minute. It says, yeah, Tesla Model X. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, so I can do this with my Tesla. Yeah.  So here's the interface. Here's the interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, here's my calendar. Very simple.  If you turn it this way, probably be better.  No, this way is better. I can still see my Tesla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My Tesla gives me my calendar. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But do you get this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ways. Ways. OK, Google, find gas stations.  That's Google Maps. Google Maps. Yeah, I do get Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can make a so it's big buttons.  I'm not going to show these phone numbers, but it's a big buttons.  Right. And then I can listen to music and you get to select which music app you can show it.  Now, which music app you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So it shuts down certain things that would be dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's very it's a very simple, simple interface like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I've been waiting to buy a car until I get Android Auto.  And I like it, but I don't know if it actually may not be selling to me.  I don't know what the site using the Android Auto auto thing is.  What happens is when I'm when I stop in the parking lot and I say, OK, look at Twitter now.  Well, I have to turn off Android Auto to do that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bit of a pain. Yeah. So it's it's really only three apps.  Because of this front page interface, I have my book.  I have my navigation based on my calendar. I could hit that and would navigate to it.  I have weather here. Right.  So let's say I want to go get my hearing aid tuned up.  I just press that button and then I get and then I get.  And if it's paired to the speaker on the phone, it'll go over the car stuff.  That's pretty good. You know what? I might use this.  You'd need what you'd want as a mount on your dashboard or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I use the one that just goes, gee, we had all the complicated mounts.  Yeah, just need a suction cup.  Well, no, no, not even that goes into the ventilation.  And it just the spring thing like this. Right.  We always used to have these mounts that had, you know, two pounds of plastic and all that stuff.  And it was just so ridiculously overdone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I have a little dashboard.  I mean, that's a really easy way to do it. Yeah.  So you would want to plug it in, obviously, and plug it into the.  Yes, yes, yes.  That's not bad. It's not better than the interface on most cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should try it out. I'm curious to hear your reaction to it.  I'll try it on the way home.  OK, so you want to hear my Pixel story?  Yeah, so you have a Pixel XL.  XL. The big one.  And I went back and forth, back and forth, neurotic, this drives your audience crazy.  I can't decide. I box it up. I get all.  So then I'm ready to say, OK, I'm going to I think I'll keep it.  They don't convince me.  And I should know about Daydream.  And OK, I'll do.  So then I say I opened up the box and I go take a drive and I go ahead and switch the SIM and I take my drive.  And the GPS is like 50 yards off. Yeah.  So it's driving me completely.  It almost got me into an accident because it's switching the directions every which way because it thinks it's going that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not going that way. That road you're going over.  It's actually over there where you're over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's so I restarted. I do all of these posts.  Do I go to the support forum and I talk to I do everything you're supposed to do.  All right. Two pieces of the story.  One is OK. It's a pixel pixel has its own dedicated service.  Right. Wonderful Google service.  So I call and I mean a nice person but it was like calling Dell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I have a Google support story we can talk about too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love Stacey's enthusiasm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, good. She's not a burnout, dried out old cynic like you and me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I got all mad and unhappy.  I'm growling and Twitter and all over.  But then I go back to support for people there.  You know, the beautiful thing about other customers is they're trying different things they're working on.  Right.  So by the trick was it must have taken some kind of settings.  There's problems with GPS on this phone, I think, with other other reasons people said.  But if you delete the cache, delete the data, uninstall and then reinstall the app without signing in at first, it'll it'll click on.  Right. And so it's been working fine for about five days.  So I'm keeping it. Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was your only complaint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a big one because I use I depend upon ways every day.  If I can't use ways, I am doomed.  Yeah.  All right, Stacey.  Over to you.  OK, so similar story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Little different.  I bought a Google Home product.  Right.  And this was last week.  I connected it.  I was talking to it.  It was exciting.  And then I went to I connected my nest.  That was good. It worked.  Then I went to connect my Phillips hue lights and it didn't work.  It didn't work.  And the process is you add the device, you click.  It says, do you want Ness Phillips hue or smart things?  And I said, oh, Phillips hue.  And then it opens up a browser window for the authentication for your lights.  And during that process, when it did that, it was like, oh, failed.  And so I was like, oh, I'll try it again.  Didn't work because you weren't seeing it on your screen.  I mean, no, it just it just said failed to connect.  And I got the troubleshooting page.  So the troubleshooting page was reboot, reboot, sorry, reboot the Google Home,  reboot your Phillips hue.  And if that doesn't work, try something else.  So then I went to the deeper troubleshooting page because that was the one that showed up when you failed.  Oh, and it also said, make sure the lights are on and your Phillips hue.  All of that was working.  So eventually I had to call support because the next level of support was not great.  And that person was very nice, but she didn't.  She basically walked me through the same steps that were on the website.  And she failed to ask me what I feel are basic questions like what are the routers you're using?  What is your browser? Right.  So then but I spent half an hour on the phone with a person and my lights weren't connected.  She was very nice.  And then she was like, I don't know.  She brought in some people apparently that she was talking to.  And she's like in 48 or 24 to 48 hours, you'll have an answer.  And I was like, wow.  So then I get this email from Google with my answer and it had the same like first six steps.  And then it was like then it went into uninstall the app, reinstall it.  And then it was like, if that didn't work, just try it on a different device.  I was like, and that was it.  I complained about it on my podcast and I actually got the right answer from Phillips.  They were like, look, you are using ad block as your browser and it only supports Chrome and Safari.  Of course. And someone else on Twitter was like, hey, you know, I was using Firefox as my browser and it didn't work for me either.  But at no point in time during the Google, what browser are you using?  They never ask because sometimes sometimes the mesh network routers can be weird.  Right. There's a lot of challenges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All those things you need to know. Yeah. If you're going to diagnosis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. So so that was that was my not perfectly nice people, but completely useless support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Support is really hard. And most people don't get an answer when they call support.  Almost always Googling it and going to the forums is the best solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But this is such a new problem.  Like and that's that's why I talked about it, because I knew someone in my audience probably would have dealt with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Smart. Exactly. Crowd source.  But yes, it's hard. I mean, I do support on the radio every weekend.  It's hard. And you just what you want.  Here's my attitude on calling support. By the way, this is kind of new for Google, right?  Because they in the past, it was we always joked it was support via Python script.  You know, they don't have to give you much human support for Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got great support on the Pixel computers.  Stuff you pay for. That's different. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Google Apps for Business G Suite, you should get good service.  By a $1200 computer, you should get good service.  Buy a thousand dollar phone or, you know, a hundred dollar doohickey.  You should get better service anyway.  But I think it's hard to do in every computer company.  This is such a this is very typical, Stacey, your experience.  The only reason I ever call support is really the only reason I don't ever expect an answer.  But what I'm hoping is if they're getting a lot of people reporting a problem that they'll know that either.  That's all I wanted to do. Right. Exactly.  Either anecdotally or there's a bulletin on their wall saying, hey, if people call about this, we're boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we. But most of the time, I want you to do.  I said, I said, stop giving me the script. I've already gone through all the things that other people have done.  Just tell me that you're going to say I know about this and they wouldn't do it.  Yeah. Well, they didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They didn't. Yeah, they didn't know about mine.  I was kind of hoping that someone had had encountered this problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's poorly designed. You know, you understand what they have.  They have a notebook with a decision tree in it.  Yes. And you can hear her going through the notebook.  All right. Let's see. Page 42. Did you?  I mean, she was so sincere. Yeah, she's doing the best she can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Which is why you have to be like I was nice.  I did all the steps and yeah, it was cute.  She finally did ask me what kind of phone I was using, but it wasn't even a troubleshoot.  It was so she could pick the diagram to tell me where like the buttons were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Customer support is only notable when it's good, because, you know, when you get something there and it really helps and it fixes it, that then you go, wow.  Most of the time, it's exactly what you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have had customer support with Verizon of all places where I've had really challenging technical issues in by gum.  If that person did not stay on the phone with me and solve my problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've even had good support from Comcast.  You know, I mean, even a even a broken clock's right twice a day.  It's just. Yeah.  There's a new Google Play Music update that allows again machine learning.  We're seeing Google apply machine learning across the board.  It looks at your location and tries to suggest music that's appropriate to where you are, the time of day and what you're doing.  It's always had time of day stuff, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But should I be using play music, you guys, because I really love Spotify.  No, stick with Google Home. I'm like, I could use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you use Spotify with Google Home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yes, you can. OK, so as you can use Spotify.  I have subscription. I actually let my Spotify lapse because I have a subscription to Google Play Music and Amazon, that new Amazon Unlimited Music and Google Play is fine with me.  Here's the biggest difference between that and Spotify.  Google Play Music has a music uploader I put on my computer and I have all the music I've ever bought or owned or digitized.  You know, many, many gigabytes of songs are uploaded to Google Play Music, so I have access to my full music library in addition to its own.  And that's only useful if you have something that's weird, unusual.  I have like up sampled Beatles songs, stuff like that.  Actually, I don't even can you get Beatles yet? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you can on Spotify and Amazon Music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you can get Beatles on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sold out, man. Man, they sold out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I like Google Play Music. I think it has the world's ugliest interface.  Look, this is the interface.  Would you guys agree with me? This Spotify looks so good.  It's just as hideous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What kind of music do they play for here? Scroll up to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't have local.  Here's getting things done.  Music getting things done.  I'm a boss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I was hoping for work, work, work about the money featuring young thug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice. Yeah.  I better stop this right now.  There might be some explicit lyrics there.  They think I like hip hop because I uploaded a ton of hip hop, but it belonged to my son.  Epic film scores, you know, belong to my son.  Epic film scores. That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that songs to run across the field to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So when you log in, if you have me, play me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The hills are alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just I think Spotify. I have to say I think Spotify's user interface looks a heck of a lot better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I like as so the discoverers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love Discover Weekly. God bless it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's awesome. Although my daughter, holy cow, you guys, she discovered Pokemon and all she does is play.  There are two things that happen in my house more than any other.  It's the Pokemon theme song and an acapella mashup of Daft Punk's greatest hits by a group called Pentatonix.  Oh, you got to love the Pentatonix.  And I was like, oh, really?  Well, totally messing with my discover.  Let me just tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, and just so because she plays it through your account, do you get as a result?  Do you get that in your Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I get some weird stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sound a little familiar?  Are you hearing this a lot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it was really bad when Frozen was big.  Did your daughter get a lift?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I lived through that. Thank you.  Yeah, I thought so.  I actually she dressed as Anna one year for Christmas and I dressed as Elsa.  Oh, and by golly, we looked amazing.  Cute, cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like Google Play Music.  I think they all have pretty much the same songs now.  So it's really things like the curated playlist, the user interface.  Spotify really looks best on all platforms.  I really like Spotify.  I kind of miss it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You did have a story on here about Spotify writing crazy amounts of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we talked about this yesterday and security.  Now it's just a bug in Spotify in its implementation of the MySQL database or was it SQLite?  I can't remember, but they were compressing the database constantly.  You're only supposed to do that every once in a while.  So as a result, it would write gigabytes.  It wasn't filling up drives with gigabytes.  It would write the same write and erase, write and erase, write and erase in effect because it was compressing the database like every second.  It's just a bug.  They fixed it.  But if you had an SSD, they may have worn out your SSD before they fixed it.  It was pretty bad, pretty bad.  So get the if you don't have the latest Spotify, you should get it right now, especially if you're using a computer with SSD or I guess any phone is an SSD.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, someone just brought up a speak and spell in the chat.  Oh, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You come from speak and spell territory down there.  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had a speak and spell.  My husband and I still yell out to each other when something happens.  We're like, I win in that speak and spell voice.  Wow.  I know we're young, apparently.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's funny because I always shout Hoover wins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the vacuum or the president?  It was a bad joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I should have said Truman wins.  Then it would have been obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Dewey wins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right.  Project Era.  We never knew it.  And now you can see photos of Google's canceled Project Era and its full spec sheet.  I never thought this was going anywhere.  This is the modular phone system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But yeah, Leo, you told me you were like, Stacy, this is not going to work.  It's going to be janky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And this was the Motorola.  It was a Motorola project, which Google kept when they sold off Motorola.  So beautiful.  So dead.  Yeah.  There's enough. There's too many phones out there as it is.  We don't need more phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we've had peak phone and peak phone for sure.  They can do.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, my new Canvas Google watch Macaulay shipped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, your Daydream.  That's not Canvas, my friend.  That's a space age material.  Same material they make running shirts out of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was going to say someone did a review and it was like sweatpants on your face.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a space age material that wicks moisture away and you can remove the inside thing and it's washable.  I still don't really understand how this differs from cardboard.  It's just a more expensive, better made, softer version of Google Cardboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's right.  Because we decided the hardware had nothing to support.  Oh, no, we decided the hardware had nothing to support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right now it's only pixels, but they say other phones will support it down the road.  But you got one free, right, Jeff?  Because you bought a pixel.  I bought a pixel, but nobody ever mentioned a free Daydream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you should be getting the code in your email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's what you got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, what should I search for?  Google Support Bot?  Did you search for Daydream?  Daydream. There you go.  You'd be surprised.  Oh, yeah. Your Daydream view promo code is coming soon.  Oh, good.  Oh.  This came today an hour ago.  Hi there. Hi there.  Thanks for your recent pixel purchase.  Be on the lookout for your Daydream view promo code.  It'll be emailed to you within four weeks of your pixel shipment date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's passed, hasn't it?  Well, this came today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's weird, really?  I ordered it. I ordered the pixel October 4th.  Yeah.  So this is no... Yeah, it's too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's your Daydream view promo code.  That's what it said.  Mine's coming soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't really care. But good. You can review it before I do.  Let's see. Real quick.  I just want to make sure we get all the really interesting stories in here that we've missed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just for future reference, I won't go talk about it now.  There's the Intercept, which is to say Glad to Read Wides.  I was reading this right now.  And it's a fortress.  There's this building in Lower Manhattan that is nothing but solid concrete.  It's a high-rise from bottom to top.  But all telephone switching buildings look like this.  This is a high-rise one. This is pure. It's really weirdly obelisky.  So this is new?  And no, no, no. It's an old building.  It's on my screen right now.  Just if you want to see it. Put it up, please. Thank you.  Yeah. So it's quite amazing.  You're not getting my screen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you getting my screen? Is that a problem?  I'm seeing it. I'm seeing it.  No, no, that's not my screen. That's what he's getting from my screen.  Okay. My fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the NSA had secret rooms there to do stuff.  So it's just a good story.  The other good story, another day, as I put up on the rundown, is a Theranos whistleblower.  Schultz's grandson. And it's pretty harrowing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  God, I'm so disappointed by that story.  Oh, same here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry, I have to ask. Is this 60 Hudson that we're talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, 33 something else. Taylor or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was designed by an architectural firm whose grand vision was to create a communication nerve center like a 20th century fortress with spears and arrows replaced by protons and neutrons laying quiet siege to an army of machines within.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They built it in 33 Thomas Street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, built in created started in 69 was finished by 74.  The brutalist structure still used by AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Built to withstand a nuclear attack.  Oh, well, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So all telco towers are built like like any sort of data center.  Switching centers.  How often do you see one that big?  It's New York.  No, there's one in Amsterdam that is like, I don't know how many square feet it is.  It's not as high, but it is literally surrounded by a moat.  Okay, there may be sharks in the moat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So documents from the Edward Snowden Trove obtained by the Intercept do not specifically name 33 Thomas as a surveillance facility.  However, taken together with architectural plans, public records and interviews with former AT&T employees conducted for this article, writes the Intercept.  They provide compelling evidence that 33 Thomas Street has served as an NSA surveillance site code named Titan Point inside a major international gateway switch that routes phone calls between the US and countries across the world.  A series of top secret memos suggest the agency has tapped into these calls from a secure facility within the building.  It's the core location for the controversial NSA surveillance program that has targeted the communications of the UN, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and at least 38 countries, including allies like Germany, Japan and France.  There's not so that much of a story here.  If it weren't a really scary looking building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what it's just kind of.  Thank you, Leo.  Thank you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The reason it's a scary looking building is because that's all data centers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All data centers are scary looking.  We have one in town.  I shouldn't say this, but I've been brought inside one.  Oh, I've been inside so many data centers.  You're not supposed to be in there.  Do you have a friend in the biz?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  Not regular data centers.  AT&T data centers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have been inside the AT&T.  They're supposed to be secure.  I was in the national.  I'm a very secure person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, I got in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, you know, well, the one the one in Bedminster is a knock that they take people as the national  knock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They take people into.  Oh, they love showing up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're knocks because there's room with all of the screen and blinking lights and all  that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Look, this is your Internet on the screen.  And you're like, yeah, has anybody have you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you go to Big Sur to get the snap tickles?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but there is it really in Tulsa?  Is that really happening?  The next one?  Eight hours away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go, baby, go get going.  When is it?  No, no, I think it's there now.  Did they?  Big Sur's.  Well, it's too late.  If you by the time you hear about it, the line's too long and you're not going to get  one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I feel like in Tulsa, maybe you had a chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The one in Big Sur, you had to hike through a park to get there.  And there was a huge line.  So remember, we thought that they were there.  There it is.  A special vending machine.  And we thought wouldn't it be funny if you just walk in down the street and you saw that  and what and you've got there only 130 bucks.  But we thought they were going to offer them only to influencers on Snapchat.  And apparently, like they're creating incredible demand by this kind of selling for like a thousand

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  bucks.  I think Joanna Stern was showing her emails where she was trying to get a copy or get

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a.  I think the Wall Street Journal should spring for a thousand dollars for those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really?  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Snapchat doesn't need the money.  They have, according to Reuters, secretly filed for their IPO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That means maybe they do need the money because they don't want to go public with their finances.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think this secret filing is allowed now under Jobs Act or something, right?  It's something new.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you have to go filing if you have more than or you have to go public if you have  more than a certain number of shareholders.  I don't know if they said that.  Apparently not.  You know.  OK.  So they were just like, what up?  We don't want to share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The guess is that the IPO will be as soon as March for 20 to 25 billion dollars.  It would be the largest U.S. technology IPO since Facebook in 2012 with 81 billion.  Would you buy Snapchat stock?  It's now called Snap.  Would you buy Snapchat stock?  Me?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No?  No.  Well, I don't buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I don't.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  Neither.  None of us do.  Or maybe Jeff does.  But I don't.  You don't.  We recuse ourselves.  But if you if you did, would you like I said, buy Facebook stock at the time, which was  correct advice, not that you should ever listen to me for stock advice.  But I believe my position there was you're investing in Mark Zuckerberg and that that  company, even though there's challenges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't want to invest in Evan Spiegel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yes, exactly.  Exactly.  Right.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  I go by that if I go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's going to be hot, though, because people think it's the next Facebook.  Everybody wants to get the next Facebook.  The company Ray has raised huge amounts of venture capital.  It's not like they need the money at this point.  But still, why not cash in what you need for employees?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you're going to actually make these freaking spectacles.  That's a it's not a cheap endeavor.  So floating that floating that vending machine to Big Sur and Tulsa takes cash and helium  is in short supply.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think it comes in on balloons?  They do have balloons attached, but I think they got a truck.  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They probably have a truck.  I'm thinking they use up more fish.  It means transportation truck and a crane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we're done.  I think we're going to take a break and come back with your picks of the week, tips.  I'm so excited about my I know you got one.  I know you got one.  But first, a word from FreshBooks.  If you're a small business, a small business owner, if you're a sole proprietor or a freelancer,  you know the worst thing is the end of the month when you got to well, there's paying  bills, but then there's sending bills.  If you don't send bills, you're not going to be paying bills because you're going to  be getting paid.  So you got to do the invoices.  I always hated that part.  I was never good at it.  And I found out about FreshBooks in 2004 and have been using it ever since and loved it.  Actually, I now have a team of people, but for years that was how I invoiced people,  how I did my expenses.  And the new FreshBooks, by the way, all new, completely redesigned, looks gorgeous.  And it's not just about sending invoices.  It's about knowing where you stand.  So many freelancers, if you said, have you made a profit this year, would not know the  answer.  They'd say, well, I'm working.  I'm paying my bills.  How much did you make?  Well, if they use FreshBooks, they go to their FreshBooks page and they say immediately how  much they made.  You know, because it's not just invoices.  It's when you get paid, how much you got paid, what your expenses were.  It's also really great at tax time.  Makes it very easy because you can print all the reports that the, you know, the accountant  said, well, I need a P&L sheet.  I don't know what that is, but here's the button.  You don't need to be an accountant to do the right thing, to keep track of how you're doing,  to send those invoices.  By the way, the tool to make and send invoices is so easy and they look great and there's  no formatting nor formulas.  You can add your logo and your custom color scheme.  And when you send out an invoice, FreshBooks knows if your client has seen it.  And so they can't dodge you by saying, oh, I didn't get your invoice yet.  Yes, you did.  You opened it last night, 6 p.m.  Dude.  Actually, you don't have to do that because they also will send out late pay reminders  and stuff.  They do a lot of the work for you.  Frankly, your clients are going to love it because they can pay using a variety of online  payment systems, including credit cards, right from the invoice.  So it makes it easy for them to brand new.  If you haven't looked at FreshBooks lately, go right now to freshbooks.com slash twig.  It is fantastic.  Fantastic.  And it's so nice to have that information you need to do business without becoming a  paper pusher.  You know, you didn't get into business for, you know, because you want to be an accountant,  but you do need to do a little bit.  And this makes it easy.  How's my business doing?  Know at a glance.  The notification center works like a personal assistant, letting you know what's changed  in your business since the last time you logged in and what should be dealt with, like overdue  invoices.  You can even take pictures of receipts on your phone using the FreshBooks app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does it tell you to stop taking Ubers because it's costing you a lot of money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, well, you'd see what your Uber expenditures were.  You bet.  And you can, it makes it easy to bill them out to the client too.  And if you do time and hours, it'll track your time as well.  Freshbooks.com slash twig for a 30 day unrestricted free trial right now.  But you got to do me a favor.  And when they ask you on the form, how did you hear about us?  Make sure you say this week in Google.  Freshbooks.com slash twig, your 30 day free trial awaits.  Oh, you were so excited.  I'm going to let you go right ahead, Stacey Higginbotham.  What do you got for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have the June Oven, which I believe I.  Oh man, you got it.  Okay.  Yes.  So I got a review unit.  So I had to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People are laughing at me because I bought it after you talked about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's I, okay.  I played with this thing for a week and a half.  I cooked over a dozen meals.  It was the best thing to happen to my cooking since I don't know.  Everything worked so well.  And I did a video.  You should show people the video so they can see it in action because you really have to  see this to appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Press the button.  So it's a, it's a toaster oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not as it's a toaster.  So it has toasting, roasting, baking.  It's a countertop oven.  So it will also double as a toaster oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Toaster ovens will do all of that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, well that's true.  Okay.  So, but it's bigger than the average toaster oven.  So you could fit up to a five pound chicken in it.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like the countertop oven.  I like the way it, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that was it saying, oh my God, those are waffles.  And I toasted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They know they'd see it and they recognize it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you not see that in the video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It has a camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It has a camera with artificial intelligence.  So computer vision.  So it's pre-programmed recipes for things like  when I put salmon filets in there, it was like-  It's the Tesla of ovens.  It is.  It was like, is this salmon or strudel?  And then it cooked my salmon at 283 degrees.  Cause I said, I wanted it medium.  It knew.  It knew.  It knew it had the recipe in there.  The cool thing is, is like if it knows what something is,  it's like, boom, I got this.  And if it doesn't, you basically,  so I put in a pork roast and it had a bunch of vegetables  around it.  So it was like, I don't know what this is.  So I was like, oh, there's presets.  I went into the pork preset.  I clicked it and it was like, what internal temperature  do you want this cooked to?  What I did is I took the accompanying temperature probe.  I jammed it in there.  There are weights in the feet of the oven.  So it knows exactly how much meat there is.  Wait a minute.  It's a scale?  It's a scale.  So using all that information,  plus the temperature of the oven, it was like, all right.  And then, you know, we're estimating that it's going to take  like 45 minutes to cook this.  And I'm like, cool.  But then the internal temperature of the meat  was rising faster,  probably cause there were vegetables in there too.  Not just meat.  So it knew that though.  And it was like, oh, look, it already reached 150.  You're good to go.  And that was delicious.  The downside is it's $1,500.  A lot of money.  I will tell you that my normal ovens are $1,500 each.  I've got two of them.  Had I known that this was coming out,  I would have only gotten one  and would have used this as my secondary oven  for Thanksgiving and all the other times I used it.  And it's going to get updated over time.  So right now, like their cookie recipe  was a little not great.  And it's because they were like,  we set it for refrigerator store-bought cookies.  So it was higher when they started.  Like the temperature was-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it knows cause they're in the refrigerator.  It needs to start warmer and heat them up faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So now it's going to ask you, they did a tweak.  So it'll say, hey, are these homemade or store-bought?  And if you say homemade, it's going to change it up.  So there you guys go.  It was so good and it's so expensive.  And I can't buy one, but I want one.  My husband was, this is one of the only gadgets  that my husband is like, holy cow, this is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How long did you have it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had it for a week and a half.  Too bad you couldn't keep it through Thanksgiving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know.  Yeah.  So I just looked in my email and I got, yesterday,  I got an email from June saying,  we're in mass production,  which means you'll have your June Oven on your countertop  very soon over the next few weeks.  June Ovens will start to make their way  to their distribution center in California.  And then they'll ship to the first pre-order customers.  That's you.  So I don't know when I'll get mine.  I'm probably not in time for Thanksgiving, but I-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, probably December, I think,  is what they're telling people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm telling you, Lisa thought I was insane  when I told her how much it cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, she is gonna love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we use our toaster oven all the time for everything  because it's easier to use than a big oven.  So even for things like making chicken or French fries  and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And imagine Blue Apron teaming up with them  and creating recipes where you literally just like,  I mean, I made dinner, during my lunch break, basically,  I made various roasts and stuck it in the fridge.  And then I just gave it to my husband  and he can cook and follow instructions,  but it was even better for him

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because he'd be like-  Like a husband can follow instructions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He can follow instructions now.  I've been training him.  Like when I smashed hot that chicken,  that was, I was testing this-  Did that come out well last time?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, and I didn't have anything to do with it  because I was doing the show, he put the chicken in,  he jammed that thermometer in there.  And he was like, it said roast chicken.  Do you want it extra juicy, juicy or well done?  And-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, he did it.  You were sneaky.  You didn't tell us he was doing it in the June.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I couldn't.  I was under-

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that happens all the time.  It was delicious.  Is that it?  Is that a spatchcocked?  That's it.  That's a spatchcocked chicken right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it should have been smushed flatter,  but you can see it's a little,  I mean, the oven is, it's smallish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'd have to spatchcock it  to get a big bird in there probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  You'd have to dismember it, I think.  Okay.  Sorry.  You'd have to hack that sucker up and arrange it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I bought it because of you.  I should really give that $100 referral fee to you,  but you still need 15 more to get one.  All right.  Okay.  Neat.  Is it Juneoven.com?  June.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's Juneoven.com.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just Google June Oven.  Do what everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But gosh, help Leo out, man, you guys.  So Lisa doesn't get so mad at him.  You could go, he's got a referral link.  It's Juneoven.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You save a hundred bucks when you use that referral link.  That's highly inappropriate for me to do that.  So I'm not going to flog that.  I did it then, though.  I regret doing it, but I did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, vegans, it makes the best kale chips.  I roasted broccoli.  I roasted potatoes.  Mostly, I love, like, I didn't cook any tofu,  but I usually sauteed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like the idea of roasting cauliflower  and roast vegetables are delicious.  So if it does a good job at that.  It's going to make Brussels sprouts actually edible?  Yes, actually, roast Brussels sprouts are delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And yes, it is not for massive holiday baking  for the people who are saying this is for like.  Oh, but it's a good secondary oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't put your turkey in there,  but you put your stuffing in there  so that your stuffing, you shouldn't cook in the turkey  that's unsanitary, but you put it in there  and then your stuffing's ready  and you don't have to, you can have separate.  It's like having two ovens.  One little one.  I use my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One big one.  I usually cook my meat in one oven  and then I have my secondary oven is all our vegetables  or whatever's happening.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It will just, so yeah.  It is a little pricey, but I hope they do well.  Cause I, you feel like it really was smart.  Like it's a smart oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is, it is smart.  And if you're a super advanced chef,  you can actually control the heating elements  to your own specification.  So it's smart and it can grow with your cooking skills,  which I thought was pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My stomach's been growing with my cooking skills.  So it's not that hard to do.  And there's somebody in the chat was saying  there is a a hundred day trial.  So you could return it.  Oh, well hot diggity.  Get it for Thanksgiving and then send it back.  Get through the holidays and then send it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's a 16 by, oh crikey.  Oh, it will only fit one nine or nine by 13 baking dish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is fairly small.  It's like, it's like toast.  It's like a large toaster oven.  Yes.  Jeff Jarvis, give us a number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So my number is Facebook's had a little problem  with numbers lately.  They've had two spurts of bad advertising results,  a bad advertising metrics rather.  The first, as we know, remember a while back was that they  were under overreporting video plays.  And then they had a whole bunch,  kind of boring stuff, but important to the editing industry.  Organic reach was miscalculated  because it didn't do repeat visits.  Organic reach pay metric was,  will now include only viewable impressions.  There was an issue found with an instant articles  that if overreported average time spent by seven to 8%,  you add it all up and there's some issues there.  So Facebook's doing three things about it.  One is they're launching a measurement council.  Two is they're bringing in additional third party  verification measures.  And three, they're introducing,  and this will solve everything, a blog called Metrics FYI,  a series of about being upfront about this.  So that's when they discover bugs and discover errors,  they will be more open about it, which is a good idea.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So numbers, numbers, numbers.  Patrick Delahanty says he has a number for you.  15,910, the number of total episodes on twit.tv  of all the shows ever.  I'm on most of them.  That's a lot of shit.  That's a lot of air.  That's a lot of Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a lot of Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was gonna say that's a lot of hot air.  Hey.  I'm sorry.  Hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know.  It's okay, I deserve it.  You know, my pick is gonna actually be an early pick  because later this week we're gonna review  the new Apple MacBook Pro.  And I'll have, you know, I just got it yesterday.  We got a 13 and a 15.  We've been playing with them ever since.  We'll have a longer review on Saturday  on the new screensavers.  But I wanted to kind of mention,  because I'd given Apple a hard time on this  that it wasn't innovative,  that there wasn't really the computer professionals  we're looking for, the speed and so forth.  And that's still true.  I mean, any laptop that's tapped out at 16 gigabytes  is really underpowered these days, 16 gigabytes of RAM.  But there are a few bright lights here.  It's a gorgeous screen.  It supports the P3 color gamut,  which means it's a very accurate screen,  as accurate as any screen sold for desktop or laptops today.  Beautiful, crisp, bright, and vivid colors.  I also was a little worried about the keyboard  because it looks like a duplicate of the MacBook keyboard.  But Apple said, well,  we've done a little bit something different  and it is more clickety.  And I'm thinking a little bit for me,  I did not like the MacBook keyboard.  In fact, never really could use it well.  I've already become accustomed much more so  to the new MacBook Pro keyboard.  I feel like it's pretty good.  The touch bar, which of course is the only real innovation  in here, is very interesting.  I love using my fingerprint to unlock the laptop.  This is the first time for Apple.  Certainly not the first time on a laptop.  PCs have had this for probably a decade.  It does also do some interesting things  when you launch apps from Apple.  It's programmable, so it changes and shifts  and it gives you new commands.  That's part of the thing I don't like about it  is you have to look at it.  You have to remember to look at it  and you can't touch type with it  because it's different all the time.  But having said that, there are a few useful things  you can do with it.  And I think in time, I might find it to be  a very nice, useful adjunct.  If Apple's not gonna do a touch screen,  at least they've got the touch bar.  So a full review of the new MacBook Pro.  This is the 15 inch.  This Saturday, I'll do the 13 as well,  this Saturday on the new screensavers.  Lady and gentle man, it has been a pleasure  to reunite with you and see you once again.  As always.  And I think we did a pretty good job today.  I think so.  Yes, no tears were shed, no blood was shed.  No shoes were thrown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't get tweeted 20 times through the show  talking about it, what a dork I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow, we must have done something wrong.  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sometimes that tends to come in the email later  after they think about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Jeff Jarvis will be on the email later this week.  No, Jeff Jarvis is at the CUNY School of Journalism  there at City University New York,  also at BuzzMachine.com.  Author of many great books, Gutenberg,  the geek we mentioned, Public Parts,  What Would Google Do?  And Geeks Bearing Gifts is latest about the news biz.  It's always a really great time with you.  Thank you, Jeff, for being here.  Thank you, boss.  Have you retired the Hillary gear?  Is it gonna be in a case?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I tried wearing the, well, I don't know.  So this arrived the morning after the defeat.  Oh my God.

It's condescending.  But daft was a good word, yes.  And I kind of agreed with it,  and so I just sent money to the ACLU  and Southern Poverty Law Center instead.
