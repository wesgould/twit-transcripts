Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Howdy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And from the bowels of Sony, where it is pitch black.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's the view outside.  I thought I'd show you the view outside the window way up at Sony HQ in New York.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, neat.  Where is Sony HQ in New York?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  55th and Madison.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right there in the business center.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Next to the Nike store.  I bought myself some shoes today.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis is here.  Journalist extraordinaire, a professor of journalism at the City University of New York,  the blogger at buzzmachine.com, and the author of What Would Google Do?  Working on his new book, Public Parts.  Good to have you both.  The big story of Google news.  One of the big stories.  I don't even know.  There isn't one big story.  I guess China is a big story.  Did Google blink, Jeff Jarvis?  What happened?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, it's a game of criminology.  Wrong country in terms of China objecting to Google, just redirecting.  So Google then brought back the Google.cn page, but then put a link on it to Google  Hong Kong.  What it all means, I don't know.  I think they're trying to find some middle ground there.  If they pull out is the worst thing, no.  If they stay is the worst thing, no.  Not much to say, I think, at this point.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I gather that the deal was that their internet content provider license is up for renewal  soon.  Right.  Sorry.  Yes.  So they need tomorrow.  So I would imagine that there are some behind the scenes negotiations going on.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There's games going on.  Exactly.  There's games going on on both sides.  So Google just said that certain web searches are blocked in China.  This is fairly new here.  So there are disruptions to China.  So they're playing games with each other.  I'm not sure what the win-win is here for anybody.  I think that they both just need to find some face saving.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But I'll add to that.  The last thing Google should do is once again do the tyrant spitting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, the interesting thing is I think even within Google, there is differences among  Eric Schmidt, for instance, and Larry Page.  Larry says, we don't want to do this.  We don't want to be in Google.  Larry says, this is a billion person market.  So there's some compromises not just between China and Google, but within Google itself  that have to happen.  It sounds like what...  So Google stopped redirecting.  That was a problem.  China had a big problem with redirecting Google.CN to Google.HK.  So they stopped doing that.  Are you saying that they're not censoring results at Google.CN or that they are?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Google is not.  Google stopped that.  Google's policy was we don't do the bidding of the government.  If you want to censor us, if you want to stop us and block us, well, we can't stop that.  But Google's mistake in China was that they did the bidding of the government in censoring  results.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In the first place.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.  So they're not doing that.  They're not basically running Google China.  They are still pushing you to Google.HK where they don't censor.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So they did put a link on Google.CN that leads to uncensored results.  So that implies that Google.CN is censored, but there is a link to uncensored results.  Is that...  Am I misunderstanding that?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm not.  I'm just saying that the search service in mainland China was partially blocked Wednesday.  This is according to the Wall Street Journal.  Less than a month after it was announced this.  It affects queries from mainland China of users of Google suggest.  Why that?  No one knows.  What is Google suggest?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't even know what that is.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I start typing Falun and it says Gong.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay.  So you have to know you're looking for Falun Gong to find it.  Gmail, news and images, fully or mostly accessible?  I don't know.  See mostly worries me.  That's a little fudge word that worries me.  Like images mostly accessible unless it's a picture of the guy in front of the tank  at Tiananmen Square.  Or what?  Or is it nude women?  What is it exactly that China doesn't want us to see?  What they're people to see?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That alone would be news we want to know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So there's some sort of, I would presume there's some sort of negotiation right now going on.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So there's not much to say right now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  It's interesting though.  Google kind of blinked.  Google sent a strong message that they want to stay in China somehow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Assuming they don't want to compromise themselves too much, maybe just a little bit pregnant.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, you get back to that argument.  I was having this argument with Siva in Twitter, Siva Vatnavian.  I'm not exactly sure what it is he wants Google to do.  He wants to complain about them, but a little unfair of me.  But he's, you know, when I say that they shouldn't censor, he says, well, they shouldn't pull  away from a billion Chinese.  That's the argument they're going to have now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I dislike that kind of, you know, working within the system gray argument.  Just bothers me a little bit.  It does me too.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  They've got to have principles and stand on them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The other big Google story, and it's really just a gossipy rumor started by my friend  Kevin Rose.  In fact, he repeated it on Twitter on Sunday.  He tweeted on Saturday.  He says he was a little inebriated when he tweeted it, but he said he had good authority.  Not Kevin.  Oh, I meant that was another tweet.  He was drunk.  I can't remember anyway.  Sorry, Kevin.  He was completely sober when he tweeted Google was going to start a Facebook clone called  Google me.  And then we've heard some confirming details.  In fact, from a Facebook former Facebook CTO on his service Quora, he says, yeah, that  makes sense.  I've heard about it.  He says Google's putting their every effort behind it.  Now Kevin told me that he was he had to take his tweet down.  So he did pull his tweet.  That tells me he was right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You don't have to take down something that's wrong.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Who would make it out?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's a good question.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Speaking of censorship, for God's sake.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, you know, Kevin is besides Kevin's in an interesting position because he's an  entrepreneur.  He works with all these companies very closely.  You know, he's the guy behind dig.com there.  You know, he's both a journalist and a and a CEO.  So he has interesting walk.  He has to line. He has to walk.  See me. I never take anything down unless unless it's libel and they're going to sue  me or something.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But I don't think there's anything like it sounds like his source asked him to take it  down. I mean, that's what it sounds like.  Yeah. Yeah. The tweet is definitely gone.  I mean, this makes a lot of sense, right?  I mean, this doesn't surprise me.  I'm a little concerned that they're like, we're going to build a Facebook clone, that  they're going to model this after Facebook.  I mean, let's let's try a little innovation.  Let's try something new.  Also, I mean, I don't know.  Google hasn't been very successful in the social space so far.  And I just feel like, I don't know, Facebook has so much traction.  It would be interesting to see how they try and incentivize people to move from  Facebook, you know, people beyond the people who are concerned about privacy and feel  more comfortable with the Google brand than the Facebook brand.  You know, people beyond beyond us.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think you're right, you know, they've got to find an entirely new opportunity here.  And it goes back to what you guys brainstormed on a few shows ago.  I think it comes to identity.  And there's new services that Google could provide that are uniquely Googley, but  creating a Facebook clone is the path to disaster.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do you build it around profiles, Google profiles?  That's what the kind of your idea.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think I would.  At the same time, you know, you have the White House now coming out proposing an official  identity, a kind of an Internet identity card that verified.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Isn't that an interesting position?  Well, what do you think of that?  Is that scary or is that good?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm getting the heebie jeebies.  I can't necessarily say completely why.  I don't want to sound like I'm wearing the tin hat now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, well, identity cards are traditionally a bad, scary thing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The argument here is that you need a verified identity to do so much stuff.  And if you can have this verified identity, you can make transactions and use that  identity across. That's fine.  I'm not sure governments the agency to do it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I don't know if the independent corporate is the this is kind of the  conversation we had last week, which I'm sorry you weren't here for with Chris  Messina. Or were you here? You were here with Chris.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, no.  Jeff was on Chris.  Oh, yes, I was on Chris.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, when we talked about this whole OAuth notion and.  Yeah, right. OAuth thing, yes.  And then the idea of providing independent third party  and a choice of third party, a verification of identity,  that does seem safer somehow than having the government.  What you don't want is somebody coming down the train saying papers, please.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, for real.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Especially in Arizona. Yeah.  You are born in America, are you?  Let's see your papers.  Now, Google yesterday said something that kind of does  lead me lead me to think there's something going on.  Google added links or is going to add links in Google Buzz  to its social search service.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Interesting. So this is going to knit together Buzz profiles

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  and social search. Yeah, sounds like I mean, they seem buzzed  popping up in new ways to G and I think you do you see some improvement there?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I yeah, I've actually been kind of getting into buzz a little more.  And I am seeing I am seeing some improvement.  I definitely see the value in the threaded conversations and it being  totally public. Right.  So Twitter doesn't really have threaded conversations.  Friend feed never kind of really took off.  Facebook is, you know, still feels very kind of closed.  So I do see some value in buzz.  And I have been actually starting to use it a little bit for for Google specific  posts. Actually, I've started I've stopped using it as just a broadcast,  my tweets and start using it more as a conversational tool.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The conversation has been improving in quality, in your view.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  There, you know, in the beginning, it seemed like I got a lot more comments.  And things have seemed to tapered off a little bit.  But the people who are who are still on are kind of diehards and really  and really love it. So the conversations are pretty are pretty good, actually.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I love it. I you know, but I loved friend feed.  I love Jaiku. I'm a loser.  I am not I am not in any way a barometer of success in social media.  But to me, I like threaded conversations.  And I think the quality of the content on buzz, I mean, it's always variable  because it's a variable audience. But, you know, we now post we  I used to post on friend feed every time we started a show.  I stopped doing that. I now post on buzz and buzz tweets it automatically for me  when we start a show.  And I think the conversations that ensue are often very good.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, buzz does that now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, buzz doesn't. I use a service called Buzzcan tweet.  That's very fast. It uses I think it uses, you know, something like PubSub  HubBub to do it in real time.  It seems, you know, Twitter's always, you know,  it's always a question whether Twitter is going to respond or not.  But I think that Twitter is pretty fast now picking up these these tweets.  Let's see. Yeah, it's already on Twitter. I just did it a minute ago.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There was a story I put up on the feed that was about  what do you call it, Foursquare.  But just arguing that you see the progression, somebody comes up  with something new like Twitter, and then you see the clones.  And the next thing you see is the aggregators.  Yeah, it's true. Right.  It's absolutely true. And so, you know, post once, post everywhere.  I want that for Buzz and Twitter and Facebook in a way that I can control better.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You do. But at the same time, what you don't want is for people to dump  content on Buzz, because then there's no conversation.  And that's what's different about Buzz and Twitter.  You can dump content on Twitter.  Most people, I would say.  I would say almost everybody does on Twitter, because Twitter is not so much  about conversation, but Buzz is all about conversation.  So the culture at Buzz says, if you dump your tweets here,  we're not going to follow you.  And I think that that's something that's pretty important, that  that service have its own culture.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Definitely. That's why I actually I stopped broadcasting my tweets  because I had a lot of people saying, like, hey, if you're not going to use  Buzz for what it is, then don't broadcast your tweets.  But then the great experience I had on Buzz is that a lot of Googlers  pay attention to Buzz. Right.  And I mean, because of the show, you know, that's kind of great.  Like I ran into a bug with Google groups last week where I was hitting this  infinite redirect loop and I posted on Buzz like, hey, is this happening  to anyone else? And I had three Googlers, you know, like Rick Clow,  Mick, Matt Cutts, you know, we're like, hey, we're going to, you know,  we'll check this out for you. Yes, it's confirmed.  Yes, you know, it'll be fixed.  Isn't that great?  It's kind of fantastic.  I know not everyone has that kind of same.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Don't everybody use Buzz.  We want it for ourselves.  It's our channel to Google.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's the Google equivalent of an email to Steve Jobs.  Exactly. Exactly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Buzz is our tool. Stay away.  Don't use Buzz.  Well, it's funny, I was at food camp last weekend and I saw Matt.  It's always and I feel like I kind of got to know him and Bradley Horowitz,  who I never met, but because he's a buzzer, he's active buzzer.  It was great. I felt like we knew each other, you know,  far more people, unfortunately, far more people on Twitter.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I'm asking about the reverse is I would find it useful to make Buzz  my main home and then that's what I do.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what I do, because I don't want to like that.  Yeah, I don't want it.  Well, Buzz can tweet really works. It works very well.  I would like to live somewhere and have  and somewhere where I could easily have threaded conversations. Right.  But I also want to make sure that I don't I mean, I have two  hundred thousand followers on Buzz. I don't I mean, on Twitter,  I don't want to leave them in the dust either.  And I think the Twitter culture doesn't mind that so much.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think we put there, but I also find out Facebook.  I think I'm getting penalized on Facebook for not doing stuff natively there.  And my my response on Facebook has gone to no.  I'm also stuck in a.  So is mine, by the way.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Shocking.  I have no page.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, isn't getting an uptake in activity.  Is there a fake Leo?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know what? I would join a Google me pretty quickly,  providing they didn't make the same privacy mistakes that  that Facebook has made.  And I don't anticipate that they would.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What would it be, though?  I mean, what's what it would take for people to to.  That's why I just I got Regina.  I don't see any sense of recreating Facebook  because the switching cost is just too high. Right.  Is it?  500 million people.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But how many do you need to make it work? Big bus.  It's funny.  It's funny because Google is in the position that Microsoft is in, kind of.  So Microsoft position Microsoft's in with Google.  So Microsoft really beefs up being spends a lot of energy.  I met she Lou, by the way, one of the scientists over there  who had moved from Yahoo.  It was a fan, by the way.  H.E. He listens.  Yeah. You know, it's kind of neat how many smart people actually listen to the show.  I can only think it's because of you and Gina, Jeff,  because of me.  That's a lot of pressure.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Suddenly feeling very pressured to say something profound.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Actually, it's you, Gina. It's all you.  They're just listening to you.  Yeah, it's all Gina.  So being doesn't need to beat Google.  It just needs 5%, 10% to be highly profitable.  A Google meet doesn't have to beat Facebook, does it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, but is that truly because because if if if your friends aren't there,  then it's kind of worthless.  It's like the phone book.  Book that has only 5% of city isn't very useful.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You see interesting.  So it's not merely the network effect, because if all my friends are there,  then I'm happy.  But you're saying it needs to be a phone book.  It needs to have everybody to work.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right, because it's about connections that come across.  Oh, so and so is now our friend with so and so.  And they said this about that.  That's where the value is.  Right. Interesting.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The thing is, Google has so much data about our contacts and our relationships  and our activity online to begin with.  So I feel like getting, you know, getting those users and getting those connections  pretty quickly won't be that difficult.  I mean, all they need is a hook in a Gmail.  You know, profiles knows, you know, all the places where you publish online,  if you've added links, if they could make Google me into something that's like,  you know, not a new site that you have to register for and set up a profile,  like just just something that you opt in.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, Gina's frozen.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That never happens to it.  I mean, you know, I mean, the whole the name, I think is brilliant.  Right. I mean, I say this to people all the time.  People ask for my business card.  I'm just like, hey, just just Google me.  Like, you'll find me. Right.  Because I'm because that's where I am. Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So maybe it is profiles, Gina.  Yeah. I mean, I thought of that.  Maybe that's all it is. They're already there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And what you suggested.  And we've been trying to tell everybody, start using.  I tell everybody, set up a Google profile.  You will be glad.  So now is the now the maybe the that would make sense.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah. If we became infrastructure, top Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, everything.  That makes a lot of sense.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because I could do if but I mean, come on, how many people use Google profiles?  Tiny, tiny swatch of people.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But it goes back, Leo, your suggestion there was if suddenly your profile  ended up as your canonical page at the top of search about you,  then you're going to use it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're motivated to use Google could flip a switch and make that happen.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That stands in their power to do.  And everybody Google's themselves. Come on.  Everyone Google's that's why.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's why, by the way, the name Google me is brilliant.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's brilliant. It's great. I love it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I didn't hear it that way until just now, the way you used it in a sentence, Gina.  Yeah. Google me. Yeah, I get it. Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's just brilliant.  So OK, so they have a shot is what you're saying.  As being what really and it's funny because Facebook  had to change its model to make this work.  Facebook was private.  And they realized that really the value in Facebook is by  is being the Internet phone book.  And and and so Google's already in this position where they can do that,  because they've always been kind of that way.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If you put your complimentary is, yeah, Facebook allows you to create your public.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, maybe Facebook goes back to its original model.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think they have to.  I think I think that Facebook is in conflict with the idea of publishing  to the world. That's what gets them in trouble, because I'm speaking to this  public that I created, the society I created and I control.  And if I'm now publishing to the world, don't know what I'm doing,  which that's where I got in trouble.  I think Facebook has to go back to that idea of creating a public.  And Google is about the whole world.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I started we got new business cards printed,  and I for a long time, I've been using Google profiles as my email signature.  And I thought, what am I doing?  I'll just have Twit dot TV slash Leo go to my Google profile.  And that's on my cards. That's it.  You know, and in a way, that's even better than Google me.  It's you know, don't if you Google Leo Laporte, you're going to find me.  But if you if you go to my profile, you're going to find everything.  You're going to find exactly what I say my universe it consists of.  We just the only way this succeeds, though,  is if mom and pop and in middle America and everybody say, OK, yeah.  You know where I felt this?  And I really miss Facebook in one area.  I just got all my childhood pictures digitized, all the slides.  We have something like 20 carousels of slides.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, I want to see that. Wow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I mean, a thousand pictures.  And I wanted to put a little wheel with a wheel.  And where would you want to put those when you get those?  Where's the first place you want to put them? Facebook.  Yeah, there's no one else that I could exactly.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I got Jake's graduation picture.  Oh, yes. Good question.  So Jake has his graduation picture up.  Is it OK for me to share that?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, if you ask Jake, I got to ask him.  I would just do it anyway,  which is why my children hate me.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I made you, therefore I shall.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I own your image.  You want to go to college?  Well, by the way, Jeff, that does not work.  I know it does.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Poor Jake's in pain today. He had four wisdom teeth.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I remember doing that right before I went to college.  It's kind of part of it. It's a right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Leo, back to your point.  Go to the way that place pages have come to work is that  for any given restaurant or establishment,  those are starting to rise up in Google search  and on purpose from their end.  And they are useful because they are links to maps  and the original site and reviews elsewhere and all that stuff.  So it's becoming a competence of Google's  to create a canonical page for somebody.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  In fact, I guess I could upload those pictures on Picasa.  Picasa has face recognition.  So it could do tagging, I guess, which is the strength of Google, of Facebook.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It doesn't, you know, do you really want to send them to the whole world  or do you want to share them with your your society?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right. I want to have my OK.  So Facebook has to do this.  Facebook has to go back to that's where they're complimentary.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah. If Google is your presence to the world,  right, Facebook is your tool to create your little world.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're never going back, though.  That's not that's not where the money is. Or is it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It should be because if the more data they get about you,  that's why they should buy, I think, four square.  Because if they have geo data and relationship data  and if they find ways that friends can truly recommend products to each other,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  there is value. So here's what Google does.  Hope we lost you. Let me call her out.  Here's what Google does. Google.  Starts flips a switch so that the Google profile shows up  at the top of the page when you search for my name and my Facebook page side by side.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Exactly. And Google says your option, by the way, your option.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Or whatever private social network I want to use.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right. Yes. Yes. So I.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And your YouTube. Yeah, that should be at the top of the page.  And it's and it says, OK, you want Leo's private stuff or you friend Leo's.  Here's his Facebook page. You want his public stuff.  Are you you know, do you are you a co-worker or a fan or whatever?  Here's his public stuff.  Are you a business partner? Here's LinkedIn.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's a great idea. Yeah, that's what they should do.  That's what they can do.  And as I said, they're already doing it for restaurants and bars.  They can do it for people.  Is there another layer of control they could put on top of that, too, where?  You know, they can't control Gadeen to Flickr,  but they could control Gadeen to Picasso and you could choose to publish to  certain people.  We certainly see that with Google Docs now where you can publish  a document to a group or to the whole world.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So this is really buzz and but this is really recognizing  the truth of it, which is we have stuff we want public, we have stuff we want private.  And it sounds like Eric Schmidt needs to sit down with Mark Zuckerberg and say,  look, dude, just like this, like Spain and Portugal,  let's split the world.  You get the northern hemisphere, we'll get the southern hemisphere.  Interesting. Hello, FTC.  Oh, yeah, you're not.  They're probably not allowed to do that, are they?  That's collusion.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They could. But I think it could defacto head that way.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, look, let's do that for the mark.  Eric, we know you can't talk, but just send a signal.  Tug your ear. Send a signal.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  See, Leo, you said people watch the show.  I think that that was a month ago.  This discussion was there.  I think that maybe this week in Google invented the product line for him.  We did it. It's only give us credit.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I already have a show.  You just dig for was my idea.  Now I'm going to have one that says Google me was my Google is my idea.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, the privacy, the privacy issues and settings are definitely an issue.  The other question for me, which kind of came up because of this  interesting column, technically incorrect, is seen at news is, you know,  can Google's sort of engineering culture create a compelling social experience?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That was great.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Late, Gina. Can the robots do robots make you want to connect with people?  Now, I mean, think about all the cutesy kind of stuff that Facebook started with  poking and it's complicated.  And some of these like cultural, you know, little things about Facebook  that made it kind of fun.  I think Google has a pretty playful spirit.  I mean, they're they're hackers, right?  So they have this kind of playful spirit.  And sometimes they do have great, you know, the Zella button on YouTube.  That was hysterical.  I love that.  Pac-Man logo.  I mean, they do some fun, compelling, playful stuff.  Geeky often, but but but really fun.  But this this piece called Is Google Far Too Much In Love With Engineering  kind of really takes Google at a task for I guess they require every single manager.  Everybody there has an engineering degree, right?  And even just to get an interview.  I applied to work at Google years and years ago and like I couldn't even get an interview  because it was like the fool.  Yeah, boy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, they may be loosening that up because Colleen Kelly,  our VP of engineering who went to Google, has a degree in sociology.  OK, OK. She's got an engineering job.  She's a streaming video engineer.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, that's good. That's good to know, because you really you don't want silo  ons making, you know, the software that you really love to use.  And, you know, there are those stories about testing 43 colors,  you know, shades of blue to see which, you know, made the most traffic.  I really like that idea.  That's that idea of like relying on data is very attractive to me.  But you can't engineer everything.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So you have to have some heart to if you think about it,  I think you're right about the serendipity and right about all that.  But if if you're in this closed world of Facebook, people, you know,  and love and trust, then you can do cute, silly little stuff.  Where again, if Google is about your presence to the whole world,  you probably don't want the cute, silly stuff there. Right.  You're going to do that elsewhere where you're more faith and trust.  You want to present something that's presentable.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right. We got to take a break.  We're going to talk more about this.  And there's a lot more news to you're listening to this week in Google  with Jeff Jarvis, Gina Trapani.  I just is when this is the kind of thing I love the best on the show  and we kind of try to suss out the right, you know, the way to go.  And can Google do it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We were doing this. I thought the buzz was going to be a big success.  It was really important to see how well I do.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and wave and buzz and a lot of things.  And I and I guess the question is, it's not us.  It must be them because we're brilliant.  It's got to be Google.  They just don't have what it takes or something.  I don't know. We're going to talk more in just a bit.  You're listening to this week in Google right now, though.  I want to tell you about our friends at Citrix, the folks who do the great  go to meeting, go to assist, go to my PC.  They know how to do remote access right.  And they know how to take your boring business meetings and bring them to life  with go to meeting.  I want you to try it free right now.  If you go to go to meeting dot com slash twig.  You can get 30 days free.  That's 30 days of unlimited meetings at no cost to you.  And that includes, by the way, free voice over internet and telephone  conferencing as well.  You'll have it up and running before I'm done talking.  If you go right now to go to meet, why don't we do a race?  Go to meeting dot com slash twig. Try it.  Eliminate the cost for business travel, save more, do more, travel less.  And by the way, make your meetings so much more engaging.  Once you've got it installed, are you done yet?  You got a few more seconds once you've got it installed.  The next time you want to get a conference call, you're thinking,  oh, I got to get a plane ticket to go to Dallas.  No, that stop. Just go to go to meeting dot com.  Start the meeting. Tell your conferee, hey, go to go to meeting dot com himself.  He doesn't have to have anything installed ahead of time or she doesn't.  30 seconds later, she'll be seeing your screen on her computer  and you can show her the slides, the PowerPoint, the keynote, the spreadsheets.  You can collaborate on documents.  You can you can have us something open and say, OK, what do you think?  She could type, then you could type up to 15 people at the same time.  It really is effective. It's great. I want you to try it free.  Go to meeting dot com slash twig.  We thank Citrix, the folks who do go to meeting for their support of all of our shows,  especially this week in. Google.  By the way, just I don't know if this is true, just came across the Amazon, just bought.  What? Oh, talk about see there.  Well, you're talking about corporate culture where Google's  can't do a poke, but Amazon, who Zappos, these are  these are companies where they kind of have fun.  Yeah, Google needs to have more fun.  It's not that Google engineers don't have fun.  There was a Google engineer at the food camp who brought a Tesla coil  and was toasting marshmallows.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's fantastic.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  How did you can you get?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I started getting closer with my camera phone to take a picture and they would get back.  It's going to kill you because apparently it will jump over to the phone.  If you get too close.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Leo, glad you made it back.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's only 500000 volts.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's that was great.  This week in Google host killed by Google, by Google.  What do you say wrong? It was just an accident.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I actually it was so much fun.  I talked to a lot of people at Google, including people in the communications  department and many engineers and many are fans and listen to the show.  And those who didn't now will.  I can I can promise you I was doing an informal survey of Android and iPhones  because iPhone had just come out a couple of days ago.  There were a lot of iPhone fours, but it looked like Nexus one was the phone of choice.  There were a lot of Nexus one phones at food camp.  These are smart.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, Leo, I know I'm late to this, but I got to ask.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, boy. Of course, I bought an iPhone four.  And you know what? It is beautiful.  It's a really spectacular screen.  I mean, you can't you cannot you cannot imagine how good the screen is.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Is that purple thing your bumper?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, here's the big problem.  That antenna thing they're talking about, it's very real.  If I take this case off, the five bars will go to no bars in 30 seconds.  Absolutely. In fact, I didn't even know you're not holding it.  No, you have to hold it. But yeah.  So good. It's a phone you can use when you don't hold it. Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But that's a way to get past the radiation.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's it's it's yeah. Right.  Just leave it on the desk. It's such a beautiful design.  I hate to put it in a case, but I swear, I mean, it it it it.  I mean, it doesn't take long.  It it dies every time.  So you got five bars in the office right now.  And if I hold it and by the way, this is exactly how you would hold it.  It's how everybody holds it in the Apple commercial.  Yeah, it just shorts it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And my big question to you is, I mean, forget the fact that you're someone  who buys every phone that ever comes out. I have to. Yeah.  But if you were using spare resources like real people,  would you be pissed now about Verizon?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I would be pissed about.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Rumors and reports from from January or the Verizon is getting it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We've been hearing this rumor for ages.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yes, I know. They say they have good sources.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't.  You know, there's a there's one drawback to a Verizon or any CDMA  version of the iPhone. You cannot get data while you're in a call.  I like GSM. I travel as you do. I travel a lot.  I need a GSM phone.  I'm not going to buy a Verizon anything.  In fact, that was why I didn't get a Sprint Evo in the long run.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The Droid X ad in the Times that ran isn't that funny?  You can hold it any way you want and you'll get a crystal clear signal.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Brilliant.  We've got two antennas.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I guess you got to go if you got to you got to advertise whatever you can.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But, you know, first of all, I think the Droid X is a very compelling phone.  I cannot wait to see it.  I think the Nexus one is still equal to the iPhone, although that  this screen is really good.  And you know where you know where the iPhone for really wins, I think, is  it's it's it's got the best camera phone I've used now.  And even it's five megapixels, but it's the color and everything is very, very good.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I saw some videos that were edited on the iPhone and it's pretty.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. Apple has had to do beautiful.  I mean, let's just face it.  They do. It's a beautiful screen.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, it's it's rock solid.  The detail is incredible.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So what's your main phone now, Leo?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I'm going to use it.  You know, the only way I think you can use you can try a phone is by using it.  I mean, I have to say, I wouldn't have noticed how bad this antenna problem  if it was if I hadn't been using it all weekend and been frustrated  by the dropped calls and by the zero, you know, signal.  So I did get a case.  I think it's kind of annoying that you have to spend a thirty dollar premium.  But anybody who buys an iPhone four should remember you get a case with it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Even though the life hacker posted a tip, you can take one of those rubber  bracelets like that Lance Armstrong live strong and wrap it around  the outside of the of the iPhone.  So you have to pay the thirty dollars for the case.  Oh, and that's good looking.  Well, all right.  So it's not the most good looking thing, but it is kind of like the cheap way to.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Scotch tape, just like you said, Scotch tape does it, too.  It's just an you need an insulator on that little.  It's you know what? It's crappy design.  It's stunning to me that Apple got to let this through.  This is not the way you do it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But anyway, setting that aside, people with sweaty hands to use them in bars.  But we know where that went.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, Gray, you should have taken it out of the case  before you left it behind.  On the other hand, you know, I think I probably will go back to the Nexus one.  I'm going to give it a month. I probably will.  But I have to say, having a great five megapixel camera  in your pocket all the time is really nice.  I don't miss the apps so much.  You know, the Android app marketplace.  Well, let's talk a little bit about Android, because the Android app  marketplace is really taking off.  We heard last week at the Droid X announcement that one hundred  sixty thousand this was our number of the week last week, Jeff, when you were here.  One hundred sixty thousand Android installs a day.  Puts him really right up there with the iPhone, I think, even when you know  you said you sell one point seven million iPhones the first three days.  It's still are you going to sell five million in the first month?  Because that's how many Android phones are being sold.  Eighty five thousand apps.  And, you know, now there's a Kindle.  The Kindle app is great. Mint.  Recall, which is my to do list.  There are very few apps now that aren't available on Android.  In fact, Android beats everybody with the audible application.  It's much better than the iPhone implementation.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So Kindle app was a big one this week for me.  Huge was like the one that kind of filled it in.  But there's been some kind of interesting critiques of the of the market recently.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, there's one BS one and there's one good one.  Go ahead. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So DVD John, who's the guy behind Double Twist, who, you know,  by all accounts is absolutely an Android fan.  He he wrote a pretty long piece called Google's mismanagement of the Android  market, talking about how much the Android market really sucks that there are spammy  apps, that it's difficult to purchase apps, that it makes it difficult  for developers to charge for their apps.  And there are a lot of screenshots here that made that made me very sad, Panda.  It was a very, you know, legitimate, I think, critique.  Really, you think so?  I, you know, I thought so.  I did think so. I mean, if you look at some of these screenshots,  you know, of course, he is interested in what the top multimedia apps are.  Right. And he pointed that he said, if you look at the top multimedia apps,  there are 144 spam ringtone apps infringing infringing copyright.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What's the solution? You want Google to kill these?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, you know, I think that his point was just that they should do a little more

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  curation. Google does have a tear.  Wait a minute. But Google does have a tear.  The featured apps. Mm hmm.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So it's in the middle.  I want to be able to have and, you know, again, I don't think Google should be  the curator. I think that we, the people can be the curator.  Well done. But that's where Google should should.  I get what it did for content in the whole world.  It should do for its own damn app store.  There's not enough filters and signals of quality.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not like they haven't solved this problem.  That's a really good point, Jeff. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Matt Cutts, get to work, Matt.  I just I don't want I like I really like and I really  celebrate an open marketplace.  I think that that's very that's the strength of Google.  And and and you know, this is goes back to Virginia Heffernan's article  in The New York Times that if you want a gated suburb,  if you want safety, yeah, you've got the Apple App Store where everything is  polished and beautiful and pretty.  But I know I like the freeform marketplace.  And yeah, it's kind of like downtown.  There's some some some rats behind the garbage cans.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But the opportunity there is if Google put out a better API, then  could someone create a high quality marketplace on top there?  That'd be great.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Maybe that's like an editorial.  Yeah, like a featured featured apps.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, they have. I mean, that's kind of why wouldn't Best Buy do that?  Right. Why wouldn't Best Buy come along and put the investment  in and full disclosure as I've gone there to talk.  But that's the kind of thing they could really add value.  Their brand could say, we're going to find the 10,000 best apps out of the 100,000.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And there's no reason they couldn't.  Right. I mean, that's the beauty of open is that anyone could say, OK,  come to our app store.  You don't have to go to the the Android marketplace.  You can go anywhere.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's that's what I do need that quality layer.  I is it Google's fault?  Well, yeah, because they're the only ones doing it now.  But they could enable others to do it, I think.  And the value in that is if Best Buy did that, just to play with this for a second,  it's a great advertising opportunity.  You know what apps were downloading.  You could add value to it on top by saying, here are your apps.  Here's new apps. Here's new stuff.  Recommend things to you.  I mean, it could be a very high value thing.  Amazon should do it for God's sakes.  They've solved the problem to recommending things to you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Amazon would be great.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So maybe that's what's going to do in this. Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  AppBrain is. Yeah.  In fact, if you just wanted to use stick with AppBrain, I think you'd be safe.  There's not any spam ringtones in AppBrain.  If you go to the recommended or well, hot apps might, but recommended doesn't.  So was that the B.S. criticism, Leo, then?  To me, this feels like B.S., Chris.  And by the way, I have a huge respect for DVD John.  And he's done an immense amount of good for the Android marketplace.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But I guess and he has the web based interface right to the market.  Yeah. With a double twist.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So why doesn't he curate it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a big job.  Why don't you do it, John?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, so.  So I think that the what what it what is the alternative?  The alternative, I think you want open.  And yes, this is the side effect of open.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You want to open with quality layers on top of it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's just like somebody saying, oh, the web, it's full of pornography.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, yeah. So or or book publishing.  There's a lot of really crappy books published. Right.  But libraries and bookstores and, you know, find the best ones.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  So maybe that's look at this is this is early days yet.  I know. I know. You know, we feel like Android's mature.  It's not that old.  It's matured very rapidly.  It's gotten better very quickly.  I mean, how long when when did the G1 came out?  You know, a couple of years ago.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. Two years, two years.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And in two years, they've gone from, you know, really subpar hardware  and a kind of rocky operating system  with just a few thousand apps to fifty eight thousand apps  in a rock solid operating system that in many ways  Apple's playing catch up with in the iPhone four.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah. And the other thing that I really want out of them badly is other devices.  You know, we're waiting for the Dell device,  but I want Cisco just announced it's in the list.  A tablet, an Android tablet for businesses, which is smart.  But I think that Android has to push.  Apple is going to be trapped in its definitions of its devices.  And the advantage of Android is it can work across many devices.  So I want to see more of them.  As part of the other problem is that you must wonder whether Google should invest  in some really good apps and some really good devices.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and that leads us to the conversation about Gingerbread Android 3.0,  which, if you ask me, is the next level  and where we're going to start seeing some pretty amazing hardware.  But we're going to talk about that in a minute  because I want to take a little break and talk about Carbonite Pro.  We've we've been talking about Carbonite for some time.  Carbonite is that great solution for people who need backup.  Everybody does need backup in their home.  Carbonite is the kind of backup you want.  It's automatic, so you don't have to remember to back it up  and secure encrypted.  And it's in the cloud. It's off site.  So if the worst happens, you know, you've got a backup on your hard drive  sitting next to your main computer.  What if there's a fire, a flood?  What if somebody comes and steals it?  Carbonite Pro is the backup you want, especially if you're in a small business.  Do a little thought experiment with me.  Just imagine what would happen  to your small business if you lost your computers in the backups next to them.  Would you be able to get back online?  Would you be able to run your business?  How would you recreate all that data by hand?  If you're not backing up off site, your business is hanging by a thread.  And the best way to do it, Carbonite Pro, it's free right now for 30 days.  There's no reason not to try it.  It's and you may object, well, I can't afford that.  No, no, no, no. Let me tell you, this is the most affordable backup system.  It's actually more affordable using Carbonite Pro  for a number of seats than it is to use Carbonite  to consumer for the same number of seats.  Prices start at $10 a month.  If you go to carbonitepro.com,  you'll see some example scenarios of how affordable it can be.  The beauty of this is there's a central dashboard,  you know, a centralized place where you can see how the backups,  you make sure all the systems are backed up, that everybody's doing their thing.  People can restore for themselves.  I can go on and on, but really, the best thing to do is just try it free for 30 days.  And the prices, I'm telling you, eight computers,  each of them with five gigabytes of data, that's $25 a month  for the whole office.  18 computers, five gigabytes, 50 bucks a month.  You're not going to find a more affordable, more effective solution.  Carbonite Pro for Windows right now, Mac's coming soon.  Carbonitepro.com, try it free right now.  I beg of you.  I beg of you.  Carbonitepro.  Not for me, for you.  .com.  I just added Google.me.  You know who's going to be the big loser on Google.me?  It's the Croatian Google.  Oh, Google.me is Croatia.  Oh, what is me?  Is me a Croatian?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know what Google.me.com is not resolving for me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it's Google.me.  That's what it should be, right?  Yeah. Yeah, they just take it away from Croatia.  Let's take it away from them.  So let's talk about Gingerbread.  We're right now starting at 2.2 on the Nexus One.  I haven't gotten it yet.  Gina, did you get it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I haven't gotten it yet, but they're saying they said end of the week.  By the end of the week, we should get the update.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is FRF 58.  Is that the number 78?  So we have so when I got my new Nexus One,  you know, I got the replacement Nexus One.  I put FRF 50 on it, which is the one.  By the way, I found out what these numbers mean.  It's the number of the days in the quarter that it came out.  Really? Yeah.  So you can tell exactly when it came out based on the number.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. I've got FRF 50.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  50 is like the first one, and it's buggy.  It's got a lot of little bugs in it.  Not that I've noticed, but I've been told.  And so I think it's what's the next?  What's the one that they're pushing 78 FRF 78, something like that.  85. So it's practically the end of the quarter, right?  April, May, June.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That makes sense. The system is currently up to date.  I hate that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I hate that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And you keep tapping, maybe hoping it's not going to.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's how geeky I am.  They should they should set that in.  So if you tap on it, it puts you in queue.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They need to put like, I don't know, fortunes or something there.  Just something to make you happy, a game or something, Tetris,  something to like make you happy because it's so depressing.  It's a big black screen.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. So now, you know, you can download the zip file.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, but then I'm afraid I'm not going to get automatic updates after that.  It's not a jailbreak, but it's a.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Ah, I asked the Google engineers about that.  They said, no, we look at the version number.  So if you have FRF 50, which you and I do, Gina, it will update to 85.  It'll say, oh, no, you don't have the latest.  And if you put 85 now on, you'll get 86 or whatever the next one is.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Now, it's now good to know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know who I met? I met Sorik, by the way, he was there, the guy who does Sidiya.  Very smart guy.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And it's Sidiya, you said, not Sidiya.  I've been saying Sidiya this whole time.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I asked him, he said, no, no, in Latin, it's the penultimate  syllable that gets the emphasis.  I wasn't going to argue with a guy named Sorik.  You know what he showed, Gina, you would have flipped your lid.  He showed.  Sorik is a iPhone hacker extraordinaire, and he showed how you could inject code  into a running, un-jailbroken,  well, it must have been jailbroken iPhone.  You can inject code into the running app and it will execute it  because of the I guess it's because the object oriented nature of the framework.  It's because it's late binding, right?  So so because of the late binding, you can just do some great  JavaScript code and inject it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Really? So so he had the phone.  Did he demo this? Did he have connected to a machine that? Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So he for instance, you hold the icons down and normally goes  jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, jiggle. This is on iPhone only.  I'm talking about Android jiggle, jiggle, jiggle.  Instead, he made it go transparent.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, huh, huh.  That is cool. Yeah.  That is really cool, but also kind of frightening. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because it doesn't have to be just jiggle, jiggle, jiggle.  It could be something else.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, but you have to be wired to a machine in order for that.  I mean, can this happen over the air?  I don't know. Could a malicious hacker do this over the air or was this?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's what's scary. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't ask him. I didn't want to know.  Or malicious.  Oh, I didn't have enough time with Sork.  I would have had a lot more.  I would have had a lot to ask him, but I did find out at Sedia.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Sedia, that's that was worth it.  It was worth it for that.  Finding that out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, as I pointed out to him,  really, I mean, there aren't many people in a position  to actually say how things are pronounced.  Almost all of us get all this by reading.  Yeah. How would you know how it's pronounced?  And we have this enviable privilege of deciding how words are pronounced  that are for the first time ever being said out loud.  Um.  Emmy, by the way, dot Emmy is Montenegro, I have been told.  Oh, OK. So gingerbread 3.0.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Gingerbread is going to require some hefty hardware, it seems.  Yeah. Strict set of hardware requirements.  So we're looking at we're looking at beefier handsets and not looking back.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  One point, oh gigahertz, five, 12 megs RAM.  By the way, the Nexus one is all of this, right?  Minimum display size of three.  I don't know, is it three point five inches? I guess it is.  So it's the Nexus one, but it isn't the G one or the touch.  Some of these older devices won't work.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Android.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That is going to be a problem for them going forward.  Yeah. But I guess the Apple same way Apple, you know, the the.  The original.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Four, right. Doesn't run on the older iPhones.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. So and you and you need to do this.  I'm thinking for tablets.  I think this is this is where you start paying attention.  For tablets. Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But most importantly, they're updating the UI. Right.  So there's been reports that they they want to disincentivize carriers  from having to create this custom UIs like the sense UI.  They want the native Android UI to be fantastic.  And I'm really happy about that.  Yeah, because I think that Android could be a lot prettier.  I wish it was a lot prettier, actually.  And I guess I was thinking about that stage.  Go ahead.  I think that they're saying you're going to see more like the gallery UI  that you see in two point two right now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. What does that mean? They said that.  But OK, so the gallery is where you have these folders come up  and it's 3D and it twirly and.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. You have like the stacks of photos, right?  You can kind of spread out.  And then when you move the phone, it kind of I don't know.  I don't know how that's going to apply to the rest of the phone.  It'll be it'll be interesting to see.  But it is kind of a neat, neat UI.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah. The problem, I think, with the UI  that Apple solved with one button is is with four buttons, the buttons.  Now you end up with an exponential growth  because a given button can do 10 different things given on the circumstances.  And I have to think.  When I when I hit the little  you know, I'm in an application and I hit the little whatever you call it,  the four lines button.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, the menu button.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Thank you, Doug.  You know, at some point in Gmail, it refers to that.  Obviously, and logically, I get this,  but I just want to be able to hit a button and know what's going to happen.  And to get back to setting sometimes takes three different steps.  And I've got to go back in the application  to get to a place where the button changes its functionality.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, worse, that's the handset manufacturers haven't decided  what order the buttons are in.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. And you get a new phone and yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. And you get you get so used to it being a certain way on the Nexus one  and then use an Evo and it's flipped.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And this is the advantage, right?  The iPhone having one button, right?  Well, always does.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, when you only have one company making everything,  it can all look the same.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  I watched this on like best Android practices video  that one of the developers put out from Google I.O. actually.  And kind of one of the one of the things they asked developers to do  is to not make buttons do do something that it shouldn't do.  You know, the back button shouldn't go forward.  You know, the search button should launch a search box.  And like these things, these things seem really obvious,  but they're not enforced by the software.  Like the app developer can do whatever he or she wants.  So it gets, you know, this is the cause.  Like this is the cost that you get with extra choices.  Freedom and choices means, you know, that you can make bad choices maybe for the user.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is it really binary?  Is it really open versus closed?  Freedom versus restricted?  Or is there more of a middle road?  I mean, do we have to have a situation where it's either Apple's way  or the highway or whatever you want?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So are you really asking if Steve were just a little bit less controlling?  Would it be a happier world?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He used to be. I mean, really, let's think about it.  The Macintosh really was a very open platform.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's you know, it's what I think is the Ariana Huffington.  I mean, I'm sorry, the Martha Stewart phenomenon.  You know, I've been in jail. Screw you.  I'm not going to listen to you. I've almost died.  Screw you. You know, he has a strong vision.  It's a brilliant vision.  We love it. He knows that.  He's trying to get things done.  But I think he has got I think it changed his personality and affected his company.  I'm glad he's here. I'm delighted he's here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  When you're an auteur, when you're an artist, which I think we have to grant, Steve.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You probably should just follow your muse and not listen to anybody.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But you also have a relationship with people that matters.  And if you kind of don't respect them and respect your marketplace  sufficiently to be able to do smart things on your own,  that I think at some point gets you in trouble.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's certainly a question every artist asks his or herself.  I mean, him or herself.  You have to ask how much do I pay attention to my customers, my audience, to my patron?  It's very different. Commerce. I mean, commerce.  It's about selling products. And certainly, Steve knows that.  But he gets reinforced. Look, they sold 1.7 million iPhones.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. He can say, everybody complains.  And I get that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And you don't like it?  As my as my friend Chris Tabona at Google tweeted,  Apple's gone from think different to hold it different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't like it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Too bad. Go buy an Android phone, at least.  You know, and this is the good news.  There is a choice.  We are really in a situation where there isn't a choice.  We have a choice.  We have many choices.  And the good news is it was Apple iPhone from 2007 to 2008 or nine.  It was iPhone or nothing.  Now there's some there's great choices out there, by the way.  And I don't know if this is true.  This is coming from Gizmodo today.  And it's a huge story if it is true.  According to Gizmodo, Microsoft has killed its kin phone.  Six, six weeks.  What?  After two years and millions of dollars of development.  According to Gizmodo, now Gizmodo, for all its faults,  what doesn't normally run with a story like this if it's wrong, wrong, wrong?  Only 500 kins were sold.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Jesus.  Did you say 500?  Yeah, that's what it says.  I sold more copies of my book.  Is that possible?  I don't think that that's possible.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think you're in an environment now.  Well, a couple of things.  First of all, it looked like a smartphone, but you couldn't buy apps.  There were no apps.  There was no app store.  It was the way it was or nothing.  Problem one.  Oh, Microsoft.  Problem two, it was aimed at a younger audience,  but it still had that $100 a month smartphone tag.  And the people who could afford a kin, which was fairly affordable.  In fact, they cut the prices a lot.  I don't know if you noticed, which was one reason I believe this story.  Prices were plummeting.  But the people who would buy this phone couldn't afford $100 a month for a smartphone.  And really, more importantly, all the attention is going to the iPhone.  And you got to say, this is the success of Android to the incredible, the Nexus One,  the EVO, the Droid X, the Droid 2, this new Samsung Galaxy S line,  which looks very strong.  I mean, these are great phones.  And if somebody's in the market for a smartphone,  are they going to buy something that you can't add apps to?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  My favorite part about this Gizmodo story is that the ad that is running on the page  is for the kin.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh my god, you're right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  A new Windows phone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So many.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Wow.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You're never going to accuse Gizmodo or any of the golker sites for cow-towing,  of cow-towing type advertisers.  Look at that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This story crossed literally 10 minutes ago.  I have no confirmation.  I have no idea if it's real.  By the time you hear this, it'll either be obviously true or will look like idiots.  So I just want to be clear that that's the only source right now is Gizmodo.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They had a really good ad campaign.  I really like the kin's commercials, which I only saw in the movie theaters before the movie.  But it's like that young girl takes out her phone and says,  I'm going to find out how many of my friends are really my friends.  It was all about social.  And tries to meet her social network.  It was a little depressing because the people who were her friends on social networks  were sort of like, I don't know if I know you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Loser.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and they got in trouble, remember, because there was at one point a guy takes the kin,  sticks it up under his shirt, takes a picture and then texts it to a girl.  And they actually had to cut that part out because it was, I don't know, an up shirt.  I don't know what that is.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They want to see on information week on the 29th of this month that Verizon cut the price  of the kin considerably.  Substantially, yeah.  At the lower end from $49.99 to $29.99.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What they couldn't cut is that expensive smartphone monthly bill.  And I think that if it is indeed dead, and if it is, by the way, a shocker,  remember now Microsoft still has Windows Phone 7 coming up in November.  But still, wow.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Leo, are you going to buy a Microsoft phone?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I might run out and get a kin.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Last chance.  Museum value.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Fresh in the box.  Never touched.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Computer history museum.  Yeah.  For about 20 years from now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Look, I got an original iPhone.  I got an original iPod.  I've got an OLPC.  They got to put something else in there.  That's good.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Fastest smartphone death in the West.  I mean, six weeks.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's awful.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  To go back to the control question that we talked about a little bit before,  you guys saw the story.  It's on the front feed about the remote kill switch.  Yeah, this is another big story.  Yeah, remote kill and install switch on Android.  So this is new to me.  A new information to me.  I'm still kind of a newbie Android developer.  But if you look at the running processes on your Android phone,  you can see this process, the service called Gtalk service.  So I stupidly assume that that was associated with Google Talk,  like the chat app.  It's not.  It's not.  It's a heartbeat.  So when you're connected to the network on your Android phone,  the Gtalk service is constantly kind of sending out this ping,  hey, I'm here, I'm online, hey, I'm here.  And when you install an app from the Android market,  you're not just downloading the APK directly.  You're saying to the market, I want this app.  And then this Gtalk service gets pushed a message,  which is install this app.  So actually, Google is pushing down apps to you.  So they can install apps on your phone.  And they can also delete apps remotely  that you have installed on your phone, which they've  deemed to be malicious.  So they've never exercised the remote kill functionality  until this past week.  A guy, John Oberhide, I hope I'm pronouncing his name right,  he created an app called Rootstrap.  And he put the Twilight Eclipse movie imagery on it.  And it really had nothing to do with the movie.  And actually, it was an innocent app.  But it got access to your phone and could do malicious things.  And this is just kind of a proof of concept thing.  And the Android team exercised the remote kill switch.  They deleted the app from the market.  And they uninstalled it from all the phones that it had installed.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think he removed the app from the market.  He was asked to and did it himself.  But he says later that day, he noticed a couple  of notifications on his phone.  Twilight Eclipse preview removed from your phone.  Rootstrap removed from your phone.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, so Android pulled the trigger.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I got to say, Apple has acknowledged  that they have kill as well.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, the Kindle has it, we found out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  You have to in something that's attached to a network,  like a telephone network.  Because if a malicious app gets out there,  you need to have a way to protect the network, right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I think, Gina, you're right.  Discovering it this way is not a good thing.  Being open about it and say, hey, guys, behave,  or we can kill an app would be more transparent.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Probably knowing Google's engineering background,  they said, well, it's in the API.  If you had just checked, everyone  knows that the remove asset intent is for removing assets.  What did you think it was for?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Please.  Yeah, I mean, I don't have a problem with this.  I don't have a problem with this at all.  I mean, you know, I get this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You got to do it.  And I think that, I know people who do have a problem,  but this is the reverse side of DVD John's article.  Well, maybe you let everything, you have it completely open.  You can check that box that says,  install apps from third parties.  I'll put anything on my phone I want.  But at some point, I'm sure the carriers are going to insist  there's got to be some way to reach into that phone  and stop something that's damaging to the network.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I want it.  If I screw up and put something in the back of my phone  and they rescue me from it, that's fine.  If they use it for bad purposes, that's no good.  But that's the same as all things in life.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  That is.  That's the same as all things in life.  Thank you.  All things must die.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, that kind of says it all now.  What else do you have to say?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it is good for us to know.  I love the technical explanation that you gave, Gina.  It's good to know that this cheat talk is not cheat talk.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's not cheat talk.  Well, I mean, the interesting part that the John Oh point  that he made was that they can remotely install  things on your phone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's kind of weird.  What would they do?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Which is weird and interesting.  Like your OS.  Like an OS update or an app.  I don't know.  It would be interesting to see.  I don't know of any case when they have  exercised the remote install.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, because there's a install asset intent as well as  a remove asset intent.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And that actually is invoked every time  you install from the market.  You're not just downloading from the market.  It's actually pushing that message down.  But they could do it.  I think that's kind of elegant, actually.  It is kind of nice.  I don't think so.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, the good news is John.  I wish while we were on the show.  Go ahead.  John is saying he's taking a careful look  at these code paths.  It's open source.  You got to love that.  You look through it.  It's all published.  So you can look and see what it's doing.  Love that.  Go ahead, Jeff.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I was just going to say, it wouldn't be cool  while we were all in the show.  Hint, hint.  Google downloaded Froyo to all of our phones.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Use your install asset intent, Google.  Right now.  Please.  We're spending.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it one of the specific?  You sit for good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I think it's my memory that they will give you  a notification and says there's a new update  you want to install.  I know.  I keep looking.  It has to reboot your system.  It's a pretty.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's like the girl who doesn't call.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He keeps checking his phone looking for a message.  Let's see.  The Droid X coming soon.  There's some really nice Android phones coming.  I have to say, as nice as the iPhone is,  I think in many ways it's playing catch up.  And I think.  Really?  Yeah.  Folders, multitasking, both kind of mediocre implementations  of something that's existed on Android for a while.  The screen is beautiful.  It's the highest res screen I've ever used.  I did love the Nexus One AMOLED screens.  We're going to see a really nice one in the Galaxy S  from Samsung.  They make AMOLED screens.  I think it's just a matter of time.  This is an LG screen.  It's not an Apple screen.  It's just a matter of time before we see high res screens  like this on Android.  Gigahertz processor, catch up.  512 megs of RAM, catch up.  FaceTime is in the EVO.  You can do this.  Here's where Google could just kill Apple instantly  in the FaceTime realm.  Right now, you have to have an iPhone 4 to FaceTime.  And you have to do over Wi-Fi.  Google could put a hook in Google Talk.  Because they've already got video, right?  Yeah.  Anybody who has Google Talk can FaceTime,  or whatever they'll call it, video chat with anybody  with an EVO or any other Android phone  that has video chat built in.  Be easy.  And you could even, and by the way,  you can use the EVO to video chat over 3G.  You don't have to have Wi-Fi.  The problem is that somebody else,  there's so little software support right now.  Love the vuvuzela button on YouTube.  It's not on all videos, though, is it?  It's just on the, and it's not just soccer videos.  It's just kind of random.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just sort of random.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Google has said an interesting thing, actually,  about HTML5 and Flash.  YouTube has announced that it's going to continue to use Flash  for the foreseeable future.  So despite Google's commitment to Flash,  according to the register, not my favorite source in the world,  but Cade Met's writing in the register,  Google has confirmed that Adobe Flash will continue to, quote,  play a critical role, end quote, on YouTube,  saying HTML5 video does not meet the site's needs.  This is a Tuesday blog post from John Harding, who's  a YouTube software engineer on the YouTube API blog.  You'll forgive me for not having read this ahead of time.  I missed, I try to read the YouTube API blog  as often as possible.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, and kind of another show of support.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Everything you need to know in life is in there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it's all here.  If you would just read it, you wouldn't be surprised.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The new version of Chrome.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  OK, I'll give you, Jeff, you win that race condition.  Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead, Jeff.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Speaking of YouTube, I think they're  doing something brilliant where they came up  with a new ad model, which is that just like AdSense,  they'll do pre-roll ads, and only if it's watched  does the advertiser pay.  And so Google's head of advertising for YouTube  basically lectured advertisers and said,  now it all comes down to you.  Make stuff people want to watch.  Don't just make a message.  It's not going to work.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  See, as a content creator, I have mixed feelings about this.  I hate that idea.  I don't want to get paid, regardless  of whether somebody watched it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, the problem is that it's out of your hands.  You can make a great show, but the advertiser  makes a crappy ad.  Exactly.  And you don't get paid.  So maybe that goes to a point where you start  making the commercials for them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, we're actually looking at doing that,  because most of the people who advertise it don't have assets,  video assets.  So that's exactly what it is.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm sure the strength of your advertising  on this show, which of course leads to,  you've got more to read, I know, is that you do read them.  And I'm sure there's very high recall of who  your advertisers are on Twitch shows versus just something  to play.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Interstitial ads, those ads are just thrown at you.  Really don't have the same value.  But we have to have some video ads, too.  We can't.  So I'm willing to concede this one  and say good, because normally I don't like a paper click.  I prefer paper impression.  But this isn't exactly paper click.  This is you get paid if they see the ad.  And if they don't see the ad, I guess they  didn't watch your video either.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think there's probably a more elegant way  to do it, which may be that the more people watch your ad.  It's like the interesting thing about AdSense  is you rise to the top on the right rail  not because you pay more, but because people click on your ad

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  more.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Maybe there's a similar thing to be doing with video  is the more people actually watch your whole commercial,  you get rewarded in some way.  You get discounts.  You get better placement.  You get other things.  And that quality and entertainment are rewarded.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Speaking of the cloud, apparently  Amazon was down for a significant amount of time  yesterday, a three-hour crash leading to a 7.8% drop  in its share price on the market.  Oh.  Based on revenue.  Well, everything was going down yesterday.  Yeah, I don't know if you can blame it being down.  Who knows, though?  The market's so crazy.  But that's from the HuffPo.  What were you going to say, Jean?  I'm sorry.  We had a.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I was going to say, we were talking about Flash earlier.  Google Chrome now, the latest stable release of Google Chrome  comes with Flash built in.  And we'll update it for you.  What?  Yeah, they announced us on the official Google blog today.  And in fact, they released a little Flash game  that you could play kind of in celebration.  And it went down.  Like there was too much traffic.  They couldn't keep it up.  Wow.  Yeah, race to the finish line in a Flash  is the name of the story.  Wow.  So I tried to click on it earlier.  So here I am.  It's youtube.com slash chromefastball.  And I haven't actually seen the game, because it  wouldn't load for me.  But they updated the post and said, dude,  an overwhelming response to the game.  Some things aren't quite working as we'd hoped.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So automatically, as a Chrome user, get this thing?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So you get the Flash.  It's just the Adobe Flash plugin, right?  So it comes.  Oh, I see.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So already you have it.  So probably that's not.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  But the good thing about it is that the user  doesn't have to interact with it at all to update.  Security updates are always kind of the issue, right?  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Flash has a huge security flaw.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Huge security problem.  So now Chrome manages that for you.  So you always have the latest, kind of most secure update.  So this is interesting.  And it makes a lot of sense with Chrome OS, right?  Dropping the end of the year, last quarter of the year.  So it's kind of a pretty strong Chrome Flash.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And Firefox has kind of done this for a while.  Firefox has notified you if a plugin is out of date.  But it's not quite the same.  It's just fixing it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's just fixing it, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't load that Chrome Fastball page at all.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Me neither.  So what's on that?  What do I?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's a Flash game.  To celebrate, we teamed up with a few creative folks  to make Chrome Fastball a Flash-based game built  for YouTube.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So much for Flash being scalable.  Yeah.  Gee.  Server-side overloading.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, it's kind of awesome that Google took its own site  down.  Interesting.  Yeah, complete various games to get the shiny Chromeball  to the finish line.  I want a Chromeball.  I know.  I want to play Chromeball.  All right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're going to move on here because we're running out of time.  We're going to get to our tip, number, and pick of the week  in just a second.  Before we do that, though, I want to remind everybody  to run out.  Do not walk.  Run out to iStock Photo and get your images.  You know, a blog post without a picture  is like a day without sunshine.  Every good blogger knows that you're smiling, Gina.  Well, you do this, right?  I'm sure.  Let me just go to SmarterWear.  I bet you there's not one post without a picture in it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Picture for good.  I actually want to look for photos all the time,  and I don't do a good job of it.  So this is good news.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, this is what you need.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  TechCrunch always has good, funny images up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, they do a good job, don't they?  They have crazy images, yeah.  They illustrate these.  Dave Weiner does that, too.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Now, see?  Blogger Lesson 0 is you need an image.  Blogger Lesson 1 is don't just take an image from Google Image  Search results if you don't have the rights  to use those images.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  But see, the beauty of iStock Photo  is it's very affordable, and they're great images.  And not just images, by the way.  They now do, besides photos and illustrations,  they do video and audio.  They have sound effects.  I think every blog post should have a sound effect.  What would yours be, Leo?  I got a vuvuzela right here, and I'm not afraid to use it.  Actually, I won't blow it, because somebody  said I'm no longer listening to the Twitter network  because he keeps blowing his vuvuzela.  I have two official South African vuvuzelas  that were sent to me by listeners from the World Cup.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Not just an iPhone app.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And believe me, they're just as annoying in person  as they are on TV.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't doubt that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There is no iStock vuvuzela, but there is an iStock Photo.  When they first started in 2000, they just  were offering photos now.  They've got illustrations, vector images, videos, music,  and sound effects.  There is Flash.  There are 3D renders, and they're going to do logos soon.

Of this week in Google, time for Gina Tripani's tip of the week.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  This is an easy one for Gmail users.  You can now view Word documents, .doc or .docx files,  in a new Google Docs viewer.  So instead of opening it up in Google Docs  and going through the spinning thing where it has to convert it,  it's just a viewer.  So you can just quickly open up a Microsoft Word document.  So if you go into Gmail and you search for has colon attachment,  .docx or .doc, you'll see there's a view link next to your Word  attachment.  And if you click on that, it opens up the viewer.  And then you can click on Edit Online to edit it in Google Docs  or just see it.  So it makes emailing around Microsoft Word documents  a little less annoying.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Have they made the Google Apps better for you?  Have they solved that email issue, the single email?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They haven't.  And they're still kind of promising a solution, right?  The dual Google account issue, right?  That's kind of vanilla Google account versus apps.  They haven't gotten there yet, but they're working on it.  Like they released Wave for Google Apps, which is great.  But there's still a lot of services  like Google Voice and Google Reader,  which aren't for apps accounts yet.  So I'm still rocking the two Google accounts.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So frustrating.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's going to be a happy day.  Yeah.  Work that out.  Yeah.  And I hope they give you the ability  to merge the accounts, you know?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Go country.  Yeah, yeah.  Because otherwise, you'd have to just start over or something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That'd be awful.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, especially now that my phone is tied to an email  account that's not my main email account.  Right.  Because my main email account is Google Apps.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They need a way to merge accounts in general,  because all of us have multiple email accounts now.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, they don't fight it, but they don't  acknowledge it in any way.  That there should be simply an app switcher.  I shouldn't have to sign out a Gmail and sign back in.  Right.  Yeah.  That simple level.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I should just be able to say, hey, this is where,  these are my accounts.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Claim them, and then use Gmail to go back and forth.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jeff.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Another great idea from this show we've given them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Gosh, you know, if they would just listen to us.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I want Froyo in return.  We give you all these ideas.  I just give you Froyo.  Just push me Froyo, please.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Please.  I beg of you.  Jeff Jarvis, time for our number of the week.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, thanks to a Twitter listener.  I'm going to use what he suggested, which is 443,000,  which is the number of lines of JavaScript handwritten code  in Gmail.  Oh, boy.  And this comes in a story that's more to the point  that Gmail is going to use more and more HTML5 features,  saying that their goal is to get it to load in less than a second  and to do new features like letting us drag documents  to the desktop and all kinds of fun stuff like that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I never felt like Gmail was slow in the least.  I did either.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, they have that labs feature, which is the preview.  So like while your Gmail is loading,  it shows you kind of just like a preview  of your list of messages.  I actually have that enabled because it  does take a couple of seconds to load your inbox.  But you can sort of get a peek in.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You are one busy lady, Gina.  You've got to make sure every second is filled.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't have three seconds to spare here, people.  I need to see one more.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know.  I've never even thought of Gmail as being slow.  It loads so fast for me.  It seems faster than my, certainly much faster  than my desktop mail application, which is Apple Mail.  You're just spoiled, Gina.  Spoiled.  Actually, I have a couple of tools for you.  Picasa just got updated.  If you haven't yet tried the free Picasa program from Google,  it's spectacular.  And the face recognition and a lot of nice features.  The update just seems to be a minor bug fix,  maybe a security update.  But just reminded me, we haven't mentioned Picasa lately.  And we also mentioned my other pick,  which I do think you should try if you're on an Android phone.  Kindled for Android, it's great.  It's a little bit, I think, behind the Apple and iPad  version because they've added audio and video to the Apple  and iPad version.  However, I don't think there's a lot of content that  uses audio and video yet.  So maybe they'll catch up quickly.  But at least we've got it now.  And it does sync up.  Wherever you are on Kindle, iPad, iPhone, or our Android  phone, you'll jump to that point on all the other devices  if you want.  And I love that.  And can I tell you a secret?  My wife got the Kindle when I got the iPad.  And I just said, well, keep it on my Amazon account.  And now when she buys a book, if she likes it,  I can read it on my devices too.  So it's kind of fun.  Don't tell them.  I think you're allowed to do that.  I think you're allowed to do that.  Jeff Jarvis is the greatest.  BuzzMachine.com, thanks to the folks at Sony for letting us  use the conference room.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I've got to tell you something.  I'm in an old despair office.  But I'm on the executive floor.  So there's a gigantic old Trinitron.  Where am I?  Trinitron TV.  Look at that.  Ha!  I love those.  And my favorite is, though, there is, let's see if it's  what could that be?  Is that a Selectric?  Do you know what that is?  Have you ever seen one of those?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Is that a typewriter?  I think I read something about those ones on paper.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jeff, if I were you, I'd look for dead bodies  under the behind the modesty panel.  I think you found a ghost room.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes, I think so.  Jeez.  There's a typewriter and a Trinitron.  Wow!  Actually, you know what?  I miss my typewriter.  I wish I had one.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And my Trinitron.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And my Trinitron.  Go to BuzzMachine.com and read Jeff's blog.  And the new book is coming soon.  I just make it up.  Private parts.  But you've got to read his public parts.  And of course, his current book, What Would Google Do?  And Steven Levy was at food camp.  And I guess he's doing a book on Google now.  So it's a crowded space.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  All these latecomers.  Ha ha ha ha.  You were there first.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The Christopher Columbus of Google Books.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Al Batel beat me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, yeah, he's the Vikings of Google Books.  Gina Tripani at SmarterWear.org.  That's her blog.  And of course, the book, The Complete Guide to Google Wave  is available at CompleteWaveGuide.com.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Indeedy.  Thanks for having me.  Fun show today.  Always fun.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Always a great pleasure.  Jeff and I concur.  One of my favorite things to do.  Highlight of my week.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yep.  See Gina there across the screens.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I know.  It's so nice.  We'll get a guest.  I wanted to reunite the three for this episode.  We'll get a guest for next week.  I met so many great Google folks at the food camp.  They all want to be on the show.  So it'll be easy to get people on.  I think Rick Clow is first in line.  He's been dying to get on the show.  We should get him on, yes.  Absolutely.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And Rick can talk to all these questions  we have about profile pages.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, he did Feedburner.  Feedburner was acquired by Google.  What's he working on now?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He's working on the profile pages.  He's the product manager, I believe.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He took over.  Oh, great.  OK, good.  He the man.  He's the guy.  Rick Clow, we're getting for you.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Or find out what Google media is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We will find out.  Maybe he'll have some announcement  to make next week.  You never know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Would that be cool to announce it on this show?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be nice, Google?  Don't you think you'd like to do that?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Either that or give me Froyo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
