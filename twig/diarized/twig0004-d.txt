Transcript:  This is Twig.  This is Twig.  This Week in Google.  Founder of Lifehacker and a great person to talk about Google with, I gotta say.  Also here, Mr. Jeff Jarvis, journalist extraordinaire and observer of all things, web2.0 at buzzmachine.com.  And our guest today, this is becoming a habit now.  What we do is we talk about somebody's blog and then we bring them on the next day.  Last week we were talking about Kevin Marks and his blog post about why Twitter works.  He's joined us today. It's great to have him.  Hi there.  One of the guys behind QuickTime at Apple.  He was chief engineer at Technorati.  Most recently at Google, working on open social and Google profiles.  He's currently vice president of web services at British Telecom, his latest brand new position.  How's that going, Kevin? What are you doing over there?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  I'm still getting, settling into it.  But what I'm working on is connecting the world of telephony to the world of the web  in all the ways that that fits together.  But also you should be aware that BT, even despite the name, isn't really just a phone company.  It's an internet company and has been for years.  It runs the internet infrastructure for the UK and does lots of internet services for business in the US.  So it's been quite amusing for me because over here hardly anyone's heard of it.  Whereas everyone in England, it's been the phone company forever.  So I've got this sort of interesting cultural clash as I talk to people depending on whether they're British or not.  The interesting thing for me is working out how these things fit together.  And that was the stuff I was talking about before about the flow past web, the web of flow and the web of history.  I think that's particularly interesting when you come to telephony because we were talking about latency just now in your audio chain.  Latency is really, really important when you've got a two-way conversation going on.  You really care about being able to talk back and forth and interrupt each other and nod and hmm things.  That's something you really need for a phone.  So that is the true real time.  Whereas the stuff we're doing with text, there's much more slack on that.  And I was joking about you being a musician.  Musicians really, really care about this because they can hear edges people can't.  There are people who really, really care about latency are gamers because they are operating close to the edge and they've got very fast reflexes.  So the people who notice latency on the web and really care about real time are musicians trying to play with each other and gamers.  They're on the tight end.  And then the stuff that we're calling real time now, which has, you know, takes a few seconds to propagate and is textual.  That's, you know, that's not that's from hardcore engineering point of view.  That's not real time at all.  But the interesting thing is the latency of all these things is changing.  So the stuff that used to have to be real time television had to be real time because we didn't have enough space to buffer any of it.  And so every television in the country in the UK, at least, was synchronized to one clock at the BBC that was driving the flyback scan of every television and audio.  You couldn't buffer at all.  You couldn't. I asked you about latency in your mixer.  That isn't a question you could have asked in the analog era.  The latency was how long is your cable?  Right.  So the stuff that used to have to have low latency because there wasn't any alternative is now really easy to slow down.  And we have Tivo's, we have iPods of all these things.  That means we don't have to all watch the same program at the same time.  Whereas the other stuff that we were assumed would take a little while to propagate, you know, sending emails back and forth, sending messages.  That stuff is coming closer and closer and closer to the real time to interaction that we expect.  So I think there's a lot of interesting stuff as we move things back and forth across the boundary of stuff that you really need to be real time because you have a two way interaction.  You have this flow going and stuff that you can watch later and catch up with later and move back and forth.  So that was sort of that was my flow pass thing I said before.  And that plays into the Twitter stuff as well.  One of the things I've seen with Twitter is that you've got this sort of stuff bouncing back and forth and things build up and flow.  And if you you can throw something into that and it'll spread and lots of people come to that.  So you mentioned my piece last week that I was very pleased with the nice things you said about it.  And I wrote that on Friday afternoon and it sort of it lasted until sort of the middle of the week where people still talking about it.  But I've made some throwaway remark on Wednesday about an old post of mine about identity theft and linked to a post of mine.  And that had more traffic than the Twitter post even though I wrote that 18 months ago because I happened to throw it into a live conversation on Twitter.  So having a history of things and being able to look back and point at things is really important.  And it's something we need to be aware of as we're building these new services that we don't suddenly lose all our history because a service goes away.  You think this is something that's well understood?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, we were talking last week about the word that you used, phatic, in your description of why Twitter succeeds, which I kind of inelegantly said means social lubrication or social grease.  The stuff that doesn't carry information but carries social relationship.  And you said that's a social scientist term. How good are social scientists?  How well have they predicted this?  How well do they understand this? Or is this stuff completely terra incognita for them?  Lots of them are working on it.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  There's lots of really interesting work going on there.  But there is a cultural divide.  It was something that was very obvious to me at Google was that they had no idea that this work was going on in social sciences and that it was even relevant to what they're doing.  Because they've got a very hard science reductionist analytic worldview over there.  But if you look at, I'm sure you know the work of Dana Boyd.  She's a very prominent social scientist who talks about this stuff.  But there's a large research community who look at social interaction.  And we've got a generation of researchers coming through now who have grown up with computers and use them as their tools rather than.  And so we have anthropologists who understand computation.  We have computer scientists who understand.  And I don't claim to be a social scientist by any stretch of the imagination.  But I find it fascinating to listen to them and read them and think about what they're saying and then try and connect the pieces back together.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, they've been thinking about this longer than any of us have.  Right.  It's a new context for them, completely new context for them.  Yes.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Well, it's not a completely new context because people are still people.  So a lot of the things that they talk about map into this.  But as we're more able to talk to more people, some of the possibilities change and some of the models that some of the sort of the assumptions that have been built based on how many people you can interact with start becoming more fluid.  I think that's an interesting point.  That's the sort of the change between what there's the idea of the Dunbar number that you can't really know more than 150 people, which is, you know, obviously that's an arbitrary number that's been made out of a series of curves.  But I think one of the things that we find is that as as we move from the classic broadcast model to the overlapping public's idea that we have in Twitter and how we have on the Web, it is much more possible for you to interact with more people and have some sense of what they're doing and how they're there.  And so it becomes much more of a continuum rather than you have a small set of people you actually know.  Then you have some people that that are sectioned off as professional broadcasters as sort of professional communicators that there's actually much more of a continuum between the two that I've seen.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Kevin, when I when I visited you at Google when you were still there, you showed me a lot of stuff about not just communicating directly, but about your tricky tracks in the ground.  What you do and what you see like Huffington Post Facebook thing this week, that that is your ambient intimacy and your your presence online.  And so it's not just about communicating. It's also about what sharing letting people in.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Yes. So, I mean, the the activity, I think the activity stream stuff is a strong piece of this.  And that is keeping track of what you do on the Web and being able to share that.  That's very useful because you're you're sending out these sort of social signals to people so they can see what you're talking about and what you're thinking about.  And it's also it was the filtering piece is is significant.  If we all look at several things and pass some of them through, then we're providing a perspective on the Web and saying this stuff is interesting.  This stuff is important. And we've been doing we've been doing this for blogs for a long time.  But the amount of effort to actually make a blog post that links to something is fairly high.  And so it becomes quite a strong filter. But it's the amount of that you can do per day is, you know, unless you're sitting there all day writing 10 posts a day, you can't be doing that.  You would you would do one post every day or so.  Whereas if you if you make it part of the experience of reading the Web of browsing the Web and sharing it as we as we do now where we we click share buttons, we can retweet buttons, we do that kind of stuff.  In each case, we're taking a large sort of incoming flow and saying this bit is the bit that I find interesting.  So we start using each other as filters. We become each other's media.  So rather than having an anointed committee of editors decide what the what the stories are and what the media is, we have this massively parallel set of people choosing what the media is.  Then each of us choose each other. And that is a much more resilient structure for finding information.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What does that do for Jeff for mainstream media? Is there a role for mainstream media and something like that?  I mean, people keep saying maybe the aggregator is the is the future, but that isn't that's not even aggregation.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I was at the Aspen Institute this last week presenting our new business models for news at the City University of New York, where I teach.  And it was frankly a room filled with the establishment.  Yeah. And they have a great deal of trouble, I think, breaking out of the idea that there are anything more than one way communicators of information that they gather.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and the last thing they want to be is just a one among equals, which it sounds like they've become in some ways.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's what they have to be. If you're a member of a network, you're a member of a network.  And you have to contribute to the network and they cannot think like networks and they cannot think like platforms and they cannot think about trying to enable the community to organize itself and its information.  So that's what screwing them up. I think that that if you look at the social world, you can debate whether Google or Facebook or open social will win.  But you can be sure one thing media lost social long ago.  Wow.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Amongst all these self organizing communities, though, people sharing information.  I mean, certain leaders do sort of emerge, right? Because they're really good, because they're really vocal, because they're compelling about the way that they share the things that they do.  So, I mean, that's one way the media could go is try to be compelling while being one of the individuals.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's true. I mean, or is that is that an interim feature of it? I mean, what we're doing here, for instance, we're talking heads.  We're not so very different than the original mainstream media, although it's kind of new media. Is that an interim thing?  Is this just a temporary adjustment that will go away as well? Say it's not so?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  When I was out at Aspen, Marissa Meyer was there and we were there's a lot of talk of hyper local journalism.  And that's what I was pushing was a network of hyper local plus a new news organization, plus a framework to optimize it, which was just a short step.  She went beyond and basically said to the mockers were there.  You ain't seen nothing yet, folks, and started talking about hyper personal news streams.  And that's not unfamiliar to us with Twitter and Facebook.  But if you look at the media people, they still think that the reader has to come to them to get the news.  And the whole idea that they have to insinuate themselves into your stream through probably your peers and use data to do that better and more efficiently for you and filter themselves.  You know that basically they've had 15 years since the web commercial and they didn't figure it out.  Now it's going through another huge step change. And they're behind again.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  When you say mockers, you mean mockers or mock or mockers.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You should hear me say tchotchke.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I wasn't sure if it was. Well, it could be either could be M-O-C-K mockers or it could be M-A-C-H-E-R mockers.  No, there's a little humor there.  That was good. It was a good pun for an Episcopalian, a Yiddish pun.  That's very good.  How where does Kevin, where do you think Wave and the new Google reader fit into this?  Are these attempts from from Google to try to find ways into this new kind of aggregate?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Well, there's both different kinds of things.  Reader is very much this. Reader is a good feed reader.  I use it all the time. It's had a share button for a long time.  Making that social was quite hard.  I remember the first attempt really through people because we were using at the time just the G-Talk buddies  because that was the only friend graph we had.  And that was so disjoint. People didn't get it.  If you look at what they've done now, they're actually drawing in a different set of friends and there's a better friend model in there.  We talked about this last week. I think we're still pretty confused by the whole thing.  It is. Yeah. Well, they've added six different buttons to do slightly different variations on a theme.  So, yeah, I can see there's some confusion there.  What we're trying to do with the activity stream staff is look at lots of these different models and come up with the common verbs and then map them through.  And I think, yeah, I think Google reader has has more buttons maybe than it needs.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But but not more buttons than a Chevy Impala. So you're OK.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  But it's, you know, but there are different kinds of gestures.  And there is a difference between starting, you know, starring this saying I want to read this later and clicking it saying I want to share this with other people.  And I suspect we see more coalescing of the sharing parts because there are three or four ways of sharing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Tell me what the difference is, because I'm not clear at all.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Well, no, they are on reader.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. What is the difference between starring, liking and sharing?  OK. He's not at Google anymore. We should learn.  I'm not blaming you for this. I understand, Kevin. You don't have to defend it.  But it sounds like you know.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  So the historic thing was you started and you got a feed for yourself and you shared it.  You got a feed that went out to others.  And that still works. So you've got to if you look at the starred stuff, you can see my starred items and that people tend to use that for I should read this later.  Right. Just as you do in a bookmark. OK. So that's a bookmark kind of.  It's like a personal bookmark. OK. The share is more like I want to send this out to them.  This is the thing I was talking about about reading the news and saying that it's good.  Other people should read this and you're feeding that out again.  And so other people can see that. Now, they built that a long time ago.  And the problem was the feeds were some hideous URL that you could never type or remember and could barely copy and paste.  And so making that discover was a good idea.  So now you can see the shared items at a URL and you can actually discover those because you can find your friends through the friend graph.  And also you can pump that out to a friend feed and so on. And you can get them from Google profile.  So they decided to plug the pieces together there. Now, like I think was.  And is it basically the same idea as share? It's just saying I like this thing.  It's a one click button, but it's not shared individually.  It's only shared in aggregate, as far as I can tell. So the point of it is it's supposed to be if you click like, you're not saying this is good enough for me to feed it out to everyone.  You're just saying this is good.  You know, general thumbs up and then they can add up all the liked ones and show you the most like things.  So, yeah, I think a la a la friend feeder, I guess now Facebook. Yeah.  And yeah, so it's adding a little meta. It's a little overloaded.  It's a little overloaded. And I'm not sure we need that many.  And then they've also got to send to as well, which is even because that's the same out of something else.  So they're trying out lots of things in there, you know, which is which is nice.  There's a choice of different ways you can play with it.  I suspect we'll get we'll get better at this over time and come up and converge some of these verbs, especially as you bridge stuff between sites.  And that was something that friend feed did do very well. Yeah.  Well, still does very well, actually. So I shouldn't talk about in the past.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's easy to do that, though. I don't know what's going to we we ask Paul to be on the show and he will once he's settled in a little bit and his breath is.  I'm sure there's lots to do there. Yeah, there's a lot going on there.  How about wave? So, OK, so it's a wave.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  So it's a wave is something different.  The point about wave is that it's actually a document editing system.  It's a way of doing collaborative editing.  And the other stuff that that's they've shown for doing conversations in it is built on that model of collaborative editing.  And so that's why it's actually quite hard to integrate it with all these other things, because it's really edits to a shared document.  A wave is a shared document that you edit collaboratively, just as you would with a Google document or with sub-ether edit.  If you remember that from still use it. Yeah.  Yeah. So the basic model of wave is very like sub-ether edit.  It's there is a document you're editing it together.  The OP transforms mean that you can do that in well without much delay.  I'm not to say in real time, because the interesting thing is it isn't actually real time.  What the protocol does is let you consolidate edits that happen.  If I do an edit and you do an edit and then we send the edits to each other, we end up with the same result with the operational transform.  We don't have to wait for each other to do it.  So that even though we're not, it means that we can get away with more latency between our connection because we end up with the same result.  And so it actually means that it feels more real time than the system that is actually doing a only one person edit a time model.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It feels like there's no latency at all, which I think is one of the things that scares people a little bit about wave.  It's all happening real fast.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  I mean, that's the thing is it's the if you if you've got it down to the point where you're doing character by character edits, then yes, you're not sending.  You're not sending out a chunk of stuff as you are even in Twitter.  In Twitter, you write a little thing and send out a chunk of stuff and you have that thing that makes sense.  You're doing character by character, then you have to you have to pay attention to it.  But it does consolidate up into a document that you end up with a document at the end of it.  That's the point. And the history of the edits is in the document.  You can play it back. But the but the basic model is you're editing a document together.  And that but that means that part of.  And Neil's objection to it was they're trying to reinvent the entire web.  You talk about this last week.  And he and he's you know, yeah, they've you can argue they've made up too many protocols.  But in that particular case, it's kind of far because there wasn't a good shared document protocol.  So making up one for that is a good thing.  But that also means that it is quite hard to sort of plug it into other systems because the other systems have have a sense of.  Primarily a sense of individual messages in a flow with timestamps and waves primary thing is here's a document that has edits to it.  And so transforming between those two models is quite tricky.  You know, you wouldn't want every edit to a document to be sent out to you over Twitter.  That would be really annoying.  So, you know, again, it's this what is the right latency of interaction thing and how do you match the latencies problem?  So my my my second wave is that it's interesting that we're working on stuff to connect to it as are lots of other people.  But to assume that it will it will overnight replace I.M. email and Twitter is to miss the point a little bit because what it does is a very, very powerful document collaboration tool.  But that means that it ends up being a lot more coupled than these systems are.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right.  I'm going to absorb that all. Yes, it does.  And really what it sounds like is I have to almost recontextualize what I thought wave was.  I think maybe they've been the Rasmussen's misled us a little bit by saying the future of email.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I was going to say that they didn't come out the gate and say this is a document collaboration system because that wouldn't generate as much excitement as we're going to reinvent email, which is, you know, really pretty kind of exciting and ambitious.  But if you think about an email that's responded, you know, that many people reply to and quote, it is essentially right.  A document that's just getting edited asynchronously.  But but but yeah, I think that it's the more realistic thing is to explain wave just the way you did, which is that it's a document collaboration system like some method.  But that wouldn't mean anything to a lot of people.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I wouldn't be as excited. I also think I think it's important for news and the creation of content.  And then is what I've when I saw wave.  That's what I saw is this a new way for a bunch of people to collaborate on something and to publish it live to the world and then to collaborate in turn.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  True. That second part is the part that I'm not sure about.  To be honest with you.  Oh, a closed group.  Yeah, it seems to work well with a closed group.  It feels.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Yeah.  In terms of replacing email, if you think about how you know if you're Gmail users with ordinary email, you end up with all this sort of massively nested quoting and Gmail hides out a way to show you just the bit that's new.  And so you're seeing the updates, which they've done a quite a good job of extracting that stuff out to the point is where people complain about Gmail users never actually deleting anything.  They just keep sending more and more more stuff in each thing.  And so I think it was that reaction to that model of having a very email intensive collaboration where you are adding more and more stuff to the stream.  But the documents are coming unwieldy.  I think that was their reinvention of email.  They said, OK, well, actually, we're trying to collaborate on something here.  Wouldn't be better if we were collaborating on this thing.  So they have they've what they've tried to reinvent is the process of collaborating over email with the process of collaborating on document.  And they've done an interesting job of that.  And there are other things that do things like that.  Wikis do something like that, but their interactions are creakier often.  And Google Docs does that as well.  Google Docs tacitly has a document that's shared and it does a pretty good job of letting other people edit it at the same time.  It's not quite as close to the wire as WAV is, but it does.  It's got a deployed system that's working with millions of people.  So there's definitely some value there.  So I think it's not that I think what is if they said, OK, what if we started from that from this idea, what could we do with it?  And they've done that. And then they've worked as far along as and we can move these other these other modalities that you're used to inside it.  But it's going to take a while to be able to work out what it is that they want.  They want to be using it for. But it is, I think, to Jeff's point, I think it works very well for a sort of set of collaborators of known collaborators.  I think it'll it'll be trickier if you open up to a broader set of collaborators because you run into all the sort of Wiki governance problems you already run into.  So you end up having to have people who are sitting there doing wave gardening and so on, like doing wiki gardening and making sure that people don't sort of wallpaper it with nonsense and things.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, that struck me as well that that might be come quickly become an issue.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think I was just there at the invention of new jargon wave gardening.  Is that the first time it's been said like like wiki gardening?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think it is the first time. Yeah. Is wiki gardening has been around though.  Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. We'll call it wave gardening.  Well, I think that's yeah. In a way, I think that that helps me recontextualize what wave is and understand it a lot better to think of it that way.  Somebody said it's not reinventing email.  Peser said this in our chat room. It's reinventing interoffice email, intra office email.  That makes sense.  Well, it's I'm glad you could explain this.  We don't want to put you on the spot because I know you had, you know, this isn't this isn't your your gig anymore.  Fascinating. It's fascinating stuff.  Couple of stories in our we have a friend feed room and we will have it as long as friend feeds around.  It is a friend feed dot com slash twit dash twig.  And Jeff and Gina and I put stories in there.  It's a good place if you want to go to to see what we're up to and actually to add stories or add comments to a story so that we can we can comment about them.  You guys have been much harder workers than I have this week.  Want to pick one Gina from your list in here that you'd like to talk about a little bit.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, sure. Let's pick one.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I put you on the spot there. I'll give you.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  How about your app, Gina?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How about your app? This is interesting.  You created a Twitter app, but it's a it's a self-served Twitter app.  Tell us about that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  I was kind of personal programming project.  I'm calling it right now.  It's what a litic.  It's a PHP application that you install on your own server, much like WordPress.  And what it does is it archives your tweets.  So it crawls your Twitter stream constantly.  You schedule the crawler to run pretty often.  This is pretty nerdy stuff.  So just want to.  Sorry, we're all nerds here.  We're all nerds here.  So I can say these things.  I can say things like you cron the crawler to run once an hour.  It grabs your tweets.  It grabs responses to your tweets.  And it does basically analytics.  My vision is that it's going to be doing analytics on your Twitter presence.  So it tells you things like who are the least likely people who are following you?  Least likely being like who are the people who have the most followers and the fewest friends who are following you?  Which one of your tweets have the most responses?  And it actually creates a view, which is each one of your tweets.  And then you can drill down and see the responses to those tweets.  You can curate responses to your tweets, meaning like most Twitter clients, if you click on the reply to button, it associates the response to your tweet.  But not all users do that.  So you can assign replies.  Oh, this reply belongs to this tweet.  This reply belongs to this tweet.  And then you can link to your tweet and say, hey, I sent out this lazy web Twitter about what's your favorite Twitter client?  And here's what everybody said.  Oh, I love that.  Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm really using it for, because I'll be honest, I crowdsource a lot of the stuff that I write on Lifehacker and Asmodeware.  And it's really easy for me to say, like, think like, hey, I've got these 10 great things, but I want to ask my followers first.  So I've been using it for that.  And yeah, that's it.  It's kind of first iteration.  I've been working on it for a few months.  I just put it out this past Thursday.  And interestingly, I think it was Thursday.  Yeah.  Interestingly, that same day, Biz Stone said that Twitter was going to start offering commercial premium commercial accounts for Twitter, for businesses who have Twitter accounts that will offer detailed analytics.  So I felt like kind of a jerk, like releasing an app that's like, you know, just totally navel gazey.  You know, none of us wants to admit how often we look at like Google Analytics or SiteMeter, you know.  But I felt kind of justified like, oh, OK, well, Twitter's offering this as a little bit of a business model.  So maybe I wasn't totally, you know, off the rails.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Not at all. It sounds really useful.  Do you hit API limits?  Do you have problems with getting all the information?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. So the API, the Twitter API limit currently is 150 calls per hour.  So I built into the crawler to the crawler backs off, given a certain number.  Right.  So the crawler runs 20 minutes after the hour and there are 40 minutes left in the hour.  It says, OK, you've got 150 calls.  I'm only going to use like 20 of them.  Right. Because we don't want to lock anybody out of their Twitter client.  So the crawler does that pretty quickly.  And you can set it to be very aggressive or not very aggressive at all.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Without access to the fire hose, though, you think you might miss some content?  You'll see all your content, I guess.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. You get all of your content.  And then so it only grabs content from people that you care about.  So your own stuff replies to your own stuff, your friend's stuff.  So it's kind of like in levels of importance.  And then your follower stuff lasts.  Right.  So I tell you, if you run it for as long as I've been running it for about a month, you get a lot of data.  I mean, I've got a table with eight million rows in it, just from like 12 users.  You know, just grabbing like your friend's stuff and their friends, because it figures out things like mutual friends.  I can look at Jeff, say, for example, and say, which who are both me and Jeff following?  So, yeah, it sucks in a lot of data, but it does stop at a point.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is this is this is what to me is the success of Twitter is that they did so little themselves and they gave you an API to do so much more.  And what's great is that, as usual, the founders don't know what the best uses of anything are.  So they've let people like you figure out better and more interesting ways to use it.  Sounds like you've got something really cool.  It's cool.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You really have to be super engaged with Twitter to see value.  And I mean, a lot of people looked at it and was like, this looks cool, but I don't know what I would do with any of these numbers.  I've got, you know, 100 followers and I don't really Twitter that much.  I mean, I'm on the opposite end of the spectrum.  I've been Twittering for two years straight.  I'm approaching the 3200 mark, after which, like my tweets won't be accessible via the API.  So I had a vested interest in backing up my my tweets because literally Twitter's been my kind of personal blog the last couple of years because I was just busy blogging at Lifehacker and I wasn't doing my own personal stuff.  So, you know, it's interesting.  Kevin was saying earlier, he pointed out that the great thing about Twitter is this flow, right?  That things kind of go by and if you miss them, it's no big deal.  And Anil talked about this last week, too.  I loved Anil's analogy.  He said, if you arrive at a party late, there's no expectation that you have to go back and hear all the conversations that you missed.  Which is true.  But at the same time, like I do want the record of my own tweets, you know, for the past two years.  I actually sometimes refer to my Twitter stream like, what was that party?  Or what was that thing that I did?  I know I Twittered about that or someone will reply to me, you know, something interesting.  And then, you know, it gets lost or I need it later.  And so total it kind of backs up in archives and also offers those different views.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I came to think of my blog as blogs were originally intended as a place to store stuff and not just share stuff.  So when I put it in Twitter, I think I've stored it and I really have.  No, no. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I have a I have a plug in that for WordPress that automatically digests my tweets and once a week puts them in the blog so I can search them and stuff.  So I have been saving that stuff for some time.  But I like the addition.  I like that.  You know, I think you're right.  The idea of collating responses to a lazy tweet, lazy web tweet is really valuable.  I've I had to like cut and paste it and put it in a notebook and stuff like that.  And you don't you don't get everything.  It's really nice to have all that stuff.  So this is this is kind of what we're getting at with the activity stream stuff.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  The point of this is you want to keep track of all the actions you're taking in different places and draw them back together again.  So activity streams is trying to standardize this so you can do it across different sites.  And not just pick the one site that you're focused on, whether it's Twitter or Facebook or whatever, and do it for that.  But have a standard.  You can move stuff between sites.  The other thing this reminds me of is there's a project that Adriana Lukasz and has been proposing for a while called The Mine Project with the idea is that you have a bunch of information that is yours.  That is mine, if you like.  And you store that yourself and then you give out fees to other people.  And you store that yourself and then you give out fees to other people that feeds that information out.  So I'm intrigued that you're doing it on your own server and not doing it on a machine somewhere and then trying to scale up to lots of users.  You're saying, no, this is actually mine.  I want to keep this for myself and I will let some of this information out.  But I'm most interested in profiling myself as I move through the net.  And there's a strong fit there with with Adriana's thoughts on this because she's very focused on I want to draw back the information that I've spread out to these different websites and put it back together and analyze it for my own reasons.  And understand what I've been doing so that I can correlate my restaurant visits and my travel and the people I've been talking to and the tweets I've been making and then draw those back together to make sense of that.  But also have a store of your own information that you selectively let pieces of it out.  So the goal when we're defining a lot of these open standards is to be really clear that it doesn't matter who you're talking to on the other end of the protocol.  Not only should you not have to have a business relationship with that person, you shouldn't even have to know that they exist as long as you're talking the same protocol and you can move stuff back and forth.  And that's the sort of true power of the open spec process of having a spec where people can interoperate without knowing each other exists.  And that once you get to that point, then you're able to build these these interesting long chains of things.  So I wonder if Gina had looked at connecting to other kinds of feeds, connecting to streams from other services as well.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I would love to do that. That's totally ideal.  I mean, I chose Twitter just because it was the place where I spent the most time and a project that encompassed all those other things.  I mean, I'm glad you're doing this. It's a big project.  But I really like having stuff that I make on my own server, like having a copy of it on my own server.  I like having my data on my own server. I like having my blog hosted there.  I like having a backup just in case things go wrong.  I have it. I got really freaked out when I realized that Twitter's API doesn't give you any tweets beyond like 3,200, which I know is a high number.  And I know that it's probably an issue of scale for them.  But I was just like, so if I Twitter more than 3,200 times, then it's just gone.  I can't retrieve that again.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Can you really go back to one if you've got 3,200 tweets?  I didn't even know you could go that far back.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, you can view the API. You can go back 3,200 tweets. So it's a page of 100 tweets.  You can do 32 pages, which is generous.  But like, you know, it's like, I don't know, everyone wants to know, hey, what was my first?  What was my first tweet back in 06?  You know, that kind of thing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.  Crap, Gina, I feel like I just talked too much, which people tell me, because I've been doing it a lot less than you have.  And I see that I have 4,500.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, if it makes you feel better, I only have 2,500 and I've been doing it to 2007.  So 6.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  I'm heading up to 10,000. My son said, can you make me your 10,000th tweet, which I thought was very sweet.  Aww.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Aww.  Isn't that? Aww. That's the modern family. I want to be the 10,000th.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  So I've got to keep track of the number now because I wasn't looking before.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It sounds like you would like Fever, Gina. Have you played with that at all? That's the...

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I haven't, but it's totally on my list. Yeah, that's the aggregator that Sean Inman made, right?  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Also self-hosted.  Also self-hosted. Well, you know, Matt Howey, after he saw the thing about Twitterlitic, he tweeted something like, you know,  I hate reading about great projects that lead to a link to GitHub. It's like saying, you know, want ice cream and then pointing to the rock salt in the mixer.  Make it yourself.  Yeah. Right. So, yeah, that valid point.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Ken Sheppardson is asking, did you ever consider putting it on using a Google App Engine for this?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good... I hadn't really thought about it.  It seems like it would be unnatural for that.  And the thing is the database blows up so quickly. I mean, if you've got, you know, a decent network of friends,  so I'm getting your friends and then their friends and your followers and then all their tweets.  I mean, the database gets really big, really fast. And all I want is my slice of Twitter, the stuff that has some relation to me,  either someone who I've said I want to follow this person or someone who has followed me or someone who has replied to me.  So like as soon as you start registering more than, you know, a dozen users, the database gets enormous.  Then you have to deal with the scaling issues that Twitter does.  I imagine the App Engine would have a higher threshold than, you know, Dreamhost does, which is where I'm hosting mine.  But, you know, it just gets enormous.  So that's why I feel like, you know, just let people who really care and can run a server just, you know,  install it on their own on their own box and then they can configure it to work the way they want.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm downloading it right now. Requires PHP and MySQL.  Yep.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And, you know, what happens with, I presume we'll talk about this momentarily, but what happens with metadata like geo tagging,  which is they announced this week is adding to Twitter.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That is very, very excited. I'm really excited about all the API upgrades.  There was the retweet thing announced that they made, which is retweets are going to be presented a little more differently.  And then the geo stuff this week, which you got really excited about, Jeff.  And actually, Jeff, you came up with a lot more interesting possibilities for the geo stuff.  I wanted to build in maps. I wanted to say, tell me, you know, if somebody follows me who's in San Diego,  because the San Diego tech community isn't as large as in San Francisco or New York.  Like, I want to know. Let me know. That kind of thing.  I would like to see.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hugely valuable. Yeah.  Definitely. Definitely.  Any metadata you can add to a tweet is going to make it more valuable, but geographic especially.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Geographic does so much.  I mean, again, I always look at it from the news and media perspective, but imagine during the Tehran crisis  that you would have been able to verify better who were really witnesses to things.  News or I would set up an app to look at huge bursts of activity around an address.  That's going to tell me that news is happening or else is a hell of a good party on.  You could use it for things like the collaborative projects like the fabled, you know, big pothole report kind of a Seaclick fix.  I'd want to see in my town.  I really have no sense of my neighbors tweeting the where I live.  There were old farts and some probably nobody's tweeting.  But if there are a few people here, I'd love to see that.  And then you start to think about the commercial applications as well as, you know, what's going on near you in stores and restaurants and so on.  The other finally, the other thing that fascinates me about it is starting to build an annotation level on the real world over time  so that you can see a collection of restaurant reviews through Twitter done just saying, you know, this is what this is like here.  It's going to be as odd in the API from what I can see that they're going to eliminate the geo data after a certain amount of time.  And that's why your model, Gina, is all the more important.  You want to pull the stuff out of the API and analyze it separately.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Exactly. Do you think this is something Twitter is going to be hostile to at some point since you in fact are kind of doing something they hope to monetize?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't think so. I mean, I think Twitter's been really great.  I mean, there's so many third party apps for Twitter. It's such a predictable thing for a developer to work on.  And I mean, there's stats and there's lots of products actually that do similar things to what Twitterlytic does.  And Biz said in his announcement about the fact that they were going to offer this to businesses that he didn't want to disturb the kind of ecosystem of third party developers.  And I believe him. I mean, they've been really good and really generous with developers and with the API calls.  I mean, I think they just upped the limit from 100 to 150. I nearly threw a party that day.  That was really exciting because I could get a lot more data a lot faster.  I was doing things like saying, if it's three in the morning, go to the limit.  But if it's noon, only make like 10 calls.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Are you updating this so much to be better to install through Git than to download a Tarball?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You can download the Tarball for now. I actually haven't even tagged a release number.  And I think that will be exactly what's up to date right now, which is mostly working.  Other people have installed it and got it working. I have confirmed.  So it actually is working. That was also very exciting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's my project for tonight. Yeah, I can't wait.  It sounds like so much fun.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  I want to talk back to Jeff a bit about the geographic stuff, because I think the Iran example is interesting for another reason,  because actually what happened was people said everyone change your location to Iran to create noise so people can't find out what's going on.  So being able to sort of perform your location rather than actually setting it is part of this as well.  You need to be able to say, I'm interested in this place, even if you're not there.  And that's part of the location stuff that's often a bit subtle.  If you're watching a conference that a lot of other people at, you may want to set your location to that place so that you're in the cloud there.  So there's some interesting nuances to this.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The other one, Kevin, I think you're right is, well, there's so there's a privacy issue.  And the default, as I understand, is that you turn this off and you opt in.  There's a veracity issue of am I really here or am I am I faking it?  And then how valuable does the geo become at all?  And so it's it's going to be very interesting to see how it gets used.  I think the problem for square is interesting, too, but it doesn't have the critical mass.  Twitter comes in with the critical mass.  The other issue is that it's not just your phone, it's the new Firefox Google applications that lets you have your set browser on my laptop here and give it a geographic location.  So geography added in an annotation layer of geography versus me, information versus geography, me versus time, geography versus time.  It all becomes just wonderful headache.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A good problem to have.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And as we look at a streamed web of news, you know, one of the problems with news coming forward is so that you are that witness somewhere and you saw the plane hit the helicopter of the Hudson.  And when I went in to Twitter right after that happened, I searched for Hudson and there was somebody who said, oh, my God, I just saw this.  And if I can verify that he's really a witness, what happens with those kinds of news events?  It just it changes the notion of news and you don't need reporters to get there.  You can't wait for reporters to get there.  News is witnesses.  Dave Weiner says that the thing about blogging is that the sources now blog, the sources now publish.  Yeah, I love that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Well, that was that was my parody of the who was it?  Was it the AP?  Somebody was complaining about people printing their stuff without paying them.  And I did sort of turned inside out and said, what about all the people you interview you print their stuff without paying them?  Exactly.  And it's it's it.  I was I was being facetious.  But the point is that it's very true.  We have we are all each other's media.  We are able to report and say things and then we will decide what to pass on to whom.  And just there is this sort of spread of different people.  And you expect that you expect a sort of broad distribution of people that people listen to a little and people who listen to a lot.  That's what comes out of a what we call a small world network, a network that gets stuff to travel a long way.  Oh, the other thing I wanted to ask Gina about was if she'd looked at Pub Sub Hubbub yet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, we've talked about it quite a bit.  Oh, yes.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So the dream for a totalitik is to not only be an archiver and an analytics view, it's also to be a publisher and use Pub Sub Hubbub to sort of to push out tweets and to sort of do something.  To push out tweets and get tweets.  I mean, you know, I don't know if this could ever actually happen.  But if you have a group of people who have totalitik installed in their own servers to be able to push those updates out to one another and then sync back to Twitter, but have it sort of be a distributed distributed and real time.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Can you give me a use case so I could visualize what that would look like?  I'm not sure I understand how that would work.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So so when Twitter goes down, basically being able to push to push updates to your friends.  So every time you post a tweet, you're creating a distributed Twitter.  Yeah, distributed Twitter.  This is kind of this is kind of the vision.  I'm not sure I'm going to I'm going to see what I could do.  But so every time you post a tweet, there's a little feel of this is backing into a distributed Twitter.  Every time you tweet, there's a little field that says what client you used.  So I could use that that field to say this is where my instance of totalitik exists.  So I could in theory kind of detect, you know, where are my friends using totalitik and where is their server located and then be able to push updates to them.  And I'd love to use something like HubSubHubbub because it would be because it would be real time.  It would be notifications versus polling.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This really encapsulates something that we've been talking about now for a couple of episodes, this idea that people want to pull it back to themselves, be the hub instead of pushing all their content out to other third parties, make the blog or whatever the hub, but still want to participate in these social graphs.  And I guess that's really, Kevin, what you've been pushing all along is kind of owning your owning your stuff, but making it federate.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Well, the point is defining a standards in such a way that they will work for a company with 100 million users and their work for an individual with their own server.  So if you look at OpenID, that that is very much designed that way.  You can you can set up your own server that does an OpenID.  You can set your own blog up on a service that doesn't OpenID or you can use Google or Yahoo or AIM or any of these other large companies that have set themselves up.  So that that is a protocol that clearly does that.  The challenge is doing that for some of these other things as well.  The point of the the open social and the portable contact stuff was to do that for basically the list of people that you know, for some value of no, but a way of having information about people, about photograph, name and links to their other profiles and information in a standardized form and addresses and phone numbers and so on.  That you can actually move between sites in a general way so that you don't have to recreate it every site you go to.  You can you can delegate to the sites they already exist at.  But you can self host as well as easy as you could host it in some special magic place like Twitter or Google or Yahoo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I guess you have to have both because not everybody's going to have GitHub and a PHP with MySQL available.  Sure.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  You need you need you need both.  But the point is to define define the protocol in such a way that you can have both rather than it being no, no, you have to go through this server or if you want to call this, you have to sign a business agreement with us or that kind of model.  If you look at how the web was built, the web was built on protocols like this.  The web was built on a set of open protocols that meant that anyone could run a web server and there was an addressing scheme for getting it that was built on DNS, which is another distributed system, which means you can resolve an address by asking a bunch of other people.  So if you look at the way that the web is actually built from the ground up, it's a set of distributed systems that are very nonspecific about where you happen to be.  And this is making sure that we can do this with this with this next layer of the web as well.  Defining these protocols in these ways so that the standards, if you look at the open web foundation, which is something I'm involved with and these other standards groups that we've done these kinds of things.  The goal is to keep building standards and specifications that follow the follow this mindset that it doesn't matter.  Doesn't matter where you are.  If you choose to draw information from that server, you can do it.  And there's, you know, yeah, there are problems with saying you can you can trust anyone.  There were some mistakes in the protocols like email addresses.  If anyone knows your email address, they can fill your inbox with noise.  That's a problem because the protocols defined backwards is anyone can send you stuff.  Whereas if you can choose to receive from anyone, that's much more resilient against against noise.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Seems like we're making good progress.  It seems like we're kind of converging now with all of these different ideas on something that will soon be just accepted as being a way of doing it.  Hope so.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the that's the goal.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It feels that way, though. I have to say it feels that way.  There seems to be some consensus moving that way.  And, you know, even the walled gardens like Facebook seem to be getting it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, they're definitely common threads.  I mean, we've had we've been having this conversation with lots of different people and the common threads emerge and people are working on similar things.  I mean, you know, my little weekend project is is one thing.  But I mean, redefining new protocol, the activity stream sounds really interesting.  You know, seeing pubs hub hub, you know, get distributed more widely, even having wave come out.  I mean, these are this is all good stuff.  Yeah, moving towards similar goals.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, exciting.  This is you know, these are this is one of those shows where we could probably go for four hours as usual.  And I hate to cut it short, but I don't want to I know it's pizza night in the Jarvis household and I don't want to cut it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, you wrote earlier.  I got to ask you what's your thinking about the the answers to the FCC this week about the Google Voice app?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I guess we probably should bring that up.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We have Arrington screaming about Apple lies.  We have Steve Gilmore.  I saw that the Kevin tweeted earlier, turning into a wonderful conspiracy theory.  What does it all mean?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Alfie, you're asking the wrong guy if you expect me to understand any of it.  So let's synopsize because we did we did get the letters or FCC got the letters from Google, AT&T and and Apple.  AT&T said basically say what you're talking about, Willis.  We didn't we didn't have anything to do with it.  We didn't talk to them. We didn't say anything.  Apple. How would you synopsize Apple's response?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Reject. Who said reject?  We're still thinking about it.  Yeah, we didn't reject it.  We have a lot of reasons we would have rejected it, but we didn't really reject it yet.  And there was some call back for a date.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And there's some secret thing that it did that was a problem, but we're not going to tell you.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, that's more Google because Google said here's what the response was to us, but we're not going to tell you what it was.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I mean, this is the thing that's so bizarre, right?  Google came out and said they rejected it.  But then in the letter, it was redacted redacted what what they were told when they submitted the app.  It's just it's confusing. I must be slow because I don't get it.  The conspiracy theory.  What is the conspiracy, though?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, what conspiracy is going on and who are the parties?  Kevin, can you can you translate Steve Gilmore?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  I can't always translate Steve Gilmore.  He tends to have to interpret Steve Gilmore than translate him.  I think what he's saying is there are a lot of overlapping goals here.  That's that's what I was getting from from from his thing.  The the the Apple thing was very explicit.  It said Apple has the freedom that that was right at the top.  They get to decide what you see and they really like that.  So they have all the freedom.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You have none of the freedom.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  It's our freedom.  That was that was so you know.  And then they wrote a long essay on how they had to protect the iPhone from terrible third party developers and the horrible things they might do.  That was that was three quarters of the essay.  And you know, Google's Google probably sent their entire correspondence with Apple,  which may be why they redacted it, because they had stuff from Apple that they would have to get Apple's mission to show to the public.  That would be my non-conspiratorial theory there.  I haven't spoken to anyone at Google about this, so I don't know.  That would be my guess.  But the underlying the underlying tension is that each of these groups have a different set of interests that they care about.  And they're trying to fit the pieces together.  Apple has a very genuine interest in making sure the iPhone experience is good and enjoyable and isn't broken by bad apps.  And they obviously want to keep dangerous apps off there.  And they've just extended that into this this this more paternalistic model of no, no, we get to decide what's going on.  The AT&T really don't want you to clog up their data network with phone calls because they have a phone network for doing that.  So they're trying to stop you doing that.  And also, you know, their data network isn't all that.  So you probably are better off doing that stuff over Wi-Fi instead.  And Google's point of view is, well, we want we want to do this stuff on the open web, on open protocols.  We want to make sure that stuff can interoperate.  So we're going to build applications that point this out.  The interesting thing for me is that the web still wins.  When they announced the iPhone, something I said was even Steve Jobs can't make it has to put the open spec of the web into this.  And Jobs gets that.  Jobs gets that. You know, they funded the development of WebKit and built out this great open source web rendering engine that means that the iPhone was basically a browser in your pocket for a long time.  And that's still a lot of what people use it for.  And the apps are sort of extra things that you can do with it.  But they aren't you can always do lots of stuff with the web.  And both Apple and Google are working on making sure that the web stays open and has, you know, we can extend open standards for doing animation, for doing audio and video and so on.  So there's there is a set of commonality there, even though there's sort of there's some contention over different bits and pieces of this here.  I thought I thought some of the the Apple stuff was rather spurious.  The replacing thing that doesn't make sense to me because they do allow Skype on there, which is also effectively replacing the phone call part.  And obviously, I have an interest here because I work for a company that's building Internet telephony.  And we really want to make sure we can have that running on lots of different clients and servers as well and do stuff service side as well as client side.  So clearly, I care about stuff not being closed down and locked up.  But I think that that's because the open web is valuable in that way in that it isn't it doesn't dictate what you can do with it.  And so in both cases here, we've got Apple trying to dictate what you do with it through that through their process and AT&T to some extent trying to dictate what they can they can do with it, too.  Google tends not to do so much of that because they were built on the open web to begin with.  They you know, Google wouldn't exist if they couldn't have written a program that pretended to be a browser and did exactly the kind of thing Gene is doing now to Twitter.  Pull down information and made sense of it and then put more information up there.  So, you know, that's baked into the heart of how Google thinks about the web.  And it's not so close to the core of the other two companies.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I've been reading while you've been talking, but trying to skim through Steve's article and I don't I don't understand either.  I liked your explanation.  It was like it's a it's a the whole group, Arrington, Apple and Google.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's all planned.  It's all planned to upgrade the carriers by I don't know.  I don't buy it.  It was a conspiracy theory.  I was confused about that article.  Yeah, well, especially Google, Apple and AT&T.  So, well, my take might I think what Steve was saying is Apple wants to be able to put their their good client hardware on lots of different phone networks.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  What they and it's and it's an expedient thing they did by doing exclusive with AT&T so they could actually get concessions out of them.  There's that subject is definitely the letter as well.  That was something they said that they get the veto over the apps, not the carrier that they think that's really important.  That's huge.  Yeah, that that and that is important.  That was what stopped the psychic being useful was that AT&T stopped them.  Stop the app store being useful on the sidekick.  So the psychic team went and bought Android instead where there is there is a truly open app store there.  So there's there's, you know, there's a lot of people that are going to be like, oh, I'm going to buy this.  There's so there's there's, you know, there is a point that Apple opened up AT&T and Steve's what Steve is saying, I think, is an Apple would really like to open up all the carriers and commoditize them and make the iPhone the one true client that everyone gets.  And Google wants to make sure that that doesn't happen because they don't want to have to, you know, sit there and have to ask Apple to be able to ship an application.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I like Chris Messina's theory that Steve Jobs is trying to kill the app store because he always wanted to have web apps all along.  That's a conspiracy.  And just as likely if you.  So the way to think about Apple is that they're a hardware company.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  So all this other stuff is like rounding errors to them.  This was the same thing about iTunes.  iTunes is really, really, really important to the music industry.  The iTunes sales thing.  But Apple basically passes through all the revenue to them.  They when they launched the iTunes music buying stuff, if you bought an individual song, Apple lost money because they were carrying the cost of delivering it.  They were carrying a credit card transaction for 99 cents, which you pay far too much charges on.  And they were carrying the cost of the software infrastructure and support.  But the bet they made was this will sell us a lot of little devices and we can.  And if you actually look at all the things they've done to sell things in bulk, to let you prepay to stuff like that, they're trying to sort of lay off the cost of buying an individual song with a credit card.  And what they did for the app store was basically the same deal for the developers that they did for the record companies, which is you get 70 percent of the revenue Apple keeps 30 percent.  They're doing less in terms of helping them digitize the audio and so on, which they didn't on that side.  On the other hand, they're doing a more stringent review process.  So I'm not sure. Apple isn't making huge amounts of money out of this process.  But what they're doing is making sure that the little shiny toys that they're selling people are much more valuable over time.  Right. That's their goal.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And since Kevin's the only person who has worked for Apple, Google and a major telecom company, I think we have to we have to defer to you and your understanding of this.  But I think you're exactly right. It's a hardware company.  You can't forget that.  Any other stories we have to talk about?  All right. I'm going to move on to Gina's tip of the week.  And now, Gina, as you do this, I'm going to try to follow along on the computer here.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, OK. So this one this one this one requires like a few quite a few steps and restarting Firefox, but it's worth it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  OK, I'm going to start Firefox. That'll be my first step.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  OK, OK. So this tip is for people who live in Gmail and Google reader every day.  So, you know, you open your browser every day, you open up Gmail, you open up Google reader.  But if your type of person opens up lots of different tabs, you want to have those tabs kind of affixed to your tab bar, because you're always going to have them open and also as small as possible so that they don't take up tab bar real estate.  OK, so there's a there's a set of Firefox add ons, which I actually linked to from my blog, a smarterware.org.  It's right at the top of the page that's that lets you reduce your Gmail and g reader tabs down to just the icon, put the number of unread items onto that icon.  So it's still informative and permanently affix them there.  So regardless of whether or not you hit close all tabs or, you know, you close your browser entirely or start a new session, they're basically permanent icon only Gmail and g reader tabs that show you how many items that you have unread for folks who, you know, want to have a regular  page, but also kind of live in those two web apps.  So that's not very easy to follow along with.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But you know what I'm also learning?  I didn't know you could create collections of add ons.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Mozilla just launched us a few months ago.  You can create collections of add ons and then you can subscribe to collections so that if the person adds add ons to them or removes them that they update in your browser, which is also kind of cool.  But it's an easy way to link to, you know, a set of add ons.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. Oh, and they get updated as well.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And they get updated as well.  So the add ons that this works with is a faviconized tab is what it's called, which means that the tab is just the favicon, not the text, right, which makes it real skinny.  Another add on called permatabs, which keeps certain tabs that you specify open at all times.  It affixes them regardless of your session state.  And then this is shameless self promotion to add ons that I developed, that I compiled better Gmail and better G reader, which include the number of unread items in the favicon.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And you have to have a Mozilla account to take advantage of this.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Actually, no, you can you can install the the add ons without subscribing to the collection.  I don't have to log on.  You can just click on each one of those add ons and install them one by one and get it configured.  But the instructions on how to configure it and what you have to set up in the in the add ons are on my blog, which will also and they'll also be in the show notes.  The link to that post will be in the show notes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right at the top.  Smarterware.com.  You said dot com dot org.  Dot org.  Dot org. Okay.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And thank you for including a little twit tab in there.  That's very nice.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, well, of course.  I've always got the twit tab up.  Come on.  Who doesn't?  I'm going to permatab that one.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's better twit.  I want to see that soon.  Our number of the week comes to us from Mr. Jeffrey Jarvis.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So the number of this week is four hundred twenty.  That's four hundred twenty percent, which is how much Google stock has increased in the five years since its IPO.  It was five years ago yesterday.  That's right.  Exactly. Five years.  So we're from eighty five dollars to four hundred forty five dollars.  Mind you, I bought it at five twelve.  So never follow a stock for me.  He's still waiting for it to come back any day now.  At the same time that Google went up four hundred twenty percent, the NASDAQ, get ready, get your heckerships out, is up eight percent.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, wow.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But Goldman Sachs just issued a good report on Google and put a target price of five sixty versus the present four forty five.  So four twenty, that's the number of the week.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Five twelve is where Jeff is.  I own no Google stock.  I'm going to say that right up front.  My tool.  Yeah.  My tool of the week is something that I don't actually use because while I have an Android phone, I'm not a big Android user, but I'm sure Gina would like this is called Google.  Listen, did you did you see this?  This is a podcatcher.  Now, I didn't realize this.  I was reading Kevin your biography and I didn't realize how involved you were in the early days of iPodder and and podcasting.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that's I.  I am I think I was the did the first demo of downloading a podcast onto it onto an actual iPod.  I did that at the first blogger con.  There's this video of that up.  So and it was it was like Gina's tool.  It was this horrible command line thing that you ran and it would go and pull stuff and then stuff it into into iTunes and you had to plug iTunes into sync it.  But I couldn't understand it at all.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You tried it.  You were seeing no idea what he was talking about.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Fortunately, Apple then did it and made it work.  So that was that was good.  But yeah, I'm excited about that because I've got the Android.  The trouble is the Android doesn't have a phone out an audio out jack.  He's only got a USB, which is worse.  That's upsetting.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I know.  So in fact, the G2 doesn't even have a standard jack.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, I think the tour does, though.  Does the tour?  I think the newest one is supposed to.  We'll see.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  We have to go like Liam and go all digital for our audio, which is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Anyway, Google, listen, it's in the marketplace and you can download it.  And I did download it and install it.  I have to say, I mean, it works well.  It does exactly what you'd expect it to do.  It has a little play button down here.  You can subscribe.  You have a listen to you.  You have a subscription queue.  You have searches.  And this is kind of interesting.  And I'd like to sure get on this list, the popular searches list, which is really kind of like Twitter trends.  I mean, it's very timely.  You know, you've got Hurricane on here.  Quentin Tarantino, GDGT.  I don't know exactly how PS3 Slim.  So I guess they're somehow looking at maybe show notes or or tags or something and seeing what people Brett Favre.  I mean, do you do I get them the Brett Favre podcast?  I don't know. I get no.  I get a bunch of podcasts that I guess refer to Favre.  So this is a way to follow.  This is actually a very interesting use of podcasts that I hadn't really anticipated to follow trending topics by listening to audio.  So I think they've done a nice job.  This is the and of course, this week in Google can be found and listened to with this new Android listen.  It's available in the marketplace and you can download it.  It's absolutely free.  And if you turn it up real loud, you don't need a headphone.  You'll just irritate everyone around you.  Let's bug everybody on the subway.  Now, this is a time and I would like you, if you want, Kevin, to pitch in where we wine.  This is the time of the show where we wine.  We complain, we bitch and moan about things that aren't being done better.  And actually, you I think you pinpointed one already.  Where's my three and a quarter inch Jack or whatever it is, three millimeter Jack.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Yeah. All of you Android makers out there in China put a three quarter.  Jack on there. We want one of those two. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Gina, do you have a complaint?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I have a little wish list item.  I was talking to Merlin Mann actually this week and Leo, you and I have complained about this together before Gmail filters.  I would like an easy way to say like add the person who sent me this email to this particular filter.  There was a grease monkey script that sort of kind of did it, but it doesn't work anymore.  I want Google to be able to manage our filters a little better and just say, you know, when this annoying PR person sends me another unsolicited press release, let me just add them to my black hole filter one click.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, that's to be honest, is the reason I don't use Gmail.  I think that they thought originally that threading and tagging would be sufficient, but I've got to have filters.  I really have to have filters and I have a very extensive list of filters.  I use I have fast mail is my I'm an I'm an provider and I use they have a sieve scripting language that is more powerful than any filtering tool and it's really good and I use it like crazy.  And I just don't know how anybody can use an email package that doesn't put things in folders.  It just because the search actually works.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  That's the difference. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I use search.  You know, this is this there's a philosophic.  There's two groups in the world, people who think they need hierarchy and people think search eliminates the need for hierarchy.  Can't we have both, Kevin? Why do we have to have one of the other?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course you can have both.  But, you know, the point is what I what I what I moved from Apple Mail to Gmail was that it was slower to search my own computer than to have Google do it in a data center, which is kind of weird.  But I guess they're good at it, you know.  And that's because I had that much that much email.  But the other half of this is, you know, when Virginia was giving me a tip just then, this was this is my point about flow again.  I really don't want unread accounts sitting there and nagging me all the time.  I'd much rather have stuff come by and if it's important to come by again.  And I've started treating email that way as well.  So if I don't respond to emails, it may just be that I'm waiting for it to just catch your attention at the time.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Kevin, you've confessed my secret sin. I've been doing the same thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, we need we need a like button on email.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Yeah, we have a star. We have a star.  But I read it, but I just didn't write you back.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I need an acknowledgement.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  I have a fatigue email button.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I have a new new bad habit where I flag emails that I should respond to and then I can leave them in a folder and ignore them even more easily.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think you have acknowledged them in your own mind.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I flagged them in my mind.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  And now I can ignore them.  The getting things done problem, right?  The getting things done problem is you write things down the list so they're not in your head.  Well, then they're in the list, they're not in my head and I forget about them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Then I lose the list and it's great.  Life is easy.  I think so, Gina, it was more than just putting in folders.  You want actions as well.  And that's really what filtering is about is actions.  Right. Not just not just filtering.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, I mean, they have filters and they do have actions.  I mean, you can say if this person writes, then send them this canned response.  The existing filters are decent.  I mean, there are some things that it can't do, but they're decent.  I want an easy way to append people to a filter.  I want an easy way to say, I've got an email from someone who I don't want to hear from anymore.  I always want to send to a label and I just want to be able to one click, say, here, add them to this filter I have already set up for mailing list.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's nice.  Oh, I'm sorry. I misunderstood.  That would be very handy.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, because the filters are pretty good.  If you add too many people to a filter, I've got this giant filter of PR people and you know, the more and you know, it's up to like 200 addresses and Gmail just kind of falls down.  Like I might probably resave it, edit it and resave it.  Gmail just says working, trying again, working and spins.  But so just easy, easier filter management or maybe more advanced filtering.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is really the solution is I never forget that Apple, that silly Apple knowledge navigator video that they made.  I want a computer that's smart enough to kind of know what to do with the email.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  You know, but that's been the myth for the last 30 years.  You know, that was it.  Paddy Mays was working on that at MIT.  Yeah.  God knows how long ago.  And the problem is that's the hard problem.  That's the really hard Turing test is like which stuff should I actually care about?  And the answer that is, well, what do other people care about that you press?  We paralyze it.  That's the answer that we've come up with.  It's like, OK, which news should I read?  I'm not going to delegate it to them.  I'm going to have a lot of sources and see what comes up out of it.  And, you know, email is naturally causes you trouble because anyone can send you.  Whereas all the total for saying that word by my son.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm going to bloop it so you can make him listen to the podcast afterwards and then it'll be better.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  But that's the piece that we have been solving with the social networks with Twitter.  And these things like I get to choose who gets to send me stuff.  And therefore there's a better chance of being stuff I'm interested in.  And you need some leakage.  You need some ability to see things that you haven't.  Yes, serendipity.  But you get that by following other people's opinions and giving them some way to reply to you with filtering.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The problem is I'm the only one who gets my email.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But the system doesn't even want to certainly watch you.  Well, part of what Marissa was saying this week at Aspen was if you follow this story,  you should get updates to the story to tell you that there's been a correction or there's something new.  And you have to go find it all the time, which is rather absurd.  So something just needs to be able to listen to you better and try and do better than Amazon does.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Well, Amazon has a really good signal because they have you actually paying the money.  That's a very strong signal.  It's like I did actually buy this book here.  So therefore you might like this one next to it.  Whereas that's a much stronger signal than I just happened to click on that email rather than the other one.  And the challenge is they haven't done that much even with that really strong signal.  They still say they still tend to give you the sort of mass market things everyone buys and things like that.  Because the real value is finding a set of other people that you want to filter things for you.  And each of you is choosing different sets of those rather than trying to do the global.  The global watch is the most important answer.  This result doing different kinds of local personal.  What's the right answer for this question?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Gina, I understand the Google Labs is working on a screw you button.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Really?  Are they?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It goes to Microsoft.com.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It goes to Microsoft.  Yeah, along with the goggles.  To go back to the search versus folders debate, I call it the filers versus the pilers.  Oh, that's good. I like that.  Yeah, I'm evolving from a filer to a piler.  No judgment on what's better, of course.  But I'm getting more into being a search, you know, searching my pile.  But I still filter things in a labels, Leo.  So I'm still with you on that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I just would like both.  Okay.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's reasonable.  Totally.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's no reason why I should have one or the other.  I should be able to do both.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Yeah, but also, I mean, the other thing is that it's the same problem of it works when you distribute it.  If you let other people see the results of your tagging and labeling, then that's creating information.  And that's useful so that you get a flicker or delicious rather than I photo where I have all these photos.  I haven't bothered to tag as opposed to flicker where everyone's been able to take photos for me.  So that becomes more useful.  I mean, and that's one thing that wave does have actually buried in there somewhere is the ability for anyone to tag the different pieces in there and label it and those propagate through.  So that piece is that that's one thing that Google has done in wave that I haven't seen in other parts of the system.  And obviously, you need to be careful about this because the way you tag email is very, very relevant to you.  And if if Gina is tagging the PR person with Bozo, he just he doesn't want that propagating back to them.  But I don't.  Well, you might.  I might.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Like when Leo files.  Screw you label and Leo's and Leo's account.  That's what I want to see.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Any other whines, moans, complaints?  I this is actually a fun part of the show because I just want to like Google wave invite.  Yeah, we still want to.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I got this is a wish list, which is a little more hopeful than the like complainy whining complaining.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, Merlin Mann would call it the wines.  But you're so positive, Gina, we'll call it our wish list.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  In that case, I want to have a pizza.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, that's not a wine.  That's a wish.  I understand completely.  Kevin Marks, so glad that you could join us today.  Kevin's blog is well, the easiest thing.  Go to Kevin Marks dot com and then he links to various things.  Is that what you would prefer people do?  Then to go to Epi.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  I think if you search for Kevin Marks on Google, I'm the top result.  Well, the top page, but the top result is my blog.  That works.  There you go. Google Kevin Marks.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That was easy. Kevin Marks dot com.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  I need to update a bit because I haven't really touched that.  It's the usual problem of the the the cobbler children's shoes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's I thought it was funny that you Kevin Marks dot com,  which would nominally be your hub, is really just a Google Friend Connect demo  more than anything else.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  That's because that's what I started using it for.  Yeah. Is it?  Oh, yeah.  But Frank, I started playing with it with that.  That's true. I don't tend to use it.  The blog is the blog is the place that people link to with the words Kevin Marks on.  So that's the place that it's been me for since I started in 2001.  So that's that's the place where most of my stuff ends up one way or another.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's the only the only negative and I'm just going to point it out is that if I say go to Kevin's blog,  Epi is a pig and eat a blog spot dot com.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  It pays EPUS.  What does it pay us mean?  It was the guy, the engineer who actually built the Trojan horse.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  See, you know, everybody should know that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's so Kevin.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  At the time, at the time I started, I was this anonymous engineer inside Apple building,  building interesting stuff and nobody knew who I was.  So you were the guy.  That was where that was. That was where that came from.  So in a pig in a piggy. What does that mean?  That means someone who copies them an emulator.  And it was it was at the time you make up an alias, you think I'm going to do this anonymous blogging thing.  And after about a month, I thought, no, this I need to put my name on this.  And I put my name on it. And now if you search for me, that's what you find.  Good. So which is fine. That's it. Right there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Go there. Buzz machine dot com.  Now that I know what it means. That's Jeff Jarvis. Jeff, thank you so much for being here.  Thank you. Next week, Gina Turpani is at Smarterware dot org.  Everybody go to GitHub and download Twitterlytics.  Ah, thank you, Leo. I can't wait to. I'm really excited.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I can't wait to try it. I'm scared it's not going to work for you.  You know, you I will give one on one support to Leo. It'll work.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It'll work. I like I like messing around with my server.  The thing is, when I put stuff like that on my server, I always put it on like the Twitter server, the big production server and bring it down.  And then everybody gets mad at me. Everybody gets mad.  What did you do? Oh, I just I don't know. I put some random code on there. Is that a problem?  I just ran a cron job every 15 seconds. Isn't that what you said to do?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Be sure to read all the disclaimers in the read me. Yes, I will. I will.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You think I'm joking, but but my sys admins know I'm not.  This is exactly the kind of thing I do. Thank you. That was the root. I started with root.  I gave them root. They said, can you can you just let's let's use a sudoers file and you could be a sudoer, not a root.  So no. And you were like, no root. Not only that, I've got SSH automatically logging into root.  So I just I just SSH right in there.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  With great power, Leo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Thank you, everybody. It's great to see you. Great to have you listening.  Make sure you listen. When we do the show live, it's always fun to watch.  We now we've moved the time to 5 15 Eastern Time to 15 Pacific on Saturday afternoons at live dot twit dot TV.  But of course, you can use I wonder if there's any of Kevin Mark's code still in iTunes.  Wouldn't that be funny? Little iPod in there.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  It's I never worked on iTunes. I doubt there's any code.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Did you write it in Python or Shell? What did you write it in?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  I read it already in Python on my own machine and I probably haven't got the code anymore for that thing.  There's still probably still some of my code out there in QuickTime.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There you go. I'm sure there is on that. Thank you all for being here.  We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You
