It's time for Twig this week in Google.  A show that's all about Google, but not just Google.  The Facebook, the Cloud,  Twitter and all that stuff.  Of course, Gina Trapani is here from ThinkUp.com.  Founding editor at Lifehacker.  Hello Gina, host of All About Android.  Android Guru.  Also, Jeff Jarvis has the day off.  He's traveling, right?  He's in one of those travel loops that he gets in every once in a while.  It is a loop though.  He flies to New York, to Germany, then back.  And then New York, Bahrain, then back.  I mean, he's like, it's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's a travel animal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But he'll be back next week, I think.  I won't. I'll be in London next week.  So, yeah, I'll take a week off.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm excited.  But look who's replaced Jeff.  This is great.  Danny Sullivan is here from Search Engine Land.  Hey Danny.  Hey.  He is obviously a skateboarder and a Twitter, a tweeter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm well known.  Tony Hawk is always saying, dude, come on over.  Really?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's pretty awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow.  I bought it.  You should have rolled with that, Danny.  He doesn't live too far from you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's in San Diego, I think.  That would be pretty cool.  I actually did take a few skateboarding lessons because I felt like I should.  But I'm not very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You live in San Diego.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think everybody's supposed to skateboard there.  Yeah, we should all be doing that in Southern California.  But it's actually like, it's a Google skateboard that they have.  Oh, that's neat.  See it.  See it.  So I like the logo that was on it.  And I did like that it was a skateboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a Bing snowboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that a Bing board?  Oh, sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have a lot of board meetings in California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Being very fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you can never see the Bing behind me.  So people are like, you got all that Google stuff.  But that was like a big, you just can't see the logo.  So there you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, I got a little something in the mail today I'm a little bit excited about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, is that the watch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I did order the watch.  I think it comes later next week or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you got the Moto X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the phone, baby.  Oh, I saw that.  Do you want to do a little mini unboxing?  Actually, I already opened it up.  So it's not exactly an official unboxing.  Let's do it anyway.  So I chose the cognac leather back.  Nice.  It is nice.  And it actually, it really does smell like leather.  I mean, it's got that leathery smell to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, the dimples in it really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the dimples changed a little bit, but it's still there.  I think it's very attractive and the the flash is in the ring, although it's not a two tone flash or anything like that.  It's just a dual flash and a metal.  Now, for the first time, a metal rim all the way around it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a good looking phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's really gorgeous.  Now, compare it to the this is the iPhone 6 and you can compare the two there.  They're similar in size.  The iPhone 6 is 4.7 inches, which what the old Moto X was.  So this is obviously a little bit larger than the old Moto X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow, they actually don't look that different.  Although the iPhone has those nice those kind of shiny edges there.  I don't know the way the glass sort of bends.  Oh, I love that.  It's rounder.  But this has rounded glass, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this must be a new technique that everybody's doing.  So this has the the glass.  It's edge to edge glass or it feels like it is.  I think it is.  And then it's rounded at the edge, which it would have to be.  Otherwise, it would cut you.  Just a little touch.  This is the on off button and the volume rocker on the same side.  So to distinguish between the two, you can't see it.  But they've they've scored the on off switch.  You can easily.  It's like the edge of a dime.  You can easily tell when you're on the on off switch as opposed to the volume rocker.  That's nice.  I think that's a nice little touch.  And of course, it's the talkie the talkie version.  And you can this time program it so I can say hello Moto X.  Hey, what's happening?  How you doing?  Instead of OK, Google now now and now says, you know, you can say whatever you want.  And that's boring to say hello Moto X.  I should probably make it say something else like was the.  So, yeah, I mean, it's it's 1080 1080p now.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Accessibility turned on to work properly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, OK, OK, OK, thank you.  It's talkative little.  It's I forgot what I was going to say.  1080p screen and the 13 megapixel camera, which is still not as great as the iPhone  but better.  Do you mean after all of after all the iPhone hype, Gina, now you're really solidly  in the Android camp.  You have to be.  Do you miss it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  The thing that I missed about it, miss about it.  And I talked about this on all that Android last night is I still have this creeping  feeling that the iPhone camera is better, that the photos are better  without with less effort.  In fact, Lisa Bettany just did a post, did a great post side by side photos  and different lighting situations in every model of the iPhone.  And I got to tell you, the six photos, particularly like when she zoomed in on detail  in low light, they were amazing.  You know, like the OnePlus camera is OK.  I'm not a photographer.  I just want to press the button and get a good photo every time.  I'm not messing with settings.  I'm you know, but I take, you know, a dozen photos, a dozen shots every single time  and hope that one of them comes out comes out well.  And I got to tell you, I think that the iPhone still has like a better producing  quality photos.  And we were talking about this last night and it was like, why is this happening?  And I think it's because, you know, Apple makes the hardware and they make the software.  And I think from day one, Apple just prioritized the camera in a way that  that Android didn't partially because Google wasn't doing the hardware manufacturing.  So that's the only thing that makes me want an iPhone.  I'll be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's an important thing because I think many people consider this their camera  more than their phone even.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I have a small child and I think to myself, like, are the photos that I have  of my daughter when she's a baby, you know, should should they be better?  You know, 20 years from now, am I going to hate myself?  Retroactively for not having a better camera on me because I barely get out the DSLR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Lisa Bettany, who's of course a friend of the networks and a pro photographer  and the author of Camera Plus, which is the one of the number one camera apps on the iPhone  had all the iPhones and took roughly the same picture with all of them, which is about  I think seven different or eight different devices.  It's amazing that she had eight working iPhones for one thing.  But it's really valuable to see how they have improved.  But even more than that, in the industry, there's a company that makes software for  Lightroom called DXO Mark, and they've become very well known for their acuity testing of cameras.  I think they're they're widely trusted.  DXO Labs, they're called and it's DXOMark.com.  They gave the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus the highest rating of any mobile phone on the market.  The next one up is the S5, then the Xperia Z3, then the Z2, then the Nokia 808 PureView,  which is that 41 megapixel camera.  So they, I mean, even better than the 1020, which is kind of middle of the pack.  So now people will argue this with you.  In fact, whenever I say I think the iPhone camera is the best camera, the Nokia people jump  up and say, you're wrong.  But I mean, even DXOMark, based on clarity, based on color accuracy, exposure and contrast,  accuracy of focusing, all the things that you care the most about, said it's really,  really good, especially good in low light, I mean, compared to other cameras.  So yeah, I miss that.  Actually, I don't miss it because I have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was going to say you have it, so I'm curious to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wish it were in the Moto X because then I wouldn't need an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, right.  So that's the 6 or the 6 Plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the 6, which is really what people should buy.  The 6 Plus is like clown shoes.  It's too big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And apparently it bends like clown shoes as well, which is another issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So only the Plus bends?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think they're both bendable because it's metal and it's thin.  71 millimeters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The 6 would be more likely to bend because it's just so much larger.  Exactly.  I mean, if I put the 6 Plus in my back pocket, first of all, someone's just going to steal it  because it's just sticking out of the back pocket, but also it's just going to crush  if I were stupid enough to sit down on it, but to whereas other phones that are a little more compact,  they probably slide around and work out okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and this comes up because iPhone users have had a little phone that you could put in your back pocket  and all of a sudden they have this giant phone and they haven't changed their habits much.  So get a man purse or a woman purse and put it in there because otherwise you're going to squish it.  And I would say the 6 even will be prone to that a little bit.  It seems to bend right where the battery ends internally and the volume rockers begin.  That seems to be a very particular inflection point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that makes sense, right?  The iPhone 6 is a good looking phone.  It reminds me of the HTC One that I made a little bit, that band across the back I really like.  Doesn't it look like that?  But it's thinner.  Yeah, and it looks really thin.  So you got the Moto X and you got the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought the Moto X was the best phone of the year last year,  even though it didn't spec-wise compete with some of the other really high-end phones,  including the ones that we use, the OnePlus One.  But I always felt like the Moto X was my phone.  The other ones were ones I was using, but this was my personal phone.  And I think it's going to be the same with this one, especially since it smells like a men's club.  Not the high-end kind, not the sleazy kind.  It smells like leather chairs and cigars.  Gentlemen's club.  That's even worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's bad too, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They spoiled the name, Gentlemen's Club.  And I like the speech features on the Moto X.  Sorry, I'm going to have to change it to Jarvis.  Although that won't work either.  And now they've got infrared sensors on the corners,  so when it's doing the sleep thing, you can wave over it.  Here, I'll put it to sleep and I'll show you.  So it's sleeping the screens off, but if I wave over it, it'll show me the time,  and if I have any notifications, they'll be available as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does it not do...  I read that it doesn't do the sort of always-on fading thing though.  Is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't. It waits until you wave at it, which I think is actually the right thing.  All right.  It's easy to wave at it.  It used to be it would pulse up and down, up and down.  And I imagine that would kill the battery life somewhat.  I don't know about battery life because I literally just got it hours ago.  One thing I'm a little concerned about, and maybe somebody in the chat room or somebody watching can fill me in,  last year, Motorola, they had this Motorola Skip, which was an NFC tag,  either on a sticker or a little leather thing you could put on your pocket,  and you could tap a locked Motorola phone to the skip and say,  that one I want to unlock.  Either my skips are broken or it doesn't work with skip anymore.  I notice it's not in the copy anymore.  They may have turned that off.  You can still pair with trusted Bluetooth networks, which is really great.  And if you have the Moto 360, I'm thinking that's probably one of them.  So you could say, as long as we're in proximity, I'm unlocked.  I'm not sure that's a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's nice. That's really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because locking's a pain, and you'd like to use a strong lock instead of just a swipe.  So if it's easy to unlock with a tap, then that would be pretty cool.  Screen looks good. Not great. Good.  It's a Super AMOLED, like last year.  But again, higher resolution.  You know, the jury's out. We'll see.  I just got it.  I'm going to London with both it and the iPhone 6.  Both will be on T-Mobile because T-Mobile offers unlimited international calling and text,  as well as 2G data for free.  Oh, right. So you got the 6 unlocked, so you can pop in your T-Mobile card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't. I got the Verizon 6, but it turns out you can pop in your T-Mobile card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, that was the same thing that happened with me with the iPhones,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  was that I was really surprised that I bought the T-Mobile unlocked,  and I put my AT&T card in, and that worked fine, which is what I expected.  But then I threw my Verizon SIM into the T-Mobile iPhone,  and now LTE and data and that's all working as well.  Yeah, I remember you reading about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, you were the one who inspired me to do it.  And the reason is that the new iPhones have all the bands  and Verizon's doing voiceover LTE.  And so everything now is, we're not in the day,  we're rapidly moving out of the bad old CDMA versus GM SIM days.  Yeah.  Thank goodness.  That's such a difficult thing to explain to like family members and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was like, no, no, that's a different thing.  You need this thing.  I was like, what?  So, you know, mental maps of what carriers are what,  and normal people don't know that and they shouldn't have to.  So, due to an FCC ruling when Verizon acquired the LTE bands,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they're required to not lock their SIM slot.  So the Verizon phone can be used with a SIM from,  at least from AT&T and T-Mobile as well as Verizon.  And also from international companies.  And also from international carriers,  I think because you've got every band in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and that was the other things.  I took my old Verizon phone, which was on my iPhones.  I had my iPhone 5S, which was for Verizon.  So I threw my AT&T card into that,  which I'd never done before and that completely opened up and it was fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I was able to get LTE on T-Mobile on the Verizon,  which is new that you couldn't do that before.  And we'll see how it works in Europe, you know, or in England anyway.  Yeah, so travel wise, I'm set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you are.  I want to see some photo comparisons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You will.  Yeah, that's one of the things I'll very likely do.  I'm also bringing a good camera.  And that's the other side of it is, while I do use the camera phone a lot,  if I'm serious about where I am, I'm going to take a good camera with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  All right.  So that's the story of the Moto X.  They did start shipping.  I'm sorry, I changed the name.  And the Moto 360, they are back in stock and those are also shipping,  I think next week.  And I did order the Hint, which is their standard Bluetooth earbud,  but it's designed to do some extra stuff.  I think it's touch free with Moto X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, so when does that come?  Didn't get that yet.  I want to call it the Her.  I do do.  I'm going to say, oh, maybe I should say hello, Scarlett.  What was her name?  I forget now.  Samantha.  Sam.  Samantha.  Yeah.  No, that might borderline a little creepy if you call the phone Samantha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would like it because actually, if it had Scarlett's voice,  because I don't know how you feel.  Siri's voice I've gotten used to, but the Moto X Google voice is strident.  I'll give you an example.  Let's get out of this.  Let me think.  What am I going to do here?  Hello, Moto X.  What's the weather in Petaluma?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unlock your phone to continue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just a little, I don't know, a little strident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's 78 degrees and overcast in Petaluma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Siri just seems nicer.  You disagree?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you agree?  No, no, the voice is, it's still a little robotic.  I think it's difficult to get it, you know, kind of softer,  but I haven't used Siri in a really long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you want to hear Siri these days?  I think she's sounding a little bit better.  I forgot what I do to start.  I have to press the button.  By the way, I have to be careful on the shows now  because if people have their iPhone hooked to the power  and you say, hey, Siri, it will actually wake her up  and she'll start doing stuff.  How long is the Golden Gate Bridge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Golden Gate Bridge is 8,981 feet long.  Long?  Long.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Long.  She seems friendlier.  Yeah, yeah, she does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Interesting, and our voice is a little lower.  Now we've got to get Cortana into the mix, but I won't.  I actually like Cortana's voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My Windows phone is in the other room, so I can't.  But I actually like, you have it?  There goes Danny.  There goes Danny.  I can upgrade the voice on this.  I can download better sound.  So you need to have celebrity voices, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Back to TomTom, I used to have great celebrity voices

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  on my TomTom.  My TomTom 1 version sounded great

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because you could put your own voice  and I had my kids do all the turns.  So they'd be like, go forward, make a U-turn.  Daddy, go forward, daddy.  Actually, whenever I would have to do that,  actually, whenever I would have to do the U-turn,  because that was usually a sign that I was lost,  it would say, my wife would go,  instead of saying, make a U-turn,  it would say, why don't you pull over  and ask directions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's good, I like it.  So let's hear Cortana. You got Cortana?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you want her to say?  I don't know if you'll be able to hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it doesn't have a speaker?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but I don't know if you can hear it through my headset.  Oh, just put it right up there.  Hang on, hang on. Here we go.  How long is the Golden Gate Bridge?  How long is the Golden Gate Bridge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like the musical tone.  It'll take six hours and 51 minutes

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  to drive to Golden Gate Bridge.  Did you hear that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It says it'll be six hours to drive there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not too long. Let's go.  It doesn't sound at all like Cortana in the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They should have gotten Cortana from Halo  to voice...  I'm so disappointed because I love Cortana in Halo.  And I know this is a different Cortana,  but I wanted the voice to be the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ask Cortana what she thinks of Siri.  Does she say anything about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She does a whole series of things that she does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's one thing that both iPhone and  Apple and Microsoft do is  there's some personality.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What do you think about Siri?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hard to say.  So far our conversations have been kind of one-sided.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's great.  There's inflection.  Of course, that was pre-recorded.  That's another thing that Microsoft is doing, which is intelligent.  These canned speeches,  and this is obviously one,  are treated differently than synthesized speeches.  So that sounded great.  That sounded great.  Morgan Freeman would be good.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, well. Someday. Ask who Bill Gates is married to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who is Bill Gates married to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bill Gates is currently married to Melinda Gates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't like that curly part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like, you know, right now this is the answer.  Whoa, I'd fix that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd fix that.  I would fix that.  Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jiminy Christmas.  Well, we don't know what's going to happen in the future,  but right now...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right now things are good with Bill and Melinda.  Who is your father?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Technically speaking, that'd be Bill Gates.  Oh, yeah.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But again, you heard all that inflection.  Technically speaking, those are pre-recorded, obviously.  They're not synthesized.  That's fun.  All right, enough.  You notice one thing.  Both Danny and I got kind of speaker's block  when we have to think of what to say.  What should I say?  What should I ask her?  I think that's kind of a problem with these systems in general.  Do either of you use voice a lot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been using it more if I have something complicated  and I want to annoy my wife.  She's like...  It's always like, blah, blah, blah, blah.  It doesn't do it.  She's like, just type it in.  But no, like I was doing it yesterday  and I was trying to look up something  and I just spewed off a whole bunch of things  and it came up with it.  I think this was on Google's Google Play.  Google Now.  If it's something complicated  and I think I'm in a quiet environment  and I just want a quick answer,  I use it a lot more for  commands that I'm really confident will work.  It's very rare for me to  set my alarm clock by hand.  I set the alarm for 6 a.m.  That's a great example.  You will get 2 hours and 25 minutes sleep.  It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree.  Timers and reminders.  We're watched to do that.  Those are really good examples  of something you can do much more quickly  with voice than you could do.  Searches and things like how do I get here?  I guess navigation is pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Navigation is good.  I do it while I'm cooking,  while my hands are wet or covered in breadcrumbs.  Set a reminder, how many cups in a whatever.  That kind of thing.  But not as much as I thought I would.  I thought the watch would make me do it more.  I really just still use the watch  to get the instructions and dismiss them.  But I have friends who love it  and reply to text messages  and do the voice commands from their watch a lot more.  I feel a little bit like a doofus.  Maybe that's just me being too self-conscious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think you're not alone.  I think that's part of the issue, isn't it?  That's one of the things holding  all of this stuff back.  The voice interface is such a public thing.  Last night we saw  a new movie called The Drop  and I really liked the actor in it  but I didn't know who it was.  So I used Siri and it worked quite well.  I said, Siri who stars in The Drop?  She told me.  One of the names was Tom Hardy.  I said, Siri who is Tom Hardy?  She read his Wikipedia article,  including what movies he'd been in.  That was a very nice, very convenient interaction  that worked quite well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think Siri is much better, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  During a movie that you were watching?  Yeah, I got a few cat calls.  It's a popcorn thrown at me.  Excellent movie.  Not what you think.  It's a really, really good movie.  Really, really good movie.  One of the reasons I wanted to know who the lead was  is because he's so good  in this movie.  Here comes Google 2.0.  According to Larry Page  in the future Google will build  cities and airports.  That's the headline in The Verge.  Anyway.  The information.  I am actually a subscriber.  Instead of doing the meta reporting  I should actually log in.  The information thing? Yeah, that was good.  The problem with the information  is that it's 400 bucks a year  and a lot of people don't subscribe to it.  All that happens is the Verge just repeats it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I kid you not.  My renewal thing for the information  is on my screen.  It must have been a year  because we need you to renew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I renew.  I think that deserves our support.  I think they do a great job.  Is it $400 worth great?  $400 a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a pretty...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Especially since you can read pretty much everything  or listen to Twitter  because I regurgitate.  Amira Frati who has excellent contacts  at Google  wrote the piece.  Google 2.0

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What does this mean?  Google is going to build cities  and airports.  Many times I've been sitting on the tarmac  wishing that Google could point its  smarts at making  airports more efficient.  I just don't know what that would look like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe they could just make the security check point  more efficient. Maybe after you put your  thing through the thing they could split into two  areas. I mean, god.  Let's redesign the entire airport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This comes... Amira  and his co-author,  Hunter Walk have combined  a variety of sources. This is an  interview they did with him.  But what I thought was kind of interesting  this Google 2.0 thing  which is absolutely happening  Paige cleared out space on  his floor. He has his own floor.  At Google headquarters  to oversee a series of workshops  run by Google's  Vice President of Business Operations  Kristen Gill.  Apparently  this feels like there might  be between Larry and Sergey  something going on because  Sergey basically runs Google X.  That's his R&D lab.  Apparently Larry  wants to start his R&D  lab that he would oversee personally.  Some call it Google Y.  I wonder  if it's like, Larry's getting all the fun  projects. I need my own.  That does not bode well for a company  when you've got the two founders  not feuding exactly, but  in a rivalry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and for listeners it's not Y, W, H, Y  although you might ask that.  That would have been good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google Y?  I didn't read it so much like, oh, Sergey  gets to have all the fun with Google X. I want to have  Google Y so I can have fun.  I read it more like, Google X  is doing these really long term things  that are going to immediately change stuff.  So Google  Glass is still  lurking out there, but that's probably the closest  thing that you have to a dramatic change  that a consumer might do. But isn't Glass

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  even Sergey's thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but that would fall under Google.  Yeah, I think it's still under Google  X. I could be wrong though. It might have migrated  out. But the auto driving  cars, you know,  we're like five years, ten years  away from that really being a type of thing.  My impression from the article was that  Larry would like to have a Google Y to make  moon, maybe not moon shots, but  I don't know, several orbital shots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Shorter moon. So Google X  is on a ten year time frame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but the idea, although  redesigning airports is not exactly  something that happens tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but I don't know. It sounds like  this is even longer term programs than Google X.  It sounds to me like Larry  is just obsessed with different problems than Sergey  is. Have we seen Larry  wearing Glass in public?  I mean, that's always been a Sergey thing. Even with the  IOs, the different years were led  by different founders and we heard a lot from Glass  and Sergey was wearing Glass and we had the crazy demo  with the skydivers  and then the next year it was run by Larry  and it was a lot different. We didn't hear a lot about  that and he did the Q&A. It's kind of a different  tone. I hope it's not a  competition and more just  these are just two different people with sort of different  ideas of what the long term  problems to focus on are. Although maybe  they're not on the same page.  That's a bad thing.  I don't know. Well, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If they have different portfolios, different goals  then it's not a rivalry.  It's complementary.  And maybe that's it.  A Friday writes, some of the Google  2.0 workshops fizzled.  Say people briefed about the event  or the effort. One involved Mr.  Page's desire to build up a subscription business  so that Google wouldn't be so dependent  on advertising. You know, paid Gmail  for instance. Page even discussed  with colleagues the notion that ad supported  services can sometimes be lower  quality than paid offerings.  I guess Google Apps is a paid offering.  That would be the example. The problem of course is paid services  have smaller reach.  And a Friday, Amir writes  and Google's all about reach.  Another Google 2.0  project involved location.  Larry determined that Google in the  future should know a person's precise location  down to the inches. Not just that they're  in a particular room or store. That way  people might be able to know who else is in a room  with them. This is what  Apple's iBeacon does by the way.  It describes exactly where you are in the room  and that's useful for merchants because  they can have different things triggered on  your phone depending on what you're standing in front of.  But by knowing which  aisle a person was at inside  a store for instance, Google could  potentially provide helpful information to the shop  about what's there. This is exactly what iBeacon does.  Google could also let people pair  their smartphone with another device.  Ads information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, I got some information for you.  You want a pizza?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't want that pizza.  You've already got pizza at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a great article.  An interesting article.  New airports. He thinks that for  instance, ELOP's plan to create a  hyperloop railroad between  San Francisco and LA so that instead of  6 hours and 3 minutes to get here, Danny  could be here in seconds.  He thinks that's a terrible idea. But he says planes work.  Why don't we have better airports, better flights?  Afrati writes in the comments  it didn't make the cut but Larry Page also thinks  Wall Street is broken.  Maybe a better way to do finance.  That's obvious, right?  When you got a lot of money and you got a lot of power  and both these guys do,  I think it's appropriate for them to think about it  as long as they don't stray too far  from the business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They stray all over from the business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  I guess the business runs itself nowadays, right?  Google 1.0 is fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It depends on how you define the business, right?  The auto driving cars don't make a whole lot of sense.  They're not the business, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Autonomous vehicles are not the business.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they'll pour the money into it.  The business sadly is still  largely people do these searches  and they click on these ads.  I don't mean sadly because that's much as it does.  It's a good business. Search ads.  I always joke every now and then on Twitter  that all those self-driving cars  are being paid for by Mesothelioma ads.  That's what's bringing you to the future.  That's what's bringing you to the future.  That and structured settlement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who knows what else?  That's true in any business.  We have our bread and butter shows  and those subsidize the newer shows  that are not yet making any money.  That's how businesses work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I reinvest 75%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We just did another  article yesterday looking at  the arbitrage stuff that goes on  with Google and say Ask.com.  Ask.com CEO is about to run a  counter saying no it's not like that.  But you search for  something on Google like what is  Mesothelioma or something and you get  these ads from other sites like  Ask that when you click on them,  jump you from Google search results to their  search results which  have more Google ads on  and it's all this sort of like  there's a lot of money being made  off of stuff that is still very  cruddy and  yet it goes further  up the chain into producing these things  that seem very all pure and all  clean or whatever.  I'm perhaps too jaded or perhaps  it's just that I've been watching too much of The Wire.  I'm in the middle of the series  so everything is very depressing to me right now.  Which year are you in right now?  Which season are you in?  I'm literally in the middle of season 3 like  episode 5 or something.  Was that the school one?  I don't know they just moved everybody into  Hamsterdam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh Hamsterdam.  Okay alright.  Because there's the boats  season 2, the first season  is the yeah yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought the third season was school but maybe  the fourth season is school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then the newsroom is the last one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm waiting for the newsroom so I knew that's coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No but Hamsterdam, that's a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hamsterdam is a great one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That might be the best year.  However  now everything you're going to say is going to be  filtered through that so now I understand.  I'm glad you gave us the disclaimer.  That's a great show.  Alright let's take a break. When we come back  obviously, when we come back we're going to  do the changelog.  Find out more, there's lots more going on at  the Google.  Okay so Glen  who is our TV expert here, Glen Rubenstein  in the  network says that season  4 is the  best year. I didn't like the newspaper  season.  But Glen says that season 4 is  the one to look forward to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the school one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that the school one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that the school one? The school one broke my heart. Anyway.  Oh no god no spoilers.  Sorry sorry sorry.  No spoilers. Season 4, season 3

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is the second best.  Season 4. So you're in for two  excellent seasons.  According to Glen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is Glen at home or is he over there typing?  He's over there? Alright.  Which is, nevermind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Our show today.  Okay you have time. Go wikipedia  while I talk about treats for your dog.  You don't have a dog do you?

Right. You have Ozzy.  Me. But you know I love him. So it's  okay. It's okay.  BarkBox.  Sebastian Thrun  has left in his role as a Google  Vice President and fellow. He was  the founder of Google X.  And did some really  interesting stuff.  Including Udacity which was his online  learning startup.  And so apparently this has  been on his LinkedIn page since August but  somebody finally told TechCrush.  He does have an advisory  role in his LinkedIn  post. He says while I'm now just an advisor my  enthusiasm for Google X is as high  as ever. But you know I  figure with Udacity taking off  that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  made sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's his startup that he's working on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Google  spokesperson said as the co-founder  of Google X and our self-driving  car project, Sebastian made  huge advances in computer  science and robotics that have paved the way for  autonomous driving technology.  In his role as an advisor to Google X over the  past couple of years he's provided invaluable  inspiration and perspective at a variety  of projects. In Udacity, Sebastian  has his own more than a full-time  job, moonshot to take and  we wish him well. That's very nice.  That's a really nice farewell.  So obviously. That was a nice farewell. Yeah, obviously  the... It was all okay. It was all

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  good between them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're Google, this happens all the time.  This is normal, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean  when these stories happen people are like oh is something  wrong? You know, did something happen?  But I think it was in Stephen  Levy's book where he interviewed Marissa  Meyer who ran that  management program and she said we want people  who want to leave Google eventually because we hire  entrepreneurial types and  entrepreneurial types want to build their own thing.  It's kind of a problem that you're facing too, right, Leo?  To some degree. Yeah.  It's like the best people want, you know, the ones  who take initiative and want to do everything and want to do it their  way and this happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if you have this in the change log but  I'm glad Danny's here to explain it.  Structured snippets.  Oh yeah.  What are... They're now live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know that. I know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well I'm looking at a search engine land article.  Mr. Cotter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, oh, Mr. Cotter.  Okay, what are they?  Do a search for say  Wonder Woman on Google and  you will see that you get a description  that comes up. I'm looking ahead of time.  This one's coming from Wikipedia and you'll see  underneath it, not just are you getting a description  with more about Wonder Woman, but underneath  the description you discover her first  appearance, her alter ego,  who she was created by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why am I not getting this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're missing it.  Zoom right in on the very first listing.  Oh, first appearance.  It's tiny. Okay.  And so you can see this  for a lot of the superheroes.  Somebody was joking with me  on Twitter about how  is Google making sure that  if Google's listing everybody's alter egos, aren't they  revealing secret identities?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, spoiler alert.  Princess Diana of Themyscira.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But what Google is doing  is they are understanding that  from pages.  They have been doing over the past  year to two years now  understanding not just that you are searching  for words,  which are patterns of letters, but that  you are searching for people, places, and things  that are connected to facts.  And so this is Google saying, well,  we understand that Wonder Woman  actually has a thing known as an  alter ego, and in fact we know what that  fact is. We know when  she first appeared. And they're getting  that information by automatically extracting  it from web pages.  Is it all from Wikipedia?  It's not just from Wikipedia.  You can see it from like,  try like Nikon,  the producer for Nikon D7100.  And then you should see like the  third or second listing.  You'll see that it pulled off of this page, like  the sensor resolution type, the weight of the battery,  the display size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's in the page  related, so this is a DP review  article where they do list these kinds of specs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you look at the page, you will probably  find that these facts are on there.  But these facts may be also extracted  from other pages, and Google's starting to  learn that these are facts  from doing extraction.  So it's all part of the stuff that Google has been  doing to have facts and  just present facts when you search.  Another example,  if you type in, this is  before, so what you're  seeing there with the Wonder Woman stuff,  that is structured data being inserted  right next to a listing.  But then other kinds  of things that are related to this, do search for like  reset iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of people doing that today, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How do I  reset  my iPhone? Let's see if that one does it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know,  is it better to do...  I was searching for something  today, and I couldn't find it  giving it just basically words. I think it was  Moto X, and then  I wanted to know if the skip worked in the...  So 2014 Moto X  Skip, and then I thought... Shut up.  And then I thought, maybe  if I say, does the skip  work with the 2014 Moto X  would be better? Is that  me, or is that a reasonable  thing to do with Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In the past, those kinds of searches weren't good  to do because  you're searching in a way that  somebody probably hadn't written it. Like,  how does people had written  stuff that way? They would just explain it.  Then the searches just got smarter, but then the  content farms got smarter and started writing all  the content designed for the people who were doing  those kinds of searches. And now what's happening  is Google itself has become smarter  and is understanding  this kind of conversational question  better. That it's understanding  how to parse it so that when you go in there and say  something like, how old is Barack Obama?  You know, it understands you're looking for  that person, you're looking for an age,  and in fact, that I have the exact  answer, and so I can provide it out to you and give it to you that way.  So that really changes...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're confirming  what I kind of have observed,  but it changes the way I had used to think  of a search engine. I used to really  think that the best way to get the  result you wanted would be to actually match  a string of text in the  page. And if you can't do  that, then to use, as I did originally,  skip, moto, 2014,  in any order, but  knowing that the best result would be  one that combined all three of those.  So kind of trying to out-guess what Google's going to  do with a query.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and so these days now, you don't have to try...  And that used to be good advice, and I  used to teach people on how to search,  and I would tell them,  you know, give them those kinds  of techniques, like try to think about the person who's  writing the material and how you think they would do it. But these  days, really just search however you  feel comfortable searching, and trust that the search  engine will probably figure it out.  To give you that other example, try to search for how to  reset iPhone again.  Yeah, in fact, I'm getting the answer  instead of the search result.  You get a big box with steps, yeah.  That's another example of  structured data and direct answers.  It's also, and this goes a bit  further, this is becoming a concern for the  content owners, right?  I was just about to say that, because I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  have to now click on this link at iMore.com.  I got what I wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. And so,  you know, as Google's  doing more of this, you've got content  owners that are thinking like,  hey, you know, is this  going to steal traffic away from me?  And, you know, and you're  giving me credit, but  in the past, people were happy  to be lifted by Google because they clearly  got lots of traffic, because there wasn't  enough just given away for free.  And so that's part of the debate that's going on  in this structured, I want to say structured  settlement, but these structured snippets  are perhaps more of that.  You don't necessarily need to go to those  pages if you were looking for some of this information.  You just did the Google search and you were done.  And well, you know,  that debate's going to continue on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I understand what Google's thinking is here, though,  because they're trying to serve  their customer. And if a customer  says, how do I reset an iPhone?  And you know the answer, you should  just put it there. And agreed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And if they can provide it, that's great.  The problem is they're trying to serve their customer  even though they don't actually know anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  themselves. Oh, that's a good point.  I mean, they don't. They're serving them with somebody

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  else's content. They're serving.  And that is what their entire  business model has been built off of.  Right. And again, to go back  to those auto driving cars  and everything you want to go to  Google, the bulk of their funding  comes off the fact that  people search on Google and click on  ads and the content that surrounds  those search results comes  from other people. And those other  people have been happy to supply that because  the balance has been very favorable  for a lot of them. They get traffic that comes  back to them. But as Google starts to  say more and more, hey, you know what?  We don't even need to send you these websites. We  already know the answer. Here it is.  Yes, that's good for the user, but it's not so good  for the websites. And it hasn't  come along with Google necessarily  licensing that information from anybody.  Because Google's like, hey, that's just facts.  And this is what the publishers

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and Rupert Murdoch are upset about  is here I just search for how to  make jello shots. This, I'm telling you,  this is serving your audience right there  in a medium bowl, stir together  the jello and boiling water. This is like

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, this is the how to eat sushi  issue, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That wouldn't come up. I was trying  to get it to come up again so you could see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they killed it. They pulled it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's one how to make jello shots. There you go.  See, Leo, if you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  go to, you can see this  example. If you go to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You must have, I think Danny  spends a lot of time trying

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  queries. I want to know the  stuff I try. I always feel like I'm going to get  arrested for the things on my computer that I've  searched for.  It's terrible.  But do a  search for how to eat sushi and  then see if you find my article coming up.  Yeah, because you wrote about  So you'll do the search  on Google for how to eat sushi  and you should just get a set of search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do now. I get YouTube. I get WikiHow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I get them. Click on my listing  because my listing should be in there. It says like the  NSFW. Do you see  my article in those listings?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there it is.  NSFW advice on how to eat sushi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now scroll down a bit further  and you will see what Google was showing.  And you can see that when you read it,  the fourth tip  on how to eat sushi was like,  don't shake the soy sauce off. That's like  shaking your wanker in public.  Which isn't exactly correct  British English for shaking  your thing.  That's what they mean. And it's because  So you're like, really? Google?  You're kind of giving that advice.  It's not that bad. I've heard worse.  But the reason is  because that's not Google's advice.  That was Google extracting the advice  from someone else and offering it up  as a direct answer. And the concern  really is  down the line, if Google  just takes all the answers and isn't giving  enough back to support the sites that are producing  them, the sites that produce them no longer exist.  And guess what? Then Google has  no answers to provide.  Unless it just stores them all in some database.  But things change every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. People need to make content. How to change a flat tire.  And boom, boom, boom.  Everything is here. And I guess it comes  from DMV.org.  Because that's in the box. That means to be the original source.  That's their way of saying, well, if you want  to read more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I  agree. It makes a lot of sense.  Although DMV.org  is not the DMV.  It is just some  private website.  And in the past,  that site might have gotten a lot more  traffic from this.  Thank you.  Okay. Pull over.  Whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The amazing irony for me  about the structured snippets  is I've been a web developer for years  and years and it used to be that you used tables  to lay out your pages. And then everybody moved  away from that. You shouldn't use tables.  This is actually tabular data.  The structured snippets that they're pulling  out of the page.  So this Nikon D7100  page has a table with the  sensor resolution and the weight and the display size  and Google's figured out a way to  discard tables that are used for  formatting or not very interesting.  And pull in data tables that  are actually relevant and interesting. So it's like,  everybody put a table on their pages.  I feel like that's the takeaway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It can still do it even if things aren't  relevant. But that's true.  There used to be things you'd have to avoid with tables.  The issue with tables was more that  the search engines used to consider the  text higher on the page, more relevant than lower.  So when you'd use a table, the table  sometimes would break apart.  But that  hasn't been so much an issue.  It's kind of related is that for  a long time Google didn't want people doing  metadata. They're like,  we don't trust metadata. People lie. We don't  support the meta keyword tags. And these days  Google wants you to mark up behind the scenes  not just doing stuff with tables,  but also mark up your content  so they really understand it.  Okay, this page has  a review. This review has five  stars associated with this product  because you've marked all these sorts of things that are  up along with it from there. Wasn't this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the semantic web movement,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  this whole idea? Yeah, this is kind of like  the semantic web except a lot messier.  The original vision of the semantic web was that everyone  was going to have these amazing, perfectly structured  XML files with these  predefined standard relationships  and that anybody would be able to build an engine  and suck it all in and know everything about the world.  And that never happened. The reality  is that web pages are messy and they use  lots of different tags and Google's just gotten really  good at taking in anything  and figuring out what's important.  But it is the semantic  web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's this hybrid because in the  Tim Berners-Lee idea, exactly like  you say, that everything would be nice and neat  and that never happened. And not only  was it not nice and neat, but you had people  actively trying to be misleading  with their metadata.  So what Google has learned to do is both  take the structured semantic  data and  extract the data  even if it's not structured and add it  all up to decide when they want to trust  all that information together.  And they're doing all this sort of cross-checking  and trying to decide whether or not they consider  something to be a fact.  How old is Barack Obama?  Well, if we have a hundred different  places where we see his birth date, we feel pretty  good about that. So we'll calculate  it up from there.  And that's why we're finally seeing this kind of emerge  where you get these structured answers.  But it really is this slow  revolution in terms of what that means for publishers  as well. And no one really knows the answer  to it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Reverb Mike in our chat room says, this is just straight up plagiarism  using others' thoughts and ideas  without permission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to say, if you type into  Google, what is a scraper site?  That will  explain to you that it cannot  be plagiarism.  So you've got to type this in.  You've got to type this in, okay?  Type in, what is a scraper site?  And then the first thing you should  see is a thing at the top of Google search  results that say, a scraper site is a website  that copies content from other websites  using web scraping. Or effectively  plagiarizing it, right?  So scroll a bit further down, you should see  my article that says, tweet showing how Google itself  as a scraper site goes viral.  Click on that.  So what happened was  earlier this year...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my god, that definition  is scraped from Wikipedia!  So earlier this year,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Matt Kutz, good friend of the show,  he did this  tweet where he said,  hey,  if anybody spots scraper sites,  please let us know here at Google.  We want to try to wipe these things out.  We don't like it when people take content from other  people. So this guy named  Dan Barker tweeted back,  I think I've spotted one, Matt.  Note the singularity, scroll down.  He, it was like,  it's like up to 40,000 retweets.  I'd never seen anything like it.  Especially for a topic that is so,  so, so very  like, SEO oriented or whatever.  Oh my god.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm favoriting this tweet now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Me too. You'll join  3,873 other favoriters.  And 33,000  retweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I've spotted one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Note the similarities.  Wow.  It was a well executed tweet.  And it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but it really also  crystallizes that conflict between  the publishers and  Google taking their content and are you giving it back?  And then Google wanting to have rules  saying other sites shouldn't take content.  And, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say it's a very fine line that  Google walks. And  you know, and this is why they're being taken to task  in Europe  in some cases. And by why, you know,  if Jeff Jarvis would  remember last week he ranted  about the Murdoch  article about what Google's doing.  But I can understand that there is a position  from the content creators. Hey, wait a minute.  But if you don't want your

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  content to show up in these knowledge boxes,  quick answers, can't  you just disallow? I mean, isn't there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But then you're not in the search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But is that true, Danny? Are you either  in or you're out? But if you're in, they get to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  display however they want? That's part of the issue  that had been going on in Europe. And this  is where the publishers and especially  I think in Germany have just been  kind of going overboard.  They complain that they should  be in Google. They complain Google stole all  their content. Google's like, well, then don't be  in Google. No big deal.  But then they like complain, well, we want to be  in Google, but we don't want to be  in Google News. So then they finally got  Google to pressure them enough to say, OK, you can be  in Google News. You don't have to be in regular Google.  And then they like said, well,  even though they literally, even  though the law changed and they had  to choose to be in Google News,  they still said that we thought Google was using  too much of their stuff and they wanted  to be paid even more. And yeah,  the answer is you don't have to be in Google News.  You don't have to be in Google. You can  opt out of all this stuff. And they don't because  by and large, the mainstream publishers  get a ton of traffic for free

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  from Google. Well, and if you look at that Jell-O  Shots, there is a link to the rest of  that article and it is at the very  top. You are now number one on the search  result. So there is  a payoff in a way.  And there is that sort of stuff, but everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that's going on in Europe has nothing  to do with these sort of last two years  where the direct answer is because the  Europe thing is so old and it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so... They'll be suing about this  in a couple of years. Yeah.  Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. And I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  got to admit, when I'm on my phone and I want a quick  answer and I search for something, I  don't want to scroll through  a heavy page, just flash banner  ads. Well, isn't that what Siri's doing?  Yeah. Well, right. Exactly the same  thing. Yeah, this is exactly. And I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  all this... How do I make a Jell-O shot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think all this is correct, but  it is that key thing that  if Google is going to provide  answers and it's just  going to give the answers, is it going over  to the tipping point where it needs to actually  license that content?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't... Siri does not and should  read me the recipe.  It does give me the same  link, but not the  snippet.  It's interesting.  Interesting. Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Huh.  I have a hard time. I have a hard  time coming at it from the perspective of  the content providers  need to get paid. I get that  if the content providers aren't getting traffic, then they don't  produce the content and then the answers don't happen.  It's just it's hard for me to get out of the mindset of  this is obviously the best thing  for users. If your content...  If a lifehacker  tutorial steps were at the top of a page,  I would take that as a compliment. I would be like,  hey, Google's decided on the authority on this  topic. If someone needs to dig deeper, they're  going to click through.  That's okay. It feels like a free  chapter or the introduction of my book on Amazon.  It just kind of feels like that, you know, here's  a sample of what you'll get. But I know  that not a lot of people feel that way. And I know that this is  a tough... Things are changing a lot  and Google makes, you know,  one tiny change can change somebody's business.  Okay, Moto X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do I make a jello shot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where I would search for... It was like earlier this  year, I was searching for what is SEO and  they were listing the definition from our  page and our  link. And I was like,  wow, you're just going to take our definition  and then you're done.  And then it switched over later that year  where they took the definition from Wikipedia  rather than from us. And I was like, why  are you taking it from Wikipedia, not from us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, right, right. We got the authority on this.  What if Google... So there is some payoff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You get authority. What if Google  said, and we'll cut you a penny for everybody who reads  it or something like that? Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know that they necessarily have to pay.  It's still so  early that we're  digesting it. What I can tell you is  there hasn't been a whole scale  reporting of people saying, I no longer get  as much Google traffic as I've gotten in the  past. Which is a sign that  these direct answers probably are not robbing  enough traffic from people  as you might think that they would. Yeah.  Right. So Google still  seems to be sending a good chunk of traffic to  people. So I think it's sort of watch  and see. And I think the real case will come into  a situation where if you do see  that it starts to tip the other way,  where publishers might be like,  you really are taking answers.  There really is no incentive on some of these queries  for people to  click through.  What way can you reward us or  assure us that we're going to do better off of that  down the line? And it could be that Google says, you know  what? Sorry, I've just  said, okay, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've got to fix this. This is a problem.  I can't. My phone,  everything is all responding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's fine. But it might  be that people will say, you know,  we want to be paid directly.  But Google could as easily say, you know,  if you want to participate in our direct answers  program, we're also  going to consider you to be a trusted source  that you're doing better in rankings  for a whole range of other stuff.  Right. Or maybe that's already happening  too. And people might say, well, great. That's a good  trade off because, sure, you're going to have these  direct answers and I'm going to get a little bit of credit.  But you know what? That's  all right because I know on a lot of these long tail searches,  I'm going to pick up traffic with it from there.  But so I don't know what  the answer is. And again,  it is so early. I think  the real concern is that Google  has not really shown a lot of concern  about what they're doing to the publishers  as they've rolled this out.  I've been, no, like, hey, publishers, let's all get together  and talk about what you think about this or  what we should do or is even right. It's just

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we're doing it. Maybe they don't want to set a precedent.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they might want to get the Europe thing settled before  they start doing this stuff. Right. Let's not bring up another

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  issue. Yeah. All right.  Let's take a break. Come back. I want to  do the changelog. I'm going to do the changelog.  Actually, Gina's going to do the changelog.  So get the trumpets ready  because we're going to do the changelog right  after a word from Braintree.  This is a brand new  sponsor on the show and I'm really glad to get them  on because you've been using  Braintree. You just don't even know about it.  So message to developers.  Anybody who's doing mobile apps  and you're trying to get a payments API  in there. I know this is kind of a specialized  thing, but there are  lots of them and there's  one that you want to do. It's the  new one touch system  from Braintree. The fastest, easiest,  most secure way to  pay in app. You've  used Braintree. If you've used Venmo,  if you used Airbnb, if you've  used Uber. Uber uses  Braintree. Hotel tonight, living  social. GitHub  uses Braintree. So you've probably  used Braintree.  It makes the payment experiences in these applications  seamless, dare I say.  Magical. And now you can  do it in your app too.  Braintree scaled with these companies from early  stage startups to the successful companies they are  today and did just great.  You can scale with your business too.  You know the problem is, and I,  as users we know this,  when you are about to buy something,  especially in mobile, and you get  to the payment part, it is often so  horrible that you just go forget it.  I've done this so many times. In fact,  there is a 70% rate of  abandonment at the cart.  70% of people stop.  They're ready to buy. They're ready to  push buy, but your cart is so bad  that they stop.  And that's on desktop.  It's even higher in mobile.  So I love Braintree because  it's a full stack payment solution.  Everything your customer might want.  Credit, debit, PayPal,  Venmo. Venmo is  run by Braintree. Bitcoin  yes, and they're going to be Apple Pay  as well.  130 currencies all  over the world. Fraud protection, yes.  Customer service second to none.  And don't worry about it taking days  to integrate payments with Braintree. You'll do it  in minutes with just a few lines of code.  Android, iOS, JavaScript,  SDKs in seven languages,  .NET, Node.js,  Java, Perl, PHP, Python,  Ruby, those kind of languages.  Not French, German, Italian languages.  Elegant code. In fact, you could  do this with ten lines of code in your app.  Right now,  when you start out with Braintree, at  BraintreePayments.com slash twit, get that right.  Now BraintreePayments  dot com slash twit,  your first fifty thousand dollars  in transactions are fee free.  That's nice.  That's nice.  The most secure way to pay,  if you're a developer, if you're mobile especially,  one touch from Braintree.  Braintree.  My brain is not working  today. BraintreePayments.com  slash twit.  Really sweet. Just go to the website.  They actually have a lot of information there.  The SDK is documented there.  It's really interesting.  BraintreePayments.com slash twit.  It's for specialized a group.  Although I have to say the people,  the group of people doing mobile  is growing rapidly.  Alright, ladies and gentlemen,  it's time for Play the Trumpets,  the Google changelog.  The Google changelog.  La la la la la.  Gina Trippani is the latest  from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, if you're wondering about what's going on with Google Plus these days,  Google isn't saying much, but  at least one new change might be an indicator.  Google is no longer  requiring new Gmail users  to connect their account to a  Google Plus profile.  So, when you sign up for a brand new  Gmail account,  you'll get to a page which says  create your public Google Plus profile,  and there is a no thanks option.  That's wild.  There you go. I remember when everyone  was up in arms because you had to  create a Google Plus profile.  If you had a Google account, period.  This is kind of a big  turnaround. But there you go.  Google Plus profile is no longer  required for Gmail.  Another nice, I think,  I would say user-friendly change.  Google Play is going to start  listing in-app purchase  price ranges for apps.  So, starting September 30th,  Google will start to display the range  of prices an app can charge with  in-app purchases on the Play Store.  That's because they lost a court battle in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Europe, as I remember. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this is no doubt a response to that, right?  There's the dust-up over children  racking up in-app purchases  and their parents footing the bill.  So, this is nice.  Because when you download an app currently on  Google Play, it just says in-app purchase. You don't know  how much or  if you can  use the app without buying in-app purchase  or if not.  So, this is a nice step toward letting  consumers know what they're getting into.  Actually,  Leo, you could probably speak to this.  Chrome for iOS now  added support for app extensions.  And this is a new iOS 8 thing,  which I actually haven't had time  to play with very much. But so,  if you've got Chrome installed in iOS  to share a website from Chrome to another  app, you tap the hamburger menu,  then you select share,  and then you can send pages to any app  that supports extensions.  Now, extensions are new in iOS 8, right, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, in fact, there are a couple of ways  they're used as a little surprising. For instance,  the password managers, like OnePassword,  and I just learned LastPass does this  as well, will add  themselves to the share menu.  But when you share, you're not really sharing, you're going  to get a password,  which is kind of cool.  Before, with Apple,  go back to the share menu, and this is  of course with many Apple  apps, all the Apple apps and many  third party apps. The good news is Chrome has  added this because of the capability, which  was added to iOS 8. Previously,  you could basically email, Twitter,  Facebook,  you could message. Now,  this is just like  Android, right? So as you add  apps, this list will get longer,  and you could turn it off or on.  So you get share  capabilities, which is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, so similar to Android's Intents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very much like Intents.  I'm not clear because  on one  of my phones, it seems like the list is automatically  populated in quite long.  I'm not sure exactly  when it does that and when it just gives you  a chance to turn it on. I don't know.  But yeah, this is  very much like what Android does. The Android does it  automatically. And in fact,  that's a detriment because you can get an awfully long list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can get a very long list, and then you have apps  that help you manage the list, right?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Extensions are iOS 8's  response to all of  the capabilities, the inner  app capabilities of Android. Apple,  which has traditionally sealed each  application hermetically,  is now finally letting applications talk  to one another. I think that's huge.  And they've done it, to their credit.  They understood that that was a  security risk and they didn't want to do it. They've done  it now in a way that's much more judicious  and one step at a time. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that's a good thing. Yeah, it's very nice that you can  turn them on and off by default.  That's very nice. Lifehacker  reports that apps like LastPass seem to work  some of the time, but not all of the time. Apps  have to update iOS 8 to enable  the hooks to share.  So you might not see a whole lot right away.  It sounds like this is still pretty new  and some apps are working out bugs.  But nice to see. Anyway.  iOS 8 is very  buggy in general. Is it really?  Oh, God, yeah.  I'm fielding a lot  of bug reports about my iOS app.  It's not you. It's not you.  It's not me. I'm going to  tell all my anchors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not me. It's not me.  But everybody who does apps for iOS is going  to have to address it because  there's issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's going to go out to everyone.  Or it already has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, adoption traditionally  is very high in iOS. This one's a little  slower than iOS 7. I think  it's 43% now. That's still pretty  high. It's only been a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's only been a week.  Wow. That is impressive. And then there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the people who have 8.0.1 who won't be  reporting bugs for some time now.  Because they don't have any internet  access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, right. This is what  you were talking about earlier. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, there's a... Say again?  There's a fix. So the update 8.0.1

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  cut off your internet access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It cut off your LTE,  your voice,  not all, but some, iPhone 6s,  apparently. And it cut off  your touch ID,  your fingerprint reader. But that's all.  The fix is out. That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There isn't a fix out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They pulled it pretty quickly, like  within an hour. And the fix  is kind of a restore  your iPhone fix.  You press the  option key and you can reinstall  Wow. Yeah, it's pretty ugly. It's about as  ugly as you can get, frankly. Sorry,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  iOS users. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Although, the last night of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It will slow down the adoption  rate, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think so. Go ahead, Danny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was just saying, MGC where it tweeted  something like, good job  putting out an update that takes everybody's minds off  of Ben Gate. Yeah.  Your phone bends. Who cares? You can't use it now.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You think they had that in their back pocket?  Just in case, antenna gate happens again.  If you just update. Unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Come up with something that really screws things up. Really amazing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right.  Last item in the changelog, Google Maps  update. Users in 20 new countries  around the world just got navigation  in Google Maps. The expansion is  aimed primarily at navigation  coverage in Africa, the Caribbean, and South  America. And there are a few outliers in Nepal  and Malta.  Long list of  countries here, which I'm...  My computer is currently loading.  Angola, the Bahamas, Bolivia,  Nepal, Trinidad. I didn't realize

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you couldn't navigate in the Caribbean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's because you are  an American. Here. Just like  me, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like, oh. So what did you...  If you're in the Bahamas and you fire up  Google Maps, it just says,  well, you're here. Good luck getting there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it was just Maps  pre-navigation.  Wow. So it was  something, but just wasn't everything that we're  used to getting. Wow. Okay.  Sorry I'm so pixelated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're fine. And you are Gina  Tripani, and that was the Google  changelog.  Bum bum bum bum bum bum.  So it's funny because  as we see the Apple users who have been in their  little cocoon of Apple happy secure  happy land, get  these new features like extensions  and third party keyboards, the  shock and horror with which  they're greeting these is interesting.  And maybe we should address this. You know,  you can now use SwiftKey,  which we've been using for years on Android and  love. Swipe, same  thing. FlexKey and  a bunch of other keyboard  alternatives in iOS, including one that I  wish we had an Android, which allows you to  respond not with text, but with animated  gifts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just  an animated gift keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's got thousands. It's amazing.  But  when you just as an Android, when you  install a new keyboard  on iOS, you get a big bad  warning that says, hey, watch  out this keyboard, third party keyboards  can transmit all the data that  you type to their servers.  And you should  be wary of that. And it's scaring  Apple users.  The warning on Android, I should compare the two, because the warning  on Android is similar, but  not terrifying, right?  I can't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I don't even know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me read the Android warning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is there a keylogger specific  warning message? I don't think so.  You know, it's funny, I've been watching  iOS users try SwiftKey and one of  my friends was like, this prompted me  to sign into Facebook and it uses my  Facebook status updates to figure out  how I write. Yeah, isn't that great?  Like, he's like, mind blown.  And it's like, whatever, he was like,  creepy, this is too creepery. Like, why  is it doing this? It should have told me that. And I was like, this is  SwiftKey. Like, it's been around for a long time.  This is what it does. It's weird that you  sign into Facebook with your keyboard. It is a very  unexpected thing unless you, you know,  know about it, right? But it was an interesting  sort of wake up call, like, oh, this is a keyboard  that has to tell you why it's asking you  to sign into your social networks.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you do get, I'm  pretty sure, and I'm going to install  SwiftKey on my new phone because it's not  installed yet. I'm pretty sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the thing about the Android phones too  that's different is that  even if you don't install SwiftKey,  most of them at this point will have  swipe typing of some sort built into  them. I assume that they've licensed the  technology. The Google keyboard does. Right.  But, I mean, like every phone that I have right now,  I can swipe type if it's Android.  And I didn't have to install anything. And I didn't  have to worry about any security issues that were  coming along. Plus, I didn't have to kind of  lose one of my keys so that I could switch  back and forth. Whereas, when  I did it with the iPhone, it was like,  hallelujah, I could finally do the swipe typing.  But it's a little awkward at times  that I have to, if it  hasn't come up with the SwiftKey, I've got to push  a thing and then I have this little globe thing  that's kind of there in my way. And, you know,  it works. It's not as polished as I think it is when you're using Android. And then all the security stuff that comes with it, you're just kind of like, Apple, why didn't you just find a way to make that native? The swipe typing. How difficult was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you think that that's why people are using third-party keyboards on iOS? They just want swipe. They want SwiftKey Flow or the equivalent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There may be other reasons why. I think there are other reasons. I haven't gone through to see which ones are big right now. I'll tell you the other reason. I'll give you the other reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple still refuses to do anything but uppercase letters on its keycaps.  Even when you're lowercase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What is up with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you mean uppercase? You mean like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The letters are always uppercase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like a typewriter. They're never, even if you're typing lowercase letters, the keycaps of the keyboard are uppercase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it was one of the first questions I got from family members who got iOS. They're like, I don't understand. Why aren't the letters lower?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's another reason too that I immediately wanted to change the keyboard.  So many of you guys don't remember but when you install a third-party keyboard on Android like SwiftKey, which I do on every Android device, you get this warning.  Attention. This input method may be able to collect all the text you type, including personal data like passwords and credit card numbers.  It comes from the app SwiftKey. Use this input method. OK or cancel. It's very similar actually to what Apple is saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For some reason, we Android users just go, oh yeah, whatever, and say OK.  And Apple users are terrified. I'm getting calls. People all... Oh, is it safe? I heard SwiftKey send stuff to the servers.  And then Steve Gibson said yesterday, which I didn't want to say anything, but he said, well, SwiftKey sends stuff to the servers, but swipe doesn't.  How do you know you don't know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yeah, you'd have to set up a network sniffer, right?  Yeah.  And then you'd have to use it to see. Yeah, yeah. I mean, in a way, I feel like Android users to some degree have been like sort of Windows Vista, right?  Like we just mass information so many times. We just give it, give it, give it.  Danny, you tweeted the iOS prompt that said like, hey, Facebook has been, you know, collecting your location data.  Oh, get ready.  Do you want to continue to keep doing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Every app will do this once, Danny. Every single one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you know what? And somebody tweeted back to me how they like that it didn't all happen at once.  And I had to agree every time I turned on my phone, I got a different reminder and I didn't mind it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Or it could just honor your because it asks you the first time it said it.  And you say yes. And then a little later, a day or two later, it says, you know, it's still doing that. Is that OK?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought that was fine. I thought that was totally cool.  Yeah, I mean, I actually kind of like it.  I appreciate the reminder that Facebook is doing this because, you know, I just appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe I'm not using Facebook. Maybe I decide, oh, you know what?  I don't need this to be using my location data in the background. I'm going to uninstall this. Right?  Like, like this is the issue. It's like if you want to use an app, you have to grant it these permissions.  Maybe I try the app. I try apps all the time and then don't need them later.  But they're running in the background. I kind of want to be like, no, you know, let know.  But yeah, this issue of constantly being prompted for permissions or being prompted with this like huge wall of permissions  with subcategories that have supposedly been made simpler.  There's this there's got to be there's got to be a better way.  Well, the choice is clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Android asks you once when you install the app and then presumes that you've read that and you've approved it.  And that's that. Now you can't get a list, can't you, of all the apps using fine location?  That's all it is, by the way, is fine. Yeah.  And on Apple, same thing. You have to approve it when you install the app.  The first time you use the app, not instead when you install it, but the first time you use it, it'll say, hey, can you want to give this app location permission?  You say yes. You still can go in the settings and see who's getting location.  But for some reason, Apple's decided that a few days later it wants to warn you on each app doing this.  Now, I'm hoping that's not going to happen every few days because I have one hundred fifty nine apps and it's yeah, it's happening a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's interesting to me also that I'm assuming there's some kind of logic that's going on because I did not get hit with every app that I've authorized to do that.  I will face. No, you will.  But it was the things that came up immediately were the things that I probably are using the rights.  And so that made sense. And so maybe it'll come down the line.  It's going to I'm wondering what the trigger is like.  Hey, we've noticed that Facebook has now done its one hundredth update of your location.  Yes, something like that. You know, to whereas, you know, you installed emoji keyboard and let's talk next week, Danny, after you've seen the fiftieth one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. There's two problems.  One, it's annoying. But two, there's fatigue.  And as you pointed out, we Android users are so used to it.  We go, yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a risk you warn people too much.  I think it's sufficient to warn.  I like what Apple does, which is it warns you not on install, but it warns you the first time it needs those permissions.  You have to explicitly say so.  But that seems to me sufficient to continue to warn you is a little nanny.  But that, you know, I don't know. Whatever you don't see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you like the approach of the inflow? I do. Just not the reminder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do. Yeah, I agree. It's very easy to ignore the permissions you're giving an app when you're installing it, because it's a long list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just give me the app. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So many apps, for instance, want location information, your contacts and your photos on on Android.  You'll see all three of those requests only once when you install the app on iOS.  You'll you'll see it when you when it actually asks for those permissions when you first run the app and you want to access the camera roll.  Say, hey, do you want to give this permission?  I think that's exactly the right time, because you know right then why it's wanting the camera roll and what it is.  And I think that's when you can best make that decision.  But I question the need to continue to remind me.  And but you know what? This is Apple saying.  And by the way, I guess this is a story for us, because it's very clear in the last few interviews Tim Cook's given.  This is Apple saying, oh, we've decided to be the privacy security company and other companies are, you know, our business is selling you hardware.  Other companies is selling your information.  You know, we would never do that.  We would never do that except with ads.  But but that's another story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the marketing opportunity for them.  They're capitalizing on the people's fear about that.  Yeah. About what Google knows about them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think, frankly, that's a good that's a good positioning.  And, you know, Apple has done some things to make it better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or, you know, we would we would never, you know, target you with with ads or anything.  But we would partner with a big company that pays us lots of money to be the default search engine and probably gives us 90 percent of all the revenues when you do a search on our device and go over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How much do we know how much Apple gets from Google every year because it's the default search engine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I saw some estimate that it might have been like two billion or so.  Two billion. Yeah.  But it's a lot.  And they're going to get a lot off of it.  And they never disclose to you that they have paid or are getting paid from Google to do that.  You barely even know that there was a deal that was ever struck.  So I. So that's when you're using the Google search in Safari.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That information is being leaked.  When you use it in Siri, it masks that information.  All of the I was told, and I may be wrong, that all of those searches are coming from Apple, not from you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they're going to come from Apple.  Yes.  Although when you click to go through to a particular site, if you do that, it might change.  And eventually maybe Siri will happen where they don't they don't target you in any sort of way, you know, with the third parties or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I wonder, though, doesn't so far.  I thought I remember the Safari was doing this, too.  But that would be giving forgoing two billion dollars.  Safari is doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Safari has moved to by default.  It's anonymizing.  HTT HTTPS searches.  But that just means you're going to have a secure connection when you do your search with Google.  Google still knows who you are.  In fact, you'll probably be logged in with Google.  You might be logged in with Safari.  So, you know, even if you're not logged in, Google is probably still going to cookie you, even if you're on a secure thing, because it's not like you're next time you go to Google says, oh, you're still on a secure thing.  I'll throw away the cookie.  I assigned you the last time.  Right.  Right. So let me I appreciated what Apple said, but what they didn't say was, but we also have deals with these big companies and make a lot of money off of them because they in turn are making a lot of money off of you in turn by doing that stuff that we said we don't do directly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would hope here, by the way, is the Apple warning just so that you can compare it to the Android warning.  I've turned on swipe.  It says allow full access for swipe keyboards.  Full access allows the developer of the keyboard to transmit anything you type, including the things you have previously typed with this keyboard.  This can include sensitive information such as your credit card number or street address.  Actually, the Google warning is a little more clear.  It's coming from that's pretty, pretty much the same, isn't it?  They're pretty similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it scares Apple people more because because they've never they haven't seen that confronted this before.  I love it.  I love it.  Somebody in the chat room saying, why are you always banging on Apple?  Can't you just be?  It's like, excuse me.  I think Apple people sometimes say, no, there's just let's I don't want to.  I don't want to hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How everybody says that you can have Android people do the same sort of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why do you always pick on Android?  Oh, no, no, I hear it from everybody.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, we people take these things very personally.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this is the three people still using BlackBerry who get really upset.  Does it?  Well, you're saying there's only three people using BlackBerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just going to see real quickly if I do a search on the new iPhone, if the default search is Google, by the way, immediately before.  Yeah, it's a Google search.  Before it does the search pulls up a Wikipedia entry.  It does a search snippet right away before I even hit go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the Google search app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, this is Safari on.  Safari, iOS.  And then if I hit return, then I get the Google results.  So it is it's actually doing it on Google.  I thought it was going to use Bing to I think Bing is available if you wish.  But that's two billion dollars worth of revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It gets complicated with Bing is available for spotlight searches and in and in Siri.  But Safari still defaults to using Google, although I'll have to go back and look because that's interesting that if they're pulling in Wikipedia.  As you type, I don't know if that's Google doing that or that's Safari doing that.  I wonder too.  Right.  I'm going to have to go look into that now.  That just blown my afternoon.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.  And we trust SwiftKey, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple users, if you wish to trust SwiftKey, you can.  I would trust Swipe.  Here's to me the bottom line.  These are all well-known big companies.  It is possible with a packet sniffer to see what's being sent back.  And I think they would be discovered if they were to do anything nefarious.  They'd be discovered quite quickly.  So I wouldn't worry too much about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can I just say those when I was typing in G bag, that was just because I was trying to under a G pack.  I was trying to understand some of the dope lingo from the wire.  If you look at my search history right now, have you noticed?  You think I'm like a startup in the heroin trade or something?  What the hell is that?  I'm just trying to understand the wire.  Have you guys noticed that the it seems like Google's doing a better job of catching the stuff I search for and pop populating the ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In other pages as I search around, it seems like it's really working well lately.  I search for something and I see ads for it all over from now on.  Yeah, yeah, I have noticed that.  It seems like it's working better, doesn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It follows you around the stuff that the stuff that you're interested in still.  It was not a good idea to know that.  You know, the things I think are important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, why is it so important?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I think you're good to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have to say, I'm trying to understand the things that I've been doing.  It follows you around the stuff that the stuff that you're interested in.  Still, you know, I continue to get that feeling of like, Oh, Google knows a lot about me from now and from ads and from search suggestions of like things I searched for before.  Right.  Yeah. Yeah.  Very smart.  It's why they're they have enough money for Google X and Google Y.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're doing a good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're doing a good job with their job.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see what else before we wrap things up.  We're getting to the end of our program schedule.  You can tweet a Wolfram Alpha language program, tweet a program and it will return.  What is that?  Where did that come from?  Let me try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So tweet Wolfram Alpha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wolfram Alpha is the coolest.  I love it.  It's such a cool product, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That nobody knows about or uses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nobody knows about our users.  But there's a thing I know about it and I don't use it.  Although until something like this happens and I'm like, oh, cool.  Let me try this.  I try it and I'm impressed.  Oh, I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you can tweet code in Wolfram Alpha, obviously 140 characters or less.  And right.  And Wolfram to Wolfram TAP and it will run your program and tweet the result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which is pretty awesome.  Now, have you played?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is a really good one.  Geographic's text style.  Hello. 150 geo range world.  We'll put hello on a world map and it'll tweet it back to you.  It tells you two things.  First of all, that it's a very succinct language.  It's a very powerful language.  Have you played with this language?  The Wolfram language.  Look at this one.  This is kind of like Mathematica, which is Wolfram's.  Right.  Mathematica.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That cube of spheres is amazing.  This is the RGB colors in a cube of spheres.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it tweets it back at you.  I haven't actually done this, but I am now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're a programmer.  We count on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this is neat.  And they attach.  This is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they attach the results as an image kind of as a Twitter card.  Yeah, that's very cool.  Wow.  Look, you could do fractals.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Neato.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But again, it's like, I just want.  Wolfram's just seems like a thing that I want to use every day in my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just I'm just never rendering.  I'm just never rendering.  I'm just I'm just never rendering cubes of spheres in the RGB scale very often.  You know what I mean?  It's just not something I need to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know, but it's fun.  Well, here's one.  It's fun.  All the flags of Europe sized by population.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's cool.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really with one hundred forty character tweet.  All right.  We send this tweet as your best Wolfram alpha language.  That's just crazy.  I want to it makes me want to learn the language, which is obviously the intent.  Are we still waiting on a Nexus seven phone or six or whatever it would be?  Nexus six.  It would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  What do you think?  What do you guys think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Chad, you're the one, right?  You're the one to be waiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, my gosh.  The rumors.  There are no solid, great rumors.  Everyone, everyone expects.  Sorry, I don't know if I can in this office.  You got to rename it as you've demonstrated.  What's the next Android version?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't that Android L that I'm waiting for the L word?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  We have to get a phone that comes out with Android L.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's got it's due next month, according to The Washington Post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so we might be looking at new phone running the L.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, default encryption.  Remember, this is something Apple announced.  Apple used to have a waiting line for law enforcement to decrypt phones.  And you'd fill out a form and you'd send the phone to Apple.  And within a few months, you'd get it back decrypted.  Apple's announced we can no longer do that.  There will no longer be a line because we don't have the capability.  We've changed the default encryption and it's strong encryption.  And now L will do that, too, which is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is where the companies influence one another.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, yeah, you're right.  They have to release.  Do they have? Is that right?  Do they always with a new version of Android have a new phone, a new Nexus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what some of the developers tweeted was that, listen, if we're going to release a operating system,  you need to release some sort of hardware.  We're going to have a hardware to bundle with, which was from a tweet.  That makes sense.  Yeah, I mean, a reference device, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  A reference device about what the default Android L, Limoncello or Lollipop or whatever it is experience is going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you could just update the Nexus 5 and say that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You could, but then you wouldn't get all those that the money coming in in the holiday season on hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's a profit thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know how much they sell for the Nexus 5, but I don't think it's a big moneymaker.  You know, it's nice having it, but I could see is the Moto X out unlocked yet?  Yeah, this is unlocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's as it's it's it's the problem is not exactly pure Android,  but all the Moto customizations are in Moto programs, the Kinect program, for instance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's what I'm wondering.  So it's pretty pure.  What I'm wondering is whether they just put out the Nexus 5 L or something, and it's just the Moto X or whatever.  It's a nice little phone.  I like it.  It'll be interesting.  But, you know, potentially they could just put the Nexus 5 back out.  You know, it's actually maybe it's time for a phablet.  Maybe they're they're desperately coming out with the 5.5.  The Nexus 5.5 Blackberry Passport L.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  What?  This just came out.  Would you pay $5.99 for this unlocked?  It is a passport sized Blackberry full physical keyboard.  Nice screen, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, you have me at Blackberry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We shouldn't mock it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want them to succeed.  This is a product that some have been very interested in.  You know, there's such a limited store compared to the Android store compared to the Windows phone store.  It's limited.  So it's also kind of a weird form factor.  It's like that.  It's like a pop tart.  It's like you kind of have they have a picture of people trying to hold it.  It's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, Leo, the Wablets are going to be great.  What?  Wablets.  What's a Wablet?  What's a Wablet?  Oh, the wide phablet.  Yeah, you'll see.  They're going to be the leaders in Wablet technology.  And you're not going to be talking pop tarts anymore.  You'll be going every phone should be Wablet sized.  Wablet?  Has anybody done that yet?  Wablet.com.  You just invented it.  Go get it, Danny.  Now, I'm sure someone's done it.  No, I'm not going to get many Wablets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to give you time to register that domain name.  And then when we come back, we're going to get our fix of the week.  Danny Sullivan, that wascally Wablet from search engine land dot com.  Gina Trapani, one of our regulars.  Do you shave, Danny, or are you just naturally a boyish?  No, I shave for the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you.  Thank you, Danny.  I appreciate that.  That was nice.  I hear he wants to like stumble over my face.  Did you use your Harry's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you know about Harry's?  I love Harry's.  This is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh my goodness.  Yes, I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you?  Yeah.  Harry's is a shave club, basically.  I get my blades every other month.  And the fabulous Harry's shave cream, which is really a critical part of the whole thing.  You know, if somebody could go on my desk, I don't know if they've announced it yet,  but there's a couple of new Harry's products you can get from Harry's dot com.  The new foaming shave gel and the aftershave are here.  Harry's is founded by one of the founders of Warby Parker, Jeff.  He said, you know, just like Warby Parker, here's a business, the shaving blade business,  that is dominated by monopolies, effectively, that are keeping prices artificially high.  So high that now when you go to get razor blades at the drug stores,  not just New York City, Gina, everywhere in the country, here in Petaluma,  you're locked up.  You have to get a clerk, you know, and he'll check your ID and your passport  before you can get the shaving equipment.  They're so expensive.  Well, Harry's is better for less.  They actually bought, they looked around, they said, who makes great blades?  They found a company in Germany that makes, that's like the only company that makes really great blades.  This is the Truman set.  I have the Winston at home, which is an engraved metal,  but some people prefer the Truman.  You know, they're, but the handles aren't really the key.  The key is this amazing blade.  Made in Harry's own factory in Germany.  They own the factory in Germany.  Andy and Jeff said we could do better than those $8 blades.  If you visit Harry's.com, shop around, pick a set.  I actually have to say I kind of like this Truman.  It's pretty nice, but the Winston's good too, and you can get that engraved.  And then you're going to get, with the kit, you're going to get the shave cream, the two blades.  So you're all set to go, and then you can have your blades and your cream delivered monthly.  I haven't tried the new shaving, foaming shave gel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it smells good too.  Harry's.com, here's the deal.  You get $5 off your first order when you use the offer code TWIG, T-W-I-D-G.  This will be the closest shave you've ever had.  Harry's.com.  Now what do I do?  Shave?  Offer code.  I couldn't resist.  I have to finish the show this way.  Offer code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Santa, will you bring me a Nexus?  Can we have a Nexus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A Nexus 6?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You've been a good little boy and girl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, one with encryption, please.  That foaming shave gel really foams.  That was just a little dabble, do you?  And it just, whoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That did foam right on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whoa, I didn't expect that.  And then afterwards, you're going to want to use...  What are you laughing at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got shell everywhere.  Afterwards, you're going to want to use the Harry's shave lotion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why is my phone making music now?  Oh, it's time to do something else.  Well, I'll tell you what.  The Moto X alarm says it's time.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Shh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do I stop this?  Don't you hate new phones?  It's time for our picks of the week.  Let's start with actually our tip of the week with Gina Trapani.  Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So if you've got yourself an Android device  and you want to get a taste of material design before Android L launches,  Google actually released a cute little quiz app.  It's called Topeka, and it's free in the Google Play Store.  That's Topeka.  It's a quiz app.  You log in.  You take quizzes about food or history or music.  I like that.  Yeah.  They're actually good quizzes,  but it also gives you kind of an idea of what material design is like.  The cards kind of move around and slide.  It's got the big numbers and sort of the more material design look and feel.  Yeah, this app, Topeka, was actually built with Polymer,  which is a developer framework for making web apps  that have the material design look and feel.  This is actually a web app running natively on Android,  which is kind of neat, too.  And you never know.  It behaves just as if it were a native app.  It's just a very simple, kind of cute...  Yeah, it's pretty simple, cute...  Yeah, a nice way to kind of get a taste of the material design,  and it runs on Android 4.0 and up.  So Topeka and the Play Store.  Topeka! And it's free.  It's free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Free.  From the goog.  Such a good...  These are such good blades.  You just never cut yourself.  That's what I love about Harry's.  I have been using Harry's for six months.  I have never cut myself shaving.  You know, I don't know why.  I just took it for granted that you would always cut yourself shaving.  No one jinx it.  No, I'm not worried.  These blades...  I get nervous.  Oh, so great.  And because I get them every other month, you know, I get them fresh.  I always have a nice sharp blade in there.  Good.  Do you have a tip for us or a trick or a tool  or anything you'd like to share with us, Mr. Danny Sullivan of Search Engine Land?  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Breaking fresh off the search wire.  Yes.  If you have Google Now on Android...  I do.  And you have ever searched for a flight in the past,  Google is now going to prompt you to tell you  if that same flight is coming up at a lower fare.  Oh!

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  In fact, interestingly, this was something that when being launched,  they made a big deal of the fact that you could fair track  and have predictions or whatever, and then they abandoned all that stuff,  and now Google is going to put it into Google Now.  So the way it would work is, you know,  if there was a flight that it knows that you've done all the time,  you may see a Google Card coming up telling you that it is now at a lower price,  and if you tap on the Google Card, then you can go through and do the booking.  So watch that on Google Now.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. Nice.  Is that because they acquired... what was it, IAAT, IA...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That'll help them do that, where they can track that more.  And they were already doing flight tracking,  so it's sort of a good extension of what they're doing with it from that.  Nice niche.  It's sort of surprising that you can't explicitly set it up, though, right?  But maybe if you're doing that on Google,  I'll have to go back and look at Google Flight Tracker.  There might be a way to set up the standard thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And is this something that the airlines are going to hate them for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Probably.  Probably not, because you'll place the flight through the airline,  so, you know, airlines are still going to get the money.  But I'm sure if there's a way for someone to hate Google about something,  they'll find it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They'll find a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very nice.  They're going to blame them.  Very nice.  Well, I don't have to tell you what my pick is,  and you'll hear a lot more about it after I've used it for a little bit longer.  The Moto X, I have to say, the Moto Maker site, motomaker.com is up.  They had Moto 360s and Motorola hints there.  I think they're sold out on the hint now.  But I have ordered all three and should have all three for the next time we're here  on This Week in Google.  I'm going to be gone next week taking the Moto X along with me  as I head to London with Lisa for a week.  Who's doing the show next week?  Do you know? Does anybody know, Chad?  Is it Father Robert Baliser, Sarah Lane?  Mike Elgin.  You know what? It's Mike Elgin.  Mike is a Google fanatic.  It's definitely Mike Elgin.  So he'll be hosting next week with you and Jeff.  Cool.  I want to thank Dani Sullivan for being here from searchengineland.com.  Always a pleasure working with you, Dani, and I read you religiously like every day.  Well, thank you very much.  It's a pleasure to be here.  Marketingengineland.com as well.  Yeah, thanks, Dani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really, really good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We appreciate it.  And thanks to Gina Trapani from, we were just playing with ThinkUp.  I guess Dani uses ThinkUp too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina, I kid you not, it's on my calendar every week.  It says right here, write ThinkUp review.  So that might be another week or two longer, but if anybody hasn't got ThinkUp,  you should really get it before Twitter just buys it, which is what they should do.  You're not for sale, right, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're not for sale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're too expensive, I think, for Twitter right now.  Anyway, I don't know.  I'll talk to you in a few weeks.  Dani, the longer you wait, the better the product will be when you write the review  because we're fixing stuff every week.  All the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's perfect because I can wait for a really long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, don't tell him that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm going to finally get to it, but it's awesome.  I look forward to getting my digest of stuff that's coming in there.  It's consistently giving me great things and better feedback than what I get from Twitter directly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and it's updated regularly because we look before the show, and now I'm looking in.  I've got new stuff on here.  I just love it.  ThinkUp.com.  You can try it free right now.
