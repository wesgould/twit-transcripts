Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am so happy to be back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do I sense a little hat hair there, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just a little.  Hat hair, Rudolph nose, wearing a winter scarf indoors,  even when I'm not outside.  Yes.  It is cold.  Did I mention that it's cold here?  It's cold.  It was four degrees yesterday.  And I just, I don't own thermal underwear, folks.  So I was like, I was at American Apparel by my office,  just like buying random legging,  like just please, like layers.  I'm wearing as many layers as possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're coming desperate.  I need leggings.  I need leggings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I nearly task-raveted somebody to go to New York Globe  for me to get heat tech.  So yes, it's very cold here,  but I'm so happy to be back on the show.  I really missed you guys.  I'm so sorry that I missed the New Year's shenanigans,  which was amazing.  I caught some of it.  Well, here's the good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're doing it again.  We'll have to wait a year, of course.  I'm not doing it again tomorrow.  But, and I want you and Jeff to be here.  What we found was the really,  the real benefit of doing that New Year's thing,  well, besides the fact that we got to talk to people  all around the world,  and we really, it was a real celebration,  was getting to see our hosts in unusual contexts.  So I think what we're gonna do next.  That was fun.  Yeah.  So next year, there'll be-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some of these games were beyond me though, Leo.  I know.  Yeah, some of them, the Star Trek thing.  We won't make you-  Chad looked in place there.  I think I'd be a little out of place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have to be a Star Trek fan.  I was out of place.  That was fun though.  We were commanding a starship in a simulation,  and we had all the people to be on the bridge,  a navigator, comms officer, tactical officer,  captain, everything.  It was really fun.  That was called the Artemis simulation.  He goes around from conference to conference  doing those, Wes does.  And we'll have that and all of the highlights  on our YouTube channel soon.  In fact, we're putting hour by hour up right now  on YouTube.com slash inside Twitter.  And then on Twitter specials,  we'll do a series of specials.  But what I was saying is the thing that I think  is so great, and we will definitely do next year.  One is we're gonna get every time zone.  I gotta talk to everybody in every time zone  and say, and because we had 30 bottles of champagne  and we just, it was so much fun opening one every hour  or sometimes every 15 minutes.  But then the other is I wanna get every host out here  and I want you all to pick something that you love  that isn't what you normally talk about.  So Steve made coffee.  Mary Jo gave us a beer tasting.  Alex Lindsay mixed drinks.  It was really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Very cool.  Can I talk about MMA?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you wanna?  Is that what you do?  We can have a little MMA demonstration.  You know, we did have,  we had a team of theatrical fighting people  show us how to do, you know,  lightsaber fighting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's cool.  That's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I put on my hood and oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that was the geekiest moment of all.  Yeah, it sounds like you watched the show.  I came in on and off throughout the 24 hours.  I'd say, I'd be bored.  You were like my Twitter that day.  Nobody's on Twitter.  I think, oh, how's Leo making a fool of himself now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He really did kind of feel like you had friends  who were having a party  and you could drop them when you wanted.  I did kind of the same thing.  I was working, but every once in a while,  I would just kind of stop in and be like,  what are these guys doing now?  And it was always, it would always make me laugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, now you are going to be the friends  who are having the party.  I like that.  We'll fly you out.  Yeah.  Please do, bring your baby and everything, your wife.  Everybody wants to come out.  We're going to, this is going to be, I think,  a regular feature of the network  because it's just so much fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know where else I want to be at that time of year,  next year, is the Chaos Computer Club meeting.  I was watching tons of videos, but I think Jacob Applebaum  just did a brilliant, brilliant presentation.  Now, that is, is it German?  Where is the Chaos Computer Club?  This year was at Hamburg.  It's only been in Berlin.  At the beginning of the WikiLeaks movie,  that's where Assange is presenting WikiLeaks at first.  It's the Mondo gathering of good hackers.  And they had Glenn Greenwald give a keynote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gosh, would have been nice if Snowden  could have snuck in for that.  It would have been phenomenal, phenomenal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, one of the great pictures was at the airport  for Hamburg, a lot of people took this picture  of a guy standing there as if a chauffeur  with a sign that just said Snowden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just a case.  Just a case.  His ride is waiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I really recommend Jacob Applebaum's video.  Look it up, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And is that a New Year thing they do every New Year?  They do it between.  So.  Okay, so you could go to that and then come out here.  Fly to Hamburg, yes.  I kind of like the idea of having you be here.  Was he talking about NSA this time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, he was talking about the stuff  that Der Spiegel revealed, I guess, half ago.  Oh.  And he kept on saying it's gonna blow your mind,  your mind is not blown yet.  And he got to the end of the presentation,  you know, Eddie, who here still hasn't had their mind blown?  He said, you cynics, just wait, now I'm gonna do it.  And then one guy raised his hand,  his mind still wasn't blown.  It was what they can do to us.  It was pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and the Ant materials,  which we've talked about extensively, Security Now,  in fact all of Security Now next week  will be on the Ant materials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I missed not having Steve on before the show.  I always get the alert a little bit.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're gonna have to tune in.  It's on Tuesdays now, 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern.  Good, I will watch this.  It was called To Protect and Infect  the Militarization of the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there's good stuff that happens that time of year,  you know, you know what I'm saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's a slow time as everybody gets ready  for CES, which is going on right now.  And it tends to be a little slow in tech news.  The NSA really kept us lit up.  And this, I credit Steve, Edward Snowden,  and Glenn Greenwald for this,  because their strategy was to dole out  bit by bit this information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they get accused of doing that cynically,  and it's important to say,  and I think it's really, really important to say,  that I don't think that's fully the strategy.  It's also that each of these revelations  takes a lot of reporting.  And yeah, I hear this from my Guardian friends.  You really gotta dig in, figure out what the,  you know, what does this acronym mean?  What is this really, what are the implications  of this and that?  Talk to people.  There's a huge amount of work that goes into  each one of these stories.  So I think that's part of the reason it takes time.  And so when they get accused of doling it out,  or he gets accused of hoarding it  until he gets under Pierre Amidiar's wing,  you know, is that true or not?  I don't know, but if they did it at the fastest pace  possible, I don't think it'd be much faster  than what they've been doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's easy, you could interpret it either way.  It's easy to say, oh, it's cynical,  they wanna maximize the monetary value.  But by now there should be no question in anybody's mind  that the, whether they're doing that or not,  that by slowly dribbling it out,  gives it its appropriate amount of attention.  Had they dumped this all as WikiLeaks style,  dumped this all, it would not have gotten  the attention it deserves.  You're right.  Yeah.  Just this catalog of exploits from LeakSource,  the Ant Exploits, and admittedly, these are old.  These are few years old.  The iPhone exploit, for instance,  is from 2008 for the second iPhone.  So we presume that there's much better effective stuff  going on right now.  Shows how they can target and attack  against pretty much anybody.  Now, Bruce Schneier does make that point on these,  that this is privacy invasion retail style,  not wholesale style.  Unlike gathering all the phone records,  this is how you can take someone's iPhone  and spy on what they're doing.  Not everybody, it's just some bodies.  How you can embed something in a computer  so they can't get rid of it.  Things like that.  How to code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And let's say that if you look at the principles  that were put out by Google and the other seven companies,  I think we're all fine with specific surveillance  of people who are properly suspected under due process  and with due cause.  So some of this technology, I guess, isn't bad,  but do we have any faith that they use it  only for that purpose?  When we have secret FISA courts?  Not so much.  I don't know, there's no other.  And look at the great revelation coming this week  of the revealed who the burglars were  who went after the FBI and showed how J. Edgar Hoover  was using the technology he had at the time  to try to do in the left wing.  It's been done before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, we've certainly talked about this ad nauseum.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't.  So I guess it's my fault we started again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Look, there's no more important story of 2014.  It should have been Time's Person of the Year  and everything else, but I don't know  if there's much news we can add.  Nope, I think that's kind of it.  Except to say that if you wanna know  what these exploits are,  Bruce Schneier's going one by one,  a blog post a day through them,  and his blog, schneier.com,  and Steve Gibson's gonna do his analysis  of the ant and dao technologies next week on Security Now.  Yeah, I think it'll be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Security Now is now on when, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tuesdays, 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern Time  on Twitch.tv.  You can watch live,  but you can always get anything after the fact.  You can watch last Tuesday's show if you want,  Twitch.tv slash SN.  We talk a little bit more about this.  It is kind of shocking and depressing a little bit.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So did you have any temptation at all  to go to CES this year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I always am tempted.  I always, it's a mixed feeling.  How about you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I haven't been in two decades, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gina, did you wanna, I bet you wanted to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nope, never been, don't wanna go.  It's just not my thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could tell from a distance, it's too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I've never been much of a hardware.  I always sort of, I'm biased towards software.  And I'm also just an introvert,  so it sounds like hell to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is a lot of noise, a lot of commotion, a lot of fuss.  Everything's twice as hard as it ought to be  from getting a sandwich to getting a cab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It sounds like Comic-Con, except without the cool costumes.  Times a thousand.  Yeah, times a thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And yet, there's certainly stuff to see.  Some of it fascinating,  like Michael Bay's meltdown at the Samsung event.  Some of it silly, like the idea of mixing Android  and Windows 8.1 in a computer.  Yes.  What do you guys think of that?  That's an ASUS Transformer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we covered that last night on Android,  on All About Android.  And I was saying after the show to my friends,  I forgot what a crazy time the Android ecosystem,  the notebook laptop that a hot dual boots,  Android and Windows,  that was up against the phone that docks into the tablet,  which I know isn't a new thing,  as like the two crazy, why would I ever want this  sort of gadgets for me, for me.  But it does kind of feel like,  oh, let's just throw something up against the wall  and see what sticks.  Throw everything up against the wall and see what sticks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does not seem like there's demand.  I don't understand what the use case is,  unless there's like a game or some app that you use in.  I don't understand the use case for Windows, period.  Well, you would go all the other way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I haven't used Windows in forever.  So I realized that my Mac, my Mac BIOS gonna makes me scoff.  But it's for people, Leo, who can't decide  between an Android laptop or a Windows tablet.  You can get both.  I can't decide.  I can't decide.  Sometimes I want an Android laptop  and sometimes I want Windows tablet, vice versa.  I mean, that's a big bucket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, by the way, it's Android 4.1 is Jelly Bean.  Kind of a little behind, we're up to 4.4 now.  It's not the first we've seen.  Other companies have done this even last year.  And I thought ASUS did this last year.  But you know, there you go.  It's there if you want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're right about the timing here.  I wish I could figure out the year,  but I realized that I now use no Microsoft products at all.  It's the first time since probably 1982, something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was on CPM in 81.  I was on MS-DOS.  In when, when did the PCs come out?  IBM PCs.  81, so it's probably about 82 that I got that.  And so from 82 until 2013, I used Microsoft products.  And now I don't use any Microsoft product.  No offense to Microsoft, it's not because I'm trying to.  It's not because they're bad or anything like that.  It's just because I just don't need them now.  I got the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The other point to be made about CES is that I think  if you're a company that really has something to say,  doing it at CES is really a crap shoot.  You might get more attention  because there sure is a lot of press there.  But you might get buried in the sea of information  and not get the attention you want.  I think it worked well for Marissa.  She, okay, so Marissa Meyer gave the keynote.  I think she got attention.  I think that that's, if you can do a keynote at CES,  that's gonna guarantee you a certain amount of attention.  There's only a handful of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I mean, she's running a huge company  and gets a lot of attention just because that company,  she's turning that company around.  Well, it's the first time

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they've done a keynote there, right?  Yahoo's done a keynote, I think.  Unless I'm, maybe Terry Semmel did one.  I don't remember.  It doesn't seem like right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It seems like the equivalent of a consumer app  announcing at South by Southwest,  which is something I'd never do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, there's some benefit.  Well, I note for instance,  that Motorola has announced it's doing an event  in London January 14th.  Now, if this were a big important announcement,  they could have done it a week earlier at CES.  By the way, according to Droid Life,  the thinking is this will be good news for you in England,  Moto X and Moto Maker, perhaps.  Motorola told Droid Life at CES,  we have a bit of an announcement, it's very British,  and we have ambitions to broaden our geographic footprint.  There is a job listing on the Motorola UK site  suggesting that Moto Maker might be coming along.  Program manager, Moto Maker.  It's in the UK right now, Moto Maker,  which is the way to build those Motorola's in the US, right?  Is only in the US.  Responsible for national and international integration  of Moto Maker point of sale and online registration.  So when Moto came out, Moto X came out,  Motorola said, sorry, North America, South America only.  I think we're now going to see the expansion.  And I think there are, you know, a lot of people go, oh, hum.  But I think this is still my phone of choice.  I think this is a great phone.  And a really good introduction to Android  for people coming from the iPhone side.  So Marissa Mayer brought Katie Couric on stage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I had coffee with just two nights ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, fancy, huh?  Oh.  Ah, you fancy, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  John Legend, cast member, did you have coffee with him too?  No.  Cast members of Saturday Night Live,  Tumblr CEO David Karp and David Pogue,  their new tech columnist.  So-  Our studded lineup.  I guess we don't want to bury the lead.  So tell us about Katie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it was not a big deal.  I was asked when she was,  and now she was going to Yahoo.  I got a call from Weekend Edition NPR  and I, you know, blather about Katie going to Yahoo.  The truth is, do I have anything new to say?  No, but I decided to use it for my own agenda, which I saw.  So I hope that Katie and Marissa,  who are really smart, really good, reinvent TV news  because it sucks and it needs it.  Oh yeah.  And so out of nowhere, I got a tweet from Katie saying,  let's have coffee.  Wow.  We just had a nice coffee talking about that  and such and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was she pitching you on what they were about to do at Yahoo?  Or was it, she wanted to hear what you had to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think she's in listening tour mode, I think.  Wow.  And this is the day before she went out to Vegas.  But, you know, I've always admired her.  I think she's very, very smart.  And, you know, she's gone through every network now.  She's in something new.  And I think she might try to reinvent things  in substantial ways and is not going to presume  to do it the way that she's done it.  She doesn't have the kind of staff that a network had.  So it was just, no, it was just kind of battering  back and forth about what's possible,  but it was very enjoyable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You should send her, you should tweet her the clip  from the show where you guys,  where you all talked about this while I was out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I mean, it was a little critical.  Completely positive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Self-loathing new media, said Leo Laporte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I don't know if that's the headline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You came back around saying how you like an American,  but you gotta get through.  Oh, I think she's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I don't think that that is internet native by any means.  I don't think many of the moves Yahoo's made  are internet native moves.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they download their new starter screen thing.  The MyYahoo page?  No, they bought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, they bought Aviate.  Aviate, that's right.  I didn't like Aviate when it came out.  I baited it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wasn't crazy about it.  I think Aviate versus what's the other one?  Cover.  I don't like either of them.  Yeah, I agree.  I installed them both and don't use either of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What do you use as a launcher, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've got the Google experience going on.  Yeah, yeah, and I don't use a launcher.  I just group a couple of apps in a folder on my dock.  My most used apps and I basically do that.  And I've tried a bunch of launchers  and with different methods, swipe in.  And I just kind of do it that way.  I don't like to keep icons on my home screen.  I like to look at the picture of my daughter  and that seems to work.  I keep it simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  The idea of Aviate was what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's kind of, it's contextual.  So the idea of Aviate is that it organizes your phone  for you based on context.  So I could tell from the Play Store page instantaneously  that it was not for me because it says straight up,  like if you like to customize your phone yourself,  this is not the app for you.  So you install Aviate.  It takes over your home screen.  What it does is it categorizes your apps for you  into groups and it brings up apps  that you'll want based on where you are  and what time of day it is.  So for example, you go to the gym,  it'll bring up the Nike Plus app.  If you're at a restaurant, it knows that,  it'll make a recommendation of what you should eat  based on, I don't know, Foursquare or other apps.  If it's nighttime, you're going to bed,  it'll bring up the alarm clock app, that kind of thing.  So it sounds sort of Google Now-ish  except it takes over your whole home screen  and makes assumptions about what you'll need  and when you'll need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I always prefer the stick shift to automatic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like to know what I'm doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We also don't want a UI that's changing all the time.  Yeah.  I think that's a mistake.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's a good idea.  I mean, they're marking as somebody who,  someone who just wants to make their phone easy to use  and forget it, not customize it themselves.  I don't know, but I understand what you're saying.  If my phone home screen changes,  depending on where I am. It's confusing.  Yeah, it could potentially be confusing, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not the first time,  this is a very common area people say,  oh no, you want it to customize yourself, but hey.  Right.  I don't know, I tried it.  It was in beta, it's still in beta.  I guess, is Yahoo going to make it public soon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they've got 25,000 beta invites

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that they're giving out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll bet if you go for it right now,  you can get on the beta invites still.  Real quick, huh?  You just use Yahoo all caps as the code.  Okay, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I just, hmm.  It is kind of answers, I think a little bit the question  that everybody's had about Meyer  and what she's gonna do with Yahoo,  whether she's gonna go in the content direction  or the services direction, and she's going in both.  It's very clear.  Yeah, yep.  Big focus on content, mainstream content though.  So, I think she's also looking at what happened at YouTube.  It's pretty clear at this point  that YouTube is a little bit of a failed experiment.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How so?  Well, here's my thinking.  You tell me if I'm wrong.  It came to the forefront doing a few things.  One, sharing copyrighted content like,  NBC Saturday Night Live clips, which NBC hated,  and crotch shot and humorous stuff.  It's been a great place for viral videos.  The real problem with viral videos is  they're pretty much all one shot, one hit wonders.  Now, then for a while, YouTube recognizing this,  see it's a terrible platform for advertisers  because advertisers don't know  what they're gonna get basically.  Am I gonna get a crotch shot?  Am I gonna get a pirated content?  What am I gonna be?  Except they've,  Well, they responded to that by investing $150 million  in channels from people like Shaquille O'Neal.  All of which failed.  So they've retrenched on that, right?  They're reaching out to,  who's successful on YouTube is in mainstream is Ellen.  Cause Ellen DeGeneres puts clips from her TV show  on YouTube and people watch it and they monetize it.  But I don't think that from the point of view of Google,  this is a brand message that is great for them.  So I think that the problem,  when I say failed,  hey, hundreds of millions of people watch videos,  everybody my son's age watches videos all the time.  But the problem for Google is how do you monetize that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess that was what I was wondering how you'd find.  It's not a failure in the sense that people use it.  It's a cultural force.  It's a huge cultural force.  Yeah, and in that way it's absolutely been successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And there are people,  the Jenna Marbles of the world who have,  you know, Petey Pie, giant following.  But Petey Pie is a good example.  Is he still the number one most followed,  most subscribed to channel on YouTube chat?  I think he is.  Yeah, I think he is.  I mean, yeah.  He's a what, Swedish guy who watches,  who plays video games and swears a lot while he's doing it.  And there's a little picture of him doing it.  And you know, Lisa's son, Michael's 11,  lives on Petey Pie videos,  watches them over and over and over again.  How does this help Google in any way?  It helps Petey Pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think people make fun of Petey Pie  because he's so make fun of bowl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but no, no, no, no.  I didn't pick him because he's make fun of bowl.  I pick him because he's the most followed person on YouTube.  By a long shot.  He has three million, three billion video views,  19 million subscribers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And this is just a dude, huh?  That's great.  Well, good for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's good for him in the sense that  he's got a lot of people watching him play video games.  I guess he's making money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's got to be.  He's definitely a partner, right?  I mean, Google's making money on him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's not making as much money as he'd like to be.  I mean, he's not a real,  I mean, maybe he's making hundreds of thousands  of dollars a year.  It's very possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's probably making here that Social Blade,  the network that I have.  What do they say?  They'll estimate it.  And I bet he's making a million.  Yeah, he's making at least 115,000,  at most 1.1 million.  That's a monthly earning, sorry.  Whoa.  Yearly earning is one point.  And this is based off of the lowest CPM  Google or YouTube offers versus the highest CPM they offer.  So one point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, if he's making $16 million a year more power to him,  what does Google get out of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They get 45%.  And so they would get a little bit less than that  just on one user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I just think this is a short-term win,  but in the long run,  are those advertisers getting anything  because Michael watches PewDiePie  over and over and over and over again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely, they're getting the eyeballs they want.  And PewDiePie-  They're getting crap eyeballs.  But PewDiePie is a bad example because there's many-  What's a good example?  Well, let's say Lamar Wilson.  He's created an audience that comes to him every day.  Is he making a lot of money?  I mean, he's making enough money.  Is he making a living?  But there's also 3,000 people that are like him,  and Google and YouTube is making 45% of whatever they do.  I mean, you can do things like the Fine Brothers  who make Kids React videos.  And that's a television,  basically a television show that people are subscribing to.  And that's where I see the future  of that type of entertainment,  is that there is meat there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's about, Google is always about scale.  The weird thing about Google to me is  if they would reduce that percentage down to 25%,  they would multiply the size of the talent pool  and what goes on there.  And they would end up netting more.  And yeah, they're being a little greedy.  The network economics are take out as little as you can  to make it grow as big as possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and we have somebody in the chat room,  Sam Harrelson, says he runs an ad agency.  He says, I assure you advertisers are getting lots  from YouTube if you do a tad bit of work  to keep things relevant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is a key point.  They often don't, but I think Sam's quite correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I gotta tell you,  advertisers don't get a lot from NFL football.  I mean, it's very easy to buy an ad,  to spend millions on an ad that doesn't change anything  around you.  I just, it feels like, okay, it could be that really  I come from an out of touch era in terms of content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would say this is as digital native as you can get.  I agree, that's for sure.  Like here's someone you've never heard of.  His name is AntVenom.  He makes Minecraft videos.  Two million people subscribe to him.  And most of his videos have over, you know.  YouTube's numbers to me.  Still, I don't think, they may be a little bit squishy,  the numbers, in that if you click on it  and then leave within five minutes.  I think YouTube's numbers are way over inflated.  They may be over inflated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think YouTube's benefit to an advertiser is questionable.  I just wonder if it's a long term,  if it really could survive long term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You built a business on.  We do something really different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no, I'm not saying web video's bad.  I'm not saying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're saying the content on YouTube is what's bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel like content, the YouTube model  is a failed model.  But obviously the evidence is against that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's like medium versus blogger, that kind of thing.  Yeah, it's very much like that.  Yeah.  Okay, so it's what medium or blogger?  Well, who's the winner there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who's the winner in that comparison?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, well, the idea that medium has high quality content,  that it looks beautiful and attracts a high quality audience,  however you want to define that.  And blogger is just like a bunch of junk  that people started FTPing up to the web in 1990.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  At zero cost to Google at huge volume  and in pockets high engaged.  Is Google happy with YouTube?  They say they are, but what else can they say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, but I mean, I wonder, do you think they are?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they're trying to still figure it out.  I think that looking at what they've spent money on  and what they're focusing on,  they definitely feel like they're not there yet.  And that they do need to shift things going forward.  But I think that may be easier than all of us expect  because the gaming community on YouTube exploded out of nowhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  because of a few changes that they did to the algorithm.  I would guess that that's really for YouTube, for Google,  a lot of what YouTube represents is more a way  to see how stuff works than it is something.  I guess they make money on it, right?  So, who am I to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I remember a couple years ago being at,  pardon me for this, Davos with Chad, then Hurley,  and Marissa and Eric, and Eric saying,  we're pleased with the direction  and it just started making money.  Don't forget, it was in great measure  a defensive move by Yahoo, so nobody else got it.  They became kings of video in that sense.  No, are they kings like Hulu?  No, but Hulu's, I would argue that Hulu's  more of a failure than...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think they're struggling a lot more.  It's apparent they are.  Their parent company keeps trying to sell it  or figure out what to do with it.  Ironically, Hulu looks a lot more like traditional media.  YouTube, to a traditional media guy like me,  looks like chaos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's, so is the web.  So is the web.  If you're gonna look for a new model,  you have to look at Netflix.  I think the beginnings of it at Netflix,  Tim Wu had an amazing story in The New Republic  about how Netflix is reinventing the world as we know it.  And it's something I'm dear to my heart talking about  is the notion of the value of signals.  Right.  And that's what Netflix is beginning to do,  and that's what Google understands better than anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, YouTube is all about signals for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.  So I think that if we see Google as a signal monopoly,  and I'm involved in a company now...  Man, that's a good point.  In the same way Twitter is.  Yes, yes.  Each in their own way.  And so, full disclosure here is I'm about to start,  I think, advising and maybe even investing  in a company called Infinite Analytics  that came my way from Sir Tim Berners-Lee  that potentially can break the signal monopoly  by those of us who don't have it, a warrant in it,  media companies, commerce companies, and so on.  And if you can start to understand people's signals  so you can give them better relevance,  get better engagement, get higher value,  that's where media to my mind goes.  It's not about content, it's about signals  and relationships with people  and the value you can return as a result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, except for the person who consumes the media  doesn't think it's about signals,  it's not about content for viewers.  So they do when it's about relevance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They do when it's about relevance.  When I go ask Google for pizza,  if the old days of Yahoo, you ask about pizza,  you're gonna get a treat this on pizza.  You ask Google for pizza.  It says here's where you can get some.  And what you're gonna get with jelly, I don't know yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, I'm wrong, I stand corrected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you're not wrong.  You're not wrong, it's fine, but I think-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the reason this came up is because it struck me  that what Marissa Meyer was trying to do at Yahoo  was the anti-YouTube, which was a highly curated,  safer place for advertisers to spend their money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That has always been Yahoo's-  With known brands and known content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. With volume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And known names. And known names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And not at all a digital native.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no. Well, except the Tumblr acquisition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tumblr is, yeah, yeah, yeah, Tumblr is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But even Tumblr, doesn't Tumblr, to some extent,  Gina, match your matter versus blogger comparison?  That Tumblr is more about trying to curate quality,  or is that ridiculous, because I don't use it much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I don't know where Tumblr lands  on the quality spectrum, probably somewhere in the middle.  But yeah, Tumblr does seem to be more about curating  and reblogging, right, than anything else.  But Tumblr has a nice aesthetic,  it has a very creative community,  and I'm making broad generalizations here.  There are lots of different kinds of Tumblrs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you think Yahoo sees Tumblr as just an ad platform  with millions of eyeballs they can play ads to,  or something larger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know, I mean, I like to think that Tumblr  is somewhere in the Flickr bucket of like,  you know, tools for creatives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That could be a bad place to be in the Flickr bucket.  It's not been a good bucket to be in for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Look, Flickr is getting incrementally a little better.  It has had some changes since Meyer took the helm  that the mobile apps got a refresh,  the photo layouts are getting better.  Look, it's not, Google Plus does a lot better work  with photos at this point.  I look forward to awesome videos,  a lot more than Flickr notifications,  and I use both extensively.  But you know, Flickr hasn't gone away.  I still have a real soft spot for Flickr.  I use it for my kids' photos.  And so I don't know, I like to think that Tumblr  is in the Flickr bucket, and I also like to think  that Meyer is going to continue to refine those tools  and focus on them and make them kind of capture  that audience of, those are kind of creative digital natives  with a certain kind of aesthetic.  And I think that those are good monetizable,  that's a good monetizable audience as well.  But then there's also the weather app  and the news app that they're launching.  So, and you know, things like Aviate.  So it's interesting to see what they're doing.  I mean, she's obviously trying to get tools out there  that have the Yahoo name kind of relevant again  on our devices, on our home screens.  And you know, I don't know, maybe she is taking a cue.  They are taking a cue from something like YouTube,  where they're going more curated, more high quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Understand that I wear two different hats in all of this,  which one is the, you know, as a pundit,  I'm supposed to have an opinion on everything.  And so, you know, that's an opinion.  But then as a reporter, reporter and journalist,  there is this fascinating thing that I think should continue,  which is that people are trying all sorts of stuff.  There's more experimentation.  There's more creativity.  Well, and this reporter in you is being skeptical,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  which is right.  You should be, you're-  I'm skeptical of everything, of course.  You're skeptical, that's right.  Yes, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I, yeah, anyway, you know, of course,  one of the things I fear as a business owner is Yahoo Tech,  because that's the closest thing to what we do here at Twit,  although not that close.  Really, I'd be more afraid if I were Buzzfeed  than I find, than anything else.  This is the front page of the new Yahoo Tech,  launched very, in a timely fashion during CES.  That's the best time, if you're going to get people, get them now.  There's an overwhelming amount of news.  Very up worthy in some of its headlines.  A lot of this gadget can control your iPhone  without even touching it.  And, you know, this enormous phone battery,  allegedly lasts more than two days.  Is this Razr the last one you'll ever buy?  Very up worthy in its feeling.  Very.  And its design, you know, I mean,  look at that front page with the owl going,  ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.  The sassiest birds on the internet,  ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So are we, have we officially coined the term up worthy  to describe these times, like, is it up worthy,  or it's not Buzzfeed?  Well, same thing.  At least with up worthy, it's positive content.  It's totally positive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, so listen, this is a typical.  Every parent's three biggest Facebook fears  and what to do about them.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's up worthy you're reading from.  That's up, no, that's Yahoo tech.  No, that's Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Gina, while we were gone,  we had the up worthy story generator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's an up worthy story generator  we used while you were gone.  And I think Buzzfeed,  my one New Year's resolution is not to click  on any lists again.  Listicles, yeah.  No lists.  But up worthy, or stories, things that tell you  how you're gonna feel after you click.  That's up worthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You won't believe.  Yeah, you won't believe.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Here's your morning cry, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This isn't quite that bad,  but it's clear that their headline writer is,  there's something going on with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, stay on this for a second.  I haven't written a post about this yet.  But this notion of manipulation,  that we go from search engine optimization  to human brain optimization.  And we look at the catalogs of ways  we're trying to be manipulated.  And so up worthy is one, this is how you'll feel.  Buzzfeed is one, oh, there's one acute list.  You can't avoid clicking on this  and you're gonna pass it around.  A native advertising is one we're gonna fool you  and make you think this is content.  It's all a form of manipulation.  If you go back to what I said earlier about signals,  there's a small bridge between cynicism and reality there,  where giving me something that's targeted to me  so that I will engage with it more  because I value it more, I say that's good.  Giving me something that cynically says  they're gonna manipulate me into clicking on something  that I'm gonna be disappointed in,  but they got something out of it, that's bad.  The latter is a mass media model.  The more we can fool people to click, the better we are.  Slideshows, Drudge, all that stuff.  The former, I would argue, is a Google model  where in the long run, they know that if they're evil  and misuse this power they have, they'll lose us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a very thin line.  I mean, look, every product,  editorial is this type of product, right?  So every product, you design it with the idea of like,  how are your customers or your users gonna feel?  We're going through this with ThinkUp right now.  I mean, we're agonizing over every word  because you wanna be evocative, right?  You wanna create some sort of feeling.  Mostly you wanna create delight.  I mean, Jobs talked about this all the time  with the iPod and that kind of thing,  but you don't wanna be manipulative.  You wanna be evocative with a purpose, right?  So it's like cotton candy versus broccoli,  maybe broccoli with a little butter.  It's like, what are you actually giving your consumers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the metrics are everything  because if you measure yourself by gross tonnage,  then you're gonna do what BuzzFeed does  and you can get a lot of tonnage that way.  If you measure yourself by the outcomes in your user's life,  did they accomplish what they wanted to accomplish  and they're better off for it,  then you have a valuable product.  You may not have the right way to monetize that,  yes or no, but you'll have something  that somebody values from you.  And there's a big difference there.  And then it's the mass media way of tonnage,  I think is still corrupting the net.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Leave it to me to say something to lead to silence.  I specialize in that show.  Yeah, that's the silent.  What the hell do you say after that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm translating it into German in my mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's profound, but you know, no, it's true.  And it kind of segues a little bit  into the rap genius story a little bit.  Let's get to that.  Yeah, TechCrunch's headline  was about growth hacking gone bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, let's take a break and do that.  And I do wanna get Matt Cutts on  to talk about rap genius at some point soon  because that was his ban.  He was a little booked today, but he was almost on.  Little busy, busy, busy.  We'll get him next week maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I listened to all the shows, by the way,  while I was gone.  It was both luxurious and frustrating to be a listener.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you wanna get on there and say something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was on the subway listening to it.  And I really loved the episode that Matt was on.  I'd love to have him back on, but yeah, it was fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and I could just say in the other side,  we really missed your input.  We did really truly.  It's not the same without you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You guys are too nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by the folks at Atlassian.  They make a product called Jira.  And I think that that name comes from the Japanese name  for Godzilla, Gojira.  What is Jira?  It's the project management solution.  One of the world's most powerful and customizable issue  in project management systems out there.  It captures and organizes your workflow  so you can prioritize and take action on what's important  while staying up to date with activity going on around you.

Jira gives your team a simple intuitive interface  for collaborating with each other in real time.  You can integrate all your planning documents  from all your sources, your backlog, your issues,  your code repository.  Yes, it works with all the big ones,  including our favorite GitHub, Git rather.  Set up any business process you can imagine  so your team can work the way you want.  You can stay in the loop with notifications from email,  chat, at replies, RSS, monitor streams of activity.  Of course, it's got self-updating reports and dashboards,  so you just keep those running  and you're always in the know.  Just so, so sweet.  Thousands of Jira add-ons are out there  from many, many, many millions of Jira users,  including test management, time tracking,  project management, lots of other uses.  25,000 companies, 70% of the Fortune 100, NASA,  they all use Jira.  If you're going to Mars, you need Jira.  And of course, you can build onto Jira yourself  with the Atlassian REST APIs.  Make it very, very simple.

Atlassian Jira, A-T-L-A-S-S-I-A-N dot com slash twig  for more information.  And we thank them for their support of this week in Google.  I don't do, I don't, I'm not an enterprise guy.  I have to get Father Robert to explain  all this to me sometime.  Although as we run our business,  I start to understand what complexity means.  Holy cow, holy cow.  Rap genius, what is rap genius?  It was started by some Yale guys.  And it was, I think, kind of a, I don't know,  have you ever used it, Gina?  It was kind of a comedy site to begin with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't, I guess I'm not hip enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jake, my son Jake said to me, before all this broke,  a couple days before, he said, you know,  Pa, you really need to look at, he didn't call me Pa.  Pa, hey Pa.  That's what I call my father.  You really need to look at this thing  because it's a really interesting form.  And it was a lyric site.  It's kind of a Wikipedia for hip hop.  With annotation.  Yeah.  But then it takes anything else,  you can annotate anything else.  So some authors are putting up chapters of their books  and annotating them, not as footnotes,  but as background material and explanation.  You can put up a government statement and annotate it.  It becomes a very interesting form for journalism.  Let me look at this, so, go, go, go, go, go, go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go shorty, it's your birthday.  We gonna party like it's your birthday.  We gonna sip Bacardi like it's your birthday.  And you know, we don't give a,  cause it's not your birthday.  You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub.  Look, mammy, I got the X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you into taking drugs, I'm into having sex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I ain't into making love.  So come give me a hug if you're into getting rubbed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This guy sounds like a creep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  White-est people on earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I don't see no annotations.  Let's see, this is good, this is good.  So I would go here if I'm listening to a song  and I'm trying to understand, you know, what this means.  It's a lyric site.  Yeah, but it annotates it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, then anything else,  it's a platform that lets you annotate anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada,  that BCBG Burberry, Dolce and Gabada.  And then, okay, the other foolish men.  Is it like annotations that explain the...  I was hoping that, but it doesn't...  The phrases, like an urban dictionary built into...  Well, here's one.  I could care less how she perform when she in the bed.  Get that rack, catch a date, and come pay the kid.  So apparently in this annotation,  evidently 50 Cent does not care about customer satisfaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So do you remember when Groupon CEO Andrew Mason  did his farewell letter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, he left it back to something in our context.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some people annotated this, so he has each...  So I'm posting it publicly,  because it's gonna leak anyway, and you click it,  it says this is a wink to, among the others,  the pre-IPO...  Caris Swisher.  Leaked thing, and then after three and a half,  four intense years, and then it provides  a whole bunch of stuff about like,  well, they were valued at 16.7 billion  when Google tried to buy them for 6 billion.  But now they're no...  This is useful, forget the rap lyrics.  Absolutely, and then it says,  he's decided to take off time  to spend more time with his family,  and it links to Wikipedia articles about the first time  that I'm gonna go spend time with my family  was ever used in a letter,  to say that he's stepping down as a company.  And any of these yellow things are written by users,  and any of the green things are links back  to other articles or other things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you go to...  Chad, I just put one up, a lyric one up on the rundown  in the chat.  If you go to The Weeknd, Jake is a huge fan of The Weeknd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Weeknd, that's a band or that's a song?  It's a song, singer.  Singer, The Weeknd, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, adaptation lyrics.  So if you go down, it says,  I lay my head on a thousand beds.  You click on that, it just has a picture of him  and talking about the tour life, right?  So you get a sense of the inside of the lyrics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there you go.  That's rap genius, ladies and gentlemen.  Couple of Yale boys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Enabled us. Enabled us.  So that was a wonderful thing.  It's really pretty cool, and it was growing like crazy.  But then, are you gonna pick up the story now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they decided they wanted to grow faster,  so they did something called SEO,  except that there's SEO and there's SEO,  and there's Black Hat SEO,  and they did things like giving people mentions  for blogging about them, things like that.  And they came to the attention  of the world famous Matt Cutts, who delisted them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You don't wanna do that.  Yeah.  So they would go to bloggers and say,  if you link to our site from your site,  then I think we'll tweet about you.  It was link trading, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And he, it was a growth hack.  That's what they called it.  A growth hack.  A growth hack.  Oh, God.  So Matt did delist them, and huge drop in,  by the way, rap genius responded, but a huge drop.  They immediately called them.  It went from 700,000 views to 100,000 views in a minute,  you know, whatever it was.  They wrote an open letter to Google  about rap genius SEO by the founders,  and the TLDR, we effed up.  Other lyric sites are almost definitely doing worse stuff,  and we'll stop.  We'd love, we'd love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They really needed to rearrange the order of that sentence.  Yeah.  Okay, I can't stand apologies  that are not contrite enough.  Either apologize and be contrite, or don't.  Well, but you know what they're saying is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  this is a very competitive environment,  this lyric site thing, and they're all cheating,  so we felt we had to cheat.  It's the Lance Armstrong defense.  We'd love for Google to take a closer look  at the whole lyric search landscape  and see whether it can make changes  that would improve lyric search results.  So they explained what they did,  and actually Google responded by unblocking them.  Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to have made a difference.  At least according to an article here  on Search Engine Watch by Jennifer Slag,  the lyric site fails to recover traffic  after the Google penalty.  Once, here's the graph, by the way,  so you can see the uniques.  Once Google allowed rap genius back in the index  after they cleaned up the bad backlink profile,  which largely involved them nuking  their poor quality backlinks,  they went from 700,000 uniques a day to 100,000  according to Quantcast in the delisting,  but now they're only 400,000.  So they've still lost 50% of their total,  and they haven't recovered from it, at least so far.  In the end, she writes,  rap genius only lost their Google rankings  for slightly over a week,  something that's definitely on the extremely short side  of penalty links.  So it would appear they were getting special help  from Google to resolve the issues.  That's why I want to get Matt on to talk about it.  Perhaps because they're funded by Andreessen Horowitz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're gonna end up better off as a business,  because they're gonna end up not with cheap,  like what we said before, mass horrible traffic,  cynically raised versus honest to God relationships of value.  In the long run, I believe the latter is gonna work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We see the same thing in podcasting.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What are the tricks?  What are the tricks in podcasting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yeah, what do you mean, Leo?  What do you mean?  Everybody else sounds like it.  This sounds like a good story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I was at New Media Expo on Monday,  and I keynoted a panel, which I didn't realize,  but we actually broadcast,  so it was kind of an industry insider panel,  but one of the people on the panel was Norm Pattis,  who was the founder of Westwood One,  the big radio syndicator.  He's a radio legend.  He's in the Hall of Fame and everything.  And he started a company called Podcast One.  And we were talking backstage,  and we were talking about metrics,  because of course, any ad-supported media like this,  we sell ads.  The way we bill our advertisers,  as we say, you had a certain number of impressions.  They call it in radios, cost per thousand, or CPM.  And we charge $70 or $80 per thousand listens,  which is very high.  Radio charges about $10.  But we think we're worth it.  And apparently I'm-  What do you charge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  $80, wow, that's really high.  That's good, that's premium, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah, well, we feel like we're a premium product,  and advertisers seem to agree.  And my position's always been, look,  but that's tied to the numbers.  We have to give you download numbers,  and we say, well, in this case of this show,  70,000 people downloaded it,  so it's 70,000 times, actually 70 times 80  is the cost for an ad.  But Norm went, oh yeah,  because we use PodTrack as the number generator.  He said, oh yeah, we don't like them.  I said, what?  He said, they count uniques.  I said, oh, well yeah,  they count unique individual downloads.  What do you count?  So it turns out, and this is true of a lot of people,  they count every time that file gets hit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's page views versus visits.  Yes.  In web parlance, yeah.  Yeah, they're hits.  You know how you sometimes say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  yeah, that site had a million hits.  Well yeah, because each person who loads that site  gives you 30 hits because they're hitting over.  It's almost identical in podcasting.  Various podcast downloaders and so forth  will hit the file many times instead of once.  So what we do is we count each unique IP address.  Now, that gives you an under count in some cases.  Microsoft, for instance, everybody who listens  at Microsoft comes in under the same IP address.  We count them once.  So it could be 10,000 people listening at Microsoft.  We don't know.  But we've decided that we want to use  the lower conservative provable number.  And then that's one of the reasons our CPMs are high  and then bill accordingly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He charges $10 CPMs but uses this magic number  that is very high.  And we could use that number.  It's usually five times higher or 10 times higher.  But that's how podcasts, a lot of podcasts,  when you hear this, we have a million users  or a million listeners, that's what the number they're quoting.  So that's not at all unusual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's also the issue of you have clients,  like pod catchers, that will automatically download  a new episode, but it's not necessarily a listen, right?  There's no way to tell someone to actually listen  to the MP3.  So actually your under counts might be sort of washed.  There might be a wash, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  And ultimately, the only thing that matters  is the advertiser paid X amount of dollars  and he got this much value out of it.  And if we're overcharging, they won't come back.  And if we're undercharging, then we don't get  what we think we deserve.  So it's a very, you work hard to do this right.  And my position's always been we want a win-win, basically.  We're no good if we don't win for our advertiser  and vice versa.  And the advertiser has to be a win for our audience.  So it's a win-win-win.  Everybody has to be good for everybody.  How did I get into this?  So the point being that every industry has cheating.  Has its tricks.  And what happens with cheating is it makes it much harder  for those who don't cheat.  And the intense pressure, I guess the analog is sports,  is Lance Armstrong, is the performance enhancing drug era  of baseball, is if everybody's using PEDs,  there's intense pressure on you to do so as well.  Because you can't compete.  Right?  Yeah.  So I can understand Rap Genius saying,  hey, everybody cheats, we gotta cheat too.  And sometimes being the honest guy is not the way to succeed  because they could just disappear.  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Long and boring explanation.  I'm sorry I brought it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, I was like, I wanted to hear the podcasting dirt.  But in that case, look, this is why you sit  in the big chair, right?  I mean, the case of being able to charge a higher price  for fewer numbers, that's a quality product.  That's proof that your audience is more valuable versus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, we're sold out.  Many of our shows are already sold out  for the first quarter, right, Lisa?  She's not paying attention.  What are we doing wrong on Twig?  Hey, Lisa, how's Twig's sales for Q1?  Looking really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Transparency in action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're actually gonna do an inside Twitter later on.  We'll fill you in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I won't believe it until I see that sponsored burrito,  dammit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Many of our shows are sold out.  But sold out, another thing that we do  that others don't do, that's three ads for Twig.  Yeah, you limit.  You limit.  Yeah, yeah, don't say that that loud.  She says it's really six ads.  And the reason it's six ads is  because the billboards count as an ad.  We even count that.  So at the beginning of every show, as you know,  we say, you know, brought to you by, blah, blah, blah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and you get a little 10 second.  That's what the viewer cares about.  That's what real people care about, right.  Yeah, yeah.  And I remember, what's his name?  My good friend from Rev3, President of Rev3.  Jim Lutterback.  Thank you, Jim.  Back in the days of Dignation, he bragged about,  and I'm sure you have the same there,  an incredibly high unaided recall of sponsors,  of who sponsors the show and what their message is.  Yeah, well, we have to.  But the relationship of you reading the spot  and talking about it and not really interrupting the show,  but it's true data advertising in a sense,  but it's well labeled and known.  You say it's time to go to a sponsor,  and that's what we have,  but that that has a higher impact than just slapping 87  avails at you, which is another way to gain the system.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And by the way, I just want you to know,  ours are even higher.  I bet they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jim says theirs were 105%.  I don't know how you're.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Perfect, plus Google buys Timely,  my favorite alarm clock app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Your favorite alarm clock app  is probably not gonna get a lot of development done on it  for a while, unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was it an Acquahire?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's Acquahire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Damn, nation.  You know what I like, Timely,  besides it's beautiful, blah, blah, blah,  is that it's synced with all my other devices.  So this is really, this is a huge value.  Maybe not, maybe people don't have multiple Android devices,  but I did.  And so when my alarm goes off in my bedroom,  it goes off all over the house.  The tablets go off, the other phones go off,  because they're all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Lisa, the dogs.  Everything goes off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I will not, I cannot oversleep anymore.  That's a good thing for an alarm clock.  So I'm, yeah, I mean, it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Any app that properly implements  cross-device syncing real time is a good app in my book.  So cool.  That's a relatively new API.  Is it?  Relatively, like no-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it uses Google, it uses your Google account as the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, to store data.  Yeah, that's relatively the last couple of years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does it store it like kind of in your Google Drive?  Where does it store that data?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do think that it's your, I do think it's Drive.  I think it's like a hidden secret kind of Drive, but yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What a clever way to do that.  Yeah, indeed.  Yeah, like the game I really like, Clash of Clans.  The same thing, as soon as you log into your Google ID,  it says, oh yeah, okay, and that,  and it's kind of like the game,  play games or whatever the center game thing is.  But I think it's all-  Play games, yeah.  It's all underneath that, right?  It's all, yeah, same API.  By the way, you will be seeing Android in your cars soon.  GM, Honda, and Audi are all gonna do Android  instead of Microsoft Car or QNX as their telematics system.  Big win for Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's kind of a response to the Apple partnerships, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, except I don't think, I think it's different  because the Apple, as far as I know,  when your car is Apple-fied,  it doesn't mean your car has been running iOS all along.  It means there's an interface to the data from iOS  and the screen can be put up on the screen.  This, if I'm not mistaken,  means that Android is the underlying  operating system of the car.  Now, maybe I'm wrong, but I think that's the deal.  It was Microsoft Car, that's looking very dated.  That's what Ford uses, and it was starting to get dated.  Google created the Open Automotive Alliance,  kind of an analog to their Open Handset Alliance,  which is what Android is on phones.  And I believe the plan is to have Android  run the infotainment system,  or the telematic systems in these cars.  That makes sense, it's a free operating system.  And is it open, really?  Yeah, the same way Open Handset Alliance is open.  No, it's not open, why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a marketing term.  Open, not like, as in a door is open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Come on in.  Can I make you some tea?  Blackberry owns the other biggie, which is QNX, oddly enough.  Maybe some of this flight to Android  is fear that what will happen with Blackberry and QNX.  I don't, I mean, in 2009, BMW, GM,  and Intel announced the Geneva Alliance,  I'm sorry, Alliance, based on Linux.  See, Android is Linux, I think this makes perfect sense.  And you're already involved in that, and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I cannot wait for the Chrome car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I hope it works better than your Chromebook,  is all I can say.  Ah, shh, shh, shh, pah.  How many, how many is it now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On number three.  What's wrong, mine's fine.  Well, I used mine maybe too much.  Oh yeah, you used mine.  The first one had a weird sound thing,  where it would get out of phase,  and I talked to the product manager for Pixels today,  it was very nice that he called, introduced by somebody,  it wasn't, I asked for no special treatment,  I got no special treatment.  Boy, I did say I was gonna, when I was having problems,  I said, I'm gonna talk about this stuff on Twig,  that was, see you're warned.  Oh.  So, that one, they replaced it immediately, that's good,  and then the screen on the next one  went completely black when I opened it up.  And the problem was, it happened two days before New Year's,  which supposedly the order went into me,  at least supposedly it was shipped to me,  but it wasn't, so I was a week without a machine.  I was using my old poor Samsung toy,  my Tonka Chromebook.  Tonka book.  Yeah, Tonka book, right, I like that.  And so I just got, I got,  in fact, I had thought that no one,  someone else was using my IO book,  so I finally got that one out,  and saved myself two days at that time.  And the product manager said that there was a problem  with some screens that they knew,  and they thought they caught them all,  where, I didn't know this, that the Chromebook,  most laptops have the LCD and then put glass in front of it.  Chromebooks and like your phones,  laminate them together into one.  So it gives you less depth.  Yeah, but you have to replace the whole stuff.  But then you have to replace the whole thing.  So yeah, and I think the problem with the Chromebook,  well, the problem I really had in the end  was the fulfillment, it wasn't the ninjas,  it was the fulfillment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're gonna have lots more choice.  Lenovo's announced that they're gonna get heavy  into Chromebooks this year,  and in a variety of price points and configurations,  which I think is something that's been missing.  You've had the very low end, you've had the Pixel,  be great to have a mid-range Chromebook with touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Asus, in fact, I was almost getting ready to buy,  they're so cheap, I was getting ready to buy one  for the use of the week, I was so desperate to buy one.  They are so cheap, yeah.  The Asus C720P is their touchscreen version at 300 bucks.  The non-touchscreen is 200 bucks.  And people rave about it, and it's a good machine,  it's solid, it has well, it's only two gigs,  but people seem to rave about it,  and I think you are gonna get that mid-$300, $400  having a lot of the features.  Now, the guy at Google, Kevin today, said,  well, when we have people have a bad experience,  we offer them something, we offer them a play certificate,  or we offer them this.  I said, no, I don't want anything,  I don't wanna have any treatment here,  even though you say it's not a special treatment.  I said, don't give me anything.  And I said, you know what you can do for me, Kevin?  You can wink at me when I tell you how much  I wanna have a new version of a Chromebook  with Haswell in it.  He wouldn't play my game.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you find that you touch the screen a lot, Jeff?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a really interesting thing, yeah,  because here's what happened.  I didn't realize how much I do it,  because when I was off of it, I was not just reaching for it,  but I was getting carpal tunnel,  because what I do it for is when I'm in Twitter  or things like that, or stories,  I end up mainly to scroll, not to point so much,  but to scroll, and it relieves the hand pressure you get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, interesting, interesting.  Yeah, I'm turning around a little bit on the Chromebook.  My wife handed in her laptop,  which was her work laptop when we left San Diego,  and so I gave her the Pixel and said, good luck.  And she loves it.  And she loves it.  You're on your own, honey.  Wow.  She loves it.  We hang out, we hang out on it all the time.  She's at her mother's right now, so I see the baby,  and she's job searching on it,  and doing cover letters and resume,  the whole thing, and drive.  And she's somewhat paranoid about Google.  She doesn't like the idea of Google having all of her stuff.  She uses Yahoo mail as a matter of principle,  not all of her eggs in one basket,  so she's sort of sufficiently skeptical,  which is why I love her.  But yeah, no, she's been loving the Pixel.  And it's funny, we moved and we had to ship some stuff,  and she wound up throwing the Pixel  into a priority mailbox.  And she was like, oh, no, it's a Chromebook.  It's only like 200 bucks, right?  I was like, that was the Pixel,  which is a $1,500 computer.  She was like, whoa, but it arrived safely  and all was fine.  But it looks like the Chromebook sold really well  over the holiday season too.  First and third bestselling laptop on Amazon.  Yeah, but I don't know what that means.  And there was that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you feel like, is Amazon a good,  in terms of the price?  Yeah, I mean, it's a good deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, is Amazon a good indicator?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's price.  It's all about price.  It's price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think it's growing, because it's one of schools,  education, they're making huge inroads.  I see schools that install 1,800, 2,000 Chromebooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do feel like it is the right choice  for a school, for education.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think some companies are starting to realize  this is a lot cheaper way.  It's a good thing for a salesperson.  It's, they're talking to the cloud,  they're talking to Salesforce or whatever.  And so I think we're seeing companies,  some companies starting to go in.  And then I think that it's starting  to become a grandmother machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a perfect grandma machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hate to imagine, I was gonna think about it  for my father, and I thought, no,  just to try to explain the notion of the cloud  to him would be more than life.  Where's my stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thanks for this $200 laptop.  So when you gave it to your wife,  you didn't say, it's 1,500.  You gotta get, you gotta go for the,  get some credit, get the points.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I look, I said to her, look,  this is a really nice machine.  I showed her the little thing with the rainbow lights.  I was like, how cool this is, you know.  She appreciated that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look, it's our machine.  It's our machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you didn't, this shows you how out of touch she is.  She didn't look at the unibody aluminum construction,  the four by three aspect ratio, the touch screen,  and say, this must be a premium laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She did not, she did not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She was like, oh, it's the $200 one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If I had handed her a Tonka book,  I handed her the Pixel and she's like,  okay, let's try this, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's okay, it's okay.  It's all right.  I'll just throw it in the box, mail it back east.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, right, she didn't even carry it with her on the plane.  She was like, I got too much baby stuff.  I'll just ship it.  No, I'm just like, okay.  She's in, but now she loves it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Underscore normal person.  Normal person.  This is how normal people are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but she took to it really, really well.  I was surprised.  I'm waiting for her to say, like, how do I start up office?  But I think that she's gotten out of that.  She worked at a big university and they were all Microsoft.  It was Exchange and Office and the whole thing  and she hasn't gotten there.  She grabbed her documents and yeah.  That's actually really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm trying to convince my new dean  to listen to the tech guy and switch to docs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's a great way to go for education.  Yes.  Let's do the change log and then we can wrap things up.  What do you say?  We've missed it.  You know, we didn't do it without you.  It's just not the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I heard that one episode you said, well, if Gina was here,  this would be in the change log and I went, oh.  But she's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, we welcome back the trumpets  because it's time once again for the Google,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we'll let him say it.  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And now ladies and gentlemen, all new for 2014.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I decided not to include everything that's happened  all through December.  Thank you.  That was a lot.  And there actually wasn't really a whole lot  in the past two weeks.  Oh, my magic mouse.  I'm sliding all over the rundown here.  But we got one new thing and a couple of shutdowns.  First, Google launched a new G plus auto backup utility  for your desktop.  So on your mobile phones, on iOS and an Android,  good the Google plus app has this auto backup  that automatically stores your photos up to Google plus.  You can now do that from your desktop.  If you download the latest version of Picasso  for windows or Mac, there's a separate app in there  called Google plus auto backup.  It's got the same icon that you see in Google plus.  It's separate app from Picasso.  And you tell it what folders to look at on your desktop.  If you've got a SIM card, any sort of drive  that's attached to your computer.  And it does exactly what the auto backup mobile app does.  It uploads all your photos.  And then you get all the auto awesome goodness  along with that.  So pretty cool.  I have to say, I really love the auto awesome stuff,  especially around videos.  I'm taking a lot more videos of my daughter  and it really, it takes, you know,  you don't have to edit it all.  And it actually comes out,  the video comes out pretty nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have all three, both of you received  your 2013 auto awesome film?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, it was surprisingly good.  So amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was, it actually led with the photo of us at Google I O,  which made me really happy.  That was in mine as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It went to lead with it.  It's so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's got a lot of responses.  I think that they ranked the photos by, you know,  how people, it must've been that  because I think that photo went around.  Most of my photos are private.  So there's not a lot of signal there to measure,  but yeah, it was pretty good.  It was pretty good.  It was a nice, although the snow falling thing drove me nuts.  I love the 2013 app up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, too many people put snow on too many things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I, you know, I heard you guys say on the show  that Google plus was doing it.  If you, if you shook your camera,  I shook your phone after you took the picture.  I was completely unaware of that,  but a bunch of my photos had snow on them.  Oh yeah.  It doesn't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was like, that's why that happened.  Like, so clearly I can't hold my hand still.  Cause a bunch of my photos had,  so to a couple of shutdowns,  along with that, that's the only new, really new thing.  No more location history dashboard.  I knew this was going to make you sad Leo,  because I know you'd love this.  Yes.  Google latitude, where you check in  or track your location,  there was a dashboard that would let you visualize.  And I think we've even looked at yours, Leo,  how much time you spend at work,  how much time you spend at home.  Google's killing the dashboard.  Google does, is not erasing the data.  They say you can continue to view  and manage your location history information.  You go to maps.google.com slash location history,  but we removed the location history dashboard,  the part of the location history website  with the summary of your locations  and miles traveled and trip information.  They're not deleting any raw data.  They're just rethinking the dashboard.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, what they're rethinking is,  gee, we really shouldn't let people know  how much we know about their location.  Cause it's not like they're,  yeah, they're not getting rid of the data.  Yeah.  So the point of the dashboard is to let people know  how much they know about my location  and then let me use the data that you already have.  If they said, oh, we decided not to keep that data anymore,  then I could see it.  But I think the dashboards are critical  to letting users know what Google knows.  And I think it just.  Yeah, actually that's a good point.  It's bad PR for them.  That's why they got rid of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm, oh, okay.  So you think people looked at that dashboard  and got freaked?  Yes.  Because people got freaked?  Yes.  Yeah.  Oh, no, that's a valid theory.  I'm kind of anti-dashboards at this point.  I came to this place with ThinkUp  where we built this dashboard.  I think a dashboard, you look at a dashboard,  you like look cool charts,  and it gives you kind of a shot in the light,  like initially, but unless you're really obsessed  with the data set, you never go back and look at it again.  And I think that dashboards kind of rely on you  to interpret the information.  Although I know Google did some cool stuff,  like, oh, you travel this many times around the moon  or whatever in the past three years,  which kind of translates the data into something.  I just think there's a better way than dashboards to show.  And this is what we're working on with ThinkUp  to give you kind of insights into that data.  But you might be right, Leo, it might be a PR,  but this makes me worried though.  Like they have the raw data  and now they're just taking away my view into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't that the point of dashboard?  If you go to google.com slash dashboard,  the point of it is to show what Google,  I mean, really is to show what Google knows about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  And so I don't want to see them moving away from,  I want to see them moving toward being more transparent  about what they know and what they're compiling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, this is all the stuff Google knows about me,  but now when I go to location,  what this used to give me at least something valuable.  Is it over already or is it still, no, it's still here.  So I can at least still show you what you got.  This is amazing stuff.  I can go back to a date  and watch me move around Petaluma for that day,  you know, the places I went.  I wonder if I go back to Europe.  Boy, wouldn't that be cool.  Let's go to Turkey.  I was in Turkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you know that they still have this data internally.  When they take away the user facing dashboard,  it's internally they still have this dashboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's kind of my point is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  if you're going to have this,  you better darn well show it to me.  And yeah, if it crosses the creepy line, guess what?  It crosses the creepy line, right?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the optimistic part of me thinks  that they probably saw that not a lot of users  were looking at the dashboard very much  and they don't want to maintain a user facing product  that isn't getting the use and that they're going to launch,  they're going to offer something better.  That's what I'm hoping.  I'm hoping that it's not the, this is bad PR for us.  So let's just pull it down.  I hope you're right.  But yeah, yeah.  Also another fatality,  I guess that's a little more of extreme way to put it.  Schemer, I don't know if you remember Schemer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was my tool for a twig many moons ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it was, it was.  So this is reported by,  says Google operating system says that an internal version  of the Schemer site says that it's going to be shut down.  So there has been no announcement  and there was no link to that internal site.  I'm not really sure what that means.  I think this was a tipster inside,  but apparently this internal site says Schemer  is being shut down soon.  Sign in to get your data before it's gone.  So they'll probably have some sort of takeout.  And just, yeah, it just sounds like Schemer doesn't,  I didn't really get the use that Google requires,  which doesn't surprise me.  You don't hear a lot of people talking about this app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I stopped using it.  It was actually kind of annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  So that's all I got for the changelog.  One new thing and-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Plays it's wrongs, changelog person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, this is kind of cool.  This is my Google location map when I went to Europe,  but the only thing that's bad about it  is that the phone kept thinking it was back in Italy.  So if you follow-  I keep going back to Italy, see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The phone was like, what's that out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then briefly for a moment, I went to Bordeaux.  Huh?  Are you using Italian Sim or something?  No, I think it was the ship's internet  or something was thinking.  So if it was just the phone GPS, it would have been fine.  But I think it was the ship's internet  that was getting it confused.  And then for some reason I went to France briefly.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hope you had a good time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But still, this is neat.  Even if nobody ever looks at it,  I think there's some value to this.  Oh well.  I guess download your location.  Can you get it exported to KML  and look at it and other stuff?  They don't have to do a fancy dashboard for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that it's just a straight takeout  if there's takeout for location data.  Yeah, I don't think there's any way  to save the dashboard itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See that key button here, delete history from this day,  delete all history, that's gotta be there.  That's important.  Yeah, I don't want my wife to know where I was this day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google knows.  That's, I just, oh well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you, Gina, for the change log.  Good to have you back.  Great to be back.  You wanna see my 2010, I mean 2013 movie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, let's see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You guys feature prominently in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The perfect beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  This shouldn't be in there, that's random.  This should be.  These are all shows and things we did.  People I love, people I hate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, people I love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's Sideways, I don't know why.  Random Sideways video of Metallica singing the Stars.  Oh, who's that?  Who are they?  It does somehow know.  So you think that it's doing this,  see it got my son's graduation from high school?  That's awesome.  I mean, it got Jason going, ooh.  Colleen.  I just, this is really special to me.  This in many ways was 2013.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a good year right there.  Yeah, and Chad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People think for some reason that Chad's my son  because he keeps showing up in the 2013 video  as a cat in Greece, a Greek cat.  Topkapki Palace, there's Jamal and Zandra, that's great.  Fun.  And there you are Chad, wrapping it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I like how it ends with that.  It's like, this is how you do stuff on your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, look, it's a computer, it ain't perfect.  But that's a good year right there.  That's a good video.  That's a hell of a good year.  And I would never do that myself.  Although it kind of inspired me to think  maybe I could do something better  if I choose my own things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I love editing video, but I've accepted that.  So much work.  It just takes, yeah, it takes,  what is it, eight hours every 30 minutes?  I don't know how your staff does it so well.  It's just a lot of time, it's a lot of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, how many staff editors do we have?  Five?  That's a lot.  I mean, there's a lot of people in here.  I mean, just thinking about the best of 2013 videos.  Yeah, there's stuff behind the scenes  that you don't ever see.  And you shouldn't because it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are they Google bots?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You never want to see how we do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Now time to wrap things up,  starting with something we've missed for so long,  Gina's tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I have to thank Abraham Williams,  who just hang outed me, hang outed me, chatted me,  to tell me about-  Hung you out?  Hung me out, to tell me about journeytothemoon.appspot.com.  So we were just wondering if you could map  your Latitude Takeout data,  and you can, one of the Google Plus developer experts  built this, so you can export your Latitude data,  and then you drag and drop the JSON archive  right onto this page, and it will generate a map for you.  So hey, I like this a lot.  I don't care if it's a third party app,  or if Google's doing it for you.  I mean, I like the idea-  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe that's why they did this,  is like, hey, anybody could do you the dashboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly, anybody can make the dashboard.  And I really like the idea that your archive,  their takeout archive is doing something  versus just kind of laying on your hard drive somewhere,  not doing anything.  So thanks a lot to Abraham for that.  I like that.  Journey to the moon, it's journey to the moon with dashes.  Journey dash to dash the moon.  To the moon, Alice!  Yeah, love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Very good.  Jeff Jarvis, can we get a number to week from you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're gonna get more than one.  We got Kickstarter rounded up its numbers for the year,  and had it put on a nice little presentation.  And there are three million people pledged $480 million  to cut projects in 2013.  Wow.  19,911 successfully funded from 214 countries,  people pledged from 214 countries.  800,000 back more than one project,  80,000 back more than 10.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Whew!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And at the end of the presentation,  they list some of their little stars.  Now, it's interesting, Kickstarter tries to avoid  being seen as the gadget place,  but look at the things they highlight.  Pebble.  Yeah.  Which by God is a company now  with a new product announced, Oculus Rift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, same thing, new products at CES.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  Mm-hmm.  Goldie Box.  Goldie Box.  That is so cool.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  An emoji translation of Moby Dick.  Wow.  Not everything.  I'm so thrilled with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I feel like my English professor just passed out.  Why don't even?  That's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why?  Why?  Why?  A DeLorean-powered hovercraft.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's important hovercraft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess they're pointing out  that not everything is important, but some is, and you know.  Wow, that's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What?  Wow, Kickstarter does such great stages.  No.  It's great communications work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look at that.  What?  A human-powered helicopter.  Oh my gosh, I never saw this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't either.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There you go.  Very cool.  This is built classrooms with containers.  Grandma Pearl made Happy Kings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yay, Grandma Pearl!  A skate park opened in Philly.  That's awesome.  Photo exhibit on the Berlin Wall.  This is pretty impressive, isn't it?  It is.  Kickstarter was on Jeopardy.  Let's hear this.  I will use the energy of Niagara Falls  to carry power to Buffalo by 1896.  Come on, my coil worked.  Trust me.  If early inventors used Kickstarter.  Who is Nikolai Tesla?  That is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry.  It's Nicholas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kickstarter was in Cards Against Humanity.  All right, all right, all right.  Blue Ruin won at Cairns.  That was a Kickstarter movie, I guess, huh?  Wow.  Innocent.  Wow, so anyway, long list of things.  But you're right, it did focus a little bit on the gadgets.  It's interesting, because now there's a huge  wide range of crowds sourced funding.  Platforms.  Platforms.  I mean, it seems like they've just,  I don't know if even Kickstarter was the first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I would argue that Spot.us,  which was started by David Cohn,  who's now at Circa, was a very early venture in this,  was trying to do crowdsourced,  crowdfunded rather, journalism projects.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Kickstarter wasn't the first.  There were micropayments and there were others,  but Kickstarter just hit the right note.  Yes.  Hit the right note.  And sometimes that's more important than the technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm in that group of 80,000  that has contributed more to the 10 Kickstarters.  Ha!  How many have you got?  I keep falling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I keep falling.  I think it's a good idea on Yahoo! Tech  that they have Kickstarter reviews.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Reviews of products that are shipped from Kickstarter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, they're getting the prototypes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, they're getting the prototypes.  So during the campaign.  Yes.  Oh, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because they did, I have mine right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The razor that, oh look,  how many miles have you traveled, Chad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Get to the moon.  I don't have that far left to go.  But it says, you know,  which city is I've spent the most time in?  And apparently I went to a few Emoryville  for two hours at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'm downloading mine too now and I'll do mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Didn't get very far, unfortunately.  Just a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To the moon!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you upload the zip or  do you have to unzip it first?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to unzip it.  You can get the JSON file.  I need the JSON file.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  JSON.  JSON.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's that think, Jeff?  I have my, I was trying to plug it in.  I have my three doodler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, there's a successful Kickstarter.  They're at CES also.  Yes, they are.  So what do you think?  Have you built the Eiffel Tower?  I got the one plastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got the ABS plastic as opposed to the PLA.  Yeah.  And the ABS is more for doing things in the air,  whereas I think the PLA is more about sketching in 2D  and then making things out of it,  which I think would be more fun, actually.  Writing somebody's name and that kind of stuff.  So it's fun.  I mean, people still make fun of me for a reason,  but they have many other causes to do so.  I still think it's a very neat device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think you should carry it in your pocket  and take it to Davos.  Yes, exactly.  And build a guitar for Bono.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's the problem.  I just got the return package to upgrade my glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, nice.  I just sent that in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I don't know.  I don't know where the heck the charger is.  It's a USB charger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Chad, I made it to the moon.  I made it to the moon.  I made it to the moon.  I made it to the moon.  I made it to the moon.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I made it to the moon several times over.  Wow.  It looks like I traveled one point.  But are you gonna get back?  That's the question.  Apparently you only go once.  You only live once.  And these are all the places I've been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's been a lot of time in Australia.  Yeah, I feel like mine doesn't.  It only has like a full 5,000 hours basically.  These are all the cities.  You have a ton more hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I've been using Google location for a long time.  This is really, yeah, I mean, if this goes to Australia,  it goes back, you know,  this is a couple of years worth of data.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't even remember going to Edgewater, United States,  but according to Google, I was there once.  CNBC.  Look at this.  Is that where CNBC is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe I was.  Or you just go across the George Washington Bridge.  Didn't you ride a bike across it or some such ridiculous?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe I did something like that.  This is very nicely done.  But now I think this is,  it says I've traveled 1,448,851 kilometers.  Pretty good.  I've traveled to the moon and back almost five times.  So my tool, my friends, my tool  is has nothing to do with Google.  Oh, you are not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just a little thing I like to call a Mac Pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It looks like just a big beer glass.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm taking this to Oktoberfest next time I go to Germany.  This is when you should show what Pogue did with it, Leo.  What did Pogue do with it?  I haven't seen his review yet.  You had the video up.  Oh.  That's cute.  Oh, Chad, you gonna play it for us?  No, I don't.  Oh, I'll get it.  I'll have to go to yahoo.com slash tech.  You think I keep tabs open?  I don't.  I know you guys all do.  You have hundreds of tabs open.  But I believe in tab purity.  Let's go to Yahoo Tech.  Apple's new Mac Pro.  I don't, I have to say, just a snide remark,  I don't like the, what happened?  So you go to the website.  Oh, sorry.  And you click on something and you get these articles.  But this is very fussy little Times Roman, tiny in here.  I don't like how this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Same with the New York Times redesign today, put out today.  Maybe it's the new thing.  There's font problems online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe that's it.  The rendering isn't very good.  All right, let's see what Yahoo,  David Pogue, the Jerry Lewis of technology reporters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And welcome to What is That Thing?  The show where we ask you, what is that thing?  How do I go full screen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is that thing?  What is that thing?  A, B, C, or D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The answer is E, none of the above.  It's the new Apple Mac Pro.  Available now, starting at the high, high price of $3,000  and going up to $9,500.  This computer is crazy fast.  Look at this, in Final Cut Pro,  it can munch this 4K video like butter.  That's four times the resolution of high depth TV.  And it's made in the USA.  It's portable, one-handable,  expanding the memory is super easy.  The shell pops right on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, the music's gonna make me shoot myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The jacks light up when you move it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like Benny Hill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's super quiet.  Da da da da da da da da da da.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And no one who's watching this is going to buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's not like the old Mac.  Oh, that's all right, they still have to.  Put drives and cards inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know, I mean, I'm glad it looks like this.  This is good, if there's a market for this,  all the better.  It's not our market.  It's not your market at all.  Thank goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The gorgeous object of art might wind up  surrounded by mismatched butter and caddies.  Apple, very different.  Real pros, you can film editing and music recording.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oxygen.  Now I know why Meat Loaf used to keep oxygen  backstage after every show.  That thing weighs 80 pounds.  I think people don't understand.

Transcript:  Is this great?  We're talking like New Yorkers.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  You got a problem with that, people?  Is that the IRT or the MTA?  The F is the BMT.  BMT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The F and the 6 connect at Bleecker.  That made me so happy.  That's relatively new since when I lived here last.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is there a good book on the history  of the New York City subways?  I would love to read that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, there's gotta be many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because the reason there's these different lines  is they used to all be privately operated, right?  Yes.  The IRT and BMT were different companies.  I'd love-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I tried to type in, on Google,  I type in history of New York City subways,  and it automatically puts in this better history.  What the hell is that?  It's giving me my history from my own flex and links.  I can't just type in history of-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you could go to the Transit Museum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
