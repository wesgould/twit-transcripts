And we've got the Google-ishness of on my right here, Mr. Jeff Jarvis for the City University  of New York, the author of What Would Google Do?  Hello, JJ.  And of course, his brand new book, Public Parts, all about the role of publicness in  a world gone mad for privacy.  Also, to my left, the now famous fully employed Gina Trippani, smarterware.org and her app  ThinkUpApp.com is now in public release.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  1.0 out of beta.  Golf clap.  Yay.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's been a stressful week.  Does that mean people could just go on the website and download it now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yeah, people can go on the website and download it.  You can install it on your own web server.  It's about the same amount of effort as WordPress.  Or if you don't want to deal with the web server, we have an Amazon EC2 launcher.  So you need your Amazon keys.  Pop them in under 60 seconds.  It'll spin up an instance and start running it.  ThinkUp is, we kind of selected for pretty geeky users who have a lot of followers and  social networks.  And you're going to have to pick up API keys from Twitter and from Facebook.  There's still a lot of rough edges.  I think someone said if you're not embarrassed by your 1.0 release, then you waited too long.  And there are definitely things I'm embarrassed about and that could be better.  If you've got big followership on different networks and you're interested in archiving  your data and visualizing some of your conversations, I hope you'll check it out.  The installation is about the same amount of effort as WordPress.  So if you've done that, you'll have no problem with ThinkUp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can back that up because I've had, Gina's very kindly let me run my Twitter stuff into  ThinkUp for some time, almost a year now.  And it's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Wow, thank you.  Yeah, you've been such a great tester, Leo.  Thank you.  You have such a huge data set and you really helped us kind of, you know, I want to kind  of push the limits of the database as much as possible.  And your data along with Jeff's and a few other people's really helped us optimize our  indexes and make it fast and, you know, see what happens when you throw millions of followers  at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So thank you for that.  Well, I don't have millions, but the few hundred thousand I have are all yours, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Anything you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And thank you.  I guess I should probably now set up my own server and stop mooching off of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  But you've been an awesome data tester.  I really appreciate your I appreciate it.  I appreciate your OAuth keys, Leo, as always.  My OAuth is yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is an important day.  This is just some program note that in about less than an hour now and about 45 minutes,  Google will do an announcement, probably the Google Music.  In fact, we know it's a Google Music announcement.  And so we will follow that live and we'll have our commentary.  Tom Merritt will join us from the TNT newsroom.  And so we'll have 45 minutes of this show, but the crew will continue with the Google  Music or whatever it is.  Whatever it is.  Announcement.  It's also American Censorship Day.  And I think this is very important.  And I wanted to plug this right at the beginning of the show today.  Today Congress is holding a hearing on SOPA.  And it's very important that everybody who is listening in the United States today call  their members of Congress and protest.  If you go to leoville.com, I'll give you an example.  I, as many other webmasters across the country, have put up this picture here when you go  to my website.  Website blocked.  And this is the kind of thing that you will see if SOPA passes.  This site has been blocked to Americans by the US government firewall.  Now if that sounds scary to you, and by the way, the standards for what the government  needs to do to block something are not, in my opinion, full due process, you should absolutely  fight to protect the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And just allowing anyone that architecture, to change the architecture of the net, not  to plug, but at the end of public parts, I argue the last principle I talk about is the  need for the architecture of the net to stay open and distributed.  And this puts a chokehold.  And if our government can use it for ill purposes, China's government can use it and is using  it for ill purposes, that kills the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this is, Jeff, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that this is being done by the  music industry, the television industry, the content industry, to protect their copyrights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they think, yes.  So they think.  But I'm delighted to see a large consortium of technology companies today come out with  full page ads in at least the Wall Street Journal and New York Times.  Google, Twitter, eBay, Facebook, AOL, Zynga, and a whole bunch of companies say, no, no,  don't do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's stupid.  Well, and Matt Cutts.  On his personal blog, of course, we all know Matt, who is the spam fighter at Google.  We've had him on the show many, many times.  If you go to Matt Cutts blog at MattCutts.com, I need your help.  Please call your congressperson.  Take a few minutes to learn about SOPA and the Protect IP Bill.  It's SOPA in the House.  It's Protect IP in the Senate.  And they're doing hearings right now.  Everybody who knows what they're talking about agrees.  The problem is members of Congress are often not very well informed on these issues.  And maybe they get a lot of funding from these companies.  And look, absent hearing from their constituents, that's going to influence them.  But ultimately, all the funding matters to them is to get votes.  We're the voters.  We matter more than anybody.  But there's no excuse if we don't do this.  So please contact your member of Congress.  This is American Censorship Day.  Find out more at EFF.org or AmericanCensorship.org or Matt Cutts blog or just a lot of places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  This is the single most important thing that you can do today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree.  I agree.  And, you know, right, actually, I was going to do this earlier, but maybe after the show,  I will call my members of Congress.  I ran out of time.  Very important that you understand that the best way to influence members of Congress  is to snail mail.  We don't have time for that right now.  But snail mail, because they see the postmark and they know you're a constituent or call  them from a local number.  And it's not an elaborate call.  You just call up and say, I just want to register this.  Please tell my Senator Feinstein that I am dead set against the IP Protect Act.  And I please hope that she will vote against it.  And I'm a constituent of hers.  And if she does, she'll have my vote.  And if she does not, she will lose my vote.  Something like that.  It doesn't take a whole lot.  They just they have a little box.  They put a checkbox in.  And, you know, if you have a website, if you go to this AmericanCensorship.org site, there's  a simple snippet, a JavaScript snippet you can put on your site.  This is all I did for a Leoville.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yeah, I got to set this up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yes, I'm here.  If you go to the Tech Guy site, I'll just do that real quickly.  Just to show you any.  We should do this on Twitter.  We never I don't control the source code or I would have.  But if you go to the Tech Guy site, that will pop up.  And that is a very dramatic way to remind people that this is what life will look like  if we allow this to happen.  We do not want you know, I've been to China, we've been to China, you've been to China.  We know what it's like in countries where they have firewalls that block access to the  full and free Internet.  It's not a good thing.  It's not what we want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  It's incredibly jarring.  You know, intellectually, when you experience it, it's it's incredible.  So this is really, really important.  So I think this is great that they implemented these JavaScript snippets.  I love it.  I wish they had set it up sooner, because it really does give you the experience of  what it's like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not too late.  It's not too late.  If you go to Tumblr, I think that you'll see a good example of that.  I'm being told by the chat room as well.  Tumblr, because Tumblr and Facebook are two sites that would be very much immediately  impacted by this.  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So all of those of us who link to things, if you if it was a story today somewhere on  the web about the impact on journals, if you link to a site that's considered to be in  violation of are you in violation and things like that, it's appalling.  First friggin Amendment people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tumblr.  This is really interesting.  They basically just blacked out.  You see your Tumblr dashboard, but they black out every single post individually.  This is really neat.  Isn't that great?  Yeah.  Good for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good for Tumblr.  Let's see.  Mine's not doing it right now.  But yeah, if you go to your Tumblr log, your Tumblr log, you'll see it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So good.  Good way to start.  We got some big stuff today.  This is a big day.  Big day for some of us yesterday when we got our fires.  I'm riding in my car.  I turn on my Kindle fire.  You're holding me close.  This is an Android device.  You'd never know it.  But you know, the slide slide to unlock kind of as a giveaway here.  I'll show you a little more close up.  I haven't done anything to customize this.  This is the out of the box experience.  These are all the books I've ever bought.  So if I say, oh, you know, I'd like to get my design patterns book on here, I click that  little button and it will download to my Kindle.  These are apps.  And in fact, we can see more apps if we click the apps button up here.  These are apps that come on the device or are encouraged.  For instance, Comixology.  Again, you just click the download button and this is a recommended and you can install  it.  Now, this is very obviously Android.  If you're somebody who's got an Android phone, you can you probably recognize the interface.  You even see the Amazon App Store logo right up there.  I hear that they've already got a one click root exploit.  That's a good sign because now some people have complained about this in terms of speed,  that the speed of the performance is not great.  In fact, let me let me go to a book.  This by the way, I do not like you see this that this now those two apps that I've used  are now part of this cover flow.  It's really driving me crazy and I don't know how you control that.  Let's go to a let's go to a book that's on here.  You see how slowly that did it and watch the page turn.  It's just a little.  It's not.  It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  A little bit laggy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a little laggy and people have been complaining about the speed of this.  David Pogue said, you know, it's just too laggy.  Others have complained that tapping the icons.  Now this mine feels fairly snappy.  Maybe I haven't loaded it down yet with enough stuff.  Here's Pulse, which it comes with, which is a great little news reader application.  And of course, there's the magazine stand, which is right here, the news stand.  And that's the thing that people will be most interested in is taking a look at magazines.  And I have to say that experience is a little disappointing as well, at least so far because  these magazines really here I'll get it's turkey time.  I'll get Bon Appetit by current issue.  Oh, I do not have a valid credit card.  Well, I have to set up one click on this.  I thought that one was going to be free.  But what they basically feel like is PDFs.  In fact, in many cases, you have to squeeze it and zoom it to see the full page.  It does go sideways so you can see the magazine that way.  But it is not a very good magazine experience.  And so far, these really feel like scanned in magazines.  I don't see anything dedicated to the magazine experience.  That's probably going to change.  Let's remember it's early days for all of this.  Did you guys, either of you get a Kindle?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  No, I didn't get it.  So when you take it out of the box and you sign in, Leo, you're signing into Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. In fact, I knew it was my fire.  In fact, all the Kindles, when you get them and you open them up, they'll be pre-registered to you.  So it had my Amazon credentials.  I'm not sure exactly.  Maybe I need for one click.  It's probably for one click.  I need to log into Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Right, right.  And there's no Google Guts, no visible Google apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For those of us who use Google, we can kind of recognize some of this.  But try this.  There's no slide down notifications.  There's no apps.  There's no Google Apps there, right?  Oh, that's a good point.  Is there a web search?  Ah, no.  I mean, these are the apps that are recommended.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Search for Google under the apps, if you would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't have to.  This is it.  The app store is not a full app store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, you could download unknown sources like you can.  You can do third party sources.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I would do that, I guess, from the settings.  Let's get the settings open here and take a look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I mean, I think email someone an APK or download an APK from the web.  Exactly. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I mean, that's how they're hacking it, of course.  And if you look at this, you can tell, oh, yeah, that's Android, isn't it?  Yeah.  You know, let's look at security here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you think Google really thinks of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's an interesting question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If I'm trying to figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's go to the web.  If search goes through Google, then they're going to love it, right?  So let me search.  Let's search for censorship.  By the way, nice, easy to use keyboard.  It is there's, you know, I don't know if you will be able to install other ones.  This is, I guess, kind of pretty close to the that's a Google search.  So Google's not going to mind that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Right. Google's kind of like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's good for them. That's that's that's the whole point of Android.  I'm sure they'd like the Google is just Gmail and and Maps apps and so forth.  And maybe at some point we'll be able to.  I don't know. Well, there's no GPS.  So I guess that's why Maps wouldn't make sense.  Here's the built in email map or app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  And, you know, it's just Gmail's the top of the list.  That's number one. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which makes sense. So I haven't set it up yet.  I just literally just opened the box.  So I'll have some more to talk about over the weeks and months to come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  But any device that searches the web using Google is good for Google.  Google likes that, right? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a it's a pretty I think it's a very polished interface.  It looks good.  This is the interface to the Amazon bookstore.  Top 100 paid books, children's picture books.  They know that that's a big market that Kindle hasn't served up to this point  because it's been black and white.  Best fiction of 2011, new and noteworthy.  So. And here's the top 100 free books, kind of like that.  How's the how's the part where feel of it?  It's big, it's heavy, which doesn't you know, I have a case here, by the way.  Let me take it out of the case so you can see what it looks like without the case.  It is very much like the Blackberry Playbook in terms of size and fit and feel.  Although I fix it, torn it down.  And in fact, internals are not the same by any means.  So it is its own hardware device.  I think the only complaint people have is it doesn't feel very snappy.  It's snappy enough.  I mean, remember the Kindle black and white Kindle aren't snappy at all.  How's it with the video?  Oh, I can I can sign into my music.  This is all my this is all my music that's already on Amazon.  So that's that's kind of nice.  I don't actually. Now, can I play it?  No, I have to download it first and then play it.  What am I? Oh, OK. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So let's do a YouTube video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, it will. Yes, it will.  Let's go to YouTube.  It's got it's got flash built on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  But no YouTube app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's kind of interesting, although that could be solved.  And it may be that, you know, remember, they've got a big Amazon  video streaming store and video streaming and all of that stuff will be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let's go to Netflix and Hulu Plus is there too.  We ran Netflix works nicely on it.  I think, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ah, so let's play some Dancing Babies here.  See how they look.  Oh, yeah, that's very nice. Yeah. Yeah.  You know, you can't go wrong with Dancing Babies.  You can't.  It's interesting because the aspect ratio for YouTube is perfect.  But people have complained about the fact that other movies  have black bars, top or bottom, and you can't resize it.  But it does fit YouTube just right.  Actually, now I'm intrigued what's going to happen here.  I think that's Jeff and Gina.  I think I'll stop talking. OK, I'm sorry.  Remember, this is only this is only 200 bucks a chat room saying.  And that's that's an excellent point, right?  You know, it's for 200 bucks.  This I think that will be in a lot of stockings and it'll fit  and a lot of Christmas under a lot of Christmas trees and a lot of Hanukkah.  They haven't sold out or anything, have they?  They apparently know what we don't know, because Amazon doesn't say.  I think you could still buy it, though.  It says on Amazon's site you can buy them today.  One thing that's kind of interesting is that the rumors are that they've made  five million to get them through Christmas.  So they expect this to do very well indeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  So this is basically a device for someone who loves the Kindle or reads a lot  and is also vaguely interested in the iPad, but doesn't want to spend  the money on the iPad or a tablet.  That's basically it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Somebody who's heard about tablets hasn't isn't sold yet. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That he just I think we lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, that works.  Oh, perfect timing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would you buy your mother one, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Um, that's a good question.  That's a really good question.  My mom is not into technology at all.  I showed her the original Kindle and she she was super excited about it.  She was an English teacher.  So the idea of having all those books in your hand was was exciting.  Although she did question me about paper.  I think I think I would buy one of those for my mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My mom loves the original Kindle and really.  And because she can make the text big, she's 77.  She loves my mom.  Yeah. She says I can read again.  I haven't been able to read.  I brought her back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It got so angry with you in the bottom of the Kindle.  You know that that Seinfeld episode when Jerry got his parents  the fruit of the month club and they got all angry with him.  The fruit keeps coming.  That's where my father was with this.  Why would I want this thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dad, they're like teenagers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. But I tell you, I tell you, I'm going to be pissed for a moment here.  I'm in I'm in Toronto today.  I'm doing some business, but then I'm going to do these events tomorrow.  19 in Toronto and Friday night in Ottawa, thanks to a group called Third Tuesday.  Sold out. This is wonderful.  I go to Indigo down the street to sign the books.  Not one copy, not one copy in any damned Indigo in the whole freaking country.  And it's the only bookstore there is.  What? Why? Why? Why do you need a bookstore anymore?  Why do you need a publisher anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's absurd. It's unfortunate, isn't it?  It really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what happens with the fire and all that to be happy is that it is a way  to still distribute stuff and it beats the hell out of the old way, which is F.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and somebody like you, Jeff, who has an audience and, you know,  but there could be it's it's instant.  So somebody's watching the go, I want that book.  There's no there's no resistance.  There's no friction. Boom. They got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so for their Canadian friends, don't go buy the Kobo thing.  That's it. Indigo by the fire.  And give it to Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and that's by the way, we should probably say,  is anybody here getting the Barnes and Noble tablet?  Are we going to have anything to compare this with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We should probably get one.  We should. Isn't that funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I mean, Jane Lynch is doing the commercials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, we'll get one.  Tough life, it's wet.  Can I go ahead and order one, Leo?  Yeah, order one.  We should we really should have we should have bought one before this.  And I am embarrassed.  But it's you know, it's funny when we do we're doing a review show,  we're launching a review show and we're getting everything.  Except there's some.  Congratulations, by the way. Big hire.  Yeah. Oh, yeah. Nicole Lee will be our producer on this show.  Great woman I've known for years.  She used to work for me on tech TV.  And it's going to be easy to get people to review things like the fire.  A little harder to get people to review things like the nook.  We'll figure it out.  So there is already a one click death to all one ten.  Posted a one click recipe.  You have to have super one click two point two and Android SDK.  And well, as you can see, a little bit of knowledge.  I'm waiting for the app.  Well, but you know, if you can root this that easily and it literally took less than a day,  it's just a matter of time before people are putting ice cream sandwich on here.  And this could very well be a full bore tablet.  Not as powerful, though.  And I think that's probably going to handle ice cream sandwich.  Well, that's the interesting thing.  I mean, I think that maybe that's why Amazon didn't put more memory in this.  You know, maybe they were.  Yeah, maybe they were aware of this potential.  You know, that was what happened to the Barnes and Noble tablet immediately.  And it became a became a very popular tablet as a result.  I fix it has done the tear down, taken it apart, looked inside and you can see what's in here.  It's a smaller tablet.  A smaller battery than the iPad, although it is mostly battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Four.  Why are circuit boards green?  That's that was my Andy Rooney moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why is it with circuit boards?  Why are they all green?  That's a great question.  I'll have to ask was next time I see him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wouldn't it look good in blue?  Look at that. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Should there we have a blue circuit board? Yeah.  There you go. So once they took it apart,  this is the main thing.  I was like, really?  Eight gigs of flash memory, five, 12 megs of RAM.  That may be one of the reasons it's not so fast.  It has a Texas Instruments microprocessor in here.  In fact, it's all Texas Instruments, including the audio and and everything else.  The Bluetooth FM Wi-Fi is from Georgian.  So I guess I'm not sure about this processor,  but I'm guessing that where is the processor?  I'm guessing it's a little bit of a less powerful processor in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Seems like kind of planned obsolescence, right?  It's an older and older TIO map chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's not I think this is it's either planned obsolescence  or really worrying that people might want to hack the dang thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dual core, one gigahertz TIO map.  4430 says I was in the in the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, with an older  support chip. So this is an interesting. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And answer any question in the chat room.  I think there's no Bluetooth, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have a Bluetooth chip in it, so it has capability,  but they do not do they don't in fact turn it on.  So the Wi-Fi chip has Bluetooth capability as I gather from reading this.  Um. Anyway.  That's an interesting tear down.  Most people were saying it doesn't feel super fast, super snappy.  It doesn't actually feel slow to me, but I haven't used it for very long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's be honest, if you're reading a book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. How fast do you need it to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And of course, it's a great portal.  Look at here. This is Amazon, you know, and this is one of the things  they did very nicely with the Windows Shop app on the iPad.  Um, very, you know, let's buy.  Oh, let me buy that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, it's a buying machine.  Oh, let me buy that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look how easy it was to buy that. Right.  Whoops. Stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I mean, I think it was like all the geeks want to turn it into a full board tablet.  Right. It's an e-reader where you buy stuff to read.  You know, that's that's what it is.  It looks like it does that pretty well.  The people have always done that really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not a bad e-reader, you know, I mean, I love the cover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is to say I work.  I work for the guy named Sean Samson is rethinking retail.  But imagine if you if you had this in a store.  You should like it, you know, probably for that.  It would be the camera or some means to say, what's that device?  They just buy it. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think this is a night.  It's a nice, crisp screen.  I never I never I wasn't one of those eink bigots who said,  I have to have an eink screen.  I think this is I like to turn it to see if you make the text a little bit bigger.  I think it's quite legible, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or does it does it have a speaker?  Somebody's asking whether we're going to be like the Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good question. I don't know if it'll reach you,  but it absolutely has a speaker because you think it's a music player  and it's a video player.  And that's the whole idea. This thing you can, of course, buy.  You don't have to use headset.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  You know, no, it has a speaker. Yeah.  Let's just let's just see here.  We can watch it.  Watch a trailer of The Walking Dead.  Not suitable for all audiences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not all audiences.  Let me turn. I prefer sex to violence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to soft.  This is the future of Android, which I don't like, which is soft everything.  Right. The only switch on this is an on off switch.  So if you're turning up things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The last part of the plane was hidden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, there it is up at the right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's got speakers. Not very loud.  But they're loud enough.  I have to say the screen looks good.  Yeah, absolutely.  And now this particular case I have is a little stand built into it.  So I could absolutely sit and watch this on an airplane or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think if you have an iPad, is there any reason to buy this?  That you can imagine? No, absolutely not.  A smaller size. You would have had a smaller size would be it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, this will do the I will do everything this does  because of the Kindle app.  So you don't need the functionality, but you know,  I do like the smaller size of something like this  because you can put it in your pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the iPad won't stream out from Amazon, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ah, good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  It won't stream video from Amazon.  I have to say, I love Amazon.  I don't use I don't have any Apple hardware in my living room,  so I just don't use any iTunes stuff.  I mean, this weekend, I was going to go see Melancholia,  the Lars Venter movie.  It was on Amazon streaming. What?  It's in the theater, but it's also on Amazon streaming.  Yeah, it's crazy. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm staying home. I'm watching it on my fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yeah. And like on the iPad, because it doesn't support flash,  you can't even purchase stuff from Amazon and say,  hey, send this to my Tivo or whatever.  There you go. Because it doesn't work for flash.  But, you know, that's I mean, you know,  you have access to so much video content through iTunes on the iPad.  That's not going to be that big a deal. But.  Interesting. I do really like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These are all prime videos that I could watch right now.  That's yeah. Huh.  Because I'm an Amazon Prime person.  Big Julia Roberts fan. I love Julia Roberts.  To me, if a movie has Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant in it, I'm happy.  You're in. I'm in. That's all I need.  It's on. It's on. It's on.  I'm such a girl.  I love you, Leo. Yeah, no, I like I love I love romantic rom-coms  as we chicks call them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think this looks great.  Leo, do you watch do you watch Dancing with the Stars?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I would just like to point out that I have watched it when Leo was with all  male guests and he's a different guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know. I know. You guys soften me.  I would never admit to this with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This show is Leo's feminine side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, we're showing the feminine side of love it now.  So that's the question.  It's interesting. We were trying to decide who covers this.  There was a battle between iPad today and all about Android.  And Eileen said we're covering it and that's all there is to it.  So all about Android will cover it because it is, I guess, it's an Android device.  But I mean, yeah, now that they've rooted it, I think you win the argument.  Yeah, that sounds like the right decision to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Nothing against iPad today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Time Warner is now going to block this because they think there might have been  something in here that was theirs.  So, yeah, I don't like this cover flow absorbs everything you've ever done.  I mean, the UI...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there a UI to change that flow to a different UI?  To a list or anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I heard no.  No, I don't think Dr. Mom's been complaining about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can search.  Well, that's interesting. Let's see if a web search.  Because, oh, look at this. This is interesting.  So you could choose to search sources.  Amazon, Facebook, Google, Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  So that cover flow interface is the home screen.  There's no home screen popper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, this is it.  Interesting.  But then you have this menu bar, Newsstand Books, Music Video, Docs.  Now, Docs is interesting because I don't know how I would create a new doc.  In this case, the only doc is the PDF.  That's the user's guide. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  You can email PDFs to your Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right. So I guess that's where these would go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Just an update. The Google event.  I'm seeing this right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ooh, it must have to do with music.  Well, I'll tell you what. Let's take a break and come back.  We will go live to that when it happens and talk about it.  And we do have some other news, including, by the way, Ice Cream Sandwich Source Code released.  And because it's in the source code tree, that means Honeycomb has been released in source.  But I want to ask Gina what the hell that means.  Before we get to... Is it good? Is it bad? Is it open source?  Let's talk about that in just a second.  And yes, we will have live coverage of the Google event, which is about to start in about 15 minutes.  Until then...  I have too many... I have commercials for every show except this show. Here we go.  Here we go. Let's talk about GoToMeeting, the folks at Citrix produce.  I just found this out. They consider this their premier product.  I guess it's one of their oldest products.  And of course, it's one of their most used because nowadays, work groups spread out all over,  clients all over the world, colleagues too.  Online meeting is the best way to meet, to have an impromptu meeting.  And now, because of HD Faces, that could be a face-to-face meeting.  I just love this. I want you to go to GoToMeeting.com.  Use the offer code TWIG to try it free for 30 days.  It's, of course, screen sharing for online meetings and very easy to set up.  It includes voice-over internet and teleconference bridge.  So, you know, people, if they're using their iPad, for instance, they can hear the meeting,  they can speak to the meeting without any phone line.  They just use their internet connection.  And now, with HD Faces, the people on PCs and Macs with cameras can now be seen.  I mean, that makes a huge difference in a meeting to see your client's reaction to your presentation,  to see what your colleagues think.  They've also made it possible to do this on Android phones and iPhones.  You can't send the video yet. They're working on that.  But you can attend these meetings on even Android phones and iPhones.  And that is fantastic news.  That means no matter where you are, you can be at a GoToMeeting meeting.  It means it's easier to get these teams together, to get them working together,  to see them, to interact with them.  Try it free for 30 days. You may have tried other meeting software.  Please do not let that poison you.  This is so much better, so much faster, so much easier.  In fact, it's so easy. You'll just use it all the time.  And it will become your de facto standard for meetings.  Go to meeting.com. Try it free for 30 days.  Use the offer code TWIT.  And we thank Cedric so much for supporting all of our shows.  One of our oldest and most beloved advertisers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Offer code TWIT or TWIG?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, did I say TWIT? I meant TWIG. Thank you for correcting me.  Of course we want credit for TWIG.  T-W-I-G, not T-W-I-G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yeah, give us credit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know, it doesn't...  We don't do what they call pay-for-click ads.  We don't get paid if they put TWIG in and not get paid if they put TWIT in.  It's all... That has nothing to do with that.  But they like to keep track of which shows do best for them.  And so if you like this show and you saw it on this show,  do use TWIG so that we get...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We want to be like Supe Sales.  Call your congressperson.  Use the TWIG offer code.  Go into Indigo and demand my book.  And send us a dollar, kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, go to daddy's wallet.  And find a buck.  Ten recent algorithm changes.  Google just constantly working on their algorithm.  This is from the official Google search blog.  They have added...  I mean, we've heard about the...  We talked about it last week,  the new algorithm that makes it more up to date.  But apparently they say they do over 500 changes in any given year.  This is just the last couple of weeks.  Cross-language information retrieval.  Snippets with more page content and less header menu content, like that.  Better page titles and search results by deduplicating boilerplate anchors.  Length-based autocomplete predictions in Russian.  That doesn't help me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I love reading through change logs.  It's an epic journey toward...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm glad that's somebody's job and not mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I met the guy who does the Polish localization.  I think it was Polish, of Google.  He works out of the Dublin office.  And so he says, I'm the Matt Cutts for Poland.  Somebody's got to do it.  Yeah, absolutely.  And Matt doesn't read Polish.  So extending application rich snippets.  Rich snippets for applications.  Oh, that's neat.  That's that snippet thing we were talking about with Google+.  Retiring a signal in image search.  Fresh or more recent results, this we've talked about.  Refining official page detection.  Now, this is interesting, because how do they know what's an official page?  If you type in Ford, what's the official Ford page?  So they've improved that.  So which pages are official?  Which pages are fan sites?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ah, that goes to our Google Plus stuff last week we were talking about,  about how to know the brands are there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and I'm sure Google Plus kind of ties into this, don't you think?  I would think so.  Yeah, that would be a signal.  Improvements to date restricted queries and prediction fixes for IME queries.  You know what that means?  Queries that have non-Latin characters.  So those of you who speak Latin, this isn't for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I like to see Google be transparent.  I happen to really love reading through change blogs,  because it's a little boring, but you can kind of see what some of the thought  processes are and the directions that you're heading in.  I like to see Google being more communicative and transparent about what  they're doing with their algorithm.  Remember back in the day when you had no idea about the magic that was going on  behind the scenes?  This is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree.  Hey, let me ask you about this open sourcing as I was going to,  but I forgot, of ice cream sandwich.  That was fast, because ice cream sandwich is brand,  and we haven't even seen a phone with it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Right, yeah, it was pretty fast.  Ice cream sandwich is kind of that honeycomb was this weird bridge that never  really got released, and ice cream sandwich includes honeycomb.  So you can say that ice cream sandwich is really fast or really early,  or you could say the honeycomb is just really late.  You can look at it either way.  So yeah, this is really cool.  So ice cream sandwich source code is open source.  So everyone knows that Android's open, but the conventional ways  that open source projects work is that you can see nightly commits,  and that's not the case with Android.  Google works internally and in private on Android up  until a point at which they release the source of one big drop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's why some say it's not really open source,  because you can't watch the commits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Right, exactly.  Some open source advocates say that it doesn't qualify  as a true open source project, because you don't see the daily commits  and the daily work.  So that's a matter of opinion.  To me, open source is a source that's out there and open,  and now it is.  Give out the source.  Yeah, I mean, there was a time when honeycomb wasn't out there,  and ice cream sandwich wasn't out there, but now it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The interesting thing is people said, oh, they'll never  release the honeycomb source.  But in order to release the ice cream sandwich source,  they have to release, I guess they've released the whole,  is it Git that they use, the Git tree, and then you'll see everything,  even all of the commits prior to ice cream sandwich,  you'll see honeycomb.  Now they say you could use it, but don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  But don't, right.  Yeah, from what I understand, the ice cream sandwich  is based on the honeycomb tree, right?  So it's all one tree.  So all the source code has come out, but new developers should  develop on the top of the branch, the top of the trunk, right,  which is ice cream sandwich, and not develop on honeycomb.  So this is great news, great news for developers.  It's great news for users, especially power users,  because this means that custom ROMs can get developed for ice cream sandwich.  It means that the next Kindle Fire or whatever the new next Android device is  can be built on ice cream sandwich instead of earlier versions.  And it just means that the source code is out there for people to look at  and start developing on, and more eyes is a good thing in terms of bugs  and development.  And so this is great.  So the source code came out before the first device running ice cream sandwich.  Isn't that amazing?  That's the first time that's happened.  That's good.  Yeah.  Yeah, good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Source.android.com.  And they give you full instructions for doing it and doing the whole thing,  and it couldn't be easier.  And once you have the whole cold base, you can make your very own.  Build your own, kids.  It's easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  They do use Git.  I mean, this is the open source project, so you're not going to get things  like the market or Gmail or Maps, which are closed source apps.  But this is fantastic.  This just means newer Android devices are going to be running ice cream sandwich.  Upgrade.  It's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just think it's a great answer to all the people who were saying,  after Honeycomb was not released, oh, you see, this is not really  an open source project.  It is.  It is.  And I think that I applaud them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, better to have it this low, even if it's not purism.  Let's not get our knickers and knots.  Let's take what we can get.  You can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't.  I mean, let's talk about purism.  There's nothing more pure than an open source advocate.  And there will always be something.  So there you go.  You got the source code.  Did you know that there is, you probably knew this, the secret Google lab, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I never knew about it.  You didn't know.  I love this idea, don't you?  And I love it a few ways.  I love it in the Google mysteries are fun thing.  They're going to make robot cars.  But I also love it in the idea that this country needs Abel Labs again.  So what is Google X?  Google X is supposedly working on projects.  We don't know what it is.  The Google refrigerator, the Google cars.  And if you look at the video that I put up on the rundown there, Leo, you'll find out  there are other projects that the Chinese have found out about.  The Chinese know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess it's time for Google to tell us.  So if you have the video there, you want to play it.  Yeah, let me see.  Let me see if I can find it.  Where did you where'd you stick that?  It's right below that on the rundown.  Right below it on the rundown.  It says Google X Chinese video.  I see.  Here we go.  Ladies and gentlemen, from China comes this video.  Oh, this is these.  These guys.  These guys.  These guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Google has pumped out many digital innovations through its Google Labs portal, but chose  to close it last month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I don't know what that meant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We don't.  It's you can't even.  It's not clear.  No.  It's just silly.  I think it's I think this is a Chinese language news show or something.  What's the story with this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  These guys just always do these parody.  Yeah.  Where the company is working on super secret projects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Lots of guys in lab coats with like Sergey and Larry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm traveling in the works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Darth Vader and the android robot taking a space elevator up to the moon.  Where there's a hard rock cafe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Researchers are also looking into robots and internet connected appliances as ways for  people to manage their homes from the cloud.  But from where is Google getting all their ideas?  This is my favorite part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Aliens.  Larry and Sergey.  It's bonging it up with the aliens.  Dude.  NMATV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  So is this a broadcast network in China?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, these guys.  These guys just you ever see these guys make.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're like they made the Ariatons slap around fight.  They do that.  I would be honored sometime to be in one of these videos.  I think we have to do something outrageous so we can get in the video here.  We want to be in an NMA video.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's a story behind Google X explained so that even a small child.  Can get it.  What is the story with this Larry Page article?  We talked a little bit about on Twitter on Sunday.  He sounds like a hard ass.  He sounds like he's trying to be Steve Jobs.  Which is not what I expected to you.  No, Larry Page now CEO.  He of course replaced Eric Schmidt, who's been bumped upstairs.  Has is apparently gotten tough.  My favorite is the 50 minute meeting so you can go to the bathroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  No more than 50 minutes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not going to go to the bathroom.  My favorite too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think all meetings should be held standing up.  That way they're shorter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  That'll end sooner.  I thought it was interesting that he said that he'd rather decisions get made quickly  and then risk making the wrong decision than drawing it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a reasonable response though to Google's kind of overly maybe processed decision making.  Right.  Absolutely.  He's trying to snap it up.  But this is a very, I think this is, I think, you know, and remember Steve Jobs did give him advice.  Yes.  For a long period of time.  This is very Jobsian.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  It sounds like, I mean, I think that didn't didn't Page say in an interview, someone asked,  what's Google's biggest stumbling block or obstacle?  And he said Google.  I mean, to me, this just read as this is a really, this is a great engineer who is really excited,  you know, is focused on efficiency and getting things done.  And he was just frustrated with the slowness and the process that's, you know, just inevitably happens in a huge company.  So good for him.  It sounds good to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Times quotes a former Google executive saying when Eric was there, you'd walk into a product meeting  or a senior staff meeting and everybody got to weigh in on every decision.  Larry is much more willing to make an OK decision and make it now rather than make a perfect decision later.  He started these changes right away.  Right after he came in, he required senior executives to show up at headquarters at least once a month for face to face meetings.  He's it's this is very interesting and probably pretty encouraging to somebody who's watching Google closely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think obviously I think we must have put this out there to say, let's write.  Let's show that there really is a grown up in charge now with a strong direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Right. Are we as it is two minutes now to two p.m. Pacific time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  See this right now, which is the logo and what the rumors.  A little bit of music, but this is the same loop that's been going on for a while.  OK, not quite ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it didn't something kind of leak out or hasn't been going on already.  Can you sign up for it or anything like that?  The idea, I think, is that they would launch an iTunes like store.  Sony supposedly involved the email that went out to this event feature came from Nigel Toughenall.  Right. And of course, Spinal Tap's legendary bassist who goes to eleven.  In fact, the event is called This Goes to Eleven.  It would be great if Spinal Tap played at the event.  And if they do, I promise you, folks, we will not interrupt it, but we will go live and broadcast.  We'll sing along. We'll sing along to smell the glove.  I love it.  Songs and Google Music, according to Bloomberg, will cost between ninety nine and a sense in a dollar twenty nine,  very much like the iTunes store. But Google may offer discounts like a free song of the day.  I would expect that Amazon's already doing that, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The question is, we heard about two weeks ago where you can play a song for a friend.  This is what I'm really interested in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  So, of course, they have to catch up to what the other guys have.  But the social part of it, this is the thing that I'm really interested in, kind of like pages.  I have really high hopes that Google is going to do something interesting.  And someone said with a twist and we said maybe it's double twist.  I'm really interested to see if they're going to be built in sharing and how that's going to work.  That would be really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They could do Ping right. Ping never really took off the Apple iTunes sharing.  Maybe they could do it right.  Don't hold out, though, for Cher, CeeLo, P Diddy, Gucci Mane, Green Day, The Prodigy, or Van Halen.  They're all on Warner Records, which apparently is, according to some, the only major label that hasn't signed.  But we'll find out, I think, in just a few seconds what labels are signing up for this.  So we are going to watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We can track above you, Leah. Look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, nice.  Wow, we are so sophisticated.  Trying.  So sophisticated.  This is on the if you want to watch it live without our commentary, you can go to YouTube.com slash Android.  It's on Google's Android channel.  That would be so dull.  Why would you want to do that when you could have us eventually just life with no commentary?  We should swap us up into their.  Whoa, man.  No, no, no.  Oh, yeah.  Boy, you're good.  Eileen, you've really been practicing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm not as good as some of the others here, but I'm just better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're virtuoso of the turret.  She's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I still need a lot of help, but I'm getting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. That was pretty impressive.  Golly.  I don't know how to do any of that crap.  We'll put it right there.  So there's still. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  I'm kidding.  For those of you listening at home, nothing.  We'll continue to cover stories until they go live with that.  Saman Rushdie.  That's not his real name.  He's of course the author who faced a fatwa for his book.  The what was it called?  I have it. I read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The oh, Jesus.  Are we getting older?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What?  You are.  Anyway, you know what I'm talking about.  The satanic verses.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Apparently his real name is Ahmed Rushdie.  And Facebook said, well, then you have to be Ahmed Rushdie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How did they even know that?  How did this occur that it changed?  I don't get it.  They do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He had a Saman Rushdie page.  They deactivated it and he said, send us your passport.  Send us a copy of your passport so we know it's you.  So he did.  But on the passport, it says Ahmed.  Ahmed Salman Rushdie.  Oh, I see.  And try to get the official page.  So he got reactivated as Ahmed Rushdie.  He called Salman Rushdie on his Twitter called Mark Zuckerberg, a moron.  Where are you hiding, Mark?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Come out here.  Give me back my name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love the fact that Salman Rushdie, unlike Malcolm Gladwell, you know, cares about social media and was really pissed he didn't have it.  Good for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's kind of cool.  Good for him.  But it shows you Facebook has the same issues Google Plus does with this whole NIMS issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  And Facebook fixed it and apologized pretty quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  After the Twitterverse went crazy.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  We need for these things to happen, though.  I agree.  For these policies to become nuanced and accommodating and reasonable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And now we have a name for the event.  It is not It Goes to Eleven.  It's the November 16th event.  Please, I got no audio or anything.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It just went to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I like the rocker.  Wait a minute.  He's going like that.  Oh, man.  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's that's very cool.  Little antenna.  OK, I do dig that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google has solved the problem of collecting data via their Wi-Fi Google maps or Street View cars that are collecting the Wi-Fi stuff.  There's an opt out feature.  Huh?  Do you think they've solved it?  Sure.  This solves it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  All you have to do is add the underscore no map to your SS ID and bingo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're out.  Google will ignore you.  Come on.  Can we have a good laugh about this?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  It could have been worse.  It could have been underscore no map dot p y.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's true.  It could have been.  Yeah.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  You think that's not a good solution?  I think that I found it funny that Google posted this solution in earnest.  It's basically like robots.  Yeah, it's robots.  Wi-Fi access point.  I think it should have been N zero MAP just to make it more elite.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  Right.  Obviously, they don't work confusion between the zero and they don't want anybody to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  So they're going to make it obscure.  I would have liked to see them say that you put underscore map if you would like to opt  in.  There you go.  And I wonder how many Wi-Fi access point manufacturers are going to name the SS IDs  underscore no map by default.  Well, it'll break everything, right?  It'll break everything if you do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they want that data.  And I don't think it's wrong for them to get that data.  Yeah, I agree.  I'm waiting for Jeff to come up with a solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I'm joking, of course.  I just thought that the opt out process was a little...  Again, what's the harm?  It just goes into all the fear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  USA Today today had a ridiculous story about discovering cookies and how evil they are  and how Facebook tracks you everywhere.  Oh, please.  And of course, do they say that USA Today tracks you the same way?  It's like USA Today say, hey, we just read the Wall Street Journal and boy, there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a problem out there.  It's called cookies.  It's called cookies.  Hey, we're going to do a commercial before we go to the event.  We are waiting for the stage to go live on the It Goes to Eleven event.  We expect an announcement from Google of Google Music and we'll continue to cover that.  Bring Tom Meriden in as well.  This show, as always, brought to you by our good friends at Squarespace.com, the secret  behind exceptional websites.  Squarespace, if you are ready to make a site or you have a site but you want to make it  easier, it's hosting, the best hosting in the world.  I mean, really, it's hosting.  The best hosting in the world.  I mean, really great hosting plus the best content management system in the world combined  together.  And because they're so tightly integrated, you really get the best of both worlds.  It is not a compromise.  A lot of hosts have their own site builder software.  It's junk.  This is good.  This is the stuff you want to use and the hosting you want to use.  So do me a favor.  Give it a try.  Go to Squarespace.com.  See that green button right there?  Squarespace.com.  Click that try it free button.  You don't need a credit card.  You just need a name for your site, a password for your site, and an email address.  And for the next two weeks, you have full access to everything Squarespace offers.  The incredible app, the Android or iPad or iPhone app.  What a great way to post, to moderate comments, to check your stats.  And by the way, stats, big deal for people who have websites.  This has fantastic site management stats, built in SEO.  So you're going to show up great on Google.  That's automatic site mapping, things like that.  Take the tour, the product tour of Squarespace.  See what they have to offer.  See how easy it is to use.  And then try it for free.  If you decide you want to buy, it's very affordable.  You can check the pricing plans.  There's no secrets right here.  It starts at $12 a year.  A month for a year.  You can also do monthly plans or two year plans.  And if you use the offer code TWIG11, you'll get 20% off for the first six months.  Over and above the savings already here.  You know, I would say get the one, get at least the year account.  Because then you get unlimited bandwidth, unlimited pages, unlimited storage,  a custom domain.  They have an interesting feature called Audiences.  Which allows you to have different password protected parts of the website.  So you could have a paid and a free website.  Freemium, that kind of thing.  You have unlimited editors.  So there is a less expensive site for people who just need a very simple site.  But I have to say that the $20 a month site with the great hosting and all of these  features, including unlimited bandwidth, is an amazing deal.  And then just add TWIG11 to the coupon code on checkout and you'll get 20% off for  the first six months.  I don't know how to say it any other way.  This is the best place to go for your next website.  And if you have a friend who doesn't have a site or maybe better yet a business you  love that doesn't have a site, go there, Seth.  You could just set it up for him real quickly, like while you're eating dinner.  And give him the password.  Say, here, I give this to you.  And if you want to use it, go ahead, it's yours.  It's a nice thing to do.  Squarespace.com.  Give him a try today.  What's going on in the Nigel Tufnall's world?  Still like this, huh?  Yeah, and I still don't have any audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's still this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I'm the last person to complain about things beginning on time.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  But it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, maybe there's people.  I don't know.  Larry's late.  I don't know what.  Is there anything on Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you want to say, Tom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was just going to say once Leo starts complaining that it's not on time, you know it's late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tom Merritt is, of course, the chief victim of my tardiness.  Tom will be joining us in just a bit as this event begins.  No, keep him waiting.  Just keep Tom waiting.  Let's do our tip, a number and tool of the week while we are waiting.  How about that?  Let's start with Gina Trapani and her tip of the week.  Oh, sure.  So this is not new, but it's new to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I hate getting catalogs in the mail, but I love looking through catalogs.  And there's a Google Catalogs app, which I think came out this past summer,  but it's a little more useful now because we're sort of getting into the holiday season.  If you go to google.com slash catalogs about it's an iPad app for your iPad.  You flip through lots of different catalogs and buy stuff online.  It's just a really kind of nice experience.  Actually, it looks similar to the Kindle, but what's nice about it is that the catalogs pages are scanned  and they have little dollar signs.  You can tap them and you can buy what you're looking at.  They used to do this on the web only, but now having it in an app is a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, having the iPad is really nice.  Can you buy from it?  Like, can I click it and buy it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yeah, you can buy it.  Yes, you can tap an item, you can see details, then you can buy it on the web, which is super, super, super nice.  And along those lines as well, iOS folks, the Gmail app, which was released in the store last week  and then quickly pulled because of a bug, is back in the app store.  So you can get that as well.  And it works nice.  Yeah, it works pretty nicely.  They still have to add things like multiple account support and that kind of thing.  But it very much is like the web interface kind of inside an app.  I think the event is beginning here.  So, Jeff, hold that number.  I will hold the big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good tip, though.  I like that, Gina.  Thank you.  And here we go.  We're going to go to their stream.  This is at Android.  I'm sorry, youtube.com slash Android.  They've been trying to assign the last music partners.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's why they're late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what is this music?  Listen, can anybody identify this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Break out the Shazam.  It sounds like Larry noodling.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's Paul Allen noodling on his guitar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Requiem for Eric Schmidt.  I'm getting hungry for sushi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, we're waiting for the It Goes to Eleven app.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  App.  Event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is a shop tab on Google Music right now.  That's exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Remember when your music came on plastic and it revolved around you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  But lately, this is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is good.  Yeah.  They're playing a cassette.  They start with an album, then a reel to reel, now a cassette, now a CD.  It seems.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  It seems.  Hard drive to be spinning out of control.  On computers.  Speaker.  MP3 players.  Phones.  Sinking.  Cancel.  Stop.  They stopped everything.  And there is a shop button on Google Music, but it says, we're sorry, the requested  URL not found on the server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it takes you to market.android.com.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's a little confusing.  That's interesting, though.  It does sound like it's an Android thing that we're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, now introducing from Google Inc., Director of Digital Content for  Android, Jamie Rosenberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Teppet applause.  Good afternoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Welcome.  And thank you for coming on what is a very exciting day for Google and I hope for others  as well.  Before we get started, I'd like to thank the guys from Monogold, a terrific indie band  out of Brooklyn, New York, who kicked it off with that great set.  You'll hear more about Monogold a bit later.  Today we're here to talk about music.  At Google, digital music has become fundamental to many things we care very much about, including  the mobile experience, the social experience, and the power of the web to improve people's  lives.  And for music fans, we believe today's technologies, including high-speed networks, powerful device  platforms like Android, engaging social networks like Google+, and advances in cloud services,  bring with them the capability to dramatically improve the digital music experience.  In fact, it's what consumers have come to expect.  To rewind a few months, back in May we launched Music Beta by Google, a service that allows  you to store your music collection in the cloud and access that music anywhere from  a web browser or Android device.  Music Beta has been a limited, invitation-only service, and we spent the summer learning  from the more than one million people who participated.  We learned that you love knowing that all of your music was available on all of your  devices instantly without having to worry about downloading or transferring files or  having enough storage space.  We never could have guessed that.  We learned that being able to stream your music from any web browser was a big hit.  You used the service a lot, streaming your music for an average of two and a half hours  every day.  We also learned that you really responded to the opportunity to discover new music and  add that music to your collections instantly.  During the beta, we've distributed more than 100 million free songs directly to your cloud  libraries.  Finally, with the launch and ongoing success of Google+, we learned that we could make  music discovery and distribution social in a deeply integrated way.  Now, during this time, we've also seen the continuation of a dramatic trend in the mobile  industry.  Back in May, we announced that we had activated 100 million Android devices worldwide.  Just six months later, I'm pleased to announce that we've already doubled that.  We have now activated 200 million Android devices worldwide.  200 million.  And we're adding 550,000 new devices every day.  Those are big numbers.  So during this limited invitation only beta, the Android ecosystem has experienced an  explosive growth.  It's interesting.  It's not a big increase in the number of daily activation.  It now provides unprecedented scale and reach.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They sound big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Today, for those millions of Android devices and for music fans across the web, our music  beta becomes a full service.  And that experience is called Google Music.  Google Music is about discovering, purchasing, sharing, and enjoying digital music in new,  innovative, and personalized ways.  It's about the cloud, about the web, and about mobile.  It's about better connecting you with the music you own and introducing you to new music  that we, or better yet, your friends, think you'll love.  Last but certainly not least, Google Music is about artists and their music and new ways  to connect artists with their fans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now on my Google Music page it says, add new music from psychedelic indie band Neon Indian?  No.  There's obviously a discovery feature here.  What about pricing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  When we launched the beta, we said the service was free for a limited time.  Now I'm pleased to announce that we're removing that qualification and the service will continue  to be free.  That's good.  You can add your entire music collection to Google Music, up to 20,000 songs, and stream  it for free.  You do have to upload all of those songs.  Other cloud music services think you have to pay to listen to music you already own.  We don't.  But that's just the beginning.  To show you the new features of Google Music launching today, I'd like to call up Paul  Joyce, our lead product manager for music, and Michael Solisky, our lead product manager  for Android Market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're watching the Google Music event.  It goes to 11.  Announcing a new public version of the Google Music service for free.  Thanks, Jamie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People have responded very positively to music beta over the last six months.  They like having instant access to all their songs, the flexibility of streaming or downloading  to their devices, the convenience of being able to play in any web browser, even the  one on iOS.  And they like Instant Mix, our feature based on machine hearing technology that lets you  build great playlists automatically with just one click.  Now that they're making the service completely free and opening it up to everyone in the  U.S., we suspect they'll like Google Music even more.  Let's walk through how it works.  It starts with Music Manager, a helper application for Windows, Mac, and Linux that lets you  pick which music you want to store in the cloud.  Even if your collection is spread across several different computers.  When you select your iTunes or Windows media player library, all your playlists, play counts,  and ratings are added along with your songs.  If you want more control, you can pick by folder and now by playlist.  And there's even an option to keep adding new music automatically.  Only Google Music gives you all of these options.  Once your music is added to your locker, it's organized, secure, and available.  I like that they're demonstrating this on a Mac.  On all of your Android devices.  Like this really nice HTC Amaz by T-Mobile.  With Michael's help, let's take a closer look.  This is the latest music app for Android 2.2 and higher.  Here are all my artists, all my albums, all my songs, all my playlists.  All I had to do to get access to my entire music collection, even my favorite robots playlist,  was sign in with my Google account.  I can stream anything in my library.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Please don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Copyright violation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I like that paranoid Android was in that list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Robot rock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I see folks back in building 44.  I want to make sure I have a copy of something stored on my phone for times when my connection might not be so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, this works very well on iOS without an app just through the mobile browser interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Any albums, artists, or playlists I suggest will be available when I'm offline.  Whenever I add an album or create or edit a new playlist, all the changes are instantly available on the web and on my other devices.  And the same is true for my play counts and ratings, another new feature for this release.  So we've improved the music app and we've improved Music Manager.  And we made the service completely free.  The biggest change is something we haven't talked about yet, and that's the integration with the Android market.  Let's jump over to market and take a look.  So this is Android market.  The store optimized for the web, for the more than 200 million phones and tablets we've activated worldwide.  Eileen, can you get on the market right now?  It's helped people install billions of applications.  I don't know if it's...  Already this year we've updated movie rentals and books.  On my phone?  Yeah.  And today we're happy to announce that we've added music.  And you can buy millions of songs right from my Android market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How many millions is the key?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is music.  And what labels?  There's familiar layout, there's genres, and sub genres.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this isn't so much a music announcement as it is a music to boost Android announcements.  Yeah, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  First is...  Notice that they're pushing it as an Android.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The hallmark of a good music store is one where you walk in...  Although of course it's got a desktop interface.  ...and you walk out with something you love.  I thought it would be an easy experience to create.  Oh, they're going to have a web...  It's definitely one we aspire to.  Yeah.  Take for example what's on the home page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me see if the shop link is...  So we have staff picks.  It is in the Android market.  We have promotions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then there's content, like this profile on DapTone, a really cool retro soul label.  Together, these features let our music geeks guide you to new music discovery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're anxious to show how much hipper they are in their music.  Another way we focus on discovery...  Than Apple ever was.  ...is with recommendations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On every artist page are similar artists you might like, making it easy to browse.  And here on the home page, we have personalized recommendations based on your entire collection.  That's good.  Not just the music you buy from our store.  We use the same machine-hearing technology that powers Instant Mix to suggest new things we think you're going to love.  But perhaps the most important way we assist discovery is through friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, here we go.  What was the song you were playing last night?  The Atlas soundtrack.  Yeah, yeah.  What was the song?  Mona Lisa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ah, that was awesome.  Don't act.  So as Michael goes and searches the web...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nothing better than bad acting in an announcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  ...searches market.  He doesn't need to search the web anymore.  And that's what's really great about our announcement.  He searches through it.  But let me tell you about what we're buying.  Everything in the store has 90-second previews.  And we're also very excited that everything you buy from the store...  Is also longer than Apple.  ...is a 320 kilobit a second MP3.  320 KB per second MP3s.  When you complete the transaction, the track is added to your locker.  Without doing anything else, it's ready for playback on the web and all your devices.  That's better than Apple's 256 AAC.  It shows up in the music players in your purchase playlist.  But the same, isn't it, as Amazon?  You can add it.  But the easiest way to start playing is to follow the listen link that appears right inside market.  Now, if you want to close the circle of recommendation, you can select the share button instead.  And start the sharing process.  Ah, there we go.  I'll turn it over to Michael to show you a few more features on the web.  Share on Google+.  And to dive deep on sharing.  Friends get one free play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Can't wait to share my glee music with you.  So here's a much better than score.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Glee music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  And there's the track that Paul was talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like everything we sell in the store, it's a high resolution MP3.  And you can play it here or on any of your other devices.  If you want to download the track, you can do that right from your browser.  Or, easier still, you can do it anytime using Music Manager.  The same software that you use to add your collection to Google Music.  Now, as Jamie mentioned, the web player has been incredibly popular during our limited beta.  And we think it'll be even more so now that we're adding the ability to discover and purchase music.  So let's take a walk through the music store in Android Market on the web.  So we've talked about personalized recommendations based on the music that you enjoy.  The store is still not live on the web for me.  As well as editorial pages that help you discover new music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I do get the Neon Indian recommendations too.  Yeah, I guess everybody has to listen to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Every day we'll have a different free song of the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Today we're starting with David Bowie's Sound and Vision for thematic reasons.  But you should expect a range from artists you know well to artists you're going to want to get to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've also got hundreds of other free tracks available now to help jumpstart your collection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every week we'll have a different spotlight artist in our antenna series.  Starting with Caveman.  Antenna focuses on emerging artists of all different styles.  The music of Glee.  The one thing that they all have in common is that they're all the same songwriter staff.  As you browse you'll also find compelling video interviews and performances.  Right now for example you can find Merle Haggard talking about his years of music making.  I think 320 kilobit MP3 is probably comparable to 256 megabit AAC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it plays on everything and I think that that's kind of important.  Yeah, good day to be neon India.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Shit, that looks pretty well prepared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're in for a grilling.  Did he just swear?  It's your first question.  It sure sounded like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's great.  That's how much hipper than Apple there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My new album is pronounced Milo Xylotone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's like xylophone.  But you can do it anywhere you like or not at all.  One of the reasons we called our record Milo Xylotone is because we put that into Google and it had no results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we thought okay, this is fresh campus.  Yeah, what a surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  SEO for band baby.  Milo Xylotone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nobody ever heard of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I love this guy.  Mr. Coldplay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  A lot of our favorite bands and artists by their fifth record have shown their quality.  So I think particularly on this one we like what we have to do.  He's just faking Axie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can hear it in his eyes.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you have to see anybody sharing anything on Google+, I'm checking it regularly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Let's see Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, this is where you really see the Google Plus strategy working nicely because you don't have a separate ping service.  It's just integrated in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  But didn't Facebook share this?  Did they have the play it though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess if you had Spotify.  If you have Spotify, you could just listen.  That's kind of neat.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's cool.  I like it.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to share a chapter of a book that way.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whoopie scene.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Oh, check out the internal Google header there.  Confidential.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And better yet, it's not limited to individual tracks.  When I purchase an album, I can actually share the entire thing with my Google Plus friends.  They'll be able to listen from start to end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One full album play.  Holy cow.  It's also not limited to the web.  I'm shocked the music industry allowed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's what Zuckerberg argued.  That it's proven that it's going to lead to more purchases.  Right.  It's radio play.  Trivially easy to record, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're going to go that far, you'll just pirate it anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I guess so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to see how easy they could buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they've got to make it easy to buy, right?  There should be a button that says, buy this album.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The smart thing would be to give a genius share something with me.  I buy it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And a new version of Music Manager  automatically updating  over the next few hours.  All of this is available  for US users starting now.  No invitations required.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm trying to get my Android download going here.  Now I'd like to introduce Zahavel Levine,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  our Director of Content Partnerships,  to talk about the great music that we have in the store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I would love to be able to make a mixtape,  a playlist of songs,  different tracks that one's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's where Spotify has a huge advantage, right?  Spotify's a huge advantage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  As Paul and Michael just showed, with Google Music,  you can discover new music,  whether it's chart toppers or hidden gems  from less known artists, in several different ways.  You can browse by genre  or by new releases  or by staff picks.  You can check out Google's  recommendations for you.  Or even better,  you can listen to the tracks  and albums that your friends have purchased  and sent to you, and then you can buy those songs  from those very same links.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We know this is a good idea because they're already bitching in the UK  that they can't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, this is very similar to PING,  except you're not limited to 90 seconds.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does this beat Amazon?  Because I don't have friends on Amazon.  Aha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If it's the same catalog  and price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, let's see the partners. Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Our partners include  major record labels, EMI Music,  Universal Music Group,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sony Music Entertainment,  and independent record labels,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  many, many independent record labels,  including The Beggar's Group,  Mer, Warp, and many, many more.  And other partners such as Merlin,  the global rights agency for independent music,  and aggregators of  independent music such as  Iota, The Orchard, and Ingros.  Collectively,  our partners include  over a thousand record labels,  bringing us authorization  to distribute over 13 million tracks  from Google Music.  That's a good number. Not 18 million, but it's...  About 8 million are live today.  The rest we'll be adding in the coming months, so  thanks for your patience as we add  new tracks as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they're missing Warner Music.  That is a fairly large one, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Who does Facebook have?  Spotify.  And RDO and Mog and everybody else.  These partners share our vision  of delighting users with  innovative new ways of discovering  and pursuing music.  To represent this group of world-class partners,  I'd like to invite three music visionaries  up on the stage to share a few thoughts  on a lot of Google Music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Mark Phoebe, executive vice president  from EMI Music.  Executive vice president from EMI Music.  Rob Wells, president,  Global Digital Business,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Universal Music Group.  And Charles Caldiss, CEO of Merlin BV,  the global rights agency for independent music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I cannot wait to talk to them.  The EMI guy's going to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  really nice to the Universal guy on stage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Thanks so much to have it.  I'm Mark Phoebe from EMI Music.  You know, it's a real privilege  to be able to work with great artists  and also to work with pioneering new services  like Google Music to connect those artists  with fans in rich new ways.  And ultimately,  to tap the immense potential  of an online, mobile,  and social music experience.  So, break a leg, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm Rob Wells from Universal.  I feel,  with these two guys alongside me,  I feel the need to burst into BG covers.  But I won't.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  But I won't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I won't.  Universal, we're immensely pleased to be here today.  Doing any deal with Google  for the sale of our repertoire  is groundbreaking  on a number of levels.  We expect this to be a rich new revenue stream  for our artists.  We are very excited about the prospect  of the global rollout of the platform  through all Android devices.  And any new legitimate place to consume music  is a fantastic anti-piracy tool.  So we're very pleased to be here.  And we wish Google success in all these endeavors.  Interesting that he acknowledges that.  Of course, that's the stick

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that Steve Jobs was able to beat them with.  On behalf of the thousands of independent labels  that we represent from around the world,

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  we're particularly pleased to see  Google launching a music store today.  And with that, I'm going to turn it over  to Rob Wells.  We're launching a music store today  and we think it will be a significant new music destination  in the digital space.  We're particularly pleased that Google  recognized very early on  the commercial significance of independent repertoire  in the digital music market  and worked with us very closely  to make sure that the music, music,  and the time they first engaged in the service  have access to the thousands of fantastic  independent labels and artists  we represent from around the world.  And equally, we wish them all success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The ASCAP BMI of Indies.  Applause

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Except for performance is not public.  Applause

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thank you, John.  We are very glad that we have such a great chapter of content partners on board.  Interesting.  And of course, we anticipate adding new partners  as they wish to come on board  in the coming months. We look forward to that.  Warners.  They'll get Warners. If they've got everybody else,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  there's no reason for Warners to hold out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We think we'll give you just a little added extra incentive  to try Google Music now.  We've worked with a handful of artists  and their labels to offer some  fantastic music that you will not find  anyplace else. From each of these artists,  we have music exclusively on Google Music

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  including some free tracks  to get you started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  These are artists who are truly  excited about the power of Google to bring  their music to millions of fans.  Busta Rhymes.  Rolling Stones. Huge.  Wow.  This is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I already see add a new and exclusive  Busta Rhymes single to your library.  Thank you. I shall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Busta Rhymes playing at the T-Mobile event  at 9pm tonight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He looks angry about the whole thing though.  Shakira's not too happy.  Interesting they got the Stones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stones of course, very slow  to accept digital music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We didn't Coldplay not  be involved in the Spotify  or Rdio?  Iconic rapper.  Busta Rhymes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who's there?  Busta Rhymes.  He's making all the rounds.  Where's Gaga?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Busta Rhymes will be debuting his new studio  album exclusively on Google Music.  And the first single from this album  is available today for free right now.  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I just downloaded it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In addition, we have live albums from Pearl Jam, from Shakira, and from Dave Matthews.  It's not just Busta Rhymes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's Lil Wayne and Busta Rhymes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's more and I won't get into all the details.  But please visit our post on the official Google blog.  And better yet, go to the store and check it out.  We're really excited about this great exclusive.  You're in the store on your mobile device?  No, I'm on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't get in the store on my mobile.  I'm having trouble getting into the store myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's one more group of very important artists

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  we'd like to mention.  To tell you about these artists and how they can work with Google Music.  We'd like to ask everybody in our audience to stop trying to go to the store.  Android's Engineering Director of Cloud Services  and aspiring rock star.  Here's the garage fan pitch, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you, Zahava.  Even today's biggest superstars

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  started out  I want the T-shirt.  I want that T-shirt.  I want it too.  And today, that community of independent artists  is bigger than ever.  From bedroom DJs creating laptop masterpieces  to established acts  putting their next studio recording out.  We want to work  with these self-released artists  who have yet to get a label deal  to engage with their fans, sell their music  while taking advantage  of Google's reach.  Built right into Google Music  is the Artist Hub.  A tool that gives you a direct route  to distributing music  so long as you own the rights to your recordings.  Music submitted through the Artist Hub  shows up in the music store  just like any other album.  This is very good.  On iTunes, you have to do a deal with somebody

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  like CD Baby for this to work.  Really?  No, I thought you could submit your MP3s directly to the store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you now?  I thought that was built into Garage Band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sounds more like SoundCloud.  But you couldn't sell it.  Could you sell it?  I don't think you could sell it.  I'm not hip enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  We've given a bit of a sneak preview of this  to some independent artists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's hear from them now.  You can't sell it. You can only upload it.  So that's actually a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I think about Google  and music together  because first of all I use Google every day.  My phone is Android.  Anytime anyone tells me to listen to new music

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I just Google it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is very big for Google, I think.  Not merely as a music thing  but to really establish them  as a social player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It means I attend five days a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You end up being your own manager.  They don't have any other stores like this.  We drive the van ourselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  I don't drive. I'm not allowed to drive.  We ruin our trailer ourselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I learned HTML two years ago, which was an experience.  If you're independent, nobody's handing you anything.  I like the indie artists though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder what the tie will be to YouTube and music videos and all that.  Yeah, good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Basically it's not easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Pump or boost?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And you can set your own price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is a big deal.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  What kind of cut do they get?  They're not going to say today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's an ad-free music link  that you can add all the free music in every genre.  You can really build a library this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I hope they have Creative Commons on here too

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so you can use them for podcasts.  That would be fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  There's YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's the YouTube connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This just intermediates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That works.  All you need is marketing.  And YouTube can do some of that, right?  Well, that's what Google's going to promote, right?  You're friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're friends.  This is great.  This doesn't happen without Apple dominating the music industry

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and the music labels saying,  we've got to do something about Apple's dominance.  Because really this is also a slap in the face to the big music labels.  Yes.  You're right, Leo. Apple did a huge favor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  The possibilities that it brings at a large scale.  Now, this is a bit of a new concept for a digital retailer.  So I'd like to walk you through what the experience is like for the artists.  And when I'm going to do so,  I'm going to do so using Monogold, the band that opened us up today as an example.  Oh, Artist Pages too.  When an artist comes into the art force...  That's why they announced Brand.  There goes MySpace.  Now, if it turns out that this is an artist we don't know about yet,  they can create their Artist Page for $25.  That's now called Google Space.  This is a one-time artist registration fee.  It works the same way as Android developers who want to sell their...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's the store on the...  It is the Android Market.  Get started with free music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  I have to check out Google Music Store.  So what we allow them to do...  Oh, yeah, I want to sell books this way.  Here's all the free music.  You can't.  47 songs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Earth, Wind & Fire, Busta Rhymes, Chris Isaac.  And...

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  But of course, the real benefit here...  This is interesting.  Go ahead and sell their music directly to fans within Google Music.  Listen to this.  So to do this, the next step is artists will upload their original content,  individual songs or albums.  They set some metadata about it like genre and pricing info.  And then we also allow the artists to control how previews work in the music store.  So, for example, they can elect to enable 90-second previews of their content.  Full preview or even unlimited free plays of their music within the Google Music Store.  And of course, like all purchases...  So it really does replace SoundCloud.  ...in the Google Music Store, shares to Google Plus include a single free play for your friends.  That's very big.  Now, artists keep 70% of the revenue for sales of their content in the store.  That's good.  And there's no per album or annual upload fees required here.  This is huge for independent musicians.  That's going to mean that it's really easy for artists to release their music as frequently as they see fit.  That's fantastic.  So, you know, in addition to studio tracks, artists can put up demo material...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There have been stars made in YouTube.  Have there been any stars made in Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  ...recording from a gig earlier in the week.  That's a good question.  They can also change pricing or any of the albums...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can imagine somebody going, hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  ...giving them significantly more control over how they distribute their music.  We're also working with YouTube to allow artists to sell songs directly against their music videos...  Or on their YouTube channel pages.  And we're doing this as part of YouTube's recently announced merchandise store.  Now, Monogold has set everything up.  They've uploaded all their content.  So why don't we pop back over to the Music Store and see how it looks there.  So we're going to go and do a search for Monogold here.  And when we do...  You'll see in the search results, they show up with the artist image that they uploaded.  Who needs a record company?  What does a record company do for you now?  ...artist detail page.  And, you know, a little reload between friends is never a bad thing.  Exactly. Who needs...  And so here you see that their biography information is there as well as the albums and tracks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, for the indie artists, you wouldn't have the international restrictions you have for the mainstream publishers.  I wonder if they'll make this available globally quicker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  This is fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pure musician. This has got to be the best news you've ever heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  Yeah.  So if you are an independent artist with original content, we've got your audience.  The Google Music Store is built into Android Market and installed on millions of Android devices.  I'm waiting for the Google AdWords integration.  So I invite you to come to Music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you're right.  You know, I hope it makes sense.  And if you want to promote your music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  And to kick this off, we're excited to have a handful of notable Artist Hub users on board already.  So what else could they sell in the same way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do. I agree with you. We've got to see books, magazines, content of all kinds, movies, TV shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you can upload your book to the Google Books program. Does that take it into the Android Store?

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  Yeah, they have books in the Android Store.  I think there's not the sharing and all that other stuff. I want to share a chapter or something like that.  You know?  I mean, you can do that annually, obviously.  And now we're going to turn it back to Jamie, who will tell you about a very important partner in bringing Google Music to fans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What happens on the iPhone? I'm curious.  Thanks, Chris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I guess you can't participate.  We're able to bring Google's music offering to millions of people because of the tremendous support we have from the carriers and manufacturers who form the backbone of the Android ecosystem.  The very first distribution partner for Android was T-Mobile USA, who got this all started with the launch of the G1 back in 2008.  It seems fitting then that T-Mobile is with us here today to help us celebrate this exciting milestone.  It's been quick, hasn't it?  It has.  And even as it relates to music, T-Mobile is a pioneer with us once again.  We're pleased to announce that coming very soon, T-Mobile customers will be able to pay for music purchases directly through their T-Mobile phone bill, as they can do with Android Market applications today.  For some additional announcements, I'd like to call up Andrew Sherrard, Senior Vice President, Marketing for T-Mobile USA.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Why?  You know, not everybody wants to set up a Google checkout account, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  You know, as the first mover with Android, T-Mobile has a deep history and experience working with Google.  Since the introduction of Android, it's been amazing to see exactly how the mobile experience has been transformed.  And since that G1 has launched, the Google ecosystem has grown incredibly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's not a mobile site for the Android Market.  So iOS, I guess you could do it on the non-mobile site.  Today, T-Mobile has the largest selection of Android devices running on America's largest...  I think they're really saying, buy Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  What's surprising is that...  The music.google.com is on iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Pardon me?  Music.google.com has a web app for iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The mobile site is great.  Right.  And plays and everything. But as soon as you go to the shopping experience, you get the desktop site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because that's the Apple rule.  Amazon can't sell directly to the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you don't have to do it in an app, but you could do it...  Can't you do a mobile site that's...  Yeah, you can do a mobile site, applecan.com.  Oh, I see.  I mean, I don't think there's an app.  There's no app on iOS for Google Music.  But the mobile site is so good, you don't need an app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  See, this is really about...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the reason they chose to do that is to push people to Android.  Well, there's an independent app called G-Music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't fully get that.  This is disruptive to all of media.  And while I make it dependent on Android, sure, let it push Android.  Why not?  That's what I said early on.  Well, because they're losing people.  And those people are our audience for these musicians.  So the more audience you have for these musicians, the more power the disruption...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe the theory here is isolate Apple users.  They got iTunes.  They want to live in that Apple ecosystem.  We're not going to fight it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It could just be development priorities, you know?  We made the mobile site for Android first.  We'll get around iOS later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, as I said, they have an excellent mobile site for iOS for the Google Music.  Yeah, it's just the store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  But we know they want more.  They don't just want to stream music.  They want to share it.  They want to discover music.  And they want to be able to organize it.  To date, there really hasn't been anything that's done that very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can see that it might be in some companies, and particularly in Google's interest, to say us versus them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  The music you love...  I would think they just want as many people using it as possible.  And that's where our reliable network really comes into play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is the way they treat a lot of their other things, like RG now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  When we combine a fast 4G network and Google Music, we believe this will transform the industry.  It's a whole new experience.  Not only will you be able to discover music in a new way,  you'll also be able to share those purchases with your friends through Google+.  That is fantastic.  And T-Mobile is going to enhance that experience by running it on our fastest smartphones,  from HTC, from Samsung,  and allow people to discover and share music faster than they can even do it at home.  So to celebrate that, I'm happy to announce that we're going to have some free, exclusive content for our customers.  This includes...  Ah, Louis Gray has shared the first song on Google+.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Welcome to the world of Google Music on Google+.  If you pull up my screen...  Of course, it would be Louis Gray who is working at Google+.  He's sharing the Daft Punk Tron song.  Here's the preview.  Comments, sharing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Through the end of the year.  We know our customers are going to have a great experience using Google Music...  Only one share.  Across our compelling lineup of Android smartphones...  Oh, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you can buy the song and share it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's see. I just reshared it. Let's see what happens.  You did reshare it.  I can reshare it.  And the preview.  Look at that.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Oh.  Thanks very much, Andrew.  So with that, let's recap what we've discussed today.  Worldwide Android activations now stand at 200 million.  The Music Beta cloud service becomes Google Music, opens up to everyone in the US...  And will store and stream your music for free, up to 20,000 songs.  The new music store in Android Market allows you to add to your collection...  With millions of songs, personalized recommendations, rich editorial content...  And lots of free songs to get you started.  The store launches today on the web at market.android.com...  And rolls out to Android devices in the US over the next few days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But wait a second, G. The thing you shared says listen to preview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Any song or album you purchase in the music store...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't listen to the whole song.  Be shared on your website with your friends.  Ah, you're right.  I thought you were supposed to be... Oh, that's key. I thought you could listen to the whole song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, wait a minute. I see listen to preview here, too.  Maybe the preview is one...

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  How long is the preview?  I thought the artist sets it.  Yeah, the preview is only 30 seconds on us.  Full play.  Yeah, that's what he said.  Is that a bad word, either, or is that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, chat room, somebody play one of those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's 30 seconds. I can see it. It's only 30 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. Come on, guys.  That's just a bug. That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  No issue.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because they did say full song, right?  They did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  They did. I'm seeing other shares that say listen once for free. So that must be...  Is it your reshare that's only 30 seconds?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no.  Because Louis Gray's was...  Okay, let me reshare Christina Warren, Film Girls.  So she has a listen once for free.  Google Music is now open for free.  Yeah, it looks like it's going to do the same.  It's going to be listen once for free.  So it's just you reshare what the person shared in the first place.  So, yes, it does work.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, now I have to delete this, otherwise I'm spamming everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, very interesting.  I think a very significant announcement from Google.  Music.android.com.  It's the Android Marketplace, which shows you that they're really focused on the mobile side of this,  as much as the desktop side of this.  And social.  And social is huge. This is what Google had promised with Google+.  They said Google Plus will be an experience across all Google platforms.  And by turning it on in its biggest way so far with Google Music,  they get a double bang because, of course, it's a great way to launch a service like Google Music.  And it really pushes people towards Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yeah, this is huge. This is going to sell a ton of music.  I mean, it just is.  I can't wait to get my hands on the API for this.  I want to say, you know, give me all the tracks for my friends, which I haven't listened once yet to.  And I want to see their faces next to them.  And I want to know who the people who I've bought stuff from the most, you know, who are my music muses.  I just think this is great.  And I'd love to see anything that helps us get toward fewer Britney Spears and more Jonathan Caltons.  I'm all about.  And I really feel like the focus on the indie artists is very much in the spirit of YouTube and independent content creators.  I think Myspace is not going to be the place.  I mean, Myspace is still the place for bands to post tracks.  I mean, my 13-year-old nephew is in a band. He posts his tracks to Myspace still.  So this is really, really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now we can sell them. Now we can promote them. Now we can do so much more. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  And it's interesting how they're treating musicians like developers, you know, that you're kind of saying that artist hub experience is a lot like the Android market experience for developers.  We have that one time fee to pay to set up an artist page is one time.  And then you determine how your content gets previewed and what your price is.  I mean, that's that's that's developers are talent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're creative talent. Right.  I've been telling my agent at ICM that they should be they should be representing developers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I love it. Very interesting.  Yeah, that is really interesting.  So now, I mean, you know, you want to see this kind of thing for authors, for filmmakers, for, you know, for Zine, for people who make Zines online.  I mean, this is this is this is awesome.  I'm really excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Down with the mediators. Down with the mediators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, in a way, Google is a mediator, but a but a generous mediator. Right.  They're still taking 30 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they're the centralizer. Right.  I think that's what I like the most about this is I feel like this is a much friendlier way to manage my music than iTunes with iTunes.  I like cloud.  I have to remember, well, some of it's up there in iCloud and some of it's on my device.  And I can't look at it all at once and really know because I have to launch the app.  This is website. I go to the same website everywhere.  I just feel centered. I feel like I've got everything.  It's a much more contained universe to live in.  And it's very attractive.  I'll have to play with it and see, you know, I've been playing with the beta, but let's see if I could live inside of it.  But for some reason, this strikes me as just an easier way to keep track of all the music you own.  That's Tom Merritt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to go to TNT in a moment and wrap up this week in Google in a moment.  But before we do, I want to take a break.  When we come back, we'll summarize what we've just learned.  You know, I think a very important announcement from Google Music dot Android dot com and Google Music now goes public.  For those of us who've been using it in beta, and I think that's all three of us, it's been a great service.  But with the addition of a store and all the labels, but Warner Brothers, I think this is a very significant move by Google into the music space.  We'll talk about it more in just a second.  Before we do, though, I'd like to mention that Ford is sponsoring our shows as always.  We love Ford. I love my Ford Mustang.  Bought it two years ago. You know, I think it's time for another Ford.  Maybe that electric focus. I'd love to get that.  One of the things that's new in the new Ford 2012 Ford focus is this Wi-Fi access hotspot.  Very, very cool. You plug in a 3G card into the USB port in your Ford, and all of a sudden your car is a rolling Wi-Fi hotspot for up to five people.  There's so many great features. The new MyFord Touch.  They're going to be rolling out upgrades to everybody who has it.  Beautiful new user interface.  The app link that lets you control smartphone apps with your voice, keeping your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road.  And of course, the technology that goes into the powertrains, the engines, the plug-in hybrid electrics, the all-electrics, the BLISK system that monitors your blind spots, the active park assist.  These are high-tech vehicles. You can find out more at ford.com slash technology.  Best way, though, is to drive a Ford. And I can tell you as if I'm a Ford family baby.  As a Ford owner, I want to welcome you to the Ford family.  Join the Blue Oval and get yourself a Ford. Drive one today at a Ford dealer near you.  Visit it online at ford.com slash technology.  And Ford, we love you. Thank you so much for making it possible to do what we do here at This Week in Google.  So very, I think a very exciting announcement, but pretty much what we would have expected from a Google.  The details are 70-30 split for artists.  The very important note that you don't have to have a record label to sell your music on Google's music marketplace.  You can have absolute parity with Coldplay and everybody else as an independent artist, uploading your music, creating a page, setting your price.  This is huge. Really a universal marketplace for independent musicians.  I think that's exciting. There is, of course, a lot of disappointment in our audience because we have a very international audience that it's available U.S. only.  That's absolutely to be predicted because, of course, every record label has got its own national interests and you have to do a deal with every country individually.  It is, I'm sure, a matter of time. Google being one of the most international companies out there before Google makes this possible all around the world.  But they've got to get the record companies to go along.  And so far they've got them all except Warner Brothers here in the States.  So even in the U.S. we can't get the full feature set.  They said 8 million songs available today. They plan to get to 13 million in the next few weeks.  They will roll out an updated Google market app for the Android phones that will feature music.  They don't yet.  And presumably they will do something for I.O.S.  Although right now I.O.S. is left out in the cold.  It took a while before Google Music worked on I.O.S.  It just may be a matter of time.  Thoughts, Gina? You said you're excited about an API.  They didn't announce an API, but you're pretty sure they'll have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I'm sure that the current Google Plus API has support for lots of different kinds of actions and pieces of content.  So I'm sure that sharing a music track like sharing a circle or sharing a video is just one of the different kinds.  So they've been kind of slow with Google Plus API so far, but I am pretty confident that that's going to come out.  And it'll be interesting to see how the DRM bits of that, you know, limiting to one play per friend, how that's going to work in third party apps.  But I'm sure we'll see that soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Jeff, you're excited, but you would like to see this kind of store and sharing extended to other forms of media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I really think it's a model for that.  I'm in Canada right now where my book's not for sale and I can't get into music because I'm in Canada.  But yeah, I think that in general, you know, if you're an independent artist, this becomes a new way to sell whatever you do.  And, you know, people accuse me of being against pay walls for content. I'm not.  I'm for them. I'll sell you my book if you can only get it in the store.  But you wind. But, you know, it's hard to do that.  It's hard to make it happen. If you have these easy mechanisms to sell things to people, we'll be able to sell more things.  And more important that by far is to maintain a bigger price.  Believe me, I don't get 70 percent of the cover price of a book. No way. Far from it. You're lucky to get five percent. Right.  Exactly. And so the idea that the creators can now be in more control of their world becomes really exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Best deal I ever got, I think, was 15 percent of the half the cover price.  So the equivalent of seven and a half percent. And that's very unusual.  Ten to five to ten percent of the half of the cover price, because, of course, the publisher doesn't get the full cover price, just half of it.  It's pretty typical. So getting 70 percent. It's awesome. Golden.  And I'm sure it's the same for music, better even for musicians. I mean, they get robbed routinely.  The days of an Edna James signing over the entire value of her catalog for a bottle of whiskey and a cigarette are long gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank goodness. So yeah, there's new mechanism to distribute this new mechanism to recommend through sharing,  which I think is critical both here in Google and at Facebook, the new means to distribute things with your new fire.  All of this is just tearing the rugs out underneath the mediators. And you know what? They all deserve it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  God bless them. Bye bye. Bye bye now. Bye bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's to me the most exciting part of this announcement is the fact that an independent recording artist,  there are so many great musicians in this world who do not have a record deal, who will now be able to have parity.  Right. Huge. And I think of my son who loves music and I'm glad that he's growing up in a world where he'll have a chance to sell his music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's fantastic. You want to stop online piracy? Don't break the DNS system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you. Let's not forget this is Internet censorship day. If you haven't called your member of Congress, it's not too late.  Go to EFF.org and all the information you need to fight SOPA is right there.  Just click the website blocked button, put your zip code in and they will give you the email address and more importantly,  the phone number of your member of Congress and do call your member of Congress today, your representative and your senator.  Tell the representatives that you want to stop the Stop Online Piracy Act, SOPA. Tell your senator you want to stop protect IP and that you care about a free and open Internet.  Very, very important to let them know on this day, Internet censorship day.  TNT is up next. Tom Merritt with Tech News Today and I'm sure there'll be lots more coverage.
