Transcript:  It's time for Twig this week in Google.  Leo's in Hawaii drinking a beverage with a tiny umbrella in it.  My name's Mike Elgin and I'm filling in for Leo.  Jeff and Gina are here and we'll be sifting through the aftermath of last week's Google  I.O.  Stick around, this week in Google is next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Netcasts you love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  From people you trust.  This is Twig.  Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by Cashfly.  C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y dot com.  This is Twig, this week in Google, episode 256, recorded July 2nd, 2014.  A machete, a shotgun, and a votive candle.  It's time for Twig this week in Google, where we cover all things cloudy and Google-ish-ous.  With us today is the usual cast of characters, I am not Leo Laporte.  That's the bad news.  The good news, we have Jeff and Gina with us, starting with Jeff Jarvis, professor of  journalism at City University of New York.  And I heard on this show that you've been recently anointed with total professorial  powers.  You cannot be touched.  Oh yes, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I have tenure too, so.  What the heck with you?  That too, why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Boy, we should have tenure here at Twig, that'd be great.  And I'm glad I'm here on this show.  I always listen to this show and it's great to be here.  Somebody will hear me when I talk back at you guys.  And Gina Trapani, creator of ThinkUp.com, host of Twits all about Android, and founding  editor of Lifehacker.  How you doing Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hello, great to be here.  How did I not see either one of you at Google I.O.?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't see either one of you.  Because you were busy working, Mike.  You were working.  I don't remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a busy couple of days.  It was.  It was crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the greatest thing, day two I went to a session, I did this and that, but of  course most of them aren't meant for me.  But I would just stand in the hall and honest to God, one after another, after another of  you magnificent Twig fans would come up and say, hey, Jeff Jarvis, I'm a fan of Twig.  And we'd take pictures and it was just, I could have spent the whole day just talking  to Twig fans.  It was wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Those are definitely our people, aren't they?  At Google I.O.  Yes.  It was pretty awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the one moment, it was one time I really feel like a celebrity.  I had people stop and ask to take pictures with me too.  And I was like, this is crazy.  I was telling my mom, she was just like, what?  I was like, yeah, mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For real.  Same thing for me.  You take one step out the door into the streets of San Francisco and you are nobody.  So that was a lot of fun.  So Google is buying or has bought Songza, a music play service that competes with the  likes of all the music services.  To me in terms of functionality, in terms of its sense of curation, I think it competes  very closely with Apple's Beats music service, kind of, sort of.  Jeff and Gina, why did they buy this?  We'll start with you, Jeff.  Why did they buy this music service?  Can you call on Gina first?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They need music.  I think it's simple as that.  They can go cheaper than Apple's gone with Beats.  And these music services are going to get snapped up because they have an audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But does Google need cheaper?  I mean, you know, it's like, you know, they throw around billions of dollars like it's  nothing and here they probably spent more than $39 million.  The valuation was somewhere around $15 million, but there's apparently competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's Padre's chocolate budget.  Yeah, right.  Exactly.  Well, yeah.  Who can keep up with that?  It's not much.  And I think that the truth is that at times Google does know it's build or buy and times  Google knows that it should buy, not build.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, so you have, obviously, have an intimate familiarity with Google.  The secret sauce of songs is human curation.  That doesn't sound like a Google thing to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, as we learned in the organization of Iowa a couple of times last week, humans are  not Google's specialty.  No.  I'm joking.  I'm joking.  I was very happy to be there.  I'm not complaining at all.  Just making it clear.  Just making a little joke.  No, I think songs, I don't use it, so I don't know that much about it.  So Gina, do you use it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't use songs, but I do use Google Play Music a lot.  And so it kind of makes sense to me that Google would look to snap up a company like this  for a relatively small price and Google scale, financially anyway, that can help them improve  there.  I listen to I'm Feeling Lucky radio a lot.  That's basically what I just do at this point.  I just go into Google Play Music.  It has my music.  It knows what I like.  I press I'm Feeling Lucky.  And it's pretty good some of the time.  So if an acquisition like this makes that better, I think it makes a lot of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One of the crazy things about songs is that it changes the playlist based on your context.  And that is a very Google-y thing.  It's also advertiser-supported.  That's a Google-y thing.  But the context even goes so far as a deal that they have with the Weather Channel that  changes the songs based on the weather, based on your weather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, of course, Mike, if this were bought by Facebook, they would know when you're sad  because they made you sad.  So they play you sad music and then play you happy music to make you happier.  So they manipulate your feelings constantly, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm so glad you brought that up.  Why don't we talk about that?  This really sort of like chaps my hide here, this Facebook thing, because for a number  of reasons, yesterday we talked on Tech News Today.  We were talking to the person, Kashmir Hill at Forbes, who broke the story that in fact  when they, in 2012, when they actually tested the feature to see if they can make people  sad or happy based on what, you know, they're tweaking their feeds, that they didn't actually  have explicit language in the terms of service talking about research and the sorts of things  that they in fact did.  Facebook countered to that saying, oh, it's all about improving the service.  That's what it was all about.  That's always been in terms of service.  So that's one problematic aspect to this.  But to me, this is an example of Facebook so, and probably Google too, which is, you  know, they're so used to messing around and determining what we see and what we don't  see that the reasons for doing that are not as important to them as it probably is to  the public.  I mean, it's just like, you know, to actually affect people's moods.  I mean, Gina, do you use Facebook at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do use Facebook and I thought about this a lot and my first gut reaction, I'm sad to  admit, you know, was very much the sort of, yeah, well, it made me sad.  I kind of took this technologist's view where I was like, well, companies A, B test things  all the time, right?  Like so many so many products are constantly tweaking.  Google does this.  I mean, everything is run on an algorithm.  Everything is data driven based on reactions and clicks and everything is being adjusted.  So it didn't surprise me at all that Facebook did this.  I was a little surprised at the outcry about the ethics of it.  I suppose the idea that users should have been informed in a more explicit way makes  sense to me. But I was kind of I mean, I I think there's a lack of empathy.  About the communication about this, right?  Like the communication should have been clear that the terms of service wasn't enough.  These folks shouldn't should have been let know.  But at the same time, I kind of was like, this is constantly going on.  You know, how is this different than A, B testing a headline or an email subject line,  which goes on constantly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. And every every every marketer out there, every entertainment, every politician  and political campaign does the same thing.  But it's kind of a techno panic thing again.  Facebook was tone deaf in the communication.  You are absolutely right about that.  You know, they got kind of caught rather than being open about this.  And there have been experiments in the past.  I remember that Yahoo had a great lab that was that was test A, B testing behavioral  impact on people. I'm not against that in in theory.  But when it hurts your business because of the way it's discovered, then that's just  stupid. And I think Sheryl Sandberg has basically said that they did.  They certainly had a communications problem on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, I think this is slightly different than your average garden variety  techno panic. And I'm always with you on the techno panic argument, Jeff, that you  make. But in this case, actually making people sad on purpose.  That's an exaggeration. They didn't make that many people that sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but Mike, that's what every chick flick does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, but people know it.  I think a big part of this story that's interesting is the degree to which people are  not aware that that algorithm, you know, noise filtering goes on.  But let's do talk about the techno panic aspect of it.  Let's say they discovered, which in fact they did.  They came to the conclusion that one of the conclusions of the paper that was published  around this is that, in fact, mood is contagious.  If they can tweak your newsfeed to be happier or sadder, you tend to post things that are  happier and or sadder.  There's some question about whether it's good science, whether that's a legitimate  conclusion, but that was their conclusion.  So let's say that's true.  And let's say they did conclude that.  And that's the conclusion.  So maybe Facebook wants to make your newsfeed a happy place.  Maybe they decide that as a matter of policy, because nobody knows.  This is the part that kind of bothers me.  Nobody knows what their algorithms are.  They even got rid of the name.  It's sort of like in the Soviet Union when they used to erase people from the photographs,  people were too many people were thrown around the E word edge rank.  So they basically said, well, now, now it's not called edge rank anymore.  It doesn't have a name.  So now we can't really talk about it all that clearly.  But they do have secret algorithms that nobody is aware of.  They're changing constantly.  They're testing them constantly.  What if what if Facebook or some other social network decided to deliberately improve the  service by making everybody happy?  Jeff, is that a is that a techno panic reaction as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, I'll be an old tabloid guy.  I'll play into this and panic you more.  There was a hedge fund that I wrote about this in and in public parts, a computer scientist,  University of Indiana, tracked six moods and their opposites with various keywords and  found that he could predict the daily ups and downs in the Dow Jones with more than  90 percent accuracy.  So guess what happened?  The hedge fund hired his butt and they created a new hedge fund based on this.  Now, the next step, I said at the time, the next step behind this is, of course, you'll  try to manipulate the mood of the country because you're going to arbitrage that mood.  And if you read the wonderful Michael Lewis book Flash Boys, which I do recommend, it's  phenomenal.  You know, it's not beyond Wall Street and marketers to do exactly that and to profit  from it to affect the mood of the country for a reason or another.  So, yeah, that's possible to be there.  But at some point there are cash beer heels in the world.  And at some point, you know, the truth will out and we'll figure it out.  This goes. This reminds me of going back to the early days of television advertising.  And I'm old enough to have been around almost then when when the panic of the time was  that there was subliminal advertising and that and that things were shot at us on the  screen would convince us, you know, buy deodorant, buy deodorant, you stink, you stink.  And and you start to believe it.  Well, it was never really true.  If we really believe that we are that we are as a people, such sheeples that a Facebook  news feed could affect truly our entire mood and thus the country, then we got bigger  problems, I think.  Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's hard because I feel like a lot of my friends would be really upset  about me saying this right now, because a lot of my friends, particularly in community  management, were really upset about the fact that Facebook did not communicate this and  that they were they were overusing their power.  This is a power relationship and manipulating emotions is unethical.  But I mean, if Facebook tweaks their news feed to make people happier when they use  Facebook, how is that different than anybody building any product who's trying to create  a better user experience?  Right.  I mean, think about any sort of experience you have with a product.  Of course, the maker is trying to make people feel happy or compelled to do any advertising  is it manipulates our emotions.  Music and movies manipulate our emotions.  I mean, and I mean, I think we know that.  So it just felt like and also this finding that emotions are contagious.  I mean, it's news really.  I mean, we're empathetic beings.  I mean, do we need to study on Facebook to find out that if you guys are sad, I'm also  going to feel sad or if you're joyous and happy and upbeat that that's not going to  be contagious.  And it just didn't seem like news to me.  I don't know.  I feel like I don't know.  What do you think, Mike?  You seem a little more critical about this than myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm critical for two reasons.  The first reason is they don't make a super easy way for you to just turn it off.  Google doesn't either.  With Google, you can do noise filtering.  You can choose a little bit or a lot, but you can't say, give me everything.  I want the ability to just throw a switch that's right there.  And everybody knows about that switch where I just say, give me the fire hose.  And then maybe I can decide for myself, it's too much.  I want to I want some noise filtering.  I want some help.  Of course, Facebook does now allow you to granular, granular control of, you know, I  want more of this, less of this.  I don't want to hear from this person, whatever that exists for power use.  But for the most part, this whole algorithm thing, you mentioned that, you know, lots  of things make us happy or sad.  Stories make us happy or sad.  I think we go to stories to feel happy or sad on purpose.  Whereas noise filtering is based on an assumption of ignorance by the public.  Facebook knows that we want to believe that everyone that follows us will see  everything we post and we want to believe that everything that comes to us in our  newsfeed is everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's that's a whole other business issue where, of course, Facebook is  charging for access and you don't know what it's going to unless you pay them,  which is a whole issue.  But on the other hand, at Google+, they don't do the charging thing.  But of course, no one sees no, no one of our of your millions of millions of  followers see everything that you write.  That that they have an algorithm that tries to improve the service.  I know it is.  Yes, they're they're robbed.  Everyone of them robbed.  I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's it's it's the same solution that I would give to half the problems that  we talk about on these shows when we're complaining about companies.  I want transparency and control.  That's what I want.  I don't want a complete absence of transparency and I don't want the removal  of control.  And that's essentially more or less what we've got right now.  And and I think that, you know, it's one thing to do noise filtering and just,  OK, we trust Facebook to determine what our relationships are.  Essentially, that's what they're doing.  They're basically saying, you know what?  You never you never like anything on and Mildred's page.  You never comment there.  Therefore, you're not going to see anything from at Mildred anymore.  And we're severing that relationship.  And you think that you still have that relationship and then just somebody is  being quiet or you're out of sight, out of mind or whatever.  But they're determining your relationships.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the difference.  But that's a different issue from the happy or sad.  That's that's there's an algorithm filtering at all.  And you're objecting to that algorithm filtering at all, which means you object,  I think, to both Facebook and Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's I'm I'm I'm objecting to the to the lack of transparency.  They should be really clear about it because I talk to I talk to noobs all the time.  And everybody's on Facebook, right?  Everybody is on that's the face that that's a social network for everybody.  And the vast majority of people I talk to, they're like, really, they do that.  They have no idea that there's noise filtering on Facebook.  No idea. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What I want is you go to Facebook and their buttons.  Facebook make me happy.  Yeah, that's right. Make me angry.  Make me melancholy.  You know, show me this.  I'll either get kittens or I'll get lots of you know, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what BuzzFeed cats are made for.  Exactly. It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's true.  It'll be all up worthy when I want to feel hopeful and happy.  You know, just we get crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want a I will believe how I'm going to feel after I hit  this button button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be surprising with an emotion, Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Make me feel nothing, Facebook.  OK, so let's talk about  let's talk about Android one, the the platform, the reference platform  that Google announced at Google I.O.  This is for the next billion.  They said it was the next five billion.  I thought that was a bit of a reach.  But but for the next billion.  And what this is talking about is there are low cost phones are a necessity  in many, many countries in the world and many places of of even wealthy countries.  And so is that a horrible experience or is that a pretty darn good experience?  And Google says that they want to make it a really good experience,  even if this phone costs between 100 and 200 dollars unlocked.  And so Android one is their reference platform solution to this.  They're starting out launching in India.  And of course, this is going to be rolled out across the globe.  They'll be competing with all kinds of other companies going after the space.  And and to me, I think that this this part of the conversation  is part of another story that we've got in the in the in the rundown here,  which is the idea that the Google is feeling really  compelled these days to lock down the experience, to not allow skins.  It's the same thing with Android TV, Android Auto, Android Wear and Android one.  These are all theoretically versions of Android.  And you're not allowed to put your own custom interface on it.  Is this something that's going to come to the regular version of Android?  You guys think? What do you think, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, to me, I would have phrased it a little differently.  I think rather than lock in the one Android experience,  I think that Google is, you know, putting planting a flag and saying,  this is the reference experience.  This is this is this is a good Android experience.  We're trying to create a model, right?  Like Google, Google knows that Android is a mobile operating system  that's going to go out to the next billion people,  that's going to go out to the rest of the world.  And they don't want to leave the decision of what that experience is like  to other manufacturers.  You're going to load on, you know, AOSP with none of the Google add ons, right?  They want to they want to be first with that experience.  I think it's great.  I think Android one is a great thing.  I mean, certainly, I don't think being locked down is a good thing.  And certainly I'm pro Android being open source and I'm pro other companies,  even if it's big companies like Amazon or Microsoft,  you know, building a layer on top of Android.  But I really like that Google's taking the lead on defining  what a good Android experience is for their next users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you think this will increase, Gina, or decrease,  you know, Amazon like forks or the kind that you see in China, where you see,  you know, huge numbers of Android users never use a Play Store, for example.  They're not using the regular version of Google.  Will this increase or decrease that?  I think the more because on the one hand, it's like, you know,  companies who make phones might be like, well, you know,  if I can't put on my own stuff and I don't want to play,  that would that would increase the forks.  And on the other hand, if it's really compelling  and they've really got all the specs locked down and it's easy and low cost  to do and you can make a lot of money, that would that would decrease it.  So which way do you go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the more Android users there are, the more forks they're going to be  and the more the more users they're going to be and the better it is for Google,  the better it is for everybody.  You know, I think that this is Android will be the first experience  of getting online for a lot of people.  And I think that that opens up opportunities even for other other manufacturers.  But you're right, it could go both ways, but I think it's actually a good thing  for Android. I think it means more Android for everyone,  not just more Google Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they're trying to have the cake and eat it too.  And they might just accomplish it the way Google only Google can.  Is that they get a lot of crap for the fragmentation.  So this is a way to deal with that.  But yet the open horse is out of the barn  and they're going to be, as Gina just said, a lot more versions of that.  And you can kind of have a choice.  I was at a Deutche Vela conference in Bonn two days ago  and was talking with the head of a gigantic Indian public broadcaster there  and was talking about Android one straight in India.  And he got a shrug and he said, we already have Android phones for fifty dollars  and we're an inch away from having tablets for one hundred dollars.  And so, yes, you'll have the the  they're not knockoff Android, they're Android products at lower prices.  Or you can say, I want the quality experience,  and that's not going to cost me a lot more.  But I have a choice.  And by the way, I want one of these Android one phones.  I just I just can't wait to play with it and see how good it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Where would you get one in your neck of the woods?  Will we be able to go in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know that we will.  I mean, you know, next trip to India, I'm stop.  I'll buy a couple in the airport.  Would you get me one, please?  They're only two hundred bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that, you know, Google learned a lot from its experiences  and also the place, you know, the Google Play editions  of, you know, the Samsung phones, the high end phones.  And, you know, I think they've gotten a lot of confidence  that they really know what they're doing, oftentimes more than the OEMs know.  And so it's really an interesting initiative.  I think there's so many companies are going after these markets.  And I'm curious to see how low they'll go.  Like you said, they're fifty dollar phones.  How low can it possibly go?  Twenty five dollar phones, twenty dollar phones  could could be really crazy.  Still, people struggle to pay the the data rates in some of these countries.  And that's a totally different issue that Google, in fact, is potentially  in a position to do something about as well.  Well, let's talk about the right to be forgotten.  I know I know, Jeff, that this is one of your many hot button issues.  It's one of mine, too.  The reason we talk about it again today is that this went into effect.  Google is actually making stories  and information forgotten, meaning that they're removing them  from the Google search index.  And The Guardian had a really great piece by James Ball  talking about specific articles that were deindexed on The Guardian newspaper.  So this is a case, very strong case, a very clear case  that really shows the reality of this ruling by the EU  that that here are articles on The Guardian's newspaper site,  which cannot be found with the European version of Google search.  Jeff, it does this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, this is exactly what I've been screaming about the show.  I know I know probably most of our audience, I imagine, is American.  And I go off crazy about the Europeans and the Germans on these issues.  And I don't mean to besmirch everybody with the same thing,  but this was a god awful decision.  And it's now coming home to roost.  Now, one might argue that Google is very cleverly, if not cynically,  starting with deindexing news stories for justice purpose.  But fine, it proves the point.  Both Guardian and now the BBC as well has had stories deindexed for no good reason.  There's nothing libelous, nothing wrong about them.  Somebody didn't like them, didn't like what was said about them.  And and there is a whitewashing that is now enabled by the court.  But more than that, it has an impact on free speech and freedom of the press.  And my hope now is that not only Google,  but also especially The Guardian and BBC will go and sue at the European court  to protect the freedom of press and the freedom of speech.  Yes, those stories still exist on their sites,  but people can't find them because Google was ordered by a government  to take them down on behalf of people who didn't like what was said about them.  Well, that affects the speech of those who said it.  And that is the tool of tyrants.  And it is shocking that this would come out of Europe of all places with its history.  It just shows an absolute lack of understanding  of how tyrants use the ability to change history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely. And I couldn't say it better.  That's exactly how I feel about it.  And there's another element to this as well that really is really upsetting,  which is that a search index exists to reflect what is on the Internet.  It's a card catalog.  It's a terrible metaphor, but it's a card catalog for the library of the Internet.  And essentially what they're doing is they're ordering Google  to have a search engine that's increasingly.  And remember, this is cumulative as they as they're continuously erasing  tens of thousands of requests a day, tens of thousands a day.  Exactly. The search engine that everybody uses  will not reflect what is actually on the Internet.  I mean, we're trying to have a society here.  And here we have, you know, a government mandated  requirement that search engines not reflect what is on the Internet.  It's a horrible state of affairs.  Now, if they want to go after the Guardian and try to censor the Guardian.  Fine, go for it.  There are there are free speech protections in place in most countries  that, you know, certainly in Europe and certainly in the United States.  So go try that. Go try to to to erase pages.  And when and when you actually are enough of a tyrant to to  to ban actual articles that have been published by the Guardian newspaper,  then Google can change its search engine to reflect the fact  that those have been censored.  But this idea to go to the search engine and say, you know what?  We're just going to make it so that people can't find it.  This is really outrageous and really I was delighted that Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  apparently notified those whose articles are being taken down,  though there is no appeal at this, not not from Google.  This is an unappealable decision by the European court,  nor from those whose articles are deindexed.  And so suddenly now your articles taken down because some subject  of your article or your blog post or whatever.  Has asked me taken down because they don't like it.  They say it's irrelevant. They say it's no good.  Google takes it down. Google notifies you.  There's no appeal on behalf of the of the censored party here.  And that's wrong, too.  This was this was such a numb nuts court decision.  Dangerous as can be.  When I was at the Google Big Ten event where full disclosure,  Google paid for my way over, not for me.  About three weeks ago, what shocked me was I sat in the room  and I was a lone voice almost.  Fighting against this decision, Google obviously wasn't crazy about it either.  But politicians and people in the room, it just sounds cynically, OK,  oh, what's wrong with being forgotten? It's OK.  No, because it affects speech.  I'll shut up now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree with you guys, but devil's advocate on the card catalog thing,  like I don't think that Google's index is actually a representation  of everything that exists on the Internet.  Google filters spam. It filters pornography.  It ranks based on its its own internal factors,  which is not transparent about.  I mean, you know, I like I said, I agree with you about the right  to be forgotten stuff, but Google makes a lot of other judgment calls  about what content to show up in its results, particularly on the first page.  So this isn't this isn't a new a new thing for them.  You know, I saw I saw the interview in the Times where I think it was page.  It was complaining, oh, we're going to have to make these decisions  about whether or not this judgment call, whether or not we should take this thing  out of the out of the index. Google's already doing that around.  I mean, that's what that's what Matt Cutts team does. Right.  So, again, I'm playing devil's advocate and I do.  It's an important point. Yeah, it's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So then we get to then we get to the question when I was at this  this Deutchevilla event on my second trip to Germany in a few weeks,  I was kind of debating that was frustrating.  We weren't allowed to.  But he is to prove who's the head of actual Springer, who's been a major  Google foe and an argument about this.  And he brings up this argument of so-called search neutrality,  which I've said on the show is an absurd concept because that equals only noise.  So you're right. Google does make decisions based on relevance,  authority, freshness, page rank, certain criteria of what's taken down like porn.  Those who ask for transparency to that are also asking for them to be gamed.  So there is not transparency of it.  That's all the given in the case.  What makes this case different, I think, Gina, is that you have Google  ordered by a government to follow these orders, to take down these things  from people who are the subjects of of things.  And then there's no appeal.  There's no appeal from the person who's who's been taken down.  I think it's I think it's qualitatively different from an algorithm that prioritizes things.  There's another dimension to it as well that's related to the one that you mentioned, Jeff,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  which is that when these things happen by the request or action of people in the public,  what will inevitably happen?  And this is a very un-European thing.  Generally speaking, democracy in Europe, the United States differs in its emphasis  where the United States tends to emphasize freedom over equality,  whereas in Europe, especially France, they tend to emphasize equality over freedom.  And here's a case where they're de-emphasizing equality because who are the people  who are going to request that information be taken down?  It's going to be politicians, billionaires, wealthy people, you know, smithers.  Get my bad reputation cleaned up.  You know, they're going to have these reputation management companies that are very expensive.  Go and take this get rid of whatever they can, whatever bad news or bad opinion  or whatever it is they don't like, they'll attempt it.  And so over the years, if this is allowed to stand, what will happen is there'll be an imbalance  in terms of the reputations and the good and bad information based on class, wealth and so on.  And that is, to me, an extraordinarily un-European result.  Really good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that is a good point.  There's another...  There's already an access issue around class and the Internet, right?  I mean, people who don't have access to the Internet don't have no reputation.  But I agree that this could worsen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's another case, and I'm not sure if you guys talked about it on this show.  I don't recall hearing it, that happened in Canada where a judge in British Columbia  ordered Google to block not only existing websites referencing a company,  but all future references to that company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And not just in Canada, but around the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was the chilling part of it, wasn't it?  Because once you have a precedent where, for any reason, a government, a national government,  can essentially block something through the whole world or get out of the country,  well, this is the greatest thing ever for China, for Iran, for any sort of authoritarian country you can imagine.  And what do you do?  I mean, ultimately, it's just going to get worse and worse.  The other part of this decision that was pretty awful, the Canadian decision,  was that it applied only to Google.  No other search engines were required to adhere to this ruling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And by the way, that goes back to the right to be forgotten.  We haven't heard yet, because that decision does apply to Bing and Yahoo! at all.  And it'll be interesting. I haven't heard what they're doing with this.  And as I said when we started this discussion, I don't know this.  I would suspect that Google prioritized the order of its takedowns,  knowing that taking down press stories would get attention from the press.  It would get their attention, and we need that. And I'm fine with that.  I think if it's done for clever reasons, then cool.  We are talking about it, because The Guardian and the BBC wrote about this.  Now it's time to go and ask what Bing and Yahoo! are going to do about this.  And it's time to see whether there is any means of appeal to this.  A. We're starting to learn that Google will give notice,  but will notice be given by all parties to those who are taken down?  There's no apparent means of appeal.  And is there an opportunity for these censored parties to go and now sue for their own freedoms?  We'll see. This was a dumb decision that's only going to get dumber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely horrible.  Well, the big story I think that remains undiscussed on this show,  because you guys both came rushing to the studio last week from Google I.O.  and they didn't start handing out watches yet, right?  So we haven't talked about Android Wear.  We haven't.  So let's go around the horn and find out, Gina, what do you think of Android Wear?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh man, I just love this thing. I've got the LG G Watch.  And I'll tell you, my tweet link review is the hardware is flimsy and bad,  and the software is amazing.  And now that's coming from someone who loves, I love Google now.  I live in Google now.  It's the first thing I look at in the morning, last thing I look at at night.  The fact that I have kind of Google now and my notifications on my wrist,  it means that I just don't look at my phone as much during the day.  And that's something I like.  I don't want to be the person who's got my face buried in my phone all day.  It's very lightweight.  The software is really delightful to use.  It's a little rougher on the edges and has to make some improvements.  I don't use the voice control as much as I thought that I would.  Really, this is just a kind of text messaging notification system for me,  but I really, really love it.  And I can't wait to get the 360 because I think that's when the hardware has a shot at kind of catching up.  And I won't feel quite like I'm wearing such a nerd watch, but I am wearing this watch.  The software is good enough that I'm actually wearing it.  How was the hardware from Cigena?  You know, I just think that the shape of the face and it just feels kind of plasticky.  It just doesn't feel like a nice watch.  It feels like I'm wearing this plastic old Casio.  It kind of screams nerd watch.  It's comfortable though, right?  It's comfortable and it's fine.  It looks like I've got this computer on my wrist, right?  And I would like for it to just look like I have a watch on, a nice watch.  So I'm excited about the 360.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And an underappreciated fact of the 360 is that even though, as you can agree, Gina,  the LG G-Watch is very light, the 360 is significantly lighter.  Oh, really?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wouldn't have expected that with the stainless steel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It kind of looks pretty heavy.  So, Jeff, what do you think of yours?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I also got the LG.  I'm also wearing it every day.  I'm also loving it.  And I'm coming to big conclusions about my world and our world of news with it.  Because I think that the primary benefit to me so far has indeed been news updates, right?  So I saw Supreme Court decisions, things like that come across.  Now, generally, news companies are actually ironically awful at updates.  They either do too many or they don't do any at all.  But so far, I'm getting Guardian updates, I think New York Times updates and Circa updates on this.  And they're using them sparingly that it pretty much works.  It's pretty much valuable.  I'm finding the user interface still fairly clunky trying to get around and do stuff.  It constantly tells me I have zero steps when, by God, I've been walking.  I'd have to go turn on Fit.  I wish there were some other things that I could have an update for me.  The most fundamental weakness to me of this is that I use my Shine still.  I haven't updated it in a few days, but I use it probably because it can tell my sleep.  This doesn't do my sleep.  But worse than that, I have to charge it every night so I don't have a watch on knowing the time.  And I'm blind without these.  So when I was in a hotel room the last few nights, I didn't have a clock.  I don't know what time it is.  I'm waking up and I'm jet lagged.  Not having this on at night to me is an issue.  It's almost like you need to have two of them, a day version and a night version.  And soon we will.  But I agree with Gina.  I'm looking at my phone less.  I'm finding it comfortable to wear this all the time.  I said on the show last week that I think that the computer is going to migrate from the phone into this device.  And this becomes our identity.  And this becomes our primary computer.  And everything else is a slave of it.  And we're seeing the transition to that in terms of how Android is now the master of all.  I haven't used the voice either.  And it's funny because it just seems too stupid Dick Tracy-ish.  I was on the plane coming back and I dictated a voice.  I dictated a tweet on my phone.  It didn't feel weird about that.  But I feel weird about doing this.  Especially starting with, okay Google.  And it also isn't great at hearing me.  I don't find.  So now I'm trying to get it to go to that.  And I can't get it to go back to the home.  Okay now, okay Google.  Oh it did it.  Search for Gina Trapani.  No, it gave me audit.  We can't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That seems really awkward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But what's interesting I think to me about the experience of wearing it is that it immediately becomes clear that yes, smartwatches, we're all going to be wearing them.  It's such a great place for information, for contextual information, for notifications.  It's a great place for Google Now.  Google Now really never had a place before.  You had to go find it.  You had to seek it out and say, oh I'm going to use Google Now at this point.  And that's not how Google Now really needs to be used.  It needs to be ambient.  It needs to be just kind of there.  And now it's just there.  It's on the wrist.  And that's fantastic.  I'm going to try and experiment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay Jarvis.  Oh.  It didn't work.  Oh, it didn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh that's sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It works for us if we say it.  You'll usually reply, what?  What do you want?  But what's amazing to me is that this is an app.  And I've said this on a couple of other shows here at Twitter.  I'm not going to do it, but it's the first platform with a killer app, which is Google Now.  Right out of the box.  It's already got its killer app.  You know, done.  Killer app.  Well said.  And just wait until the apps come, which July 7th they start coming out.  And a year from now, how many apps are going to be out there and what are they going to be able to do?  It's really exciting that it's already so useful.  It's already so comfortable to wear, especially if you're used to using Google Glass where you have to kind of psych yourself up to go outside into public.  You can just wear this thing around.  You can relax and really use it in a sort of like invisible way without making a big scene.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, has anyone outside your two geek circles was too obvious or no, you just came back from my own in any kind of setting with a waiter or a waitress or somebody on the street?  Has anybody come up to you and said, what's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, nobody has.  It's completely invisible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which I thought my daughter noticed it.  I mean, because she saw me fiddling with it.  He's one.  So she touches it a lot like she could.  I mean, I'm not really touching it.  So that's kind of funny.  And actually, her favorite thing to do is to promise to turn it off.  And Jason and I were talking about this last night.  Like if you have kids, especially young kids, it's very sensitive to touch.  So the baby touches it or if I pick it up and her clothes brush it, it comes on.  I actually did just fall in bed last night with it on.  And then it kind of hit the pillow and came on and lit up my wife's face.  She was not happy about it.  It's not a good sleeping thing.  Like, especially in the dark when the screen gets really bright.  And then you can't turn that thing off of you.  I was like, whoops, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My wife thinks it's dumb that it's on all the time.  She thinks it should be blank.  But I said, no, my watch has time on it.  But she just thinks it's dumb.  The other problem is I cross my arms like this and it turns it on all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's very sensitive.  And it goes vzzz and it like buzzes.  I do that all the time.  I do this and all of a sudden it's buzzing.  And I'm like, is that a notification?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And what about the Motorola seems to have in the stem spot?  Is that a button?  Yeah, it's a button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It turns it on and off and you can sort of reset it and kind of reboot it.  It's unnecessary because you can do that.  Obviously, the LG G watch has no buttons at all.  No physical buttons.  So yeah, it's a button to turn it on and off.  I think they just like the look of it.  They really wanted that.  Did you also get the LG, Mike?  I did. Yeah, I have the LG as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did anybody around you get the Samsung?  What did Jason think of the Samsung?  Have you compared?  We have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We did it on before you buy yesterday and he likes it a lot.  There are pros and cons.  Generally, the Samsung is a little cheaper.  It's just under $200 where this is $229.  The Samsung has a brighter screen, a smaller battery, but longer battery life,  which is impressive because it uses a screen that doesn't show,  it doesn't light up pixels if there's no, if it's not using those pixels,  it doesn't use any energy on those pixels.  And it's a great watch.  He likes it a lot.  It's a little bigger, bulkier.  There's a little bit more chrome.  I really think it's a little bit of a wash.  Maybe the Samsung sort of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are the watch faces the same on both?  The choices of watch faces?  Oh, that, I don't know.  By the way, they're really mostly ugly as sin.  Yeah.  Which one are you guys using?  I'm using this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the one I use too.  I like that one.  It's nice and basic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I wanted to really get a nice, you know, fool you.  This is a real watch and they're pretty ugly.  Which one are you using, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm using Mini Neon, which is a little hipster for my taste,  but it was the closest I could find.  It's a little design-y and bright,  but it was like the closest I could find to something that I liked.  You're right.  I would like to see more watch faces.  It's kind of, it's got the time.  It's kind of hard to see on my screen.  Some of these are really ugly, like this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  What's the deal with that?  It's like Peter Maxx or something.  I mean, it's like, you know, it's psychedelic 70s.  I don't know what it is.  Like a children's show from the 70s or something like that.  It's really quite horrible.  And this is another example of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the one I'm using.  The one that looks like a children's show from the 70s  with the number coming out.  Yeah, it was like the, it was the least bad one, I thought.  But yeah, that's an opportunity.  The watch faces is definitely an opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is another example of how the Moto 360 is probably going to dominate.  They've already had a contest for people to crowdsource awesome pieces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there is going to be open source design.  We can download watch faces we like, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm almost certain that that is the case.  And, you know, a year from now there are going to be tens of thousands of watch faces to choose from.  And so that's going to be kind of cool.  But yeah, the ones out of the box for the LG G Watch are, you know, pretty slim pickings  if you want a good looking watch, I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't wait for the Rolex knockoff watch face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  Well, one other question that we, that somebody wrote about this week  is the question of whether or not Android Wear sort of invalidates or makes obsolete Google Glass.  They have similar functions in terms of their, you know, app extensible,  notification oriented, Google Now oriented wearable devices.  The biggest difference, I think, besides the fact that Google Glass lives on your face,  is that Google Glass has a camera that you point at everybody you look at.  And that's the biggest controversial point about Google Glass.  But is this the end of Google Glass as a consumer product?  And, you know, obviously Google Glass might have a life as a sort of vertical integrated business device.  But is it over for Google Glass because of Android Wear?  What do you think, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was my argument on the show last week was just that.  That it obsoletes two thirds of the functions of Google Glass, notifications and instructions or directions.  And a far more convenient, far better structure.  I don't want that up here.  And I think what Google Glass does show the power of having a camera,  so that as Gina has often pointed out, your baby sees you, not some box in front of your eyes.  And you, the images that you're taking are of what you actually see.  I think that's proven to be valuable.  But clearly it's going to have to come with a red light and a siren that says,  OK, OK, I'm taking a picture of you now. OK, OK, without OK.  And a way to notify people that it's there.  And so I see glass nose cameras of some sort coming completely separate from the functionality of Google Glass.  I mean, of Android Wear.  And I wouldn't mind having that either.  I think it has journalistic opportunities, but I don't think the other functionality works very well up here.  Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I do agree that Android Wear, the watch, is a much more appealing product for most consumers  that gives you most of the functionality of glass.  I don't think that glass is dead.  I think it's just a niche market.  You know, I imagine going to Coney Island and I'm about to get on the Ferris wheel and they say,  you know, do you want to rent a pair of glass to take video? Right?  Like, or I'm going to get on a zipline. It's an experience thing.  The heads up, the you know, the sort of the camera on your head thing.  That's not something that you need on a daily basis.  And even just being able to speak to your face computer isn't something that people really want.  I think the watch is like people want a way to stay in touch without constantly being buried in their phone.  I think that that's a problem. I think it's an issue.  I think Microsoft has done commercials around people falling in a mall fountains or whatever, just being, you know,  staring at their phone all day.  I think for people who are hyper connected, the watch, you know, is a much more appealing product,  especially because people don't stop and ask you about it.  It's not banded theaters and that kind of thing.  I don't think glass is dead, but the watch is definitely much more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The big question is, if we had Larry Page there, the big question is, is if this is emasculating, is this?  And for those on audio, I was saying that Larry, so looking at your phone all day was emasculating.  Somehow Google Glass was not.  Was that Sergey or was that Larry?  I don't know which one it was. That's true.  Which one was it?  Might have been Sergey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was a very, that was an educational moment for me because I didn't realize that emasculate could mean something other than something gender related.  Like it actually means like weakening.  And I think what he was trying to say is it just, it breaks down, it makes you less present in the world.  It just was a bad choice of words.  Or maybe it was a good choice. We're still talking about it.  That was like a year or a while ago, wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. But they're sure, I think we can all agree that the comfort level of using Android Wear is very high, surprisingly high.  And that differentiates it massively from Google Glass, which is a little uncomfortable.  Really cool. It was really cool at first. It's still cool. I kind of like Google Glass.  It's great to be able to take pictures and you wear it when I'm trail running and stuff like that.  And I see a deer and I take a picture and then the picture comes out and it's like a little tiny picture of a deer that nobody cares about.  But it's really kind of cool to be able to do that if there's an alien invasion and I get abducted or whatever.  I'm going to have some good video.  But for the most part, I'm really loving the Android Wear. I think we all do.  And I'm really looking forward to the apps.  So again, that's coming next week.  Well, speaking of new platforms, Gina, have you got a chance to play with Android L's developer preview?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, man, I have not had a chance to play with it.  And it's because my Nexus 7 is a little too old and I don't have a Nexus 5.  My wife does and I wanted to swap with her. I can install the preview.  But my co-host on All About Android last night, we had Ron Amadeo on from Ars Technica,  who's written extensively about the L preview.  He said, you know, it's just not ready for it.  It's not ready to be your daily driver.  Right. And you know, I've got a kid in daycare.  Like my phone's got to work. Right.  Like I can't my phone can crash. I need to get phone calls.  So I have not installed it because I just don't have the hardware laying around to test it out.  And it looks so we did a nice long review kind of last night on All About Android added.  It's beautiful, but it's still rough.  It very much is a preview like this isn't a beta.  This is a developer preview.  So it's killing me because, man, does it look good?  Does it look good?  I'm just I'm like material design is amazing.  But unfortunately, I'm going to be developing in the simulator for now.  I'm sure there are a couple of L laying around in the in the studios.  Mike, not that I've seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll check. Jason has chocolate.  Yeah, I think Jason's done it. Yeah.  Yeah. So, yeah, I haven't talked to anybody here who's looked at that.  But you've obviously been reading about it and and you know, you've been talking a lot about it.  But for those watching and listening who are not super familiar on the material material design,  can you explain exactly what that is and why you're excited about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm not I'm not quite I'm not a designer.  But the idea of material design is the idea that the the design of of Android is that this kind of card based design,  which we've already seen in Google now.  But the idea is that the cards and the movement is very tactile, that the design of the interface,  that the items of the interface behave as if they were objects in real space.  So there's this idea of height and Z index or cards can can can be above the rest of the interface.  The cards kind of scroll and bounce and lists very naturally.  Things don't just teleport from one side to the other.  They slide and shift.  You have this hero image that you just saw pop that then just kind of contracts as you scroll up.  Everything is extremely smooth and fast.  And it behaves as if it is a it is a card stock as if they were cards laid out on the table and you're moving them around,  except that they can change shape, obviously, because it's digital.  You have nice shadows and buttons that can kind of overlay.  It's just it's a complete overhaul of Android's default theme, which right now is hollow.  So this is the material design is a successor to hollow.  And it takes over the entire the entire interface of Android and any apps that use the default theme will also get the material design upgrades.  And as far as I can say, it's beautiful and it's fast.  And it looks like this really beautiful evolution of kind of skew morphism plus flat design.  It's flat design, but it's even better because it feels very natural that the idea that your brain thinks about objects in space,  the way they actually act in physical space and to try to create that experience on the phone to make it more intuitive.  And what I've seen the just the previews and the videos and the screenshots, they've done a really, really nice job.  And I'm really excited, actually, about converting my app over to material design, which means that Google did their job at I.O.  Because that was the whole idea is to convince developers and get them excited about this new theme, this new design.  It's really incredible. Go ahead, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just a quick question on that. When you redesign your app for that, does that mean it's yet more fragmentation that all the earlier versions of Android won't be there?  How much effort does that take? And what's the payoff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It depends on how much customization that you do.  So my app is a to do list app. It's a very, very simple app.  It uses standard Android UI elements, lists and scrolling and the hamburger menu with the slide out menu.  These are default UI widgets or objects that Android provides.  And I didn't do a whole lot of customization.  So for me, it's going to be very, very simple for apps that have custom designs that aren't kind of your standard Android stuff.  It's a little harder.  You know, maybe you don't switch the material design at all if you decide to design your app completely custom.  But it's for the most part, all these improvements in material design you get mostly for free.  If you're already using default Android widget, you know, UI elements, you get these updates for free, which is really nice.  That's very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When you said that was a phrase used a lot last week at I.O., you get them for free.  Yeah.  It doesn't mean the obvious that otherwise you'd pay for them. What does it mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It means that there's no extra effort on my part as a developer.  I don't have to recompile my APK. I don't have to write new source code.  I just it just runs. It just works. Right.  So that's why, you know, when they were saying with Android Wear that your app, if your app has notifications on Android, it works on Android Wear because Android Wear just detects those notifications.  I don't have to recompile and re-upload for free. Right.  Meaning no more extra cost or investment on my part as a developer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's really fascinating to see Google's rapid transition from essentially ignoring and almost having a contempt for anything that resembles design just a few years ago to being so good at design.  Their apps have been beautiful for a while.  Their iOS apps have been beautiful for a while.  The redesign, you know, the design of Google Plus is very nice and the cards interface is beautiful.  And now this, it's just they've just gone from the back of the class to the front of the class.  And it's really great to see they finally understand the design isn't about decoration.  It's about usability and user happiness, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, we saw this on the web on the web, too, right?  Like Android iteration evolution has been this like sped up process that we saw on the web.  Right. I mean, back back in the day, Google was, you know, it was a list of blue links. Right.  It was like the default browser browser. And it still is that. Right.  But we see a lot more design and things like I look at the new modern apps like Google Keep.  And I'm just like, this is this is gorgeous what they did here.  You know, when you know, when they launched forever ago, I think either Larry or Sergey were photoshopping the Google logo themselves.  They've come a long way.  And I feel like the Android evolution has been just an accelerated version of what we've seen on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And, Gina, speaking of things that you get for free, what what is your current thinking about Project Volta?  I mean, it sounds great right out of the bat.  Project Volta is a huge initiative that will enable Android devices to really be careful with battery life.  It'll extend battery life. Essentially, that'll be the end result for for end users that with the same battery, with the same everything else,  the phone will last a lot longer between charges.  But there's a downside. There are downsides to it, of course, that it turns off services.  It doesn't do anything super magical. It just manages the things that are running.  For example, it won't launch something that requires an Internet connection if there's no Internet connection present, that sort of thing.  But what you're thinking as a developer about Project Volta, is this is this something that's going to to be transformative or could this be problematic?  What are you thinking about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you know, it to me, it sounds like advantages that you also kind of get for free.  I mean, when you're developing for a mobile app, you have to think about things like snow,  slow connections and intermittent connections and non-existent connections and small screens and low processing power.  And as Android, the system can help me manage that better.  If my app doesn't work, if there's no Internet connection, it's a bad user experience.  If the user launches the app and it just says, oops, sorry. Right.  So if Android handles that for me, that's great.  Bring it on. Like that's just less work that I have to do.  I mean, there's there's certain problems that every mobile app has to deal with,  particularly around intermittent connections and slow connections, the bad connections.  And so anything that the Android system can handle, I'm like, bring it on.  That's great. And if your app is so battery hungry that Volta is killing it on a regular basis,  I mean, that's that's more motivation for me as a developer to to optimize even more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a great point.  Well, I think we should do the Google changelog if we have the the timpanies ready and the trumpets.  So why don't we launch into that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a relatively light changelog post I.O.  But we do have a couple of little things.  First, this was spotted by Android Central.  Google Voice for Android now has emoji support so you can send all your happy faces that you want.  I tried it out today. It works really great on Google Voice for Android.  However, I got what I think I think you pronounce it.  Mojibaki is that how it's called? What it's called?  And it's what it messes up emoji.  Yeah, on the web, Google Voice, the web, I did not see my emoji, but they but it does work from Google Voice to a regular SMS carrier and back.  So that's a welcome welcome addition for those of us who like our smiley faces.  Let's see.  Video Hangouts no longer require no longer require a plug in on the desktop.  So Google has officially deprecated the Hangouts plug in for Chrome on the developer and canary channels of the Chrome browser, meaning that Hangouts video functionality is now completely built into the browser.  So this feature is going to roll out to all Chrome users in the next weeks, which is really nice.  Just means you don't have to install an extra extension.  Sad news for Orkut users from Orkut.  It was pre Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In other words, you Brazilian viewers, you Brazilian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Yes. Bad news for Brazilian Brazilian users.  Google is shutting down Orkut.  First first social networking effort back in the day acquired.  I guess they they had a launched it in 2011.  So I'm sorry. Not not not 2011.  That's Google Plus.  Sorry about that.  2004, I believe.  I think it's 10 years old.  10 years old.  Yes. So they're shutting it down to focus on other social networking businesses like YouTube blogger and Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I believe Kevin Marks worked on Orkut for a while as I remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. You know, you might be right.  You might be right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was a 20 percent time project.  And and you know, I use it at the beginning and then pretty soon everything was in Portuguese.  And then, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was also big in India for a while.  Yes. Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is or was I guess they're shutting it down September 30th.  I believe it is.  So is there no trend?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's nothing you can do to transport your friends anywhere else or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're just it's just you can export your profile data and posts and photos using Google Takeout from Orkut.  And that'll be available till September 2016.  So you've got you've got some time if you got some Orkut data.  You know, and I understand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't have a problem with it in the long run.  But there but there is I remember I talked about this long ago when my daughter was on the the American girl site.  That would be coming to you soon, Gina.  And I think Mattel owns the company and own the site.  And it was a safe place where she could have friends.  And so then they just killed it.  And it was like it was like destroying the town.  It was it was it was it's you have a bit of a social responsibility when you create the platform for a community  and then you kill the platform and the community just goes boom.  Right. There's no space for them to go to anymore.  Yeah, yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You really kind of need someone to make an organized move over.  I feel like even beyond Google Takeout, Google could do something like create an Orkut community on plus or create some sort of all.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think I've heard that they are going to provide a tool.  It's not available yet.  The to actually automatically transition Orkut profiles to Google plus profiles.  Chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Then you've got to transition all your fear losing your friends to you're losing the thing that matters to you.  Yeah, exactly.  And again, I understand why they're doing it.  They kill things that aren't working.  We've been making Orkut jokes for years.  But still, there's some responsibility to a community when you start it.  And I think that's an issue going forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Hey, you said it was OK for Facebook to sever my relationship with that Mildred.  What's the difference here?  That's right.  I don't know anybody in Brazil.  So, so is that it?  Gina, is that the change along?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One last one last shutdown.  This is actually a feature that wasn't available here in the U.S.  But Google had actually introduced SMS for Hangouts on on the Web.  Of course, we know that it exists in Hangouts for Android.  So they had offered that.  And up until now, that feature was available in India, Pakistan, Israel, Turkey, Ukraine, Congo and other countries in Africa and Asia.  They are currently they are shutting that down as well.  They're saying that the service will be discontinued.  And for other regions, it just says the service isn't available.  So not sure what's going on there.  I think we saw quite a bit at Google I.O. about getting text messages from Android on to Chrome OS.  I would love to see that actually just in Chrome.  So you don't have to be on a Chromebook to get that.  But I wouldn't be surprised if we saw another iteration of getting SMS on the desktop for everyone soon.  But for now, that experimental feature for those countries is no longer available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And there were stories related to this before we play the trumpets again that were talking about evidence that Google is going to be moving Google Voice people to Hangouts and building some of the Google Voice functionality in the Hangouts.  And in there somewhere would be another way to integrate SMS with Hangouts.  But I have to be honest, I read multiple articles and none of them were all that clear.  And I still am not certain about exactly what the evidence is and what the information is and what what's going to happen.  But I think that logically speaking, it makes a lot of sense that Google Voice be folded into and integrated with Hangouts that the Google some of the Google Voice functionality, hopefully all the Google Voice functionality.  I'm a voice user.  There are certain things in Google Voice that I really would rather not live without.  And if they're going to move it to Hangouts, bring all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The only thing I have to say is that I am to this day confused about SMS in Hangouts.  Yeah, it's just, you know, and I end up selling I end up sending a message to my son on his Google account instead of his phone.  And I yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And so it's all very, very confusing.  There are many things about Hangouts that are confusing.  For example, why can't they turn off people calling me from Pakistan in the middle of the night?  Like, why can't they turn it off?  Really?  Yeah, it happens to me all over the world.  And I just can't figure out how to turn it off.  But this whole SMS thing, when they first launched it, and I believe it's still the case, a person's SMS is treated like a different person from that person as you know them on Google Plus, Gmail and so on.  Right.  And it's very easy to mix them up.  And but the other thing that the story that Gina's talking about, as I understand it, is not that it's not that use of SMS via Hangouts.  It's the transmission of Hangout messages via the SMS.  Right. Right.  And so it's super complicated.  Nobody knows what's going on with Hangouts and SMS.  And it's terrible because Google needs to fix this.  Hangouts is super central to what Google is trying to accomplish.  And they need to make it clear and easy and frankly more FaceTime like or more iMessage like I guess I should say where you basically can just send someone a message.  And you know the company takes care of how it gets there.  And if you know if everybody's using Hangouts, fine, it goes by Hangouts.  If they're not, it goes by SMS.  Fine.  But it's all you know sort of behind the scenes.  I don't want to have to stress out about who I'm contacting, how I'm contacting them.  And I don't want people calling me in the middle of the night.  Yeah, I totally agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, we're still waiting for the unified messaging platform that Google promised.  You know, it was like two IOs ago.  And I don't know with Google Voice.  I mean, I hope, I hope, I hope they build it into Hangouts.  It feels like Google Voice is either on the edge of getting killed or this amazing roll up upgrade into Hangouts where everything just works.  I feel like if Google shuts down Voice, it will have a worse situation on its hands than it did when Google Reader closed.  Because I think that there's a very strong and vocal user base, a power users who love Voice and have used it for a really long time.  I think most people don't know what Voice is.  But I think that the people who do know what Voice is are folks like us who switch phones and who are privileged in that way and that have a need for the one number to rule them all.  So I hope that they don't shut it down because I think it will be a serious PR issue if they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And for those watching or listening who are not familiar with the feature set of Google Voice,  essentially the killer, there are many features, but the killer features are that you can add multiple phones.  You can have landline phones, cell phones, and they're all attached to your single Google Voice number.  So people call and then you can determine which phones ring, whether they all ring, whether none of them rings between certain hours.  You can block callers. So if you're getting telephone spam, you can block that number.  And Google will lie for you and tell those callers it'll play a fake, this number is no longer in service recording,  which is crazy really that they would be willing to lie by copying the official telephone systems no longer in service message and features like that.  But that's really great. You can swap out other numbers and you can have a lot of control over your numbers.  That's how phones should work really. That's how contacting people on a phone should work.  So yeah, please keep all of those features if you're going to move it to Hangouts because those are very, very powerful.  And yeah, like you said, people are passionate about voice because you start using it and you just you need it.  You can't turn back. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. So we have a closer for the changelog. Shouldn't we play that?  Thank you, Chad. Yeah. Awesome. Well, OK, so let's talk about the Supreme Court's refusal to hear Google's Street View appeal.  Now, just to set up the story, some time ago, a few years ago, a couple of years ago, Google was caught harvesting data from people's home Wi-Fi, small business Wi-Fi.  As their Street View cars roamed through the streets and just sucking down data, taking in some cases passwords, anything it could.  It turns out that Google officially threw a rogue engineer under the bus saying that this project was something done without official corporate authorization.  They should have copped to the fact that it's possible for employees to do things like that without the company's knowledge or permission.  But but the Supreme Court basically said and Google was sued.  They lost the lawsuit. Google wanted the Supreme Court to look at it and the Supreme Court said no.  And that's the end of it. So there's no higher court. The Supreme Court wants.  Well, but I think this was and I didn't read the I saw the stories quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But as I recall, this allows the case Google was trying to stop the case from going on.  This now allows the case to go on. So I don't think it's fully OK.  I can be wrong about that.  And the chat room, correct me as I know you will if I'm wrong.  Yeah. OK. That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I do want to talk about the question.  And the truth be told, I'm hoping, Jeff Jarvis, that you'll be one of the only people in the world to agree with my opinion on this.  But my opinion is essentially this.  The the way this story has been characterized in the press since this was first uncovered is that Google Street View cars were driving around and reaching into people's homes and reaching into their Wi-Fi routers and grabbing information.  When, in fact, the way that works is that the Wi-Fi information is under the control of the owner theoretically, whether it's encrypted or not encrypted, whether it's password protected or not password protected.  And those things are broadcast out into the street, out in the public street, and a car passing by.  Everything that passes by is going to be washed over by these waves, by these electromagnetic radiation, essentially.  And so the idea that you would pay attention to it, that you would see it, that you would capture it,  it's similar to when if you open up a Wi-Fi network in the restaurant next door, you can see their Wi-Fi password.  You're actually connecting to their router to a certain extent.  That information is coming to you and you're seeing it.  So to capture and record what is on a public street, essentially, it's not polite.  It's not nice.  They shouldn't have done it, as they've admitted.  But it doesn't seem to me like a super wrong thing to do either.  It's kind of as if it's literally like somebody put a big TV set in the window facing out toward the street with their personal password on it  and then having somebody walk by and go, huh, writing it down, and then them getting in trouble for writing it down.  The person who was in control of that information broadcast it into the public sphere.  And so it just doesn't seem as wrong as it sounds on its face.  What do you think, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree.  And we've talked about this back when this case happened in the US and Europe.  This is this is stuff that is broadcast on public and open airwaves.  You're right. It was stupid and rude and unnecessary for Google to take it.  But it's also been the case in techno panic land that people have argued that Google has some great conspiracy to do this.  And just the absurdity of that, you know, the odds that something of value is going to be caught when the car on the day when the car happens to drive by in three minutes and catches something.  And the idea that Google had any business model for doing anything with this data is absurd.  Also, people were ignorant about the fact that there are other companies besides Google that capture Wi Fi router addresses so that they can be used in geo location software that we all depend upon.  And that's all OK.  And nobody talks about that.  And it's not a big deal.  Problem here was that Google took too much data.  That data data was absolutely useless.  They were stupid to take it.  It caused them huge PR hell and now legal hell.  But there was no possibility of a business conspiracy behind it.  And it's once again a case of an ignorant court or set of courts that don't know enough about the technology to understand how to rule to the principle.  They've had an impact on the definition of public now.  And just as the the case against Google Street View in some countries, especially in Europe, have an impact on the notion of what's public.  That's going to have, I think, a precedent that could be harmful in other cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gina, do you have a view on on this?  Give an opinion one way or the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree with you guys.  I mean, Google, obviously it was a bug in the software that that prevented the software from discarding that data.  Right. I mean, they were just collecting the the hot that they were supposed to be just collecting the access point information, not the data that that was passing to and from it.  Right. And look, it was a bug in the software.  They collected they collect the data.  I think that they did it by mistake.  That's what they said.  And, you know, look, this is the reason why Google blurs out faces in Street View pictures.  Right. And why we were DAC personal information from public documents like, you know, that they should have they should have discarded it.  They didn't. They made a mistake.  The law that they reportedly broke was a was the federal wiretap law.  Right. Yeah.  Which is absurd.  Yeah.  Yeah. The wiretap act, which, you know, I think that indicates sort of a misunderstanding of technology as these cases as there is so often is in these kinds of cases.  So I mean, look, this is this is the case that that means that the FCC is going to be babysitting Google for like the next 20 years.  Right. Aren't they doing privacy audits?  Google for the next 20 years because of this look like, you know, I don't think that that's necessarily a bad thing.  And I know, Jeff, I'm sorry.  I think it's I think it's good that Google's aware that, you know, buggy buggy software or something they're doing in the interest of their business, you know, could could could have these kinds of these kinds of effects.  But but yeah, this seems like a bummer ruling.  And I think that they should have heard the appeal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree.  Well, why don't we do our picks and tips and number of the week?  Who normally goes first on this show?  Is it is it Leo or or Gina?  Do you go first?  Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I usually go first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Always go first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this tip comes from the Google operating system blog, great blog covering Google, particularly around products.  And it's just a little just a little tip.  If you the new new Google Maps came out quite some time ago.  But if you haven't if you haven't thought about the old Google Maps or if you missed the old Google Maps, there's a little short URL, a secret URL.  They can take you to the old classic Google Maps.  And that is Google dot com slash local.  I got to tell you, I haven't looked at the old Google Maps in a really, really long time.  I went to this year or else today just to kind of check it out.  And it felt like I was just seeing an old friend.  I was like, oh, yes, this.  I think there are a few things that the new Google Maps does.  It tries to be a little too smart, a little too predictive for me.  Sometimes I'm like fumbling around trying to figure out how to get to one view or the other.  So it's kind of cool to see the old Google Maps.  This year might not work for very long.  I'm sure they're going to phase out the old maps, the classic maps soon.  But if you haven't looked at the old maps after using the new map for a while, go to Google dot com slash local and you can enjoy a little bit of nostalgia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gina, I am totally using this as my default view for Google Maps for as long as I can.  And here's why I hate the new maps because the the the card on the upper left hand corner always covers and I try to get rid of it.  And I kind of lose control and it's frustrating.  Exactly. Same here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah.  Thank you for that tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm absolutely going to make this my default Google Maps view.  So, Jeff, what do you have number wise?  Let's mention two things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One, I want to mention this just quickly that Google is offering free lessons in coding to thousands of women and minorities.  And it couldn't happen soon enough.  Not only have Google and Facebook and other companies revealed their less than stellar diversity numbers, but also just culturally,  we're seeing just a ratatatat of cases of women being treated badly in technology companies.  And the only solution to that is to have more people doing it.  I want to plug one of my students, Audra Bernier, my graduates has a business called SkillCrush that is aimed at teaching women how to code.  And the more we have, the better.  Right, Gina?  Absolutely. Love SkillCrush.  But the number I want to do for this week was that Google is so far, the Google Cloud Platform is eight for eight in World Cup predictions.  So who needs to watch the World Cup when you have Google?  Exactly. That's my point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly. I've been, I've been, oh, man, I've been, I've been trash talking soccer in general for this.  Zero, zero.  It's not a good, it's a lonely place.  Zero, zero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Zero, zero.  Gosh.  It's so funny when I was in, I was in Frankfurt the other night coming back here and it was before the Germans were going on.  And so people were out at restaurants on the streets just like, TVs were everywhere.  The funny thing was to listen, soccer sounds like such a painful sport because it's constantly, all you hear from the distance is, oh!  Oh!  Oh!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh!  For three hours and nothing happened.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jason and I yesterday were doing Before You Buy during the Belgium USA game and we hear this enormous cheers coming out of the break room.  And we thought, oh, you know, the US must have scored.  No, the US kind of sort of almost scored.  And that was like super exciting apparently that the ball got within the general proximity of the goal.  Yeah, it's awful.  I just can't do it.  You know, I'm not a sports guy anyway.  We're going to get flamed.  Yeah.  And boy, I hear it on Google+.  I have so many friends all over the world and we have these big arguments about, you know, whether it's called football or soccer.  And, you know, we had a big pissing contest yesterday about how many English speakers, native English speakers or people who speak English fluently as a second language, use soccer versus football.  And it was very, an interesting conversation, but it always comes up.  And then these conversations about what's better, you know, American football or international football always end with the Australian saying, yeah, you know what?  Rugby.  That's the best sport in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Always.  Well, I got the important sports news of the day is Federer won.  Yeah.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right.  So let's do my tool.  There is a Kickstarter project that I would love for everyone to back so that I can buy it called Pelti.  Pelti is a speaker that is powered not by plugging it in.  It's not powered by batteries.  It's powered by a single candle and one candle will play your Bluetooth.  So it's wireless.  There are no wires visible.  There's no nothing visible and it'll play for eight hours with one little votive light candle.  This is great for the coming apocalypse, the end of the world where there's no electricity and all you need is a shotgun, a machete and one of these.  And you should be fine in the post-apocalyptic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mike, has anyone told you lately that you have too much disposable income?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe.  But this is, you know, this is this is kind of cool.  Not only does it play nice music, but it's also very, you know, creates a kind of ambiance.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Date night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And look, there's the hook right there.  That's an Android phone.  So you're going to get confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're going to start burning your phone by putting a candle underneath it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's right. That's right.  Well, you know, and if I do that, I'll have to get a new phone, which would be fine anyway.  You know, like you said, too much disposable.  Disposable income.  Well, that concludes this edition of This Week in Google.  I want to thank you, Jeff and Gina.  Thank all of you for tuning in today.  Good job, Mike.  Thank you so much.  Thanks, Mike.  Boy, Leo makes this look easy and it is not.  It makes it look so easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What are you saying?  We're difficult to deal with?  Is that what you're saying here, Algen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
