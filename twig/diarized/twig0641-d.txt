Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  When you're an actor, you're taught not to cry.  They always say, let the audience cry for you.  Don't cry for them.  And I feel like this was that.  This was like them crying made me not maybe like,  I'm not going to cry.  Were you were you touched by that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I felt that it made me mad.  I knew I was being manipulated.  Exactly. I was still OK.  You allowed yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I felt I felt like it was kind of manipulative.  Some of it I felt.  And I cry, you know, at weddings and I cry.  You know, their commercials make me cry.  In fact, a lot of Google commercials.  I mean, like I cry.  It's true hardship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, like like Simone Biles, like I cried, like, but she.  Didn't do her routine.  I mean, like some of this year, like it brings back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There is hardship in the world.  But when Simone Biles didn't do a routine,  doesn't really quite like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, I thought it was a big deal.  I mean, this she has worked her whole life for that.  She is a true bad.  Maybe I didn't maybe I know the back story.  OK, do this.  And if you think about what she'd overcome to be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, you're like, yeah, but wasn't the reason she couldn't do it  because she did so badly the day before? No, no, she couldn't do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because she got basically the equivalent of the yips.  But one of the like, yeah, because she did so badly the day before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's what she did badly because she had the yips.  But she had the yips and then she did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, yes. And then also just just think about this, Leo.  She was one of like however, 20 gymnasts who were sexually assaulted.  That I understand.  And that you think that was part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, OK. OK.  If that was part of it.  I mean, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think it's going to always be part of her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But all of a sudden that day on the Olympics, you think that was why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think when you're like big pressure cooker and like you get  you're worried and then I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And then, you know, I'm sympathetic and certainly  she should take the day off if she's upset.  Didn't bother me.  I'm not sure it made me brought me to tears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I mean, that's really I mean, like as someone who pushes through  mental illness or stress and to the detriment of myself,  I was really proud of it.  I'd like that was a hard step.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She did that. Yeah.  Right. That's going to affect different people  because it depends on your own personal story.  There are some people just like Miss Stacey said, they have their own  personal battles when it comes to mental health.  And they understand the struggles from day to day to, you know,  keep pushing through.  And it just. Yeah.  All right. I don't want to be unsympathetic or anything.  No, no, you're not. I'm not saying that.  I was a move to tears.  I'm just going to see why you I could see why you wouldn't be moved to tears  because you're not in that same space as some of the other folks are.  So, yeah, makes sense. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Uh, OK. Well, that was that was fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Way to bring us down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I really thought I thought Google would do the arc and start  like being really upbeat, but no, they just was like, actually,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this year was not upbeat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Wasn't a good year. Fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, we got the vaccine, but then we didn't all use the vaccine.  So then there's back here.  And I mean, here we are still debating like. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's still a debate on safety and all that stuff.  But yet people choose to do a bunch of weird stunts and I don't get it.  But that's just people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People are weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got tons of stuff here, boss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Adam Maseri says Instagram is going to bring back a chronological feed next year.  All right. I don't understand why they've been working  on a version of the feature for months. What?  What's so hard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's so hard about bringing a you just do it in the order they were posted.  Data comes in. Data goes out. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I wonder what it took for months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo, I saw what it took for you to do bingo.  You know, this stuff is where it was coming.  Bingo is a hard computer science problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But even then, it only took me an evening.  Not months.  Not months. After more than five years, I didn't OK.  I didn't realize this.  Instagram hasn't had a chronological feed for five years.  And this is my argument, boy, against Facebook, too, is is, you know,  you join these things thinking you're going to see the people you followed  in order of the posts they make.  Yeah. And in fact, that's you're subtly being manipulated  and you don't, you know, and it happens everywhere because, you know,  we're talking about my son and his TikToks.  I don't see his TikToks.  They don't. They're out. I follow him. Right.  Same here. But they're algorithmically nudged out of the way for something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I get notifications for his videos that's like three days after he posted it.  You know, it's sort of weird. It's it's I think it's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  that this is such a challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's interesting about TikTok, too, specifically, is that when I go to Solhank,  it doesn't have the latest on top.  Yeah. Which is the way we think of all the web algorithms, baby.  They're pushing on top algorithms. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Adam Osari, head of Instagram, not the founder.  Remember, Kevin Systrom and company left after a while at Facebook,  thinking they just we don't like what they're doing.  Osari, who's a Facebook guy who has moved into Instagram,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  he was in charge of the newsfeed before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah. Which was also not chronological.  Oh, I might add.  We're currently working on a version of a chronological feed that we  a version of does not mean chronological.  All right. I just want to say that. Right.  There's a black and white.  There's not a version of Monday through Friday.  There's Monday through Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Chronological skip Wednesday.  Myself is rich.  You tweaked it. You want to skip it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Hey, chronological is rigid.  It is in order of presentation.  And what is a version of chronological mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not chronological. That's what it means.  Maybe Tuesday through Monday is chronological versus Monday through Sunday.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe they throw the big things in there just in case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Talk about rationalization.  In June, Osari wrote in a blog post that here's the problem,  he said, with a chronological feed, quote,  it makes it impossible for most people to see everything,  let alone the posts they care about.  Putting them in order would make it hard for you to see everything you care about.  That's bull. You follow who you follow.  Self-serving. It's complete. It's like, no, no, no.  You care about what we tell you to care about, buddy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm sorry, but I'm going to devil's advocate here.  If you look at the numbers of how many posts,  there is stuff that you might like to get to, you won't get to.  I mean, it happens to be on Twitter now that it says,  oh, one hundred nine two tweets above.  Right. I know I'm missing.  Well, you kind of control that, though, because you're following

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  more people than you can see.  So you could, if you said, look, no, I want to be able to see everything, say,  well, I'm only following five people.  That's why I use a list. Then I use a list.  Yeah, but I mean, that's up to you.  He's saying, well, people follow so many people that we have to massage  their feeds so that they see everything they care about,  even though I'm sending them a very direct signal of what I care about.  I care about these feeds.  So this is just to me, self-serving.  We know why they have an algorithm and it has nothing to do with.  Why do they have an algorithm?  To make money. Oh, OK.  To make it sticky.  But that's why you should be in business, too, right? To make money.  OK, that's exactly the in a nutshell.  You've just explained the problem right there,  which is these companies are constituted to for profits over people.  They want to make money and they are using non chronological  algorithmic feeds because it keeps you there longer.  Yeah. And you see more ads and you and they make more money.  Not because that's what people want.  They're not doing what you want. Yeah.  They're doing what they want.  Make more money by making it sticky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I can I just say that I was very impressed that no fewer than three  senators offices created fake Instagram  accounts for 13 year old for teenage girls.  What? Senator Blumenthal, Senator Blackburn and Senator Mike Lee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They all created creepy about this, too.  But what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Out of the hearings, they all created these accounts to try to understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  how they have everything work. Finster accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They were so funny to shape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I thought this is kind of refreshing.  And I'm sure a staffer told them to do it.  But I I remember in 2008 said sitting  through some of the Google hearings.  Oh, my goodness. This little Leo thing.  What is happening?  Gemma B is killing it in the try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is great. Anyway, they created  way back in 2008 when we were talking about like Google search and harm.  It was ad policy. It was actually tracking.  And they were like, am I given to understand that if I search this,  you actually keep that information like they were shot.  But now they're actively trying to engage in the platforms  to understand how they work, which, you know, I I'm glad.  I appreciate that. That's progress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So that's I feel like it is.  It sounds creepy, but I think we should explain why they created  teenage girl accounts on Instagram.  Blumenthal said the office created a fake Instagram account  to pose as a 13 year old girl to research what the app is like for teens  and how it could affect their mental health, because we've all seen the studies.  And this was back when this was in the news.  Francis Hawkins whistleblower that Facebook knew and Instagram knew.  Instagram particularly knew that it was making young girls.  Some percentage of young girls feel bad about themselves.  Blumenthal said that during their protecting kids online,  this is exactly when he also talked about Finsta's.  Our research has shown in real time Instagram's recommendations.  This is Blumenthal talking will latch onto a person's insecurities,  a young woman's vulnerabilities about their bodies and drag them into dark  places that glorify eating disorders and self harm.  I wonder how he knew him.  I hope he had some expertise.  You know, some experts come in.  Dana Boyd or somebody come in and say, yeah, let me show you  what a 13 year old girl's account would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because it's not what one of his staffers had a kid and they were like, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Go. He said within a day of creating the account,  the platform began serving the fake account known as a Finsta  content promoting eating disorders and self harm.  I'd like to know what that is.  What's you know, it didn't say, oh, you know, you should try throwing up  after you eat it much more likely.  He's interpreting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you know?  Well, I get a lot of things that are very like disordered eating kind of posts.  So I get a lot of weird.  I bet it's fad diets. OK.  How about self harm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You get it. What would it post be encouraging self harm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How would that even? Man, I don't know about that.  I mean, but you could you could see girls talking about struggles with that.  Or, I mean, there's a lot of I don't know if this matters, Stacey,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but is it is this in reels that you're seeing it or is this just the actual like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, sorry, this is in TikTok.  I'm not I don't do Instagram.  I'm sorry. On TikTok, I get a lot of things like.  Only eat this for, you know, losing this.  And what's scary is.  Because I follow things that my daughter is interested in,  I'm half 15 year old girl to these things, and I'm half like,  yeah, actually, I think something like a menopausal 55 year old woman.  They're eating disorders on both ends.  Yeah, so, you know, I'm just like, damn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because I get  posts talking about eating this and eating that.  But these are all professional athletes that are, you know, following  diet plans and things of that nature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  A lot of the advertising on these sites, all these sites are  diet supplements, protein, you know, tiger milk, every single or special  teas that help you burn fat, that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the early days of newspapers.  Is that is that considered disorder?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's like the Joe Weider magazine in the back of the magazine.  Is that considered eating disorders, though?  No, I mean, that's what I'm asking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I get I get some that are like nutritionists.  But then I get a lot of like juice cleanses, which I do think is disorder.  You know, cleanses are huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  My own personal trainer, his wife,  he told me the other day, you know, we take a pill and makes everything go through you.  I said, I got some gummy bears.  You don't need to take a pill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me make you a pot of coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And then and then and then he said, and now we're on the other pill.  That is cleanses are just BS.  But but but a lot of normal people believe them.  It's not disordered eating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. But I also get like intermittent fasting.  That's pretty extreme.  I get things like I was doing like I get tons of this is what I eat in a day.  And some of them are totally normal.  And some of them are like a woman who's like my age, my size.  This is what I this is how to eat 1200 calories in a day.  Yeah. And I'm sorry, you should not.  You know, 1200 calories in a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you're like, that's not even breakfast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, well, it's more than breakfast for me.  But yeah, I was like, that's like breakfast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How many eggs do you eat in one?  There's there's minimum six eggs.  Oh, my God. Minimum six eggs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And you eat the yolks and the whites. Of course.  Oh, yeah.  Did you eat them raw? No, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, no, because Rocky, you know, he eats a shell at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because he's tough.  He doesn't even chew the whole egg just goes down.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  OK, I don't know. You know, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's also a lot of like how to keep your energy up  while only eating like X number of calories a day, which I am like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, girl, I had a Cubano sandwich and I can't keep my energy up.  So I don't know.  I think you can eat too much to.  I think that's also possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. It's true. The sugar crash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  All right, Jeff, you you said there's a lot of good stuff in here.  Give me one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I can I can I say I told you so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Actually, hold that.  Hold that thought, because if I'm going to get beat up, I better do an ad first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's pay the bills.  Better fill some money in your pocket.  Yeah. Why am I going through this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, that's right. I got I got some salt to buy.  This is expensive salt, I got to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hope I hope you're getting a wholesale price from from salt.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, actually, I'm an investor because he had a he had to get.  Oh, my God. Am I sitting behind myself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nicely done.  Nicely done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If you're not watching the video, well, you're missing all the fun.  That's all I can say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's like a Leo elf on the shelf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's an elf on the shelf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Wow. Nicely done.  Yeah. Good old Trikester.  It's kind of mesmerizing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is. It is.  It's the Leo is metronome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I have gone ahead and ordered some salt.  You don't have to.  No, even though you sent some, I want to support him.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I think, you know, get out there.  I might you might sell out if you don't hurry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, it's exciting.  It's really nice to see your kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, wait. And are you shopping while on the show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I did it.  I started ordering right when he right when he pulled up the website.  I started ordering.  I was like, yeah, I want to support him.  Oh, thank you. I really appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Give me our show today brought to you by.  And then we're going to hear Jeff tell me so user way.org.  Actually, this is something I think at this holiday season we can all get behind.  Every website, without exception, is a public entity.  That means it has to be accessible to people with disabilities.  And it's, you know, I mean, there's three reasons you do this.  One is the law. Americans with Disabilities Act requires it.  You can get sued for it.  In fact, a very well known pizza company in the United States  took it all the way to the Supreme Court.  I've said this before. They had a phone number.  They said, well, we got a phone number.  If you're blind, just call the phone number and we'll get you your pizza.  And the Supreme Court said, no, that's separate but equal.  You're a public entity.  You have to be accessible.  That's one reason.  Other reason is it's the right thing to do.  Right. Make your site accessible.  Third reason, profit.  If you aren't accessible, you're leaving 60 million  Americans with disabilities out in the cold.  They can't buy your salt.  They can't they can't shop.  They can't participate. They can't fill out forms.  User way solves all that.  And it doesn't very affordably.  You know, as a website owner myself, I was always nervous about this  is going to cost a lot. It's going to be a lot of work.  I'm going to have to hire developers.  User way has an incredible AI powered solution  that tirelessly enforces hundreds of web access guidelines,  content access guidelines with one line of JavaScript.  It can achieve more user way can achieve more than an entire team of developers.  You don't have to be overwhelmed.  You can make your website accessible easily, affordably.  In fact, first thing you should probably do is go to userway.org slash twit  and they have a free scanning tool to see if your website's ADA compliant.  Probably isn't. But, you know, maybe it is.  Maybe it is. Maybe you did the right thing. Good.  But if not, check out user way user ways, AI and machine learning solutions,  power accessibility for so much of the web, over a million websites,  Coca-Cola, Disney, eBay, FedEx, Walmart and on and on and on.  User way just but and you might say, well, wait a minute, I'm not Disney.  I can't afford this. No, no.  User way is making its best in class enterprise level accessibility tools  available for a very affordable price to small and medium sized businesses.  Operating an accessible and compliant website.  It's the right thing to do.  It just makes business sense.  And when you need to scale, hey, if it's good enough for Disney and Walmart,  it's you're going to be able to scale. Don't worry about it.  For years, user way has been on the cutting edge,  creating innovative accessibility technologies  that push the envelope of what's possible with AI, machine learning,  computer vision user ways. AI automatically fixes violations  at the code level.  They actually are working on what's called the accessibility layer of your browser.  Everybody's browser has an accessibility layer. You don't normally see it.  If you're blind, if you're using a screen reader,  that's what your screen reader sees.  And that's what user way writes to it.  Automatic automatically generates image alts.  So it writes those alt tags for you.  That's where the AI and the image recognition comes in.  It'll fix complex nav menus.  I hear from people all the time that that's a real problem for screen readers.  It's a real Achilles heel. All your pop ups are accessible.  All your forms are accessible.  It fixes vague link violations, fixes any broken links,  and it puts users in control because they can customize your website  to make it work for them. Works with everything.  WordPress, Shopify, Wix, AEM, Sitecore, SharePoint integrates seamlessly.  It's easy to add user way.  It'll help your business meet its compliance goals.  It'll improve the experience for your users.  Just ask Susan Bennett, the former voice of Siri,  the world's most popular assistant. What do you think, Susan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hi, I'm Susan Bennett, the original voice of Siri.  You won't hear me say something like this too often.  I'm sorry. I don't understand what you're looking for.  But every day, that's what the internet is like for millions of people with disabilities.  User way fixes all of that with just one line of code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We use our way can make any website fully accessible,  fully ADA compliant with user way.  Everyone who visits your site can browse seamlessly, can customize it.  It's also a great way to show your commitment to millions of people with disabilities.  Go to userway.org slash twit.  U-S-E-R-W-A-Y userway.org slash twit.  Actually, we've got 30% off for you on their AI powered accessibility solution.  So that's even more affordable.  User way, making the internet accessible for everyone.  Userway.org slash twit.  We thank them so much for supporting this week in Google.  All right, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So last week, when we were last here,  we had a discussion about Twitter's new rule that basically forbids photos without permission.  Yeah, and I thought it was a good step.  Leo thought, yes, I was going to make fun of you for that in a second.  Leo thought it was a good step.  I said that there were unintended consequences to come and danger.  It was a well intended step, but it was terribly written.  And Leo kept insisting, no, no, no, no, no.  You're wrong, Jeff. This is good.  It can't be misused. It's wonderful.  You're a fool, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't think I said any of that.  But OK, go ahead.  It was inherent.  It was inherent.  Check the tapes.  You're a fool, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think that all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, I don't.  No, I don't.  I was hopeful.  I understood what you're saying, but I was hopeful that, A, Twitter would enforce it  appropriately so that, you know, I mean, that there was enough room in there that they  could make it work.  But, you know, obviously people are already using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. So what happened was the far right has weaponized it and is going after anything  that might criticize them and taking down stuff and putting up all kinds of false reports  and doing all kinds of things.  And so, you know, my argument stands well intentioned, but, oh, unintended consequences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Here's an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter said that they're going to be looking at this.  So I mean, I think they can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they started taking down some of those who were abusing it, but it took a couple  days and a lot of researchers yelling at them.  And again, I like Twitter.  I think Twitter is doing the right thing.  I think it's here's an example.  How democracy works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. I thought this is going to be part of the process to begin with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And I think they worded it in such a way that gives them the tools they need to take care  of it. This is an example that was given by a CNN business.  This is the article you're referring to.  In January, Samuel Broslow was covering an anti-mask protest at a Los Angeles mall for  the Beverly Hills Courier, 56 year old local newspaper where he's a reporter.  During the event, he tweeted a video of a standoff between anti-maskers and a mall  official. You see that a lot these days.  This week, this is back in January.  He did this. Someone filed a report, caused Twitter to lock down his account.  The complaint led to him being unable to tweet until he either successfully appealed  the report or deleted old tweets.  He was stuck. Now, this is I don't know what's happened since then, but yeah, that's  exactly the unintended consequences you were talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So The Guardian has the latest story.  That's the one on top where this is happening.  And Twitter has said, uh-oh, we got used.  And they've got a thing.  So a statement Twitter made said an internal review of the policy after making several  errors in enforcement.  Well, if you have a bad policy, you can't enforce it badly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That does reflect poorly on them because you could see that was going to happen.  There was no question that was going to happen.  And they should have been ready for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  After this rolled out, we became aware of a significant amount of coordinated and  malicious reports.  And unfortunately, our enforcement teams made several errors.  I'm shocked.  Malicious people on the Internet.  How could that happen?  That's what I said.  That's what I said is they didn't think far enough ahead with those things.  And you said I was a fool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, I did not say that.  And I said, and I think it's still true.  I'll stand by it.  That the policy, as they stated, gives them enough leeway to handle this properly.  What they did wrong was they just kind of knee-jerk pulled down these accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they also didn't write it well enough.  Didn't write it well.  No, no, no.  This is the way.  No, no, no.  You're trying to use us here.  You can't do that.  And people managed to get through it.  So they'll figure it out.  But there's a lot of, I told you so, is going around the Internet this last week,  including rate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think, Jeff, this is moral panic on your part.  It is yet to become.  Look, there's going to be some bumps.  Nobody said this would be perfect.  But I think that we'll see.  Let's look in a couple of weeks or a couple of months and see how this is played out.  I think it was really important that Twitter took a stand on this stuff and said,  you know, this is, they hadn't even admitted it was a problem.  Nope.  So to admit that it was a problem and say, look, we're going to do something about this  is exactly the right direction.  Maybe it needs some refinement.  Probably more likely in these less automated takedowns.  But that's a problem on, you know, I was just talking about YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These were human takedowns, but they were interpreting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, they need to then, you know, train people better, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So anyway, that was thank you.  Let's see.  Let's see if they fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And if not, then they got a problem.  You're you're absolutely right.  But anything Twitter does, you know,  Twitter has also been used and you've been the victim of it for abuse.  And so I think anything Twitter does to kind of counter abuse is a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree.  I agree. They just could have done better.  That's all. Yeah, that's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Do better, Twitter. Do better.  I'm watching.  I'm watching the World Championship match, you know, it's going downhill fast.  And and there was a press conference yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  World Championship match.  What sport? What sport?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What other sport is that?  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought you were talking about F1 or maybe the college football playoff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Magnus Carlsen, the world champion, was so  offended by a question at the press conference, he says, do better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. I want that meme.  I respect that. Do better.  I respect that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He says we get this question every every world championship.  It's a BS question. Do better.  Yeah, I respect that. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wish there were more journalistic approach out there  when doing these little post-post sporting event interviews.  You rarely hear. How do you feel about this big win?  I feel like crap. Yeah.  You know, is that what they're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It goes both ways because athletes are not notoriously forthcoming  at these interviews.  I came to play. I played 100 percent.  We came to win. We're going to win.  It's not always very.  We just scored more points than the other team.  The team.  You know, I found that the team that scores the most points often wins

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  these games. Yeah, allegedly. Allegedly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Unless it's American democracy.  Hey, here's a good here's a good feel good story.  Timnit Gebru, who was hired by hired by Google  to run their ethics division, then fired when she said things they didn't like,  has started her own A.I. research center to I think this is important.  Ask questions about the responsible use of artificial intelligence.  That was kind of what she was supposed to be doing at Google.  But they didn't really want her to do that, apparently.  So that's good news.  I'm not surprised.  She's the founder and executive director of Distributed Artificial  Intelligence Research, D.A.R.E.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  with lots of funding from lots of places. Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The first part of the name is a reference to her aim to be more inclusive  than most A.I. labs.  That's where the distributed comes in, which skew, of course, white, Western  and male and to recruit people from parts of the world rarely represented  in the tech industry.  Nobody better to do that. That's great. Yeah.  Glad to hear that.  So see, there's happy news is.  D.A.R.E. will also work on demonstrating uses for A.I.  unlikely to be developed elsewhere.  Gebru says, aiming to inspire others to take technology in new directions.  This is one of the really strong arguments for diversity.  You get a kind of a monolithic group of people doing it.  They're all going to do the same kind of stuff.  Here's an example. Homogenous.  Homogenous. That's exactly one such project,  creating a public data set of aerial imagery of South Africa  to examine how the legacy of apartheid is still etched into land use.  Interesting. Yeah.  So good going. Yeah.  So happy ending.  And then there's the Estonian robots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I don't know if I put this in the rundown, though.  Stacey, I think is one of those crazy things that Jeff put in the rundown.  I thought I thought this was fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I saw this and I thought about my chat with Miss Stacey  about the murder bot book series.  And it's on my screen.  She thought it was cute that I thought I could take out a murder bot.  And I said, all I need is a hose.  That's that's that's all I need.  And this right here is these are these little things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You see them all actually in the US, too, on camp college campuses.  They're little food delivery bots.  And they're a bunch in San Francisco at one time.  Yeah. And actually, there's always on TikTok funny little videos  of them getting stalled and stuff.  But here's about I don't know, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven of them  stuck in the snow, stuck in the snow.  They just can't they just can't move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would have bought them with the snow tires.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You can see that you can see the wheels spinning.  Trying not going nowhere.  The one in the front is here.  He's giving up. He's just like, I give up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Smart robots like this is the next generation's children's  stories right here, like the little engine that could.  It had to make us it's like Balto meets the little engine that could.  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I like to as they're going in opposite directions and they kind of meet  and say, are you screwed? Yeah, I'm screwed.  You see, I'm screwed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Somebody somebody's not getting their submarine sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  On the other hand, you know what they need?  They need some macaques.  Monkeys. Watch that video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Transcript:  But I put on my shades and he has a phone here.  I'm OK. He's got my phone.  And there is a system by which I may be able to do this bartering an egg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Is there a school, a BBC reporter school where they teach them  how to look? He got his phone back.  No, OK. I think that's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But that's not good.  I think that's that's that's an example of an anthropologist who doesn't know  what he's doing. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Hey, congratulations to our own congress member, Devon Nunes,  who has decided to abandon Congress.  Wasn't working out that well for him and his constituencies to run.  This is going to work out great. Trump's new media company.  Oh, boy. He'll be the CEO.  What is the name? Do we have a name?  The Trump Media and Technology Group.  That's a good name. OK. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this is that what this is.  OK, this is the SPAC of like one point eight billion dollars.  Yeah, it's all just shady as shady can be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Before Nunes, the company released the full names of just two top employees.  Donald J.  Won Donald J. Trump.  And streaming content executive Scott St.  John. Oh, boy.  Now they've got now and then there were three.  So anyway, congratulations.  It's not up, though, right? You can't can you?  No, no. All right.

Transcript:  A political narcissist just stay relevant.  We're doing the politics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Real money. These are all Jeff Jarvis's stories.  Just want you to know. OK.  Politico slammed for inventing a disease.  News reports that Kamala Harris is Bluetooth phobic.  For not using Bluetooth, remember, Hillary Clinton got in trouble  for using her own email server.  Harris does not want to use and she's right.  Good. A phone with Bluetooth because it's not secure.  Well, now she's Bluetooth phobic, according to Politico.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Politico is bad.  I'm hating people. Why is that a story?  I mean, it's a man because they're sexist right wing

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  bros. That's why the December 6 story says, quote,  while a growing number of consumers are going wireless,  the vice president is sticking with the classics.  She's long felt that Bluetooth headphones are a security risk.  As a result, silly, silly.  As a result, Harris insists on using wired headphones.  Wow. And for her, what a horrible person.  The real question is, where is she getting a phone  that has a headphone jack?  Because I'd like to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, you're not going to find that out.  Oh, man. You're not going to find that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The battle between Roku and Google.  It's good stuff, right? It's over for now anyway.  Roku has become so big that it's able to finally say no  to companies that are overzealous in, you know,  their their contracts with Roku for a while.  Looked like Google's YouTube and YouTube TV would not be on Roku,  which would be a big deal.  I mean, for Roku use a lot of eyeballs.  I don't know. I use Roku. Yeah, I do, too. Yep.  And I use YouTube TV. I really like it.  Roku's deal was set to expire this month.  Roku warned customers in April that YouTube TV may be forced off the platform.  Roku said it was they were asking for too much data about customers.  Google was also threatening to make the YouTube app unavailable.  That was the escalation, right?  Well, you're not going to use YouTube TV, which is our moneymaker.  We're not going to use YouTube either.  Actually, YouTube TV was removed from Roku store for five months.  I didn't notice that because they didn't delete it from.  I still had it on my Roku, but I guess new people couldn't download it.  At the heart of these conflicts, allegations from Roku,  Google was making anti-competitive demands as part of its distribution agreements,  including preferential treatment of its YouTube TV and YouTube apps  within the Roku system.  Roku did not back down for months.  Google publicly denied the allegations.  CNBC a couple of months ago said we saw an email that said YouTube executives,  actually an email that was from YouTube executives,  actually making those exact demands in 2019.  Axios, this is from the Axios story, said publicly denied.  We've seen that email and can confirm the contents.  In any event, this is, you know, this is not the end of these battles,  not just with Roku, but with all of these devices  and services like Hulu.  You know, YouTube TV has its own negotiation issues with locals  and the cable channels.  They're all battling because there's a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I was going to say everybody's got to make a buck, got to make a profit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bundlers, bundlers got to make a buck.  Bundlers got a bundle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  OK, was that all of your stories, Jeff?  That was actually put in there.  He didn't put that. Oh, good man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you put?  I put in I put in something for Stacey, but she doesn't like what I put in here.  So I'm not going to mention it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what is it? Let me look through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Normally I see a little tag.  I don't know. It says very IOT down at line 152.  I thought it was IOT ish.  I thought this would be OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you think I get all the way down to line 152.  Oh, wow. Very IOT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Seeking a common language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is when you say bless his heart for self-drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bless your heart.  So this was it raised by a southern woman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This actually is interesting because one of the promises of self-driving cars  is that they will talk to each other, inter-auto communication that would help.  You all arrive at a stop sign.  The cars could say after you are fawns, that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's very IOT.  It struck me it's out of the home and and to interesting  to have to create a language for this.  And is it going to be too late to enforce it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is actually about bicyclists.  The company Argo, which develops self-driving systems,  is has released technical guidelines for safe interactions between robo cars and bikes.  The guidelines created in collaboration with the League of American Bicyclists

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because humans do a really crappy job of interacting with.  Oh, my God. I mean, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So much so that cyclists, I told I mentioned this a while ago,  are putting up what they call ghost bikes, where there have been car,  bicycle collisions and deaths.  We have one down the road from us here, a white painted bicycle.  Bicyclists are urging AV companies to incorporate the bike lanes into their AI maps.  And furthermore, to put models in for typical cyclist behavior,  like lane splitting or swerving around an open car door so they're prepared for such actions.  It would really be nice.  I actually pretty much given up bicycling around here because it's too scary, too dangerous.  I would love to be able to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you tried the pool noodle hack?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Even as an automobile driver, it scares me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  If I had a pool noodle on my head, what would I do with a pool noodle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, the pool noodle hack.  We actually see people around here riding with them.  You get a pool noodle strapping on the back of your bike and makes your bike wide.  And people avoid it.  Yeah, it's mostly just to like because it's true.  I've seen like I am not one of those people because I ride my bike.  So I know how scary it is when a car feels like it's not that far from you,  but it's really freaking close.  So that's an idea.  But yeah, no, this is this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I feel like at first I was around here, people would actually take aim at the pool noodle.  We're trying to see if they could just tip the pool noodle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if you search for horrible.  I know pool noodle bike safety.  You'll find some images of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now the entire show comes to a halt.  Well, I think you Google pool noodle.  I won't try to contribute to the show at all.  Safety. She's here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is. I just get kicked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I rode around San Francisco with a pool.  Geez. Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I totally like that.  It's it's super visible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's this is Michelle Robertson writing for the San Francisco Chronicle.  Yeah, the lead will tell you something about it.  If you be the man shouts at me from the rolled down window of his silver sedan.  We're at the intersection of Fifth and Mission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not not a fun place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah. Angry sedan man can't get around me  because I have a bright yellow pool noodle  five foot in length tied to the back of my bicycle.  It's just about three feet into the right lane.  Denoting the minimum safe passing distance  per California law for cars and bicyclists, three feet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I really like that.  I like that as a driver.  There's a certain. Yeah, I like it as a driver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like it as a bicyclist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, you would name it me.  No, I wouldn't.  But some I feel like there are people who would aim at the noodle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No one here in this area would just say, well, let me put it this way.  Have you ever driven down a country lane with a baseball bat aiming for  post office boxes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I need to confirm or deny. Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Who would do such a thing?  No one. No one in their right mind would do such a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Drunk West Texans.  OK, so anyway, I was going to say to bring it back to a tech angle  just for fun, just going out there.  I like this story, Jeff.  I think we've talked a lot about V to V standards like vehicle to vehicle.  And yeah, yeah.  Vehicle to infrastructure.  It's not infrastructure. I can't think of what.  And we were actually supposed to get there.  But then the Trump administration ordered the.  I can't remember if it was the National Highway and safety and whatever.  That one. Yeah.  Yeah, it's either that one or dot.  They basically took it out of the language that  we didn't have to do it by any timeline.  So they took away the timeline.  So now we don't have a timeline for that.  And then the other thing is this is really good information because like  MIT has done research on like cars at an intersection,  like self-driving cars at an intersection and like how people will make.  Like if I'm about to cross at a crosswalk, I try to make eye contact  with people in the car. Yeah.  Or I step into the street. That's right.  And there's no way to actually do that.  So this is talking about creating ways to have the cars communicate with people.  And I think that's really important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, it is. So in our chat room, I think this is good.  One of our chatters has attached.  His name is Zircon.  I mounted a freight train horn on my bike. Nice.  Where can I get a freight train horn?  Because I will do that. That sounds like a great idea.  A freight train horn.  What is it?  Let me let me see if I can find a freight train horn.  How do you power it?  Do you have to have a like a lead acid battery to power it?  Well, it's a bike. It already has a battery.  Yeah. Yeah.  But you need a pretty big battery for a freight train horn.  Here's a here's an example of what you might hear when you travel by Zircon.  A little too close.  I like that. I want that on my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm biking here. Get out of my way.  Watch that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Noodle horn blasters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm not going to get a special a take down from the freight train.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Costs thirteen hundred ninety nine dollars.  Ready. You can buy it. Really?  Huh? Well, it's pretty heavy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I got a trike.  I can put it in the back.  So we were talking at the beginning of the show about YouTube takedowns.  Get ready for this.  Over two point two million copyright claims  hit YouTube videos between January and June of this year before being overturned.  Wow. This is a report from YouTube.  The copyright YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so it's a new transparency report.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, they haven't done this before.  Copyright transparency report.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is good to finally shame the bozos who are doing this and put a stop to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, it is as many as that sounds.  It's only one percent of the seven hundred twenty nine million  copyright claims issued in the first half of the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's only the bad ones they caught.  You know, there's a heck of a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, it's it's this automated content ID system, which catches us  all the time for all sorts of things, including Canada.  When users dispute the claims, which we often do,  we didn't dispute the Canada claim because it wasn't really fair use.  Yeah, I just didn't have enough stories.  So I just played a piece.  When users dispute these claims, the case was resolved.  Although I thought it was it was kind of pro Canada. Right.  And I thought it would like Canada wouldn't mind if I used it.  It was great fodder at the time.  Yeah. Well, anyway, when users dispute the claims, the cases resolved  in favor of the uploader of the video 60 percent of the time.  So seven hundred twenty nine million claims, 60 percent of them.  Overturned. YouTube creators have long complained.  They didn't talk to me about this, about how the platform handles claims,  because it always assumes you're in the wrong.  Yeah, an uploader, right.  It's just by default, the copyright holder, whether or not the person  guilty, even the copy and older. Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. And, you know, it's problematic.  So the report says no system is perfect  and that errors happen even with established guardrails or or as you would  have it, fun noodles in place to prevent the abuse of enforcement mechanisms.  I think that's probably what Google's using is, you know,  it's a couple of pool noodles to keep them keep the keep the guardrails.  When disputes take place, the process provided by YouTube provides real recourse.  And over 60 percent of these disputes resolved in favor of the uploader.  You know, if 60 percent of seven hundred  twenty nine million content, I think copyright claims, if 60 percent are wrong.  Right. Right. There's something wrong with the system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And the prejudice that it's going to it's going to favor  it's going to be wrong, it's going to be wrong in favor of the copyright  alleged copyright holders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because maybe the fact that they put this out here is indicative of the fact  that they're going to start looking at how to fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah. Yes. I hope so.  That's the hope anyway. I mean, I don't think you can.  I mean, there's a lot of stuff I don't do,  even though I know it would be fair use, just because we don't want to,  you know, enrage YouTube.  And it really is.  Frankly, YouTube isn't that important to our downloads or to our revenue.  But I want to make sure we're on YouTube for the audience.  I don't want to have a strike.  We could leave you to the butt.  Yeah, it's just that's really  JT says in our chat room, Sony has taken me down for sharing  NASA Apollo 8 video, which is completely public domain,  because it was in Sony's libraries and they forgot to say, well,  we're using it, but it's not part of our content ID.  Same thing happened with National Geographic.  We got a takedown from National Geographic because we had some NASA footage  in one of our shows, and it was because National Geographic had the same footage  and content ID just says, well, yeah, they own it because they used it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, I think I mean, because it would be  it would be reprehensible and truly evil for Google to be like,  oh, we see that this is a real problem.  We're publishing this problem and screw everybody else out there.  We're not going to do anything about it.  So I think this is probably them collecting data on the path to fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This isn't that big. I could I could put this on my bicycle.  170 decibels.  So we're still building.  It might it might be kind of loud.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Lord, I think on the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can put that's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That'll go on your try.  170 decibels. I'd have to wear earplugs.  Yeah, you would.  It has a air valve solenoid for solenoid for increased air flow to sound louder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See what we need here is Stacey.  We need to put that in the studio.  And when you do something bad, Stacey can.  Oh, that would work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Should we get to I'm not I'm not ready to like appreciate her being considered

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  of me. Thank you, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You've done nothing to deserve it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Google was saying that workers would return to office January 10th.  They've backed down on that.  They sent out an email on Thursday, said, yeah, no.  They still encourage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this is the new normal.  Yeah. And I ask this because no, I do.  I mean, yeah, I do.  Yeah. So then what do we do going forward?  Do we just I mean,  are we just going to adapt over the next three to five years to just say,  see, are you thinking about in person events?  I'm thinking about in person.  I mean, I am going to see. Yes, I have decided that I want to go.  Croner. I am still going.  So you're going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes, I just got to know you won't be here in January.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I just said.  Were you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So let me explain how this show works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  John writes down everything each of you says and hands me a note and I read it.  And then that way,  Stacey just said she won't be here in January.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Sorry. Yes. Sorry.  I was just confused.  I was buying an air horn.  I wasn't.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm like, did I not say something out loud again?  No, I'm just confirming it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes, you're not going to be here.  We're going to buy things on the show.  You're going to see. Yes.  So I'm not buying anything.  I'm not tweeting.  I'm the only guy here actually paying attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not that am I going to see? Yes.  Any difference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You just weren't.  Although I am.  How well is that going?  I'm looking at the next story.  In fact, I had already started the next story.  But she was making the point.  Yeah, but she was making a point.  Miss Stacey was so that was so that was a story.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I was I was just trying to.  It is the new normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think it is the new normal.  And I think that part of it is  I don't know so much about going to events,  but working is that that's an industrial era  notion that you have to come to a place of work  from nine to five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot of industrial bosses are going to insist on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's industrial era.  It's from when you were making widgets  and you had to have hands on.  So true.  But with knowledge workers and most  and many, many jobs are knowledge based right now.  Our lot of our staff doesn't come in.  Yeah, I used to work.  Are you OK with that?  Because yeah, we that's our policy.  And we're doing four day workweeks starting next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, to match the four day school work weeks,  because that's a thing that's that's a thing to that's going to be.  Yeah, a lot of schools are having like teacher burnout.  So they're going to four day work weeks.  But if you're a parent and your office has not gone to a four week,  you're kind of like torture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's not why we're doing it.  But I'm actually I'm glad we are doing it.  I don't know if any schools in this area are good for good for the teachers.  I was going to say, you should look into that because that's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  some of the wider reaching effects of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I would say good for the teachers,  except it's not good for the students.  No, it's not.  They're getting 20 percent less education.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I agree. It's it's tougher on it's tough on the students, too. But.  I have a teacher in my family and some of the stuff that she's been dealing  with from the covid restrictions and all of that, in addition to the kids  being pretty craptastic with their behavior, in addition to the parents  being craptastic, it's it's really burning these teachers.  Oh, I know. And it's not their fault.  They just want to do the best for the kids. But, you know,  people have mass mandates.  Some people don't have mass mandates.  People have assignments that are due at such a such time.  And they third excuse.  Well, I can't do this assignment because I'm not well.  And there's nothing totally wrong.  They're using covid as an excuse when it really isn't an excuse.  It's a mess.  People are just gaming the system all around and teachers are fed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I don't blame it.  But what are we going to do about education?  Because that's kind of important. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And pay teachers better. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the thing. They're not making enough money to keep fighting this hard.  Well, that's different. Yeah. If they're just not being paid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, and they're also being asked to do a wave.  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's hard.  I know it's really hard these days. Yeah.  Anyway, yeah, I think I think more and more we're going to be seeing people  work remotely. It's interesting because our sponsor for this hour.  Who is a company called Andela.  Let's take a little break. We'll come back with more.  Actually, the change a lot coming up. Andela is the when I talked to the folks  in Andela, I loved what they told me.  Their motto is brilliance is evenly distributed, but opportunity is not.  I love that. So brilliance is global.  There are really great engineers and programmers all over the world.  The problem is the jobs up to now, they had to live nearby.  Well, times are changing and more and more companies are saying we can get  we want global talent.  They're some of the best programmers in the world.  They don't have to live next door.  And Della can hook you up.  They're a global talent network with a mission to connect that brilliance  with opportunity.  These days, your company is expected to move faster than ever before  to stay ahead of the competition.  And it's hard to find time to both build and onboard an amazing engineering team.  You need it. You need it.  But that's where Andela can help. They can get you there.  They're the world's first talent network connecting innovative companies  like yours with top tier vetted engineers.  So you have more time to focus on your core business.  And Della has a very rigorous vetting process.  Their hiring process will make sure you're getting the best technical talent.  It's quick and efficient, but it maintains the highest quality  admission standards.  You're going to get top quality engineers.  It's it's it's a truly global  talent pool.  But I want to reassure you, because for instance,  these engineers are fully embedded.  They're really part of your company.  They're embedded in your organization.  They guarantee five hours of overlapping working hours  with the rest of the engineering team.  So it's not like they're working at night.  You're working at day.  Although sometimes the shift in hours is helpful to give you a broader footprint  so you can help customers and things like that.  With Andela, you can tap into their pool of highly qualified talent  from around the world, cut your hiring timeline down from months to days.  And it's very efficient to get you going.  The ramp up times are really quick because Andela understands  companies are expecting to do more with less.  They've got to justify ROI.  When you hire Andela engineers, you can expect they will be efficiently on boarded  and work in and ready to deliver value for your team within days.  It's just great. It's just great.  Mindshare, as an example, and you'll find these references  on the website, Mindshare partnered with Andela to quickly hire  10 new digital experts.  And these are high level experts, data scientists, machine learning specialists,  analysts, software developers.  I have a quote from the executive director and head of business intelligence  at Mindshare.  He says, as we continue to enhance the Synapse platform, time to value  is very important. Andela is a great partner in helping us identify  the right talent that's fit for different purposes.  Andela, you can tap into a wider talent pool.  Stop competing with major tech companies for talent down the street.  There's talent all around the world.  You'll spend less time interviewing.  Brilliance is evenly distributed, but opportunity is.  And I love that.  Visit Andela.com slash four dash companies  to schedule a complimentary consultation.

Thank you, Andela, for supporting this week in Google.  And I think this is really great.  Bringing talent from all over the world  into these businesses that need the talent.  And it doesn't nowadays.  You don't have to be sitting there.  It's not an industrial area job.  You don't have to be sitting next to each other.  You really can get the job done.  And these people are so talented, so talented.  All right.  Let's play the drums slowly, John, because it's time for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Bluetooth. Who uses Bluetooth?  Not Kamala.  Not Kamala, but she's smarter than I am.  I'm your Bluetooth phobic.  That's what I think.  Well, that might be those might be hardware issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, dude, this this blue.  I started noticing the Bluetooth stuff on the Pixel 4 when Android 12 came out.  It just it just toggles off.

Well, I have the always on screen and even shows the fingerprint.  But it's not responsive.  That's all there.  Well, what I discovered is you have to press the screen on off.  So, I mean, you shouldn't have to.  That's a bug, I would say.  If I press the button, I can it'll it'll wake up and and live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, they this should have gone through that come you a T.  What's that user upset user acceptance testing before it got pushed out

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  with people who have Android Auto?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or it could have gone through A&T because he's got opinions.  I do have opinions.  True. Well played.  There is a lot of latency on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But no, it's this really bugged me.  All of this stuff looks like just some cosmetic, just pretty, pretty in it  up kind of Android stuff, and it has nothing to do with function.  This this always has to be better than than what it's offering up,  especially when you have really nice hardware like the Pixel 6 Pro. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Let me check for an update.  Maybe I'll get an update.  No, maybe in a week or so, we're going to get updates.  That's going to have the the Pixel December security patch.  They do say a hundred, nearly a hundred fixes to Android 12.  So maybe maybe some of these complaints will go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you control F and see if it says Bluetooth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Fix for distorted audio over Bluetooth in certain scenarios.  That's not the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The problem is it just there's quite a few fixes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's a hundred fixes fixed for issues, which seems like a lot for a lot.  Yeah. Fix for causing assistant to unintentionally start a phone call.  That's been some people have been claiming back complaining about. Yeah.  Audio playback, audio noise and videos,  microphone cutting out during calls in certain conditions.  That was happening to you, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It cuts out or drops.  I had to call PG&E.  You know how much fun that is.  I have had calls drop on this.  Come to think of it, it just stops.  So then you get back to when a call drops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I just assume it's the carrier, not not the not the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what I was assuming at first.  Yeah, but if I'm sitting in one spot, no, this is not the carrier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's a general improvements for fingerprint sensors, stability and performance.  They improved that last time to metrics.  Camera image quality improvements.  I expect continuous improvements in the camera. Sure.  Camera's good. And I think that just making it better and better. Sure.  Oh, way. Network and telephony fix for issue.  The disabled call features.  No sensors. Look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, Google, give me a call. Let's talk.  Wow. We need to talk about all pixel phones

Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  that listed below. There's quite a few. That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sorry for raising my voice earlier.  Pixel. Did you raise your voice? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Pixel buds, a series firmware update, adding bass slider,  loudness compensation and more.  I agree with Kamala. I know I want to use wired headphones.  I really don't like Bluetooth, but  that we don't have much choice.  The December Chromecast with Google TV update improves Dolby Vision playback  storage and more.  Google Photos is they do this every year now, starting to surface  your best of twenty twenty one memories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Memories. Let me just say that reminds me of another bug.  It continues to think that my photos are sideways  and I get this little notification from the software that says, hey,  your your photos are sideways. No, they're not.  I'm starting to hate my pixel phone.  They're not. I took it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. You know, well, you mean you took it in landscape mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, that's sideways. That's not sideways.  It's not. Oh, she's.  It's a dadgum cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Did you have a pixel before? No. Yes, that's all I've had.  Oh, you did. OK, because I talked to you in getting the six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, you taught me to get into four.  I wanted to six. You taught me into the four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, I told you when the six came out, I said, you can get one.  Yes, you did. And I was like, yeah, and I want me.  I bought it for you. Yeah. OK.  And I was like, yes, I'm feeling bad now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no. The phone is fine.  It's the OS. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's the OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The nice thing is the OS can always be improved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's true. Please Google.  Please. How about this fix?  And it works, Jeff, right?  For the mysterious Android Auto error.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Yeah, I was going nuts.  So I bought another cable to make sure that wasn't the cable.  I was going nutty.  And this thing's a bit overwritten because it's all very difficult.  I had to hit one button once.  Somebody discovered because they were probably in every button of the car.  Say, why doesn't this work?  You hit the talk to the car button, the little mouth.  Yeah, that just opens up the communication between the car and the phone.  And like, oh, there you are. OK.  Wow. Here was Android Auto. OK.  I hit it once.  Other people have to hit it every time they turn the car on, which is a bit of pain.  But I hit it once and it works one more time.  I kind of hit it once because I wasn't sure.  But it knocked wood. It's working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  All right. And what kind of car do you have so we can?  Mazda. OK, because, you know, like I said, I haven't had that problem,  but I guess it just varies per automobile.  I have heard from people who are having issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was the celebrity email of the week on All About Android.  Woohoo. I got this two weeks ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Did you accuse them of moral panic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, because they were helpful.  They couldn't have been more helpful and more nice and more generous and gentlemanly.  Nice work, Mr.  Jason Howell.  And they were trying to trying to help me out of a fix.  They were they were quite nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's their job. They do a good one.  I have to say all about Android Tuesdays, 5 p.m.  Pacific, 8 p.m. Eastern on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are we is there just like a paucity of news?  I feel like there is an paucity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's a paucity of Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, I'm just I'm like, OK, we're still we're still in the change.  Change a lot. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And that's the Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait, what?  We're we're in that change.  Now what do you want to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, now we're moving on.  OK, we could do TikTok videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lots of TikTok videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The top videos of 20, 21.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, wait, wait, before we do that, can we just say how excited I am  that Jessica Rosenworcel has been?  Congratulations.  Yes. Congratulations.  She is the new head chair of the FCC.  I have met her several times.  She's very good. Yeah, she's so good.  She's so smart.  She is really interested in both understanding  how the technology works and protecting the consumer.  So she's been a commissioner for some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And as you may know, they're the way the FCC works.  They have to be three Republicans, three Democrats and then the chairperson.  She is the first woman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, there are only five chairs.  There's five Democrats. Three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, there should be three Democrats and two Republicans.  Well, depends on who's the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's two chairs.  There's two Republicans.  Sorry, there's usually two Republicans, two Democrats on the chairs.  And then whoever the president is usually appoints  whoever is part of his party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So the fifth person is the chairman.  OK, so instead of OK, so I got it off by one.  So there's two of each.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's a rather crucial one, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Off by I was off by one.  It's an off by one error. It's very common.  So there was two Republicans, two Democrats and the chair.  This is the first time a woman has been a chair of the FCC in 86 years ever.  Senate approval was 68 to 31, which is kind of amazing  to hear that kind of majority in the Senate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So is Gigi Solon going to get through?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're fighting Gigi and Gigi is so freaking awesome.  And like, I'm so mad about that.  It's such a what is it?  Is it a red herring?  Is it whatever you put up to attack?  It's it's annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So there are so there's empty seats at the FCC.  Right. And Gigi would be would she make it complete?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She would be the the third Democratic commissioner, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So there's a they've been missing a fifth commissioner for some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yes, that was actually political wrangling by the Trump administration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the Republicans like Gigi first.  I forget what the reason was.  It's backwards Republican logic and some of the Democrats.  It's all complicated.  I don't really I haven't been able to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She has supported like she is very much in favor of First Amendment rights.  She's argued in favor of conservative news organizations in the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But if you ever look, she's also a net neutrality advocate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, she's a net neutrality advocate.  She is anti duopoly.  She is.  Hmm. It's what we need.  So protection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, we need exactly what you need.  She's brilliant. She's informed.  She's brilliant. Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's going to happen. So  however, her prospects are not great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I don't know. I don't know that they're bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The press and everyone is fighting for her in ways that are actually pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  astonishing. Well, it's amazing that more than Rosenwald's.  It's amazing.  Rosenworcel got a 68 to 31 vote in the very partisan Senate.  So obviously, she's charming.  There's some there's some progress being made, which is really good.  It's important.  It's important to all of us for a variety of reasons.  OK, yes. Thank you for doing that and distracting us  from TikTok's top videos of 2021.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Appreciate it. If you go to 101, you get a long list of them.  You can pick them rather than having to watch their compilation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, the CNN thing is just taking that's just like

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  one of those ridiculous slideshows where, of course, you could go to TikTok  and see the videos, but no CNN is going to give you a static slide show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So retention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm going to give you a chance to vote.  We're going to watch one one.  If you like TikTok so damn much, go watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Drone dancing. Where am I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Squishy, the chipmunk hiding nuts in his mouth,  restocking at its finest dog painting or Zach King,  who's kind of an amazing video effects genius,  disappearing into his art.  Chipmunk, chipmunk, squishy, the chipmunk.  The account is chipmunks of dog pain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No dog pain is my Aussie girl.  No, I've seen the dog painting. So it's wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here comes squishy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, squishy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's it, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, but look how cute he is.  Now he says fluffy bunny. Watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Squishy pain rent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Squishy pain rent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because all I see is his animal.  Is he going to make it? Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He got them all in. OK.  All right. I'll give you your second choice.  Dog pain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  From my Aussie gal.  This is an amazing painting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The dog that was doing the down the snow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute. We probably can't play this music.  So just watch the dog paint.  And the dog is painting blue.  Lots of blue on the canvas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's all blue now.  That's the first. Now he's got some green.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's interesting how they're cutting in between.  Tells me they really are very much influencing what the dog is doing.  Now he's doing yellow.  If they weren't cutting.  Producer. They're cutting.  The dog having a producer.  They're cutting.  I don't think the dog is painting a daisy.  I don't think the dog even knows what the hell's going on.  They probably put bacon on the paint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I don't know what I'm doing here with this.  I thought the trick was peanut butter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The dog painted a daisy and they're. Yeah, sure.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Mm hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, quite honestly, both of those are better than what I thought  would have been the best pick. The drone dancing.  Yeah, the drone dance. He was not.  That was horrendous.  I do not even play it.  Now you got to play.  Now you got to go into your.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's horrendous. I hate.  I gave them two seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's what that's the beauty of TikTok.  They in fact, the New York Times discovered  how TikTok reads your mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Didn't the Wall Street Journal panic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I give up. I'm not going to do it.  Don't worry. Don't worry.  It's moronic. I agree.  The CIA is big into.  Finish this sentence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Surveillance Bitcoin cryptocurrency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Stacey wins cryptocurrency, according to William Burns,  the director, the agency has, quote,  a number of different products focused on cryptocurrency.  Projects. Oh, not products. Projects.  This is something I inherited.  My predecessor started this, he said, but said it had set in motion  a number of different projects focused on cryptocurrency  and trying to look at second and third order consequences as well  and helping with our colleagues and other parts of the US government  to provide solid intelligence on what we're seeing as well.  And actually, there then, you know, if you look, this is on vice  at the more like this stories, you'll see why the CIA might be interested.  Man shot dead in Hall and hail of gunfire over crypto mining rigs.  Ted Cruz says Bitcoin mining can fix Texas's crumbling electric grid.  Oh, God. Cryptocurrency loan platform implodes in a one hundred  thirty million dollar hack.  How not to get scammed in the crypto market.  And Binance says it helped cops arrest ransomware money launderers.  So I guess you get an idea why the CIA might have some interest in all of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, probably four years ago, I was at an event and there was an FBI  money laundering person there.  So and they they were like very excited about Bitcoin.  This was not crypto in general, it was Bitcoin.  And it was because, you know, we can we can track things.  It's it's great. So they were I get why they're excited about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think, you know, some of these people made the case  that we wouldn't see ransomware as such a problem if Bitcoin didn't exist.  Because now that everybody knows about Bitcoin, knows how to get it.  Ransomware, despite what the CIA might say about tracking Bitcoin,  does have some sort of an anonymity.  It's a lot better going to 7-Eleven and buying money cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Did you have thoughts on the blockchain story on 108 in the security section?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, let's go there and find out.  Google temporarily disrupts a botnet that infected one million PCs.  Yeah, Steve Gibson talked about this yesterday.  Gloop Tiba. It's the largest botnet to date.  In case you're, you know, what's a botnet?  Very often when bad guys co-opt computers,  what they do is they set up a command and control IRC room.  The computer joins the room and then it waits for the command.  And there's all sorts of things you do to, you know, DDoS attacks,  try to take down gambling sites on Sabruul, Sunday, things like that.  The company S Google estimates the malware has infected  approximately one million Windows PCs globally.  They're on that botnet.  They're all infected by Gloop Tiba.  Google traced it to at least two individuals based out of, what a surprise, Russia.  The company is suing them in hopes it'll set a precedent,  create legal and liability risks for botnet operators.  At times, the company says it saw the network grow by about a thousand devices per day.  I remember and this is I mean, this is 20 years ago at Tech TV.  We had we had gotten a tip logged into an IRC channel that was a botnet.  And I was watching computers join at hundreds per second.  The botnet was growing very fast as the malware spread.  And once the malware infected your computer, your computer logged in this IRC channel  to wait for your command.  The malware that adds a computer to the Gloop Tiba botnet  is usually found hidden on sketchy websites that offer free software.  According to Google, the operators use the malware to steal personal data,  mine crypto currencies.  That's a big one these days and funnel other internet traffic through the infected machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can you explain this?  Unfortunately, Gloop Tiba's use of blockchain technology as a resiliency mechanism  is notable here and it's becoming more and more common practice among cybercrime organizations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, the decentralized nature of blockchain allows the botnet, they say,  to recover more quickly from disruptions, making them harder to shut down.  Maybe they're not using chat rooms anymore because it's easy to go after and shut down  a command and control center in a chat room.  Maybe there's maybe that's exactly why they're using blockchain because it's decentralized.  The issue, of course, is once you get all these computers,  you got to somehow tell them what to do.  You got to coordinate their activities.  So anyway, Google temporarily disrupts Gloop Tiba.  If you want more information, we did talk about it on Security Now yesterday with Steve Gibson.  Anybody, anything you want to talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's plenty more TikTok videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, no.  Are you glad you're not working at better.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They fired 900 people over Zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, how else are you going to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was going to. I saw this headline.  I was like, is 900 people?  So this one person was going to go door to door for 900 people?  Or what do you usually send emails?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, I mean, there's ways to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But then there's people that hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People complain about getting fired over text messages.  The issue was that he he come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then the CEO got on there.  He was like, this was so hard last time.  I'm hoping I'll do better this time.  He did it again. Oh, boy.  I come to you, he said, with not great news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  If you are on this call, 900 people,  you're part of the unlucky group being laid off.  Your employment here is terminated, effective immediately.  I don't see. I don't know how.  There's no way to get fired nicely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I agree. It's not a good thing one way or the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It had to be done.  And fortunately, that was the more effective way, efficient way to do it.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have to I have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I whenever well, we don't we're a small company,  so if people need to be fired or laid off, I do it.  Well, at least it does it in person.  Never fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This guy did not invent Bitcoin.  I'm just going to say I wanted you to explain this to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  How he wins a U.S.  court battle for Bitcoin fortune worth billions.  He claims he a guy claims he invented Bitcoin.  And he's an Australian computer scientist.  I'm not going to say his name.  He went to he went to court suing the family of a deceased business partner.  They claim the family claimed his own half of a cryptocurrency  fortune with tens of billions of dollars.  The jury did award 100 million in intellectual property rights  to a joint venture between the two men.  But the jury found that this guy did not owe  half of one point one million bitcoins to the family.  Didn't he? You know,  these were some of the first bitcoins to be created through mining.  They could only be owned by a person or entity involved  with the digital currency from its beginning, such as Satoshi Nakamoto, its creator.  This guy claims to be the creator. He's not.  In order. It's by the way, it's an easy thing.  If you think, you know, if you say I'm I'm Satoshi Nakamoto.  Well, Satoshi has tens of billions of Bitcoin in his account.  All you'd have to do is move.  You wouldn't even have to do anything but just say if you moved one  zillionth of a Bitcoin from that account to another account, said,  look, I'm going to do that tomorrow. And you did it. That proves it. Yeah.  He can't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the courts and they don't know.  The jury took a week to deliberate. They didn't understand it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah. He's not a credible claimant to the to the role, especially  because there is an easy proof, which he has never.  He's always said, yeah, I'll do that and never does it. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What does he think he's going to get? Because notoriety.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's why I don't want to say his name. Exactly. I got it. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good call, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like that other guy who drove Mazda crazy. We won't mention. Yeah. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Take dirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Padre had a good tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I wasn't going to do that.  But now that you've called it out, I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You like it because it takes a pot shot at your favorite organization.  Or one of your favorite organizations,  not Padre had a good sense of humor about Newsy.  Well, so it is, you know, look, it's tabloid journalism, right?  They here. I'll find the tweet.  He's I can't find it in their own.  He said, it's the Newsy published.  I got it. No, no.  Newsy published Newsmax, not Newsy, your favorite Newsmax.  Vatican preps for conclave as, quote, Pope is dying. What?  To which Father Robert says, Oh, no, I'll have to let him know  the next time he comes over rolling on the floor laughing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought it was very cool that we know the guy who knows the Pope.  Yeah, we know the guy. Yeah.  That's all. That's all. Yeah.  I can put in a plug for a friend of the show,  Neerat Weiss Blatt, who subbed for us.  Hey, we like her. Yes.  Techglass. She's brilliant. She's great. Yeah.  Her book, which we which we love, is academic and it costs 80 bucks.  But she now has an audio book version coming out right now  for I think it was 1395.  She's supposed to go up on on Audible any second. Good.  And she'll have the  paperback coming out for 30 bucks soon.  So it's an important book for those of us who cover technology.  And here's a plug for the brilliant Dr. Weiss Blatt.  She. I knew it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  She very kindly asked if I would read it.  And I said, I just don't.  I just don't have time, but I gave her some names.  So maybe she I hope she found somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Could you could you recognize that voice in two sentences?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I probably could. I sent her over to Cory Doctorow  and said, you know, Cory has his books recorded, pays for his books recorded.  She was very kind to ask me.  I was very, very flattered.  But it's hard to record a book, especially over 52 pages of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this one is this one has lots of data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes. Let's see.  It's on. Quotes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Quotes are very hard to read because you've got to do a different voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Here's a sample. Let's see if.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The sentence that drew most of the reactions from the research  interviewees was, but our work will never be done.  Perhaps since this phrase symbolizes the never ending challenge.  Good. He sounds good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't know who it is.  I don't recognize that voice, but it sounds very listenable.  So I'll be getting that tech lash and tech crisis communication near it.  Near it was on our show to talk about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  when it came, you know, when it came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And now it's in audio, which will make it certainly will broaden the audience.  Yeah, I'll check that out because it was it was it, you know, expensive.  80 bucks. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because it was academic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah. So explain to me, is it because it's such a small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's what they do is they sell them to because libraries,  if they think it's just going to be read in the library, there's a  there's a series of books that I love by a publisher called Brill.  But there's now 100 books about book history.  Get me started.  There are 140 bucks each.  Because I think nobody's going to buy this book.  Only the library is going to buy it.  This we're going to charge a very high price for it.  I'm trying to get Gutenberg the geek out.  And it will probably be with an academic publisher.  Knock on wood if I get one.  I'm talking to one now.  I just don't want it to be an 80 dollar book.  That's the way I'm. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Peter Boris reads it.  Peter J.  Boris and look for it.  Well, you can go near its website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Probably is the best best place to go.  That's where you go. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Congratulations. Google her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, there's another one that's interesting.  So there was a recent academic paper like today  that looked at the search engines line 56 and 57.  Search engines and and how much they they promoted conspiracies.  And they put in, I think, six basic conspiracies, QAnon.  I forget what the others were.  And they looked at Google, Yahoo, Bing, Xandex.  And I'm forgetting what and Duck Duck Duck Duck Go. Yeah.  And the only one that was free of conspiracies was Google.  The Google others. Interesting.  Yeah. Yeah.  It's interesting because Google obviously goes to the effort  to clean them out.  And so if you go to the explanatory Twitter thread,  they have some graphics there that show  what they what they did here.  So I think that was interesting to see that if you go to the effort,  you can have an impact.  And they chose to do this and they did it.  So it's a preprint.  It's a preprint. Yes, that is.  Which means it's not up in peer review.  Peer review. Neither have we been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We are not peer reviewed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's take all the chat room peer reviews.  I like the chat reviews kind of reviewing us in real time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They keep us straight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Do they does she say it's she's a postdoctoral  doctoral researcher at Social Computing Group.  Looks like it's she's got a Swiss URL.  So yeah, so we'll see if somebody funds that is the question.  I would I'd be curious about the Department of Informatics  at University of Zurich. OK, that's fair. That's safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Leibniz Institute for Sozialwissenschaften in Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That sounds good. Yeah, I see. All right. All right.  But, you know, that's appropriate.  You should ask when you read a study, especially if it's not peer reviewed.  Yeah. You know, what was the funding?  Just nothing here really is  sparking joy, sparking joy.  The Rohingyas are search suing Facebook for a mind boggling 150.  Now, this says million, but I heard saw a billion.  So maybe I misread it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I put this in here. I thought it's what do you do with like genocide of a whole people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, what's that worth? Right.  Axios is saying million now.  So maybe maybe I misread it.  A typo. Yeah. Yeah.  Million seems more reasonable.  Fifty billion sounds like you don't expect anybody to take it seriously.  But we're just going to ask for a giant amount of money.  Nevertheless, I think this is with a lot of merit.  There's no question. Where are they suing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But in what court do they US?  US. It's in the US courts. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who is suing? I mean, you can't sue like the Rohingya people can't sue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Like the Rohingya refugees from the US are suing in San Francisco,  seeking the court, seeking the court to apply Burmese law.  So this is kind of complicated.  That is the backstory, in case you didn't know, is that thousands of  Rohingya Muslims were killed in Myanmar.  The UN called it genocide.  And Facebook is widely accused of kind of allowing anti Rohingya  amplifying the message messages.  And this is we're talking actually about this.  I think on Twitter is that maybe that you are saying this, Jeff.  One of the problems is you can get content moderation in English  in big languages can be well done by these companies.  But it's these narrow languages where they don't have a lot of content

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  moderators very hard and the cultural context.  And you don't have the context.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You have to have people on the ground and so forth.  UN report in 2018 said Facebook played, quote, a determining  role in disseminating hateful rhetoric in Myanmar.  The International Criminal Court has opened an investigation into crimes  against the Rohingya Muslims in Bangladesh and Myanmar.  So face Facebook issued a statement back in 2018.  I think that this will be an interesting legal experts note.  There's no known successful legal precedent for invoking foreign law  and a suit against social media firms, especially because of Section 230.  So that's why they want Burmese law.  They're protected under 230.  They're not liable in the U.S., but they might be.  But they are liable under Burmese law, but they're suing in the U.S.  So it's sounds complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And if all of this goes through for that nation that sue in Facebook,  what can Facebook do to stop this from happening again?  I mean, is it? It's well, it's hard.  And that's what we're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But they didn't.  I mean, Facebook has.  I mean, this is my one of my chief criticisms against Facebook is  this seems to happen again and again in the Philippines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They know they're evil and they just don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, they don't care.  They have not found a way to do something about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it just going to take more and more nations  suing Facebook before something even gets done?  Well, this isn't a nation.  These are refugees, but people suing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't think Facebook's at all threatened by this lawsuit.  That's the real truth of it.  Mm hmm. They have enough lawyers.  Yeah, I just don't think it's going to go forward.  It kind of on on the Rohingya side, you know.  But I don't know if they're and I think they have merit,  but I don't think they have standing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the other point of doing this is for the attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes. And that's why we're giving it. Mm hmm.  Amazon launches Alexa together.  I think we're going to have to get our IOT person to say,  what the hell is that?  A new service to help you care for the ones you love.  Alexa together, you know, I guess they were talking about this.  I remember at an event this would be I would say.  I launched it in September. Yeah.  Yeah. Nineteen ninety nine a month,  twenty dollars a month or one hundred ninety nine dollars a year.  Um, and then it's a way for you to support loved ones  keeping you together, even when you apart.  You get customized alerts, 24 7 urgent response.  You can see how things are with snapshots of your loved ones,  echo and smart home interactions.  Additional family members can join you to support your loved one.  I think this is probably a good thing.  That's very remote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Augusta Augusta Augusta

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  set reminders on a loved one's echo, manage shopping lists,  link music services and more.  When I brought my mom an echo and set it up for her,  it was set up on my account.  And it didn't take her very long to reset it because she said,  I see your calendar notifications.  I don't I want mine.  But of course, she didn't know how to make it hers.  And so it just doesn't work.  And there's also if a compatible device detects a fall,  Alexa calls urgent response and notifies emergency contacts.  So or, you know, they can shout call for help.  So I think this is pretty cool.  I think this is a good idea.  It is expensive, but I guess 200 bucks a year is not not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We just moved my father.  It's a nice, my 95 year old father.  And he's now seven miles away, which is a blessing.  Yeah, absolutely.  But I was so told we convinced him to do that.  I was so worried.  And I was I was looking at this and thinking, how do we do it?  But the problem is there's no he's 95.  There's no device he can use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, no. So but some of this is you using it to keep an eye on him.  OK, and there is and one of the one of the things you're paying for  with the 200 bucks a year is a 24 seven urgent response team.  He could have reached it by saying echo call for help.  The fall detection, you know, I have my mom's fall detection on her watch.  I don't know if it works with this, but if it detects a fall,  then the echo would say, do you want me to call urgent response?  You want me to connect you to urgent response.  OK, all right.  Remote assist if the loved one chooses to activate it.  That's worth $200 a year, my man.  Yeah, I think so.  Given a homemade would cost, you know, that much a day.  So I think that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm counting down until we see the story about violating  the privacy of our elders. But.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, notice, the Washington Post did it already.  They did in November.  But OK, hold on, because you did actually at the very beginning  call for my my thoughts on this.  And then you just kept going.  Well, I wanted to tell everybody, I'm setting the stage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You used to be the background.  This is this is everything you need to know.  So now what does Stacey think is the question that Jeff had a dumb question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then now we're now we're at the meat of it.  Now we're at the heart of it.  Now we're at the value.  Now we're the reason people are here.  Go ahead, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Bless his heart. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  just a couple of things quick, not even corrections, just little addendums.  So the device that you would buy to detect falls, that's an additional device.  It's got to be set up in each individual room.  It's two hundred and fifty dollars for that device.  He uses radar. It's very effective.  I've talked to the company that makes it a bunch.  So that's a very interesting device.  If you're going to buy something like that, it's nice because it monitors  for the things most people are worried about without using a camera,  because it's just using radar.  So one of the nicer things about this particular setup  is that you will see that your parent interacted with Madame A or Alec,  but you don't know what they did.  So you'll see, you know, your mom played a song, your mom asked the time,  but you don't know exactly what they're doing or your mom turned on a light,  but you don't know if it's in the bathroom or what.  The other thing that's nice is this is an evolution of their care hub stuff,  which they launched the year before.  Now you can do one to many.  So with it, it doesn't have to be just you, Leo, controlling your parents.  My sister could do it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah. And she's down the road.  So that would actually work out really well.  I suspect we'll be doing this. Mom's 88.  She doesn't have she's living at home by herself.  She doesn't have in home care.  But I think, you know, this would be eventually she'll need that, obviously.  But this is a step in between. This looks really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, this is this is a really compelling service, I think.  And it's fairly privacy preshirting.  I mean, what is elder?  I mean, basically, to stay in your home,  you might have to give up some of your privacy. It's really terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And, you know, if you don't want to do this, you don't have to do it.  Obviously, you know, so nobody's making anybody do it, I hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, I mean, I can see someone saying, hey, look, mom,  if you don't want to go into assisted living, you're going to have to do this. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You usually that's if you don't want to go to living,  then we're bringing in some stranger into your home every day.  And I know I'm not going to do that.  And that's the fight. It's a tough it's a tough one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  All around. It really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My father had had breakthrough  that he was in the hospital that he was in rehab.  It hits you for a loop.  And he says, I need this kind of help.  And we said, oh, yes. OK.  And the opening was there.  And, you know, it's it's never an easy discussion.  But I hope somebody takes care of all of us when we get that old. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I did get my mom an Apple watch  for the fall detection and some of that stuff.  She loves it and keeps her encouraged to be active and stuff like that.  So there's intermediate steps.  Technologies, I think, as because Jeff Baby Boomers, we're getting older.  And there's going to be a very big market for this kind of stuff for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think there's going to be a lot of services to keep you in your home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, which I think is good.  That's definitely evident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this is nice because, you know, a lot of people,  there's no indication that you're old. Right.  So if you look like a lot of people don't want to wear like  the bracelets or the buttons, because it's an indicator,  even hearing aids, that they're old.  And, you know, this is pretty normal.  It's kind of hidden throughout your home. So. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Good. Thank you, Amazon.  On the other hand, there's a lot of people, according to The Washington Post,  named Westgallow, who can't wait to change their name.  What there's got to be a name in journalism for this kind of story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it was done before we've talked about before,  but I put I put it back in there just because it keeps coming around again. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Billy Joel and Christie Brinkley named their daughter in 1985.  In 2015, 6000 baby girls were named.  There's actually a good story in Brad Stone's Amazon Unbound  about how they came up with that name and all the other names they considered.  It wasn't by any means a slam dunk.  In fact, it was kind of a late decision to call it.  Huh? It says show a graph. Show the graph.  Suddenly, the names when the.  So this this peak right here is released nationwide.  This sudden plummet is the drop in people named babies named  the given the name year you wouldn't name your kid.  After Billy Joel named their kid, the numbers went up and up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he wrote he wrote a song. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  As 2020, Billy Joel does as one does, as he does in 2020,  only about 1300 babies were given the name.  OK, I mean, there's a name for this kind of story.  It's kind of a lifestyle, soft, moral panic, moral panic.  I don't think that's the name.  I don't know. No, it's not a name that I'm looking for.  Do you want to talk about basic effort for a trend story?  I know your trend story.  That's the word I was looking for. Trend story.  Do you want to talk about Benedict  Devon slides you do every year we does this that time of year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it is a time of year.  I think Ben's brilliant and a great analyst.  And I don't know how many pages it is.  What was it? Oh, hell, I should look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm sorry. I should have looked up the the name of it is three steps to the future,  which is essentially the premise is  three trends in 2021.  You know, it's funny because Amy Webb,  who is a regular on our show, would love her.  She's a futurist.  Awesome. Future Today Institute  came to us a couple of weeks ago and said, I'd like to do  show about the future with on Twitter.  So we contacted, I think, Daniel Suarez, science fiction author.  And I thought we're going to get a scientist as well.  And get Amy and talk about future trends.  That'll be early next year.  I think it'll be the first like January 7th, the first week of the first  Twitter of Janice. Yeah.  Won't that be interesting?  But let's see what Ben has to say.  OK, future.  Here's a whole slide.  Just this one. Can you summarize this, Jeff?  It says future.  There you go. I'm trying to look for the slides.  There you go. OK.  The tech visions for 2030.  He's got two dots.  One says Web 3, one says metaverse.  And then he's got a lot of other words, random words put together.  And then the great rebranding,  redefine the vision and set a broader goal for VAR crypto.  So crypto currencies are now going to be called Web 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So which is basically say it's BS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah. VRAR going to be called metaverse.  The next plat. Well, that was interesting.  He says the next platform after smartphones.  I think that's probably true.  Web 3, the Holy Roman Empire is nearly  is neither holy nor Roman nor an empire, according to Voltaire.  Cryptocurrency is neither secret nor only a currency.  Blockchain or DLT are not databases.  That's what Voltaire would have said, had he been born later.  Blockchain is a distributed open computing system,  or at least that's the plan.  Web 3, the dream of the next version of the Internet.  Users read the web publishers create and make money.  Web 2.0 users create networks, control and make money.  Web 3 users create users control networks and money.  And you know what? I'm done with this.  This is fun. This isn't that insightful.  No, it's not. OK.  BuzzFeed went public.  Is that interesting, Jeff?  It's a it is for lots of reasons, because it's journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a SPAC, but a whole bunch of the SPAC holders  backed out before.  Who? It was a SPAC back.  It was a SPAC back. Yes.  And so they didn't get as much money as they wanted.  Meanwhile, NBC was not happy about the valuation,  which was a clawback on a SPAC back.  And so NBC owns BuzzFeed.  NBC invested hugely.  Comcast invested hugely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to say Comcast, my friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They own BuzzFeed News, HuffPost, Taste,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  acquired Complex Media.  Complex is part of this is part of what what Verizon owned HuffPost.  They sold it to BuzzFeed.  Oh, they got out of all that media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And they bought Complex from Hurston Verizon for 300 million.  It was part of this deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then Jonah Paredi thinks the only way to compete with the big guys  is to become a big guy. He's the founder and CEO.  Yeah, he's brilliant.  I mean, Jonah was the brains behind behind HuffPost too, really.  And all their technology.  But the SPAC didn't work so well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The 94 percent of investors withdrew.  Yes. I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's well enough to understand fully what that means.  But that means there wasn't as much money in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For you raise a bunch of money and then you take things public through a pipe,  basically. So you usually merge with the public company.  But you have a lot of funds with the idea of doing this.  So they just didn't have enough money to do their deal.  Or did they buy a cheaper company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The merger raised roughly 16 million dollars after investors withdrew  about 94 percent of the 287 and a half million previously raised by the SPAC.  The company also raised an additional 150 million in convertible note  financing borrowing as part of the SPAC deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hmm. Well, it came out at 10 bucks today.  It closed at 768.  Eesh, eesh, eesh.  Nobody's investing in media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Down 22 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And finally, because we're going to take we're going to take a break  and then get your picks of the week.  Finally, the Chinese have finally made contact  with an alien civilization on the backside of the moon.  There it is. They call it Mystery Hut.  The outhouse of the moon.  Their rover is only it's only 260 feet away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's going to take them months to get over there.  It's going to take them three months to get over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's not moving fast.  It looks like it's cubic, which means that either  there are there are aliens on there or wombats.  Stonehenge. Because it's a cube.  And or like that poop, it could be.  That's John's joke.  It could be a monolith.  Except 2001, it would be the monolith from spinal tap.  It'd be kind of like a little one.  I actually it's hard to say how big it is.  I think it might be actually like five meters tall,  but I'm not sure.  I thought the initial reports at 20 meters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  20 meters. OK, right. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Anyway, it's it looks kind of like a cube.  So in three months, two to three months, the you  will have forgotten about it too.  We'll spend it's well, if you put it in lunar terms,  it's only two to three lunar days.  So it's not OK.  I'll still forget about it.  They have to because they have to avoid craters  because if they fall in, it's like there's nobody to get them out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like the Estonian rat robots. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So that's a good, you know, that's a good story.  Wouldn't it be amazing if they got there and it is a cube?  It's like, wow, that would be amazing.  You and on. Yeah, it's a cube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a cube. You get it. Oh, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Let's take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do.  This is part of the Stacey loves sharing books with people.  Oh, this is a good time for Ant to tell you about our book club date.  If we found it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I found our book club date.  So I'm not going to tell you about that yet.  Wow.  The book I want to tell you about today is called AI 2041.  And I think a lot of y'all are going to be really interested in this  because it is a collaboration between.  Oh, I'm going to butcher this.  And I'm so sorry, Chen Keefong, maybe Keefong and Kai Fuli.  Kai Foo is a.  Researcher at Microsoft, and he's worked at Microsoft Google.  I don't actually know if he's still at Microsoft and  Chen Keefong is an author.  So what they've done is they've created a book that is a number of 10 short stories  and then an essay afterwards by Kai Fuli about the it is all about AI.  So 10 stories about AI.  And then he explains why this will happen  and what how it could kind of vary a little bit in the next 20 years.  And so it really taps into like reading science fiction.

Transcript:  That's my stuff. OK.  Elon Musk, we can make fun of media for thinking that he was really  asking the world if he wanted to sell the stock.  Of course, he had to sell the stock because he had options coming to.  So he sold the stock so he could pay the taxes.  So he owns even more stock now.  Oh, how funny.  He's going to go on to the media again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He owns five hundred sixty four thousand more shares  than he did when he sold the shares.  The rich gets richer.  He's exercising options to buy with the cash he makes from the shares he's selling.  So he's exercising at six dollars and twenty four cents a share,  which is one percent of its actual stock price.  So in other words, it's kind of like this.  If I gave you a dollar to make a hundred dollars,  that would be a good deal for me, for you.  All right. So that's what happened.  Wow. You know what?  It's funny how the truth is different from what you read.
