Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they announced this gets into our show they announced all kinds of  Yes, and and for example a whole bunch of new  Translation stuff where you're gonna be able to talk to you to the assistant with someone else in the room who has the different language

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google made at least one dozen announcements. Here's the verges to see this is why I don't need to go  Because everybody and their brothers they're writing this out and it's much easier

We already have the home hub and LG and  Who is JBL have smart displays by his KitchenAid is getting in the act Samsung TV integration  Actually, that was interesting because Samsung's not only putting Google in their TVs are putting  Apple's iTunes and AirPlay 2  So that what used to be, you know a walled garden is kind of maybe not better Phillips Hue integration  I actually use use my assistant. I say turn the lights off and it does it so I  Don't know what better integration means car products like lighter adapters  I had theirs and still do the Viva which was Amazon's echo last year this year  They put a Google assistant in it, which I think is actually a good idea. I'll look for  Yeah, I mean, you know  Earlier this week Amazon said we were on a hundred million devices. So Google had to say we're on a billion devices  But Google has a slight advantage because most of those billion devices are phones  They're in a lot of they're in all Android phones almost  So, all right, so that's that's new let's see what else here  There are a bunch of new software features you can do your boarding passes on assistant I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Guess I don't necessarily understand how wonderful it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they well, can you say to the assistant show me my boarding pass? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Before that it will take you through the whole process. Oh  Yeah, so, you know, I had done I don't have luggage. Yes. I acknowledge. I'm not taking on bombs  You can do that by voice. Yeah, and now you do by voice  So I'm reading I'm reading odd things because my Gutenberg moment. I'm now reading a 1960s book from script print  The world of readers and writers as it was before the common existence of printed books, oh god Jarvis, please no

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going the other way. I'm going from print to script  So  You know, I feel like my this is part of my retreat from the 21st century is all found in that. Yes  Yeah kind of pen  Well, oh don't get me started. Oh, you're not getting all that. Are you I you know, I realize I don't know  It's a little Freudian but right around adolescence. I started getting involved with pens and  I remember  Yeah  Well, I  Remember going to the Brown University bookstore and I would you know  Buy pens and I've owned many a Mont Blanc owned and lost many a Mont Blanc in my time  But now that I'm older wiser and perhaps more responsible. I've decided to kind of beef up my pen collection  This is a Japanese  Inexpensive Japanese brand called sailor that people  Have gotten to the reddit  subreddit for fountain pens so stop me at any time  It's wanted for its nib they say it's a very good, you know nib is the most  Huge somebody said and I think this is very apt really writing with a fountain pen a fountain pen is just a controlled ink leak  Yeah, that's basically what's happening. Yeah, and the nib is where the ink leaks out of so how the nib works with how it writes  Whether it's scratchy you got a bad nib. It's terrible. Oh, it's could be the worst. So you're a fountain pen aficionado as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I had a whole bunch of them actually had still have one that doesn't really work it was my  Great-grandmother's I think so it's got a bladder in it and you know lift a little lever

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, see I've decided I'm never buying a pen that doesn't have a  Built-in converter. I don't like the cartridges, which is what the sailor uses or the aftermarket converters  So I've ordered a Pelican and I'm waiting for it that has a Pelican has a patented  Special system and I also have a wing sung the Chinese  Makes sense very big in fountain pen. So I have a wing sung 698, which I like a lot. I like gel Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Joe Joe's no aesthetic technology advances. No aesthetic. No aesthetic feels good

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I used to do calligraphy as well. So I got heavily into those types of pens

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You need a you need a fountain pen to because the width of the line varies which which it doesn't do with a gel pen  You can also and by the way, it doesn't end with the pen. There's a huge  Thing of ink now. This is something that's changed in the last few years  At least since I was into it where there's luminescent inks. There's all kinds of inks

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this week in 1398. I like going back in time. So there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Torium there's a brand that I'm a  fan of called Noodlers  Noodlers ink and they make a variety of inks with the political messages including the Bernanke black  That is fast drying because when you're printing money, it's important  Then it dry fast  They have such great links  So I'm gonna I'm gonna say and they're in there very  Here's Pasternak they have a Russian series now you have got I'm blaming you for this Matthew. I'm down the rabbit hole  the reason I got Bernanke though is because I'm a lefty and  If you're a lefty, yes, you don't foul hands or you don't smear it. Yeah, I have in the past  Been not, you know a good  Penman as they call them  Because of my left-handedness and I just drug right so Bernanke is gonna be my lifesaver because it dries before you get your hand  Fascinating fast sort of gel  Yeah, I have some really nice gels. You know what I like on the gel side  The Baron fig are you know about you know about the Baron Fig? No, I just have

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Enter gel

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sounds like a dessert Baron fig should be a dessert  the Baron fig  This is the squire is the best rollerball you can get and I even have a squire  That's a little stand that I keep on my desk here. Wow, this is Jeff. It's not expensive  Well, it is a stand  Why do you need a stand because then you just put it in the stand and it's always there and ready for you  You can go get John. It's on my desk  Okay, these are these are the best roller balls Jeff if you want to really have fun  The Baron Fig squire and then any idea why it's called that  And then if you want a disposable Schneider  And I've tried them. I used to be a pilot guy pilot gel. Yeah pilots are pretty they're very good  But I have these Baron fig you've never seen. Okay, the Pentel is my favorite Pentel's are good, too and tell her gel

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well as we were saying about Google, I can't escape

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  one last

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Though the notion that this is all extremely Freudian  There's something just wrong  Sometimes a pen is just a pen. Sometimes a pen is just a writing instrument. Here's my Baron fig  You see that and then it's wow always available  Wow, nice nicely weighted little stand. What if you want to carry it with you? It will retract or does retract  Yeah, but you don't need to retract it if you keep it in the patented Baron fig stand

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you pay extra for the stand?  How much for that whole package

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Think 55 bucks, but it comes with a bunch of refills. Okay, this will last a lifetime. It's a writing instrument. It's not a pen  You can also play Dixie on it I do think there is something attached to the fact that I've withdrawn from social media  Oh, yes, this is definitely and then I'm going into pens and and you're gonna be on the goddamn paleo diet

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have one of those do you have a manual keyboard for your tablet or anything like that  I've been looking for those. There's some pretty good ones out there. So it's basically like an old-fashioned

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the quirky. Yeah, the quirky. Yeah, I actually made the quirky guy cry  We had a show  Called I'd fund that in which people came in  Was it quirky USB keyboard? Let me quirky was so great. I did quirky

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I went to the quirky judge's and was a judge a couple times. They were so great

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It wasn't quirky quirky was has gone now. Yeah  Yeah, sad to say cuz I thought that was a really good idea  Yeah, the quirky writer. It's Q w e r k y  Okay, so they were they were at this point trying to raise money on Kickstarter  And so we had them on I'd fund that and if it was basically shark tank if we liked it  We'd say I'd fund that if we didn't like it, I would say go fund yourself  And and I looked at this because what do I know and I said, wait a minute  You're gonna have this typewriter keyboard. It's a hundred some dollars  You're gonna have this typewriter keyboard people are gonna buy it and use it  $249 I said you're insane go fund yourself and I was wrong  I've almost bought one. I was so wrong. It even has a little what do they call that?  Carriage return and and they'll and you hit it it makes sounds

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Crazy. I actually wanted to buy one years ago that this guy built from scratch. So he took in a land  Underwood they still do wired it out. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is another book I just bought the wonderful writing machine. Oh, it's all about the typewriter done for Olympus

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And in the lobby, I don't know if you've been there Matthew, but if in the lobby of CUNY's journalism school  They have an exhibit of typewriters old typewriters. It's really cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My favorite one my favorite  The brand is Bing Bing I tell everybody that's where Microsoft search is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have a machine that goes bang I  Had a typewriter fetish for a time as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I think lots of people do I love I love there's a book that came out last year called the Chinese  Typewriter did you hear about that? Well, that's crazy because I don't have a Roman cast. It's not 26 letters  So the book is about this guy's sort of mission to create a Chinese typewriter which ultimately fails  I think there was one but I don't know that any  copies of it exist anymore, but one was built allegedly and it had  You know a 15 stage shift key I think  And it's just fascinating but this story of sort of trying to come up with one and how

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Difficult it was to get kind of so before just processing how I this is really ignorant of me  How did one do documents there were these things called fountain pens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've come full circle now  That's the other thing I've gotten into because I because I really as a lefty  I know had terrible handwriting and I was taught the Palmer method in school and now they do it as an even simplified Palmer method  but the Palmer method was a simple live-ed version of something called  Spencerian script and there's a company named Mott books that publishes the workbooks  For the original Spencerian script as taught in schools in the 19th century  And nice and I've purchased all of those workbooks and I'm working my way through them because I want yes  Because I want good Spencerian penmanship

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But nobody writes with pens anymore. I do so I'm gonna stop teaching penmanship

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no one will notice that your penmanship is really good. I have well they will when they get these handwritten note cards  I'm thinking I'm gonna do a I'm gonna do an analog Instagram. I'm going to print a picture and  Yeah, no card and write a capsule and then have a like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Checkbox, that's a good little some paper. I want to see you write something like this. We can Google see how I can't yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm still learning it. My hand is like a noodle because it's exhausting  But I I'm gonna get the fine motor skills. I lacked as a young man  Because so because but we were taught, you know, you remember cursive, right?  Do you ever write in cursive anybody ever write in cursive? Oh my handwriting is so long

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is why I took typing in sixth grade. Yes. I did a summer course in typing because I have my handwriting was so dreadful. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, so I'm the opposite. I never took typing. I type with basically two fingers maybe four

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you a touch typist Leo no, I'm a two finger also, but I don't look at it I  Self-taught I'm like Matthew where you had to write  Just go like this. I can go pretty fast. Yeah me too. I'd be faster if I could touch types

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So do you remember I forgot this till recently as well those little memories that comes back  How did you get on an old rile real typewriter? Let's say how did you get an exclamation point?  shift

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was it was down there lower right wasn't it? No, there was no exclamation point on the older typewriter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You did that's right  I forgot that apostrophe backspace period. Yeah, is it this week at old parts? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's insane. Although it had the somewhat meritorious advantage of reducing the number of exclamation marks in writing  Yeah, exactly. Yes true. You don't do bang bang bang bang bang anymore because you got a  Apostrophe backspace period just read something about how kids like the kids nowadays, you know Millennials

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Routinely use exclamation marks all the time. So now in order to convey  What a one exclamation mark would you have to use at least three?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's exclamation mark inflation. Yeah, so a friend of mine said she dated a guy  You'll see soon. See why it was very briefly  Who told her that you should use only three exclamation points in life and I've already used one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you want to learn a little Spencerian script, I'll get yourself a little fountain pen Wow, and  This is considered simplified over the predecessor which was round hand  Which is what the Declaration of Independence is written in that looks so useful. I think it's beautiful  You're a calligrapher. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a little rounded for me. I like the I  like the ones with all the unnecessary  lines and frills and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Extras see this was considered  Simplified because it only uses seven different strokes. Mm-hmm. And so once you once you learn those and that's what I'm learning right now  I stroke one is up and to the right a 30 degree angle. No 52 degree angle  Stroke two is you don't want to hear

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Man being off social media. You got a lot of time. You get really bored easily

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What else is new in the Google change

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We were wait wait wait wait wait wait wait what were we talking about we were talking about about assistant and what I was the point  I was trying to get to before Matthew  Took us into the Leo forget how we even got here  Was we were this is a McClough and ask point Matthew as a Canadian should should respect this  Was there is how we were an oral culture before oral and oral culture before right?  And and and so you hear Google saying how important voice is and you see this at CES and  as far as reading this this this odd book and  Because of the way we learn to read right text has always been an intermediary a blockade  When you read you hear the words you you you talk to yourself with the words you it's everything is actually oral text was this weird  Exception to that. Yeah, and so the platforms are going to an oral based world  It's slower and more efficient and inefficient in some ways, but in other ways it requires  You know training no UI no nothing else as long as machines are good enough to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But assistants are terrible at people with handling people with accents. I mean you've seen those  Videos of like Scottish people try

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They'll learn yeah, I guess the Google the Google translation thing that they were announcing for for  Assistant I think has starts with something like 27 languages  I forget the number but it's it's pretty impressive and the other way I was trying to because I'm reading these weird books  I was trying to translate Latin and used to be you couldn't get that in Google Translate you can get that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there's another whole sort of rabbit hole about  The way that your brain  Functions and how that's tied to language. There's a fascinating sort of theory about character based languages  Versus and how and sort of image based languages and how  one  encourages you to think in a specific way and the other so  Character based language is the theory is it encourages you to split things up into incomprehensible  units that only makes sense when they're combined and  there's a there's some fascinating research about different languages and how they kind of  You know encourage you to think in different ways. So going back to an oral culture  Could have all sorts of you know strange kind of repercussions

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we become very dependent then on the assistance on the the machine learning and AI  Because they're gonna be the translators to some sort of there aren't humans at the other end of this  So so I think I think CS was actually that's one little important part of CES. I was trying to get us back on well

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I I welcome it from the other direction. What are we doing right now?  But we're doing oral  Aural content a lot of people who listen to podcasts and even audiobooks speed them up almost all players have ability to double the speed  or one and a half times the speed and I  Talk to people all the time I say when I when I'm in studio when they come in studio and hear us  They say you all sound drunk. You're so slow because they're used to listening at 2x  but that is a good way to get more content and faster and  I think that's completely legitimate. Isn't it the case?  that fast readers don't  Annunciate in their mind that they or is I mean I I don't think it's possible

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that's the Evelyn Woods method kind of you try not to yeah, but I think I can't not I never do you don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do the worst in your mind when you read just no, it's a direct input into your amygdala

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and I don't know  But and the consequently I don't I mean I I  Don't think very well to go. Oh very quickly

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You read fast you read fast see I actually when I don't understand something  I'll slow down and say it in my head sometimes really say it out loud. Yeah. Wow. I need to hear it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the scribes the scribes which you're turning into I am a scribe  Wouldn't do silent reading silent reading was was a was an invention of the came after books  Because everything was read out loud. You had one copy of the book. You had 20 people in the room somebody read it  Lecture and lecture, right? Yeah, and and and so it was  Right verse until until the late 1300s verse was the only acceptable form of text prose was was crap Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am going to okay, that'll be my New Year's resolution  Everything I say will be an iambic pentagon including limericks  I think limericks are acceptable limericks are acceptable. I think if it just should be  I think from now on I'm gonna do everything in iambic pentagon

Transcript:  Jeff I'm gonna send you one of these barren figs  I'm gonna I'm gonna get your address and I'm gonna send you one because you're gonna flip your lid and  Then in about two months, I'm sending you a fountain pen. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would be the worst. I really have the worst hand right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's see if I can find something but I think it makes your handwriting better because it grips the paper  It's the problem with hand see a rollerball never give you good handwriting. It's too slippery

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're I have no black for sharing this is no one could possibly read this if you can see this  That's good and doctor  That's good. That's what well everybody remember this family was a doctor. They all thought I had to be a doctor because they have horrible handwriting

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Readiness and rain there once was a twit from Nantucket by the way  You know that the original version of the Nantucket limerick was not filthy. No  What was it? Is this too much of a rabbit hole? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's where we live

Transcript:  The original  Nantucket one, let me say I gotta find I give you very careful  But I read this somewhere  Because you've all heard the filthy one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It said made 12th, so okay, there's there's clearly some  Work to be done. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was supposed to do that weren't they supposed to have

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the earbuds did it and in fact your phone does it right now  And I've used it where if you put it Google translate and you hold it like this  You could speak into it and then that will translate and they can speak back into it  It'll translate back to you and it works better than that. I'll be honest. That was a noisy casino  Did the earbuds work? No, I never the earbuds were terrible  Yeah, the reason the earbuds were a bad idea is because only you heard the translation right right and so it wasn't clear  it's much better I think doing it with the phone or this assistant on the  You know on us Google Home Hub or something will be better because they can hear the translation  So they know that you're hearing something and you speak to it. And so there's it's just a more natural flow

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a it's real-time translation. I was just watching I think was the blacklist and they had I don't know if it's Google  Translate but they had a Chinese  character say things into their phone and then it read them out in English

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you can do that right now. In fact being translates very good father. Robert told me, you know, he's he's the digital Jesuit  Robert balancer has been on a host of our shows like running the Vatican and what not he's running the Vatican now and  Well, I don't know running he might not like that characterization. He's probably the tech guy there. Yeah, I know he's I know he helped  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's in charge of digital. So he runs it. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he set up he set up the Skype for the Pope a couple of years ago  So and I think he's doing social media and stuff  Anyway, he goes to these curia meetings which are you know, the Pope and Cardinals  man, apparently the curia when it meets doesn't speak in Latin it speaks in Italian and  His Italian is not great. So he put Google being on the table. He's following somewhat but being is telling him what they're saying  He says it works very well  Last time I heard from him though. He said I'm being sent somewhere to learn Italian  Who and then we never heard from him again?  No, actually he's at CES and will be in studio with me on Sunday for this  He's having a good time at CES I bet  Fuchsia should we talk about fuchsia?  It's we still in the change log. Yeah, I guess this is well should I stick with stuff maybe that's gonna be who knows

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Doesn't matter who knows just the problem is I vision poor Carson his his hand has been

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a button for quite a while now. Well, I'm going through the verge's article and all the things  Google announced  Let's see, this is interpreter mode. Let me get all of these  Lined up here everything  Google assistant CES remember last year was also very much at Google slash echo  CES

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it feels like that's the most obvious market opportunity

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's minor stuff better auto reply and punctuation when you reply to school. Yeah your voice  Yeah, so they don't understand that you imply to comma as you speak  Assistant will be in Google Maps

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's what they say as they say in the verge. That's a Trojan horse because that gets Google Assistant everywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't it even on iPhone? Yeah  Well, you can download Google Assistant for the iPhone if you download the odds that you do as opposed to starting to get used to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, pretty slim though. I find that maps  Voice has never worked very well for me. Maybe it'll get better with official assistant. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is I mean  We were talking about this on Windows with the I Paul throughout thinks and I agree  Assistance the winner pretty clearly  Amazons echo a close second  Mm-hmm, and then all the rest are also rants and it's funny because it's Windows weekly  But Cortana is not even in the in them in the hunt at this point  Let's see the data right yeah  Apple, you know  Privacy turns out not to be a good thing for a voice assistant  Android messages automatic spam protection has started rolling out  Now you should be aware as as John Porter points out on the verge that that means it's collecting phone numbers  Automatic spam protection is opt-out by default. So you have to turn  Oh, you can turn you could turn it off from within the advanced settings menu  No time frame for the way we say that again. It's that's confusing opt-out by default sounds like you have to do it on  You know on  So I'm not sure if he wrote that confusingly or we're just reading it in our heads  But that's a good thing. I mean, I have to say Hangouts has become  Atrocious for me for Spain. Yeah, it's terrible. I get so many fake young women approaching me  Yeah, what's interesting is because my last name is La Porte. They do it in French in the middle of the night  Because they think I'm French Lisa gets young men  interestingly  in English  so it's  Not so it's a garbage fire. It's a garbage fire. So I think this you know, this is gonna be an important feature  It's in the messages and I don't see it coming to hangouts, but I don't understand why

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Spam phone calls are controllable

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you mean I think  there's a combination of a reluctance on the part of carriers because they could do it and  A concern they know it's banned or identifying the spam, but it's there was also concerned about the First Amendment. Yeah, probably  Now you don't have First Amendment rights on a cell phone network  AT&T has the right to do what they want may that's by the way one of the reasons that the at least that's the stated reason  that the FCC declared text messages to be what a  Publishing service. I can't remember what they did, but they did something that says that allowed carriers to then  block spam  but  It also has the upshot the carriers could block political speech  They don't like or you know messages that they aren't happy with things like that  That was just recently the FCC just did that  Google drawings can now be embedded in Google Docs

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know how I've ever used Google then maybe you will know that your calligrapher. I could write I could handwrite all my Google Docs  You can make any

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's see you could handwrite and then scan them and then do OCR

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can't wait to the day we do a Google changelog where I say and now Google OCR can understand Spencerian script  That'll be today

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That we we good pen no the way the way your head is gonna be able to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By Newton understands Spencerian script. It doesn't it doesn't understand any script

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we can safely say that concludes  In the changelog change lock now we are gonna get back to the 21st century in a moment  Including I'm curious what you think about this. They have arrested the 20 year old who hacked  Angela Merkel and  Other politicians the judge he operated alone  But he called himself God so we'll talk about that just a second first a word from Express VPN  I think if you if you're technical enough to watch our shows or listen  You know what a VPN is a virtual private network  The idea is it first started businesses used VPNs as a way for you to log into the work  Computer from home in a secure way and it was as if you were at the work on the work network  Even though you weren't you were using a VPN. It's a encrypted private tunnel very good technology very strong technology of late  People have been using VPNs for other reasons for instance if you had a VPN provider you could use them maybe at an open  Wi-Fi  Access pointer like a coffee shop you you turn on the VPN on your machine  It's an encrypted tunnel right past all the snoops in the coffee shop to the VPN server and then out into the world  People also use it to eliminate geographic restrictions  So let's say you want to look like you're coming from London  Maybe you want to watch the BBC or you look like you're coming from France. Maybe you want to watch French television  So there's lots of reasons you might want to use a VPN and of course one of the maybe most important is  You might not want your internet service provider snooping on what you're doing in your home  the number one  Best VPN out there and I could say that with confidence Express VPN  there are VPNs many of them that will insert ads into your stream or  worse  Express VPN doesn't do any of that no logging your privacy is absolutely secure and they're fast  Running a good VPN network that doesn't slow you down means lots of servers Express VPN has a hundred and forty eight  locations in 94  Countries so there's one near you and they are fast fast fast tech radar  ranked Express VPN the number one VPN service and for any reason with any of their plans if you're not happy  30 day money-back guarantee plans cost less than seven dollars a month  So it's not like it's super expensive, but honestly you do want to pay for a VPN  There's really good reasons and and the best is Express VPN affordable  We're gonna make it even a more affordable if you want to protect your online activity and your privacy today  Go right now to express VPN comm slash twig. You'll get an extra three months free with a one-year package. That's the best deal  absolutely Express VPN  comm slash  Twig protect your online privacy with Express VPN and of course 30-day money-back guarantee means it's completely risk-free  Do and I always recommend this read the privacy policy  And then the other thing you should look at is where the VPN is  If it's in the United States or Australia or any of the five eyes countries, that's a bad idea Express VPN is  Based in the British Virgin Islands  No data retention laws. No activity logs. No connection logs. You are  Private express VPN comm slash twig get an extra three months when you sign up for a year

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is a good price I just looked at look at the regular price and that's a much better price

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and honestly I see all the time. In fact, we had I don't want to speak out of school  We had a VPN advertiser before that offered a very inexpensive lifetime subscription and we dumped them  I didn't want to do their ads  Because I know what that means  The only way that that makes a financial sense is expensive to run these servers  The only way that makes financial sense is if they're doing something else there up to some other way to make money on you  right  Express VPN

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So can I go to one of my favorite things of the week? Yes is Facebook's political ad archive, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You knew this would be a rat hole. Let's get let's get into it man. Well, cuz it's it's it's actually fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where is it online? Is it on Facebook? So yeah, if you go it's it's it's it's in the Facebook rundown  The link there and so the first that link I put up is a sample search

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the Elizabeth Warrens campaign. Okay, right. So I don't know if it's gonna matter  because a it says Facebook's advertising tools might not work as expected when an ad blockers enabled and B  I don't have a Facebook account, but let's see. Oh, yes, it does seem to work

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So these are so this is Elizabeth. These are the actual ads. Yeah, and and you can see ad performance  So pick up click on this button. So this search is gonna be who bought the ad or this is whatever  Anything that mentions Elizabeth Warren so I I also did a search on wall

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So and it does say by the way, which is great in the archive who paid for the ad who paid for it when it started

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then if you click on performance  Okay, the bottom one of those you'll see and inevitably it's a small each one. They're doing a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  less

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then you see who?  Demographically male female at age got it and then you scroll down you see location

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So she was buying women in California in California, right? Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's one of many advice. So there were Trump ads if you just search on Trump, okay  There's time. It's it's also really telling the volume  Earlier this afternoon. I looked on Trump and I saw his ads for after his speech last night  I had to scroll like 25 pages to get to them today  Later on a few hours later because there's so many ads mentioned Trump now these are some of these are

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pro and positive. Yeah, but it's interesting who's paying for these  So do we know for instance it doesn't say this is a Russian like every town for gun safety does it say do we know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's say who that is, right? But they have a page and you can go to that page. Okay, and see what's what so I found it  For journalists, it's gonna be really interesting to see what messages are out there and  You know who's pitching once I looked at Elizabeth Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez  Ads about her ads about guns ads about the wall

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And all of these are like less than a hundred dollars. They're very expensive. They're very very small because they're tested

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and highly charged if you think back to even the Russian troll factory  The Internet Research Agency didn't spend a huge amount of money. I mean some of those campaigns were tiny

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this is why I hate to say it. This is why I feel threatened by Facebook and every ad based  Content provider should feel threatened from an advertisers point of view. This is gold  Yeah, I can target so precisely. Yeah, and there's other targeting here

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, we don't see that. I wish we we saw like what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like we don't see what the by it's the name of the by I'd like to see because when you do an ad by  You're picking as interest group, right? Yeah, I would like to see what the actual parameters of the ad by that's what I'm saying. Yes. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and and if you look at the at the at the  The news this week about about polling data being shared with the Russians  What's interesting about that is if you could compare the polling data in certain states with what was bought by Cambridge Analytica  Right, then you start to see whether collusion really exists and you know that Mueller has this  But even even that story aside much  This is if you look at something like wall and you start to see what are the messages that people are buying  To try to get across  their view  And by the way, it's both sides. I guess it's both sides  Yeah, and so you see money against money. You also see people exploiting this issue for their own purposes  You see media doing it you see politicians doing it you see interest groups doing it and this is  You couldn't get this kind of transparency before you could this what you and others have been asking Facebook to do  This is what the world asked them to do. This is what they had to do  This is the true transparency they had to have is this GDP are driven. No, no, no, no  This is this is American election driven. Yeah, I like whatever this group is American AF

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm  American AF

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Washington a flak jacket I know Franklin carried a sniper rifle, but maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Could be he was American AF that's hysterical

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they're selling a t-shirt that says if you build it, they won't come and it remarkably slender

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Donald Trump yeah, that's good. It was all a result of the congressional hearings about the Russian troll factory

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, this is the this is the the poster that Trump had on the desk  They're on the table during the cabinet meeting right the wall is coming the playing off the meme the  The game of thrums me. Wow, this is really interesting. It really is interesting and and it's great

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I went into a rabbit hole like crazy for a while. So here's Adam Schiff. Yeah  Congress

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How do you think you see it's all hundred dollar box? They're so they're so efficient though exactly is buying these older demographics

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, entirely in California. Well, we can't get it is they're doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A B's on other interests and other things. I would love to see that but good good on Facebook for making this available

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I just I just it's it's I mean sure Matthew  I thought of you as I was playing with this I can imagine the stories that you're gonna get out of this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a very useful tool and now  It sounds like they're gonna exclude news stories from it at least eventually that was the controversy and there's no there's some media

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's here is that if it had a political  Content then Facebook was saying you had to register as a political advertiser and you had to have your ad here  the New York Times scream bloody murder, but  III  Facebook just handled it badly because what Facebook should have said at the beginning is we're gonna go for transparency and advertising starting with  All that's in a political content that includes everything and what can you object to New York Times?  You should be doing this instead the New York Times said well, you're trying to make us register as a political actor  We reject to that a or B. You're not taking our ad because we wouldn't do this. So they handle it horribly  Jesus somebody paid for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are they what about how well did it do sponsored by scammers on  Fantastic. I searched for twit. This is all I found

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Stephen Miller and that gun loving attention twit are the same person who to thunk and it's Stephen Miller's face in a  some girls

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is why Jeff you're teaching  It was aimed at men  Really men and unknown and mostly in Texas, Florida and New York  Those are big population states, you know, that's and gun loving and gun loving as well. So this is why Jeff you teach  data mining to journalists  Yeah, yeah data is very important and the ability this would be a lot of work  But presumably there's a methodology you could use to go through stuff like this and make some sense out of it and get a story

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if there's an API for this  I'm gonna ask people. I know I doubt it. What you see is you see  30 different ads that are basically the same  Yeah, you want to be able to compile that into one and get some sense of what the total reach was

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is the raw. This is the raw raw data and the reach numbers are all in small ranges

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's a limited use when we get to the other story  I really want to talk about which is the the kids are all right story  if you tie  this to that  One thing that researchers don't know is what are you what are people seeing in their feeds?  What's influencing them in that way and  This starts to get to answer that a little bit this starts to say what are old people seen

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So your medium article  Basically talked about a research study from NYU and Princeton  Just just today

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Andrew guess Jonathan Nagler Joshua Tucker I knew this about this from Josh  So they they explained a little bit first they used a couple of  Lists of fake news domains one from Craig Silverman of BuzzFeed who we all love plus another one and then they asked  Who's sharing that on Facebook and the way they did this they went to you gov and they asked people some questions  What's your political? How old are you? What's your political bent and so on then they said are you they very transparently?  So are you willing to install an app that will let us?  See what you're sharing  on Facebook  and and  Half the 3,500 people they went to said yes  So they got a body of people and they saw what are they sharing the and the caveat here is obvious  There's a limited body of fake news. So there's other fake news. They weren't looking at but

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Selecting a group of people because they're on you gov to begin with right, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's all kinds of copyouts like that and the first to install we agree to do it all that all that  but  What came out of this  Is is fascinating?  I think is really an important first step of research because what it said was number one that  Very little again. These were the domains that Craig Silverman said were the most shared. These were the big ones, right?  Okay, these are the ones that he said were most seen somewhat somewhat overpowering those other factors  So only eighty eight point two percent of people shared any of it  And so sharing was not big more than 90% people did not share it. But here's the key point  The sharing was done by old people people at 65 plus shared seven times more than people 18 to 29  Which is to say stealing a joke from Josh Tucker. The kids are all right. Grandpa's the problem. Yeah  this age factor stood  Irregardless of  Education party affiliation ideology sex race or income they say they factored for that and still age was the key  factor here  Yes, conservatives ultra conservatives and independents shared more the Democrats though  They the researchers say at this time most of the content known as fake was pro Trump. So that's somewhat self-selecting  And finally they found that people who share the most on Facebook were the least likely to share crap  So there's all these things that we think  Everybody's sharing this stuff everybody's seeing this stuff  The kids are screwing up the world and people who share a lot of stuff are messing up  No, people who share a lot do know the difference between fact and not and choosing not to share this stuff  No, the kids are okay. It's old people  So a lot of this talk we have about how we need news literacy for young people because they're messing up  Nah, we need this grandpa

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should also cross correlate this with who votes because grandpa  And grandma vote a hell of a lot more than yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you start to now you know you take this with the with the Facebook  thing we just saw and  Say one thing I want to see is I want to see also what's their media consumption?  Who's watching Fox News who's listening to talk radio who has a Sinclair station near them?  If it's conservatives, you know, does that have an impact?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know that this is that surprising after all nationalism is essentially nostalgia  And it makes sense it would be appealed to older people  That younger people who are gonna be around longer might be more concerned about global issues than national issues

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely. No, that's not the narrative in media. The narrative media has been  Young people are messing up the world. Yes, people who share so much on Facebook are messed up the world. Not the case

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, in fact, I think all right Matthew here  I I think young people we got to get young people to vote and that'll solve a lot of problems

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff have you seen Yo-Kai Bankler's book that were propaganda behind me I haven't read it yet  Obviously like he's extremely knowledgeable and so are his co-authors  but an interesting part of what he's looking at the issue of whether  Facebook helped swing the election and one of the  Is that is that old people?  Swung the election and old people aren't on Facebook. Yeah  You'd be better off blaming Fox News than you would Facebook. I think so too. Yes, thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a earlier book the wealth of the networks. I've read and is really really really good. Yeah, he's a dance

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, he's been studying this stuff, you know longer than most of us have known

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And and my colleague Kerry Brown interviewed him there. Unfortunately, there's not a tape  But but yeah, he's just amazing. So I think I think that my only point is that there's a lot of  Provocative presumptions in media about the state of things and we need research and we need data because the interventions are often the wrong  Interventions the wrong presumptions and and and it's not just the blatherings in media  It's also going to go to regulation and what's done there. We got to have research like this and fund more research like this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it does it does as much as I hate to say Mark Zuckerberg was right when his first response was  Yeah, you know fake news is a tiny tiny proportion of what happens on Facebook and so it's hard to believe it had any impact  More and more research comes out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Suggests that he might actually have been right about that. Yeah. Yeah, it just in a PR sense. It wasn't wise to say so  So, thank you those are my two favorite stories the week I wanted to get that because I think they're really fascinating how they interlock

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding network propaganda manipulation disinformation and  radicalization in American politics Yochai Benkler from Oxford University Press what he does which is great is he makes everything creative Commons  You can download it free if you don't let it up for free. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I Yochai however, I bought your book. Yes friends buy friends books. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, especially when friends agree  Yeah, it's especially helpful in the friends agree so  Gosh, this seems like such a minor thing  Angela Merkel the  Prime Minister of Germany and many other German politicians were hacked massive data dump  Released of all sorts of stuff emails chat transcripts photos and phone numbers, you know, this story broke last week  I haven't seen a lot of embarrassing stuff was there embarrassing information

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the German media has been so cautious about  Unlike unlike the desk to emails  They immediately went into worry mode and Germany just went through a huge journalistic scandal  I wrote about a few weeks ago of Spiegel of making up stories. And so they're very much in that navel gazing  mode right now and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They have some pretty stringent  Laws around that's reporting private information as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the other thing they did very quickly the BKA Germans Germany's investigative police force arrested  Somebody they say was responsible for this leak all by himself a 20 year old. He's actually confessed  And he says I was acting alone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Notably the only party that he didn't get affected by this was the I've day the far-right party

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Interesting  And you'll notice that if you look at it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, most of what he did was guess passwords and or use social engineering  So the issue is more really info set up sec one one, two, three four passwords will get you a lot of information

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Will they never learn well, what was podesta's password wasn't it password or was that a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was something bad. I think it was something I'll have to no no no  Problems podesta got fished it was fished. That's right. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we said this many times if you are the target  Particularly if you're a target of a nation state, it's I know you have to have extremely good operational security  It's I mean, yeah, you have  You have no chance because there's all sorts of ways they can get your password doesn't have to be one and social engineering is way

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  More powerful right then just press or something to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Steve in absentia  the  Google Google puts out its its security dongle thing. Yeah, right  Yeah, thank you. What is again Matthew? Well one of you be key. Google's is not  Google's is their version of the Yubi key. Yeah, and so how does and they say that that has an impact on stopping fishing?  How does that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's basically two-factor  so  The reason it would help with fishing is I can get you to enter in your credentials with a fish without this  But what I won't get is this dongle and write this one-time password refreshes every 30 seconds  So unless the fishing attack is very timely  Yeah, nothing you get from it will help you steal that account and this is going to be harder and harder

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's going to be harder to convince people  Hey, you should type in the code from your little key like as soon as you ask for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's gonna be obvious right what you're trying to do. I think we're getting we're gonna we're gonna get pretty good at this stuff  Yeah, and certainly the people who want to can the disadvantage of using two-factor  Well, I use two-factor with Google and everybody should and with everything you can use and if if you're willing to use a key  You like the Yuba key or that? I'm not sure I'd use the Titan but I  Love Yubico and their Yuba keys are great. I carry one with me at all times and  That's a pretty good protection because  Somebody would it's not a phone. They was it's not a text message. They would physically have to get this key from me  When I put this in a USB slot and press the button it generates that one-time code

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a pretty secure and I was just actually reading about how easy it is to get access to  The texts even if you don't have access to the person's phone, right you can basically spoof  Messages and effectively get the text with the two-factor. So there are two factors useless to you now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not a USB C though. Is it they know you can just put an adapter on that if you want and the time is it?  Google sells does both Bluetooth actually, I think they do a double key  They do a Bluetooth one and they do a USB one and that's because iPhones don't have a way to do a USB thing or NFC  This so they have to use something that that does Bluetooth  But that's fine and Google has a little Bluetooth authentication app and all that stuff it the problem is inconvenient  You know, you can't lose this  It's it also eliminates if you use the strong authentication that Google has available the advanced protection  Then there's other things you can't do  So advanced protection was too difficult. So what happens if you do lose that?  If you're not using advanced protection, you can recover it using a phone number something like that. That's an important point by the way  Whatever the fallback method is that's the weakest link  Yeah, so if you have a bank that says oh use a Yuba key or if you lose your Yuba key  You can we can ask for an SMS message. That's what hackers are gonna use. So that's as insecure as SMS  So that's important to understand that as well. This is these are complicated things

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I think we're getting better at understanding them and I do think banks have gotten better at least I've noticed Canadian banks have with  Security questions, so it's no longer mother's maiden name. It's things like who was your favorite superhero?  You know, what was your?  First name, some of them are but they're better than they used to be. Yeah better than they used out. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I  Yeah, I use something I use strong encryption technologies I use GPG and  You know the Yuba key and stuff like that  You can get by the way somebody saying and it's true you can get you can have multiple Yuba keys registered with your two-factor  Hmm in most cases, so if you lose us you can keep one hidden somewhere in a vault. Yeah, so I've won at home  It's like away. Yeah  I use keybase. I want to I should give them a plug. Maybe I do too. Do you I really love these guys  More I'm using keybase for a lot of things. I  This is a free service, which is pretty what you use it for I signed up but everything so  What you do what I would recommend doing is generate a PGP key  Locally don't that you can have them do it, but it's not as good do it locally  Don't give them the public the private key keep the private key to yourself  That's always the thing you must keep secure  In fact, you can put it on a Yuba key if you want if you really want to make it secure  But do give them the private key that way I can follow Matthew Matthew can follow me and when I want to send a message  To Matthew encrypted I can do that  But there's other things they offer git so I use their encrypted kit to store all my keys  But also my taxes things I want to keep private  They also have a file system  There's an encrypted file system and that's kind of wild if I go to Leo Laporte  keybase  dot pub  You'll get a file. This is actually what appears in my email  Signature that can't be changed by anybody but me you'd have to have my private key to modify this and this has all of it  This is basically a proof of who I am what I do  These all these sites the phone number everything those are mine  Certified by me and keybase and so that's a nice feature. I use this as my email signature now because it can't be modified  I can go on and on keybase is is a really good way to use PGP  They have chat as well slack style  Chat I use that  So you and I could have encrypted chat as good as signal  It's the same quality of chat

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See I signed up I signed up a long time ago when I thought it was just you know authentication that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but I didn't realize I had all this other added so many they have a file system encrypted file system now  So they have  this encrypted chat  they have a believe it or not, they have a  Crypto currency as well that they're supporting called lumens. I'm not sure what that's right  Yeah, I'm not sure what that's involved with and then and then so let me what is your  What is your keybase?  let me search for all the Matthews with one T and  I can follow you and then that way if you the best thing about that there it is Matthew  I the best thing about that. I already am following you is  There you go change your key as I do, you know once in a while  It will check you can change it here  So I'll always have the latest if I'm messaging with you and you change your key  It will tell me his key is changed. You might want to verify that he did that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You also see the bio info. Yeah, you should

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would keep this I use this like crazy. I really think this and it's free the guys who did this  I think made money on another startup. I'm trying to remember their because free services always make me nervous as they should  But they're they're pretty amazing they've really done  Some incredible those messages in the chat are also exploding you can have exploding messages  Nice, so after you set the timer  So after 30 seconds or a minute or an hour like mission impossible the message self-destructs  Yeah, they have teams they have chat  It's really they've raised money. So they must have some way of I think of monetizing it's fascinating  but yeah right now it's completely free and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you um, maybe this is going off topic, but oh we can't do that. Oh  What I wrote about  the Internet Archive  Making an appeal to get Brazilian content  It's interesting that  obviously they back up all kinds of things on the Internet Archive and they do it routinely but  I think it's his name reached out specifically to people saying look if you have  Brazilian content that you think might go away  Because there's a new president worried about Bolsonaro. Yeah, they're worried about censorship and and it was just fascinating  So they're doing a special run kind of to back up things in case they disappear  You know news sites information about the country and so on but  It just reminded me of how much  the archive does and  also of how  So Jason I think runs something called the archive team and mostly volunteers  I believe and you can actually install a virtual machine  that will use your  spare cycles and  Web browser to help the archive. Oh, I'm gonna do that right now, bro

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's awesome went up and it was really easy and it doesn't use a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not you're not gonna notice. I don't think  And then it I mentioned how civil the the blockchain powered  Journalism platform one of their sort of pitches was that the blockchain makes  Archiving permanent archiving  Archiving permanent archiving of content right easier because it effectively goes to everyone who participates in the blockchain

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, although you really wouldn't want to store the entire Internet archive on no no no no it doesn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But  Popula so popular is one of the magazines that's based on civil they published the first  Article that was effectively distributed on the black chain or archived on the blockchain  And they also mentioned that this is the rabbit hole. They mentioned that it was  Stored or distributed via the interplanetary file system. Have you heard of that one? Yeah, that rings a bell. Tell me about that  Yes, so IPFS is I just love the name interplanetary file system  They're ambitious assumption is right you want a file system. That's  extremely distributed  That it's open source. No one controls it. It's a little like I guess free net  If you remember that one  There's been sort of similar  Projects, but it's got its it's got a built-in  hashing  Encryption it's a fascinating. I need to do more research, but I thought it was an interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, these guys just you know if you've used the way back machine  I know a lot of our listeners and viewers are familiar with that you you know about  Internet archive they're saving the entire internet and  Boy is this a huge and important thing. I didn't know that I could help so by off  Yeah, I didn't know that either so I'm gonna yeah archive team. I I want to join the archive team man  I got a few computers lying around

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a whole wiki that describes how they do it and you just download a virtual machine and away you go  Nice I will do that. I should have saved that for my thing at the end. Oh damn

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we both just gave away our things  All right, there's always more. I still have my numbers. Are you ready for free samples from Amazon? Yeah, please  That's really interesting  so  apparently  Amazon wants to use this according to Axios. Let me actually quote the Axios story  Amazon wants to use what it knows about what you like what you want to buy to send you  Free samples from brands like Maybelline  How about Folgers coffee see then if they send me Folgers coffee? They're making it  They don't know as much about me as they yeah, please don't do that. Please don't I'll take some Maybelline, but no Folgers coffee  This is really interesting free samples are an age-old form of marketing  You know  You can't go into a big-box store like a Costco or a Sam's Club without being  Having food and other things pressed upon you when I was in advance

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We invested in the company years ago that would did nothing but this but it was a little too early  But if I know one piece of data about you and I send you the free sample, it's a great hook

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely, and that's something Amazon says Google and Facebook can't match  They don't really have your address  They don't have your physical address oh  That problem right? Well, maybe they do. Yeah  That's a point. That's a point. Yeah, I mean Amazon's always I'm getting boxes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Every day so yeah box if Google said, you know, here's ten free things  All you have to do is give me your address. You're gonna give it your dress true

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  true  Apparently customers have already acknowledged getting samples of project products from major brands  mask mascara from L'Oreal's Maybelline brand and Folgers coffee  Amazon said one Twitter user sent me a random coffee sample  Is it because I've liked 15 different types of coffee in my cart?  Yeah, maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They should do I would think are they saying a separate order? They should be putting this in with your order. So you have a  Easter egg with your orders you have more reasons to want to order because you get something free with it  It's a little a little delight

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I used to always order my audio gear from Sweetwater because they throw a few candy pieces in the box

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, just like the president like the president brings candy to meetings. Yeah, it's nothing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I gave you candy. I wonder what kind of candy he brought though  I do too. I really wonder was it seas  Warren Buffett's candy. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was it cosmic candy with a little mix you give a little buzz? Maybe was it made in China?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Flavored good and plenty thanks to the decline of  Apple  Amazon is now the most valuable US company first time ever at  At seven hundred ninety seven billion dollars not a trillion dollar company  Nobody is a trillion anymore. Apple's about 700 some billion. So Amazon Microsoft  It was his number two with seven eighty five, but Amazon passed it on Monday and Bezos is about to lose half of that  He's gonna give it to his wife  I thought that was by the way that tweet from Jeff and we I wasn't gonna do the story because I didn't think it was  You know, I mean, it's not I think what's interesting is how he did it. Yeah, I thought the tweet was really  Kind of sweet. Yeah  And he did it the way people used to do tweets way before there was 250 characters  You take a picture of text  And tweet it  Maybe he hadn't gotten the memo that there's enough room to type that now  he announced his  Divorce from his wife of 25 years, but it sounds like they're friends  He said if we'd known we would separate after 25 years we'd do it all again  Though the labels might be different we remain a family and we remain cherished friends

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought that was really sweet. Yeah, I was he knew if he knew he had to give up 70 billion dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you do that again? Well, you know, I I like gossip. So I read all the stories and yeah  It was right they met when he was at Shaw. Yeah before he even started before he she drove  Him across country. They drove across country together  While he's typing the business plan for Amazon. She's driving to Seattle. She worked in the warehouse. She did fulfillment  She worked shows. Yeah, she better get half of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She better get half of it and she will and she's I think almost certainly will

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it but it does point out that that it's neither of their interests for him to have to liquidate to pay  Her

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Together he has what is something like 16% of Amazon stock  But he is only allowed to liquidate a billion dollars a year liquidated a billion dollars a year

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's in there both their interest to build wealth. Yeah this way so and to end of vote together and so on so it's  Presuming they act like grown-ups. It shouldn't affect the company in full disclosure as I have some Amazon stock

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sure, I do too. I probably do but it's not I never bought it  It's in a I have all of them all of the stocks in the S&P 500  so those are all my investments are index funds and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  big baskets, so it is by by by  Millions of miles the best performing single stock I've ever  Was on is yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know it kills me because I look and I watch and I think oh I wish I could buy some Google or Apple or  Amazon then  Then you know things happen and I go cut I'm sure glad I don't have any Apple stock

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it you know I don't know so Kramer says I have this in the  Rundown that there's time to buy all the fang stocks if he doesn't think Netflix

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But he thinks that they're all undervalued. No. Well. This is I don't want to make those calculations  I don't want to have to do market timing. That's why I invest in the strength of the United States economy

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's that famous phrase I'm not interested in a return on my money I'm interested in a return of my money

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or as I said about my timing stock after I got it my f you money said f you to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hmm  Oh, man, there's so many other stories you want to do the right to be forgotten

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's fairly minor  But it's just that it now reaches the France's effort to say you can't just erase stuff in France  You have to go worldwide which Google's fighting. I'm glad they're fighting it now reaches Europe's highest court  So we'll see where this goes. Wow. Yeah, that's a ridiculous requirement  Even Canada's been Canada my friend is I know I know I know not that you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I mean the whole right to be forgotten thing is broken and it's terrible it's survived

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's bad enough all by itself  But to implement it in a way or to require everyone to remove it because your country decided  It's just hello Russia  You said it you said it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but when I when I say this in Europe I get they go they jumped on my throat  They think you're right to be forgotten as a raging success

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The I mean the way they look at personal information is very different

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google made a 60 million dollar acquisition. That's you know, Larry pages cigarette money  they bought an  Expert community and answer engine called super pod the speculation according to search engine land is it's an acquirer  They just want the  Founder would imagine you're a Google assistant  Although somebody was saying when is Google gonna buy or maybe Microsoft actually it'd be better by Microsoft to buy a stack exchange  Which is I mean Microsoft's snapping up they got a new hub  They're kind of trying to be the open platform, you know corporate advocate stack exchange would be a very good way to reach out to developers  I wonder if that's on there on their shopping list  I don't care about system-wide dark mode and Android Q. Do you know I hate shark mode. I just lies darling. I turn it off immediately

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I won't do the story then so there's feelings about dark mode so there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So alright here's one

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know yes, I know what you want to do, but oh really okay. Yeah, cuz it's actually interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it the vibrator one? Yeah, so CBS gave it an award to a  AI powered smart vibrator and  Then withdrew the award saying it was a moral obscene and decent or profane under its rules, which is  Sexist as hell. So now they're getting proper hell because they're because it's a female

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Orgasm well, wait a minute. I mean, is there a male orgasm machine that they did give the award to  Well, but they're basically no no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There well, they say because for women it's um, they're being what was yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You were in CBS in the old days and see yes in the old days. You went to one whole hall. And what was it?  It was nothing  Well, but CES is roots are masturbation come on

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is not a show title no matter what you say chat room

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If we know I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Masturbation then you could you could you could you could I think properly say that CES  Realized that having because what it was is, you know  It was the rise of the VHS and recorders all of a sudden a lot of the videotapes being sold were adult  So they at first they were getting all these people booths with adult videotapes  They put them off in a show and eventually not not much longer after that  They said get out of here go do your own thing and then for a while it was it was held at the same time  Is CES but not related to CES?  And was it the AVN adult video network expo or something and now it's I think even at a different time  I think you could say they pushed them out  So that's this is more of the same they know they don't want CES to become

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Adult expo, I know this wasn't this was this was done in partnership with the University of was the University of Oregon. Oh  So here's an update  Kind of interesting an update as of oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yesterday at 3 p.m  A spokesperson for CES told motherboard the product does not fit into any of our existing product categories  It should not have been accepted for the Innovation Awards program  CTA has communicated this position to Lori de Carlo. We have apologized to the company for our mistake  So now they're saying it's not a moral just doesn't fit

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Meanwhile CES has a talking toilet

Transcript:  Swear we saw this last year, but this was a different company. Is that why I mean I did I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's different smart toilets every year every year. I finally got the total to work. Oh good. I like it hotel

Transcript:  Restrooms  Really? I've been in Google restrooms where there is totos. I think that's very civilized

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It used it is just find it. I've always found it fascinating and maybe this is a rabbit hole  We don't want to go down, but I have always found a fascinating  visiting Europe how  the days are just totally taken for granted and  Everybody thinks it's weird not to have one and in North America  It's it's so unusual that if you even mention it  People just think you know, it's such a bizarre kind of yeah, you know, it's my mother's family's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Had some narrative well relatives who went to live in Europe for like a year  They came back all European with like berets and accents and in in Lewistown, Illinois little Lewistown, Illinois  They in their house. They installed a bidet and the entire town was

Transcript:  Analyzed sure. Yes, where did they get it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Brought it back to the ship. I don't know the days now everywhere. Yeah, but in the old days like you literally nobody  In the rest of the world we are considered filthy Americans for our yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, then we also have to provide I'm gonna get through this we also have to provide automated dog toilet  I think that's a good idea was that a great idea. Yes. Oh, yeah. Yes. Yeah. Well, we have an automated cat

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just once it makes a mistake and the cat is traumatized and never takes a pee again

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does it wrap it up in a baggie and likely that sort of know it? Yeah, okay kind of sorta  Did your cat have any problems adjusting to it? No, no now Lisa wants to toilet train the kitties

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think that's inconsistent with the total

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Big it wasn't automated but we got a big  cat litter pan with a  With a roof on it and all sorts of features and the cat would not go anywhere near it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah cats are funny that way. Yeah  No interest in yeah, but I think if we can't get squirted once by the toilet. It's not good. Yeah  Yeah, not going back. So  on October 10th  the come

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here comes Lisa. I don't know if I'm in trouble or not

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  CES rewrote this award on October 10th. The company got a congratulatory. Hi  She's just watching she says  Email  Hi back a  Congratulatory email from CES naming it an honoree in the robotics my my our CEO ladies and gentlemen  Lisa LaPorte no

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Take about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right now she doesn't want to be related to you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The they were an honoree in the robotics and drone category and that's actually not so far-fetched because  It was developed  With using eight technology and robotics partnerships in partnership with the Oregon State University product development lab  This is the OSEA personal massager formerly called Vella. Oh, I have a Vella. I  Didn't realize this was the same it looked the same  Well, I have to review everything sure  On October 31st CTA emailed this is two weeks later three weeks later  Emailed Laura de Carlos team to inform them the association was revoking the award  Saying it was immoral obscene and decent profaner not keeping him with CTA's image and thus disqualified  She Laura Hattick the company's founder  Said this is an obvious double standard when it comes to sexuality and sexual health while there are sex and sexual health products at CES  It seems that CES  Applies the rules differently for companies and products based on the gender of their customers is what you were talking about Jeff  This is the issue men's sexuality is allowed to be explicit  With with well there's for instance a literal sex robot in the shape of an unrealistically proportioned woman  And VR porn in point of pride along the aisle female sexuality on the other hand is heavily muted if not outright  Banned she has a point  See now see backing off saying oh wasn't that it was immoral, but it didn't fit the category which is worse  Yeah, that's not what they said. It's in writing that they said it was immoral. So I was not raising this to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pure prurient prurient. No, not at all. Yeah, I think there was there was an interesting issue here  There was an interesting issue here meanwhile, there's the self-driving suitcases  If anybody gets near me one of those and at newark airport i'm kicking it useful

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you not feel that what we are seeing from CES is exactly what we've seen in years past that there is nothing. Yes  Absolute. This is just there. I know we saw that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Suitcase last year. Oh, yeah and the year before

There's hundreds of thousands of companies  Of the bigger companies there's hundreds of thousands of booths at CES. There's there's a hundred at this event  But they feed you  And almost all the coverage comes from these  mini  Expos and that's what this is  Just a few weird tech products. We saw at CES in 2019 at showstoppers or pepcom whichever it is  They are weird  This is  This is that toilet  Um  Actually, this is from I don't i'm confused this has branding all over it from the late show  And oh, I hear colbert talking about it. I get it the  echo-powered toilet  Now he's on the show floor, I think now he's wandering the halls  This is just still in a hotel there. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't know is it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think so, you don't get in the way. You don't want a suitcase that follows you around

Transcript:  No, because i'm trying to get around that guy. I'm trying that guy's pissing me off at newark

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then you come to the stairs or the escalator and then it's just there are showcases

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Man, maybe i'm confusing with this with the one that you could ride around the airport. Oh, yeah, i've seen that one  That one got banned in airports people didn't know. Yeah people  People apparently didn't want you riding around in the airport at 13 miles an hour on your

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bunch of airlines banned the ones that have phone chargers in them. Well, yeah, no you can't in fact

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is very frustrating. In fact, one of our sponsors some some time ago away  Remember made bags that had batteries in them and they're great. I love my away bag, but you can't check it  Yeah, yeah, you can only either be caring. So now all of these new battery bags have removable batteries  Which if you ask me is no different  Than just having a battery. Yeah. Yeah  Yeah, it's again take it out my suitcase and put it in my backpack, which was where it was going to be anyway. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  plus by the way for my my you know now old-fashioned pixel 2x  Um, I never carry chargers anymore. It keeps it. It's i'm fine. I'm good. Finally  First don't play you don't play pokemon go

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  True I do not

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I uh, I uh actually have now invested in we have a  A beautiful charging station built for me by the wood whisperer. It's loaded with portable battery packs  So that we can just grab and go grab one grab and go play pokemon go  I uh, I paid on kickstarter  I think it was two years ago and it arrived two days ago and I was like, what is this?  What is this? It probably happens to you a lot a lot  Uh, it says when you pledge that it will arrive november 2017. I think they missed that date  But I did just get it. This is samsara the world's first aluminum smart suitcase among  Among its many I did buy it and I do have it now  Uh, no, yeah among its many uh features  Are the fact that it's got amazing creation begins with the clash. Oh my god. It just goes it's got a battery in it  It's got a battery in it  And you feel so embarrassed and the battery powers leds  Uh, so that when you if oh, this is the other feature  It's got a flat top so you could put your laptop on it at the airport and it's just like a desk

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is aluminum. They as they say the same material that airplanes are made out of  Um, and it has an app  It's the first luggage i've ever used that has an app  And the app's chief purpose seems to be to let you know if somebody steals your suitcase

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right to track it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It doesn't track it exactly  It's a separation monitor because once they got it and it has a power bank, but you have to take it out  And it looks exactly like the ones I bought  So, I don't know what the advantages of it. Anyway, I did I feel like I didn't miss anything at ces  It feels like it's just more of the same  Are we in just an amazing?  plateau

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think in a way we are

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the things that are going to get delivered are going to get delivered by things like voice

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, here's some pretty good news  An autonomous robot was just killed by self-driving tesla

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just gonna mention that i'm sure that was an accident, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, it was in vegas, uh sunday night at ces a number of engineers  Were moving these robots to a display booth getting ready for ces  It was a v4 model from promo bot  These are uh, basically rentable for two thousand dollars a day to get people to come to your booth  Uh after sunday's collision the firm revealed one of their creations had been killed  As the robots made their way to the booth around 7 pm  It's straight out of line and into the parking lot roadway where it was struck by a model s tesla  The car was in autonomous mode

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the model s people could hear it screaming the war of the robots begins there can be only one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh the insanity  I just that's too perfect

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the problem. It's too perfect

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Luckily your autonomous toilet can't go out in the road and get hit by a car. So you're probably safe

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we've had in the past  Um  Those spit test dna companies we had 23 and me and most recently we had helix  um  There has been a kerfuffle a big news story and I don't know if I this worries me at all  But i'm going to run it by you guys 23 and me just did a deal  300 million dollar deal with glac glaxo smith kline. Yeah  They took a big stake. They bought a bunch a chunk of it. Yeah  The concern people have is that in fact  Glaxo smith kline admits it that they will use the genetic data in 23 me's database to look for new drugs to develop  That's why it's worth 300 million dollars to them. That makes total sense to me  It will also use the genetic data to inform how patients are selected for clinical trials  To me, uh, as long as the data is anonymous

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, who cares? You know what I go in and I answer every single question the 23 and me asked me me too  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really important data think about all the stuff you could learn about  You know lesser known diseases or genetic  Difficulties, how are you going to do research into that if you don't have the data?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You do sign. I know I didn't notice this when I and I did 23 and me years ago. I did helix more recently  Uh, you do sign a thing called bio banking consent  That tells 23 and me that they can keep your spit  For uh up to 10 years

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a fun warehouse

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So do you consent  To them owning the rights to whatever they develop. Well, I should have read it more carefully you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ask them to delete your spit  But yes, there was a huge job

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  About  Trying to remember. Um, henry had a lax. Do you remember that story? Yeah the healer

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gene that's a that's a shameful  Story fascinating story yet her genes were used and are still used  Oh, yeah, without her consent permission or even knowledge because she was african-american. There's a standard like those genes are like that's the standard. Yeah  So it's shameful that they abused they kind of used her but at the same time it's been hugely valuable for research  Yes, so I don't you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is I think there's a point at which we say that there is a greater good  And we haven't figured out how to deal with that yet when it comes to data and information  But it's a discussion that we have to have and and and and the reflex response cannot be  Share nothing with anyone

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have to balance helix tosses your spit upon request  But we'll keep the can keep the data forever  I want a video story

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Welcome to the world's largest spit warehouse. Yeah, but thanks

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ancestry which also does this says we do not will not sell dna  Without your explicit consent you have to opt in and you can revoke permission. I think that's the case with all three of these  You know, I I don't know I guess in fact when we do when we do the ads  For both companies people often in the chat room, especially will say I don't know  You know, I don't know if I want to give these guys my dna  Uh, and it's you know, I mean it's true that at least right now it's  for the most part just an amusement because  Although both 23 me and helix are going to do uh, brachia testing which is a breast cancer gene that is  Considered by many to be a strong indicator of a future chance of getting but you only get that if you specifically specifically say  I want you have to buy it. I think in some cases not to mention

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's been at least a couple of cases now. I think where  Police departments have been able to track down  Okay, you know criminal there was a case in california because of their relationships to people in the database a long dead cold case

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They got the guy but it wasn't  This was a weird one. It wasn't they didn't go to 23 and me or helix or anybody  There was there's a genetic forum where people share their genetic information  Intentionally and his relatives had they had a dna sample from some of the murders  and they were able to  Figure out these must be the relatives of the criminal and they were able to catch the guy that way  so yeah, that may be a  Forewarning of something that may be happening down the road in less palatable ways

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I mean there again, you've got a kind of slippery slope problem. It would be good to catch  Killers, it would be good to catch people who are guilty of horrible crimes  but  It would be bad if say  Your insurance company got a hold of some information that they used against you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This seems to be a conversation. We have a lot on this show is you know, these trade-offs

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, stacy were here. She'd have a different view

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah  Um, I don't know. What do you think should I call helix and 23 me and say get rid of my spit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I want you to I want you to convert it into an ink for my fountain pen

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's a very good idea then when I get an autograph i'll be giving a DNA sample  Leo ink my daughter cool idea years ago when my nabby was like eight and  I took her to an autograph signing which she thought was the strangest thing she'd ever seen  lined up to meet her dad into an autograph and take pictures. She said why don't you just give them a vial of your spit?  Now I know she was prescient. She was right. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  um  It was hard filling up that container though. It's it's you gotta get enough spin in it. So you've done it a lot of spit

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, yeah, you're not worried about it  I volunteered for the one where they  They publicly tell and you're hurt. They didn't take you. Yeah the personal genome project. I thought this was a real  There was mit it was a really good idea you pay  At the time was thousands of dollars for the genetic assay and then you answer all their questions and they they said we can't promise  It'll stay private. So we're going to use your name  And I wanted to do that. Esther Dyson did I wanted to do it?  I  But somebody pointed out this is the other side of this  Your dna isn't just yours. My kids have some of my dna. So I had this discussion with esther

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, and I said well esther. I I don't know now i've had prostate cancer  You know everybody's gonna know my son's and she said oh get over it jeff. Everybody gets prostate cancer

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's true. You get old enough if you're if you're a man and if you live long enough to get prostate cancer  You just unfortunately got it young

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Relatively

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But there helix is going to do a poe which is an alzheimer's indica part of the problem is  That these markers  Are not definitive that you will get it. There's a percentage. It's a percentage and it has to do with nature and nurture

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the gene but also environment that expresses it and to be fair. They do do a pretty good job of explaining  Of explaining that they make it very clear. This does not mean you're getting x

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, but that's the other story in the rundown which is interesting was that ai has I think it was google ai  beat  diagnoses of alzheimer's brain scans by six years  It was better than humans at reading the brain scans

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In other words the google ai was able to see that somebody was likely to get alzheimer's  Long before six years before a doctor would have diagnosed it  In fact did diagnose it because they this was a longitudinal study and all timers is notoriously difficult to diagnose

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact the number one test to confirm whether you have alzheimer's was done after death  Right, so they could only confirm it 100 after you die and they look at your brain

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so that's what's really interesting about this right? They they had the samples. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was interesting about this too to me is that?  You can't query  The algorithm and say well, how do you know that?  What what should we look for right? There's there's correlations that it figured out  That become knowledge that it can't express and we don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's we're gonna have to all get used to that. That's uh, that's alpha zero. It's the future of knowledge. Yeah, these ai's don't uh have  Uh expressible rules. We're used to rule-based logic in programming  I'm gonna lose control of of knowledge and even wisdom. I don't have a problem with that and here's  And this again, I gotta give credit 21 lessons for the 21st century yvonne noah horari  He said something I thought really clicked with me. He said we're conflating artificial intelligence  With mind or consciousness  Just because something's artificially intelligent able to detect alzheimer's does not mean it's conscious  It doesn't mean it has mind  and  He says there's no real we don't know but there's no real evidence that  This this path one turns into the other right? We don't know how  How how intelligence becomes mind? We don't know what our mind is  And we don't and it there's no evidence that it's gonna as you get, you know, google assistant gets smarter and smarter  At some point it'll become conscious  That's a that's a different process entirely. I think  So get make ai better. That's okay. They're just gonna be passive machines that are tools that are not gonna understand them  Yes, but that's fine  Yeah  That's fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And by the time it becomes conscious it'll be too late anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're gone

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The deep learning algorithm so this is again one of those cases. This is a study published in radiology. It's ucsf not google  What what's interesting is  The deep learning algorithm achieved 82 percent specificity  At 100 sensitivity predicting patients final diagnosis  after by radiologic readers after death  And on average the algorithm learned  Six years sooner 75.8 months more than six years prior to the diagnosis  And as you say  This is one of those cases where it's trained  Makes its own rules. We don't know what those rules are

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right and they can the more data we give it the better it will be and the better will you know  And of course the problem around is you can't treat alzheimer's but at some point  There will be a friend neighbor of mine  Well, no, look at better example ruth beddermansburg  Right and god bless get better with  But uh, they caught her lung cancer early because she also fell and they took a scan right just chance by chance  It's the chance and if you there are certain things that if you do a friend neighbor of mine has god bless them  Pancreatic cancer we thought okay. Well, that's it because you always hear that's it. But by chance it was diagnosed early

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the key earlier you find out and I think that's true even with alzheimer's that there are treatments and things you can do  I mean you may not stop it, but you can slow it. Yeah  I love this story new statesmen stop scare-mongering  About kids spending time on their phones  We of course are constantly worried surrounded by  As uh as the new statesman writes doom-laden warnings about how smartphones have destroyed a generation  But the evidence is very weak royal college of pediatrics and child health  Issued new stream screen time guidelines  Saying essentially there's no evidence no evidence to support the idea that screen time is directly toxic to health  There is some evidence it can displace other activities like exercise  But the main recommendations now, this is of the uk's royal college of pediatrics and child health  Simply ask yourselves as a family whether your screen time is controlled or whether it gets in the way of doing things you want to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if it does try to control this about right leo and I you and I grew up at the time  Matthew's a little younger, right? I think matthew aren't you?  Yeah, a little bit. Yeah a little bit but but but we grew up in a time when the same discussion was made about television

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was fun  There was also I also mentioned in passing this study  um a psychologist pointed out that  one of the problems with these green time  Studies with most of the research is that relies on self-reporting. Yes, and this one did people are notoriously bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah at estimating their own usage. I think honestly if we if we think about  Our  Experience, but I have teenagers at home. I have adult kids  It's clear that that is a problem that there is an issue and sure  I don't know what the long-term result will be like are they gonna  I'm not actually my adult kids kind of missed out. Uh, abby was born in 92 henry in 94  They kind of missed out but michael's 16 and he's in, you know completely soaking in it  uh, and maybe that's one of the reasons tim swinney the founder of  The developer fortnight made seven  Billion billion dollars this year with a b. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and and I read in actually an interesting in our article. I can't remember where I wish I could but about how fortnight  Is a great game and everything but it's also a social community exactly. That's a secret. It's like second life  It's a place to go and hang out and do stuff. It's not just a game. Have you played I haven't I haven't gotten anywhere near it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, you've played yesterday. Oh, you played both of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah  Uh, it's absolutely about the social it's absolutely about the social which is really interesting. We had a  game  Expert she does consulting for game companies has done it for years  And and she has a map of the four quadrants that every game has to appeal to one of them is social  You know, there also has to be a reward system and and yeah a certain amount of challenge etc  There are you know, these it's actually quite interesting to read a lot of companies  Hire her because she's kind of figured out the psychology of gamifying. Do you remember her name?  Um, you know what john her chart is on the uh, is on the wall, uh over on the left  Uh in my at the back of my office there and we can I i'll get it for you. She's great  It was a good triangulation carston might remember he was the one who booked it  But uh, but anyway, it's a fascinating subject fortnight  I was talking with the other day with a friend a buddy of mine whose kid is a fortnight addict  He says the greatest thing ever because he uses it as a reward system and he can get this kid to do anything  To do anything  He cleaned the house the other day  I think that's illegal. It shouldn't be but the kid gladly and willingly does it says okay you could play for it  So this is the four keys to fun  Her name, uh is nicole  uh, lazaro, I think  um, and her uh company is zio design xeo design  And she actually publishes on on there. So there's hard fun easy fun  Serious fun people fun and the way this is designed they all feed into one another  So with the people fun communicate cooperate compete. It's got to be there and it generates the emotions  She calls, uh amici or friendship amusement  A marrow and admiration. It's really interesting very thoughtful. It's a good triangulation hard fun follow  A game researcher named jane mcgonigal. Oh jane mcgonigal is great. I love her. Yeah  She's amazing. She's talked a lot. I've heard her speak. She's talked a lot about the gamification of everything  In any event fortnight is one of those unicorns one of those once you know, you know in a  Decade things that just kind of got magically got everything right. It's not an original concept  They kind of stole it from a player unknown's battleground pub seven billions  Uh, they but they cartoonized it which they kind of stole from overwatch  They added the social element. It was a little bit of overwatch  They they they don't charge for the game. The game is free  All the money is made on costumes and dance moves  They're being sued by the way by a number of people including what's his name carlton?  from uh  Fresh prince for stealing the carlton. Oh, right. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  oh, I didn't know the guy who  Developed and also created the unreal engine. Yeah. Yeah, swinney's  Um, basically epic games. He found it in his basement his parents. Wow, because the unreal engine is behind everything. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if you think about it in 1998 and 91  He's playing games in his parents basement  You know his mom said what are you gonna do play video games for a living for a living?

To use fake news manipulation in the alabama election is receiving condemnation from the left  Yeah, rightly so  Yes  So it's no it's not it's about what he did not to say who he did it for the fact who he did it for  Bonus points, but and even before that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I spoke to two  Former members of wiki leagues who worked closely with julian assange  and they both said  That they stepped away from the organization because it became all about julian and it was all about his kind of  conspiracy theories and  so they  It stopped being about what they thought it was originally about we were three similar conversations

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, all I know I learned from silicon valley  Someone getting majority control of the token. Oh, I see it turns out that this is something that nobody ever really contemplated  but if if if you could  Control a sufficient number of blocks in a blockchain you could take it over

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could make it yours  And that's what happened with ethereum classic  So coinbase has halted all ethereum classic transactions withdrawals and deposits if you have ethereum classic  I don't know what that means. Is it is the money out of your hands? I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I definitely do fad. I definitely do  I mean, maybe i'm wrong, but I I remember how skeptical  people were about the internet and I remember how skeptical that they were about  lots of technologies that wound up being pretty transformative and I think in the early days you often see  the worst  Sides of something like that. I mean you remember early websites even early social networks. They were garbage  and  Lots of there's so much better now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so much better now. Now they're garbage fires. So you wouldn't know leo. You wouldn't know leo because you're not there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can smell it from here. Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you couldn't you couldn't argue they haven't affected our life. You couldn't argue that they don't they aren't a big right?  You know that they obviously good and bad. It's not that it's going to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree with you. I think that's the case but I but but but boy the cooties are are winning and the cryptocurrencies right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean the part of the problem is also a lot of cryptocurrencies are essentially pyramid schemes  It seems like right. I think the fundamental technology of blockchain is fascinating. Oh, yeah, it is it is it's been

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Theoretically applied to too much  But there there are interesting applications the notion of a decentralized

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  centralized  ledger system  Mm-hmm is I think very powerful and I don't think what I that's now part of the world. That's not going to go away

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cryptocurrencies and especially ico's. Okay. Yeah, so I think that's where you have to distinguish between blockchain, which is the sort of  Technology aspect and crypto currency, which is kind of frothy  You know, yeah  It's like those websites to remember the one where you could buy a tiny ad  And the page was just full of like hundreds and hundreds of tiny tiny ads. Yeah, remember that one  Yeah, I think millions million million points or whatever. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That guy made a lot of money by the way. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's not you know the internet or the web or it's just  a minor  Bubble

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's yeah, it is it's really I think it's very interesting, you know, I  Think as soon as you see people speculating and stuff that then you're gonna start to say well, that's that's not there it is  I mean domain names were the same. That's the what is that called? The million  million dollar home page  Sold out. Oh, yeah, he made a lot of money

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Our show today brought we're gonna get your picks if we can come up with more  Are you but we've used quite a few of them our show today brought to you by this is a great pick digital ocean  Which is a fantastic platform for people who want to do web apps  uh  Learn about web apps too because it's very affordable  Uh lots of businesses about 150 000 businesses rely on digital ocean  for their  Infrastructure used to be in the old days. I remember um  Kevin rose when he started dig. I remember he was so excited because they got a colo which meant a network operation center  He bought his server. They brought it to the physical fenced in cage in the colo  Colocation network operation center installed the software set up dig and that was just one server  And he was so excited and that's what you had to do in those days if you had an idea like kevin did  For I got an idea for brilliant website  That's what you had to do  Then you know by the time we started twit I went to a company in texas and I said I need some servers  They provision them five days later. They get back to you your server is ready now. You can set it up and I mean  This has become friction-free now and this is transformative in my opinion  Digital ocean it's the easiest cloud platform to deploy manage and scale applications with droplets  Those are virtual machines that are a scalable compute platform. You can add storage security monitoring. You know what the best way for me  This is my digital ocean page. Let me create a droplet show you how easy  This is and so affordable too. So i'm going to say create a droplet  Now the the first thing that's going to happen is you can choose distributions ubuntu freebsd fedora debian sent os  You can also choose containers  Which is a great way to do applications, but i'm gonna i'm gonna be really lazy and do the one-click apps  Are you interested in developing on a lamp stack right there?  There's a lamp stack on ubuntu 1804 you want to do python programming. Here's a django framework mysql  Plesk  WordPress docker gitlab. Let's say you want to set up gitlab. All right  Now you choose how much you want to pay the droplets and by the way, it goes all the way down to five dollars a month  Or point zero zero seven dollars. So that's what point seven cents an hour  For that you get a gigabyte  Of throughput you get a cpu 25 gigs of storage. I'm sorry  You get a terabyte of transfer and I guess there's a gigabyte of ram  So i'll choose that and if I need more it's easy to add more you want backups  Yeah, let's enable backups as a buck a month  Uh, i'm gonna choose you choose your data center new york san francisco amsterdam singapore london frankfort toronto  I'm gonna choose san francisco too. I always do I use ssh to log in see they already have my keys  So I don't even have to import that I could choose other features and I can name it. Let's call it leo's  get  and  Create it now  Remember when I said, you know kevin had to go to a co-location install the hardware days later  We are right now provisioning  A entire git lab install that I can use with a public ip address  If I want I can put my stuff on there. I can manage dns  I can secure my droplets I can add storage and this is going to get all set up and provisioned  In the time it takes for me to do this ad  That's digital ocean 99.99 uptime their sla cloud firewalls  Monitoring and alerting so you always know the status  Full dns management. They've got data centers as I said all over the world. These are using enterprise ssds  A very simple api and there you go leo's git. It's at 206 189.71 to 46 is ready to go  I can I can log into it right now on the console  And play with it active you this is incredible  Over 150 000 businesses  Including some of the world's fastest growing startups rely on digital ocean. See it's booting up. Ah, there's my login  I'm running ubuntu 1804  Gits already installed. That is so awesome  do.co slash twit  This  You can see my usage fee in the right is zero because I don't have any droplets like I it's easy to destroy them  I'll let this one run. It's not going to cost me more than five dollars a month and we're going to make it even more affordable  Because you're going to get a free 100 credit when you go to do.co slash twit  That's that could be a whole year  This is great for students if you want to learn a language  And you know if you're using a chromebook like jeff or a tablet you can log in you can use blink on an ipad  Access your digital ocean account and do programming  Run a wordpress blog do anything you want emacs, baby emacs  It's so great. I love it empowering the modern world of mvps  Startups your next unicorn at do.co slash twit for a free hundred dollar credit would have been so much easier for kevin to start  Digging that's what I love about this. This is modern. They have kubernetes now, by the way, if you are interested in containers  Uh docker, of course, it's just super  do.co  slash twit for a hundred dollar  credit at digital ocean  I am legitimately excited about do because  This is the kind of transformative technology that means anybody some kid in mumbai  In high school could create the next big thing  Yep  So so great  Jeff give us a number

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a number. Uh, so I found this interesting because malls are dying. Sears is dying

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's incredible. So sad. So one mall, however has found another life  As what a half million square foot mall plus in west la is now going to be google's la campus. There you go  So I think it's a good use of a mall if we can think we can just put uh,  Uh big old tech companies and big old malls will be fine. It's not the first time it reminds me of
