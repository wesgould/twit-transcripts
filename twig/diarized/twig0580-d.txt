Stacy on IoT, the podcast and the website.  Hello, Stace.  Hello, y'all.  Hello.  Hello.  Also, Aunt Pruitt is here from Hands on Photography and Hands on Wellness.  Hello.  How are you, Aunt Pruitt?  And also with us, the profile of Jeff Jarvis.  Is this my good side?  No, this is definitely a good side.  Buzzmachine.com.  And he's already got a whiteboard that says moral panic.  He's ready for our first story.  Oh, nice.  He's ready for the show.  He's also the director of the townite center for entrepreneurial journalism at the Craig  Newmark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It fixes the damn white balance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does.  You should just use this and now you're not pink.  It's his moral panic white balance at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism  of the City University of New York.  I think the moral panic is prepared for the testimony or not testimony, the report.  Remember when we had testimony from Sundar Pichai of Google and Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff  Bezos, Tim Apple before the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee?  The report is out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Only one side of it.  The Democratic side.  The Democratic side.  They can't do anything.  They thought they had a bipartisan thing going and they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I noticed that the headlines changed.  Initially it said the bipartisan and then it whoops no.  Nope, it's not bipartisan.  And the reason is, well, Washington.  That's all you need to know.  There's a little dispute over what exactly should happen.  The Republicans do not think that the big tech companies should be broken up.  The Democrats do.  The Republicans are more concerned about anti-conservative bias.  That's what happens when you give a report to Jim Jordan to review.  It's a 450 page report.  The House Judiciary's Committee's Democratic leadership said the four big companies, Amazon,  Apple, Facebook and Google, had turned from scrappy startups into quote, the kinds of  monopolies we saw in the era of oil barons and railroad tycoons.  Oh, jeez.  The law...  Oh, jeez.  No comments from the peanut gallery here.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, jeez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's got a big sign that says moral panic.  The lawmakers said the companies had abused their dominant positions, setting and often  dictating prices and rules for commerce, search, advertising, social networking and  publishing.  They also, to amend these inequities, and I'm reading from the New York Times summary,  lawmakers recommended restoring competition by breaking up the companies.  This is the Democratic side of it.  Emboldening the agencies at police market concentration and throwing up hurdles for  the companies to acquire startups.  I would agree with the last one.  We've been a little lax in letting, for instance, Facebook acquire Instagram and WhatsApp.  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hold on right there.  Hold on.  People thought they were nuts.  Instagram had no traffic.  That's true.  They paid a fortune for it.  There's another argument that says, well, they made Instagram Instagram.  They made it work.  They could have died.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When they bought Instagram, no one thought they were nuts for buying Instagram.  They thought they were nuts for paying so much.  It is.  It was a billion bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, there is email, Mark Zuckerberg, saying, we've got to buy Instagram.  They're our biggest threat.  I think even then we knew that's why they were buying it.  I don't think that that's a surprise.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I spent a lot of time last night partially reading the documents because that's me.  Jeff is like, nope, not going to read it.  I did not read all 450 pages.  But I will say that I spent a lot of time last night trying to think of the appropriate  metaphors for this because there's a lot of issues here.  And I would say I think Google is in kind of the worst position because the core of  their underlying economic value is ad business and the ad market.  This does threaten that very directly.  Facebook is having problems with this or will have problems with this report as well because  it does talk about breaking up and splitting apart Instagram and their businesses.  But I think Google has the bigger threat.  I'll be honest.  But with this, I sat there and I was like, maybe it's the everyone's favorite example  about Facebook, the memo that Mark Zuckerberg sent saying or talking about it.  I don't know if Mark Zuckerberg sent it.  The memo that talked about Instagram not going into some businesses.  So it didn't compete with Facebook.  And that particular employee was quoted as saying it was like a monopoly, self-dealing  inside of a company.  And I was like, hmm, is it like a transportation company owning like trains and airplanes  and saying, we're only going to fly our airplanes to these cities and we'll send our trains  to only these cities.  And that kind of limits competition.  Is it more like broadband in the US where you have a really crappy one alternative and  then a really good one in most places?  So and I really struggled with this because this is not physical infrastructure.  And the bottom line is I stayed up a lot thinking about this and I got nowhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So as a result, as a result, by the way, before the show began, she said, I haven't gotten  much sleep and now I know why this is a big mistake to try to understand this.  Stacey, I want to agree with you.  Well, I'm not trying to understand it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm trying to come to a conclusion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, to think of what we could do that's appropriate.  I understand. Go ahead, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I've long said that where where where Google is vulnerable is advertising.  Right. It's not search.  That's absurd. It's not anything else.  But advertising there.  But they're not a monopoly, you know, but nonetheless, they have tremendous power.  And the problem is long.  They are self-dealing that well, well, let me say.  And I've always complained about that, for instance, YouTube results showing up at the  top of search. Well, hold on, hold on.  Let me cut it up two places.  So it is for an independent.  Thank you. For an independent company, Google has the power of God to say, you're just  a click farm or a real company.  And I long ago said they should have had a jury of peers of advertisers who's interested  is to have a good advertising marketplace on Google to deal with that.  And Google should have made all the decisions themselves.  That's point one. I think they screwed that up long since.  To your second point, I'm sorry, but I'm going to disagree here for the 87th time that  every single company on Earth promotes its own properties and  as business, Google does it too.  Yeah. The New York Times does not promote the Washington Post.  ABC does not promote CBS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, but that's so that's the important thing.  And I think you kind of right there, you crystallized it.  And I don't know what the answer is, but search is such an important part without if  you don't show up in a Google search, you practically don't exist.  Hence the right to be forgotten.  It doesn't attack the websites that carry the material.  You don't want to be remembered.  It just says Google, take down the search result.  That's evidence, prima facie evidence that if it's not on Google, it doesn't exist.  That is also bad law.  But we'll leave. I understand.  I shouldn't have brought it into it.  But but but I just I think that it's widely agreed.  I think that that's on the face of it, obvious.  And for that reason, as you say, Google has the power of God.  And I don't think that that power of God should be resided, unfortunately, in a  commercial entity that is then incented to promote its own business interests.  You're right. That's what happens.  That's a normal thing.  But I don't that's the problem is that this is so important.  This this ecumenical search, this unbiased search that it shouldn't be held by a  private company because they're going to be polluting the results with their own  self-interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's not where they're in antitrust danger.  I think Stacey's right where they're an antitrust danger is in the ad business.  It's not on search.  Search is only one way we get to stuff.  There's lots of ways to get to stuff.  But in terms of how an advertiser reaches the audience through programmatic now,  Google has incredible power there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And by the way, by the way, the report talks about that or the is it a report?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a sort of report because we thought it was going to be a bipartisan report and  then the Republicans disagreed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there's like a there's a couple hundred page alternative report out there.  You're aware of that, right?  From the right.  The Republicans.  Yeah.  From which also goes into oh, you're Ken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We tell you to take down hate speech.  Ken, but hate speech you take down.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  So yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this I will just say sorry, Leo.  Just one thing here.  I was so excited reading some of this because it felt like a back to politics as  usual in some ways, like, hey, because there are a lot of points of agreement here.  Right.  That the big tech companies have too much power.  Right.  We were figured there's there's so many points of agreement and then they're like,  OK, let's figure out how to solve this.  And of course, the Republicans are like, we should not actively break up  existing companies were conservatives.  We don't like to do that.  Right.  But then they went off and took their crazy pills again and were like.  Plus, the real issue is bias against, you know, people on the right.  And I was like, for a second there, I thought we were going to have a really  like normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Buck, Buck did say in his and this was a draft that was anyway, the  writers got a hold of it.  Buck did say in this draft, quote, the report offers a chilling look into how  Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook have used their power to control how we see  and understand the world.  Now, maybe he's going to the conservative voices.  But yes, but I don't think anybody disagrees with that.  I do.  You don't think Google has the they have opened up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have opened up far more ways to see the world than old mass media  that I controlled by them.  Yeah, that's fine.  Voices that are more that's up to now is the world.  That's up to now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the fact remains that decision is made that the fact remains.  That decision is made by a group of people in Silicon Valley who have  absolutely no responsibility to anybody.  It's Google's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Neither did media.  Well, media media was an oligopoly.  But wait a minute, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Few players.  Wait a minute, Jeff.  But there's one company that determines whether you exist on the Internet or  not. And it's a privately held company.  You think that's a good thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's better than what we had before, because because that company has  enabled far more voices to occur.  And let's throw in social media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's enabled more, but they have a whole lot of buttons that they can put.  Exactly.  That's so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If at any point Mark does a big difference can versus does show me the evidence  that they've done something actually wrong.  No, they haven't.  But that doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You still don't give the nuclear button to some guy sitting in a tower in Germany  and say, well, he hasn't blown up the world yet.  So it's OK.  It doesn't make any sense to give that much power to Google.  Just because they haven't blown up the world doesn't mean it's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They broke up the power that existed already in these institutions.  And the old institutions hate it.  And that's why they're fighting it.  That's why media fights it.  That's why politics fights it.  Jeff, I don't think you're paying attention to the real criticism here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I get what you're saying.  And there are definitely benefits.  And also, I would submit that there is no obvious solution to the fact that Google dominates  search because I don't understand how you could fix that.  You take it away from Google.  There's just no way to do that.  But I do think it's a big problem that Google has.  And by the way, Facebook too.  If somebody inside Facebook or somebody inside Google decided they, for instance,  wanted to elect one person president of the United States,  they would have an immense amount of power to do that.  Lots of tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This kind of could is really bad policy on Legal Talk.  A lot of things could happen.  But you're going to get indicted and you're going to get tried on the basis of what you  could but never did.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no criminal.  This is not a criminal trial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're going to suffer consequences for things you didn't do, but you could have done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK.  Actually, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you'd be smart to stay away from this if I were.  Yeah, I'm like, I'm going to pull an inch right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Otherwise, can I take a moment?  So this is completely off topic.  But hey, do we ever do that?  So I got Zoom ear.  I messed up my ears with these things.  And so that's why I'm not wearing my usual thing today.  I'm wearing this, but I can't hear anything because of this.  So I feel like I'm shouting more than I actually am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you want to know?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wait, is that an actual diagnosis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Zoom ear?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Zoom ear.  It's a new thing.  It's a new diagnosis.  It's a new thing.  So I just can't hear what's going on.  I'm going to change my headsets and risk pain again because I apologize.  No, no, no, don't do that.  You can hear well enough.  It's fine.  I can't hear what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's got Zoom ear.  So now Zoom is on the top.  I don't know what the answer is if you accept the fact that Facebook and Google both have  huge power and no accountability.  And I don't know what the answer is to that situation.  I'm not assuming or saying they've done anything wrong up to now.  But it's not unreasonable to say, well, just because they haven't blown up the world yet,  the fact that they have-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've got tons of accountability.  Half the world is going after them.  Every media outlet is going after them.  Every politician is going after them.  I call that accountability.  They don't always listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, you have to drag Facebook into every-  I mean, Facebook will apologize for running over your mom, but that won't stop him from  driving with his eyes closed.  So I think we do-  Accountability after the fact in social media is not very helpful.  I think we need to acknowledge that.  And I also think, do I think we should break these up?  Part of me is, this is what kept me up all night.  Never mind.  Keep going.  I know what you're going to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think breaking them up would matter personally because people are way too smart  and will still figure out a way to continue their dominance into space.  Oh, you could break them up.  You could pull.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could break them up, but I just think that the Congress's weapons and understanding  or the courts is insufficient to do the job properly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they have better understanding.  I really do.  We've seen this as a problem and we've actually been talking about it.  Let's see, it's 2020 now?  We've been talking about this for six or seven years and we've actually gotten some  really good academic research on it.  So I think that we could actually do something.  The question again is, what do we do?  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what's hard, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I think breaking up something like Facebook and pulling...  The other thing to think about is when you break up, like when they broke up AT&T,  they had to put in all of these rules in place to like,  because there was actual physical infrastructure, right?  That AT&T still had to deal with like all the T1 lines or what?  They weren't even...  They were like T1s, OC48s all that way back in the day.  They had to have...  And all that stuff still confuses me.  They had rules saying, hey, when your new competitor who is actually using what was  your equipment calls and needs help, you have to serve them within X number of hours.  And AT&T was like, yeah, yeah, sure.  We'll get right on that.  Prove it.  So I think we did those breakups and that was really hard.  This in some ways would be easier because there's less physical infrastructure.  I know there are servers.  There's going to be a heavy lift to separate the computing infrastructure.  But I actually don't know...  I don't think it's as hard as it would be made out to be.  What was it accomplished?  And I do think it puts a bump in the road and let's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me read this.  This is part one of the findings.  Real quickly, just a couple of paragraphs, which show that they understand the value  of these companies, but also understand the peril.  The open internet has delivered significant benefits to Americans and the US economy.  Over the past few decades, it's created a surge of economic opportunity,  capital investment and pathways for education.  The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of internet access.  That is affordable, competitive and widely available.  Yep.  So they acknowledged what you're saying completely.  But they also say the online platforms investigated by the subcommittee,  Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, also play an important role in our economy and society  as the underlying infrastructure for the exchange of communications, information,  goods and services.  They talk about the size and so forth.  I think this is the peril.  And I don't know if you would even disagree with this, Jeff, but maybe you will.  I'll give you a chance.  Over the past decade, the digital economy has been highly concentrated  and prone to monopolization.  Several markets investigated by the subcommittee, such as social networking,  general online search and online advertising are dominated by just one or two firms.  And I think you would agree there is a peril to that, or maybe you wouldn't.  Would you disagree?  No, I wish I had my Marshall McLuhan moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wish I had Benedict Evans next to me so he could explain it with a British accent  better than I can.  Two points on this.  One is it depends on how you well, three, I'll make it four or five.  One is an antitrust in this country.  We care about consumer consumer harm.  Different in Europe, but here it's about consumer harm.  I said there's no consumer harm.  There's no consumer harm.  Two is that Benedict argues very well better than I can how breaking him up is going to  do nothing.  It doesn't accomplish anything.  It's just an effort to make you feel good punitively.  So three, I was part of a transatlantic high level working group on content moderation  and freedom of expression, which addressed only content moderation, but which came up  with a framework that even I, who seem like sounds like a libertarian at these moments,  though I'll have my Biden Harris mask on tonight, even I endorsed.  What it says is rather than going at this punitively, acknowledge we're in a changing  world, which is part of Stacey's argument.  Well, let's have discussions.  Well, all right, more than discussions.  Fine.  So then what this argues is one, hold the platforms to making warrants to the public,  then hold them accountable for that as the FTC does and demand data so that you can hold  them accountable for that.  I endorse that view.  And so the FTC doesn't say to a peanut butter company, this is what you must promise or  not promise.  However, if you promise the peanut butter is going to make you rich and it doesn't make  you rich, stupid idea, I know, then the FTC is going to sue you for what you failed to  deliver.  So if you've got problems with the platforms, what we have now happening is a whole emotional  thing of they're too damn big, break them up.  It's an emotional response that accomplishes nothing.  I don't know.  I think you're exactly wrong on this report.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the antithesis of emotional.  This is well thought out.  They took 18 months to research it.  They collected huge amount of documentary evidence.  I think this is thoughtful and careful and they have tons of evidence, including smoking  gun emails from Zuckerberg and others.  But I think this is at the epitome of a carefully thought out proposal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where does Apple say it's all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Apple says we don't have a monopoly in any of the markets we compete in, which  is that they've always said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I can see having Facebook and Google because of all of the data that they manage  every single second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's part of the problem because this you're right.  They're very different problems.  And I don't know if Apple belongs in this basket, frankly.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But again, we spent 18 months doing this research and we still have Apple in this conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but they have they talk about the problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they should have issued a report on everybody individually.  They should have said, hey, here's our Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or maybe Facebook and Google because those two are related.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, because they're related in some of the ad stuff.  So I would say each individually.  When they talk about the Google Play Store and revenue models, they also bring up the  Apple.  You know, so there are places where it makes sense.  But I think fundamentally, it's not like you're going to apply one solution to all of these  companies.  So they do have recommendations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll I'll jump ahead.  There are several categories, one restoring competition.  They talk about structural separation, prohibitions of certain dominant platforms from  operating in adjacent lines of business.  That's an awful big bucket.  Non-discrimination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We do that already in like the FCC puts requirements for a certain number of years.  And I did actually think about like sunsetting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It could be underneath that.  Not you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's a whole nother fight that we have to have will last another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think actually this is fairly intelligent, but OK, I'll keep going.  Non-discrimination requirements prohibiting dominant platforms from engaging in self  preferencing and requiring them to offer equal terms for equal products and services.  Well, if we do, we're going to take a four hour show because there's quite a few  recommendations here.  So let me let me just whiz through them here.  So far, these make sense.  Admittedly, it's not obvious how you do this, but I think this is that's important.  I think a reasonable person might say, yeah, that seems like a good idea.  Interoperability, data portability to make services compatible with networks, to make  content information easily portable between them.  A presumptive prohibition.  This is tricky against future mergers and acquisitions by the dominant platforms.  Safe harbor for news publishers to safeguard a free and diverse press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This this is library paying off.  This is BS.  This is my industry engaging in antitrust.  It's BS.  But keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Prohibitions on the data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The data export data portability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really good.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you export a Facebook photo to TikTok?  There's a lot of definition to be done there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you so by the way, this is not a list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is not a list of prescription of what the committee wants to do.  These are a set of reforms proposed for further examination.  So for purposes of crafting legislative responses.  So they're basically saying we think now the subcommittee needs to dig down on each of these  and see what we can do about it and what kind of legislation we can talk about.  We intend these recommendations to serve as a complement to  complement to vigorous antitrust enforcement.  So this is not the antitrust portion.  This is a set of what you do on Google.  Well, there's also antitrust in here.  That's later.  Prohibitions and abuses of superior bargaining power.  These are all antitrust concepts.  There's law existing for that.  Right.  Then in strengthening the antitrust laws,  because they did say the antitrust laws need some reworking.  They want to reassert the anti-monopoly goals of the antitrust laws  and their centrality to ensuring a healthy and vibrant democracy.  Strengthening-  It gets into first amendment, but keep going.  I understand.  It's tricky.  And I don't think that they imply that these are easily solved.  They just say this is something we ought to think about.  Strengthening section seven of the Clayton Act,  including through restoring presumptions of-  I don't know what the Clayton Act is.  So I'm just going to stop right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Clayton Antitrust Act?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that the fundamental?  Sherman Antitrust is the-  Clayton is Sherman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it was prior to Sherman.  Okay.  Oh man, y'all are going to-  Recording regarding restoring the-  No.  Incipiency standard-  1914, the Clayton Antitrust Act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Strengthening the law of vertical mergers.  Okay.  They do suggest strengthening section two of the Sherman Act  by introducing a prohibition of abuse of dominance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Y'all, this may come up.  The Sherman Act declared monopolies illegal,  but the Clayton Act defines  business practices that are conducive to the formation of monopolies  or the monopolies that result for them as illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They call that the-  Restoring the incipiency standard and protecting nascent competitors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's Clayton.  I've seen a lot of that Clayton talk with all of these proposed bills,  not bills, propositions for the state of California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, that's in there?  Great, got to start studying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like that Clayton talk.  That Clayton talk, it's in here too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a lot of Clayton going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't like this one.  Taking additional measures to strengthen overall enforcement,  including through overriding problematic precedents in the case law.  I don't know about that.  This section C is reviving antitrust enforcement,  which we probably do need to do.  Restoring robust congressional oversight of the antitrust laws in their enforcement.  Restoring federal antitrust agencies to full strength  and strengthening private enforcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's where that happened, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think this section has to do with kind of the erosion  and the abrogation, congressional abrogation of their duties and rights as Congress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and cutting out all regulation possible in the last three years.  Yeah, strengthening private enforcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't even know what private enforcement is.  Through eliminating obstacles such as forced arbitration clauses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those are those self-governing regulatory bodies that you have.  Companies like to set up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, like arbitration.  Okay, limits on class action formation.  One of these things is not like the other.  Strengthening private enforcement through eliminating obstacles such as  forced arbitration clauses, which by the way,  we have forced arbitration clauses in our contracts.  Limits on class action formation.  Judicially created standards constraining what constitutes an antitrust injury.  This is lawyer talk, unduly high pleading standards.  Don't know about any of that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right versus left about lawyers.  Yeah, yeah, that's an anti-lawyer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  I think this is as well thought out as you could expect, frankly.  I think it's pretty good.  I think A, it's not going to happen because the Republicans have already pulled out.  So we're just seeing a draft proposal, which is never going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If the Democrats end up in charge of everything, then this has become a blueprint for where it goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe that's the biggest takeaway from this.  Here's a warning.  If Democrats are elected, this is what's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think that's the case.  I was part of a group that recommends a regulatory framework.  My argument is that-  Yeah, so you're not against that.  Moral panic will get us in trouble because-  No, I agree.  Oh, that white balance is so different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at Ant.  Ant's got a great, just permanent-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Ant did it.  I thought God did it.  Yeah, Ant's doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just blink it off and on, Ant, whenever he says it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Freaking game.  So obviously, you know this.  So you're not against regulation.  I'm not against a framework of sensible regulation.  My fear is that in the anger, emotional response, otherwise known as moral panic,  Ant, that's going on here is that there's going to be a lot of ancillary damage to freedom of  expression and the things that they cherish.  This has to be done carefully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is brain surgery.  I don't trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it'll be done poorly in some cases and we will have to fix it through either further  legislation or empowering a regulatory agency to make, to dispense the rules in the right way or  through lawsuits.  Now, I'm only on page 26.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you guys are going to keep interrupting me, this is going to take a long time.  No, I'm just kidding.  I'm just teasing.  I think we've done enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We also look at the regulation to date in Europe and I don't want to get into all that,  but I think I have a spiel which I give as talks where I go down everything that's happened so far  and what's wrong with it and the unintended consequences, which include giving more power  to the platforms, regulatory capture on behalf of the platforms, harming newcomers and smaller  players because of the difficulty that the regulation creates.  This is what's happened in Europe with this kind of regulation.  And so be careful what you wish for because what you might find is what's happened in Europe is  the platforms have become only more powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I understand.  But we also should not be knee-jerk in our rejection of thinking about this just because  it can't go wrong.  I spent two years on a commission coming up with an alternative.  I'm not eating.  Good.  All right.  It just sounds like you need to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I will have this always at the ready.  It's here.  I'm warning you.  It's always going to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like it.  I kind of feel like we should get like a light, bright version of the time for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  LED.  Oh, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll have a graph of it next week.  Would you please?  It's going to work on that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I completely concede all the issues with having this go through government and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I also concede all the issues that these companies...  Listen, I think they're different.  I think Facebook has been screwing up over and over and over again.  Google has been screwing up less but has a lot of hubris.  Twitter is trying but it's a small beast.  I think Apple has incredible hubris.  Amazon has incredible hubris.  None of them is helping themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do think there's a difference.  The damage Apple can do is limited to people who own iPhones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, and Apple is not secret, but Apple is also very upfront.  It is getting a little overbearing in how it enforces rules, but Apple has been very upfront about,  yes, we have made a beautiful walled garden.  You will come inside and if you leave it, you will be sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you can leave it because there's another garden.  Right.  Yes, but we make our garden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is an antitrust because there's a choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But to say that, for instance, you can leave Google because, well, there's always Bing or DuckDuckGo,  which is Bing, by the way, isn't really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is where I got it wrong.  For a searcher, you can.  You'll get the same results.  For an advertiser, that's different.  So I think you're looking at the wrong end.  Have you used DuckDuckGo for any length of time or Bing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Advertise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have.  I use DuckDuckGo.  It's not as good.  So I don't think the search issue...  So I think people can use search.  I do think it's very difficult, though.  If you're not an Apple user, you're going to be on Google's ecosystem.  And I would also say if you are a business...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And if you are a business, you are going to have to advertise with Google.  No ifs, ands, or buts about it.  Google and or Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that means there is competition.  It's duopoly, but there is competition.  And in programmatic advertising...  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, if you're programmatic advertising, you've only got Google.  Is that true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't...  There's no...  Well, no, you've got AppNexus, you've got others.  But Stacey, the difference I would say there,  there's advertising on Google, with Google, to Google properties.  That's one thing, right?  Then there's advertising across the whole web through programmatic.  A lot of that goes through Google.  Not everything does.  You don't have to go through Google.  You can be on AppNexus and you still compete with others in that field.  Having said all that, yes, in advertising...  Leo, this is where we would actually agree here.  In advertising, there is an antitrust issue with Google.  It's not in search.  It's in advertising.  But I don't know that it's legally a monopoly.  Hello, my friend Benedict Evans is going to come in and explain this for you.  But the advertising piece that Stacey's concentrating on is the right place to concentrate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's not be pedantic.  Okay, it doesn't say perhaps match the standard of Clayton or Sherman.  But that's the law.  But I understand.  But I understand.  But do you not agree that there is a concentration of power and as a result, a problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that there does need to be, especially in advertising, a structure of,  at least to start off with, accountability and oversight.  I think it is far too soon to say break them up because it's not going to accomplish a damn thing.  But I do think that we need...  This is the argument of the...  Again, my commission that I was on was only about content moderation,  but it cuts across other areas too.  Is there need to be regulations, there needs to be promises that companies make,  they need to be held accountable that and to do that, they have to give data  to government and researchers so that we can see what the actual thing is.  There was a lot of presumption in this country that,  oh my God, filter bubbles are ruining us.  It's miserable.  It's horrible.  From 2001 on through 2011, filter bubbles, filter bubbles, filter bubbles.  Well, I recommend to you the book by Axel Bruns, an academic art,  our filter bubble is real in which he has all the research saying, actually they're not,  because there was a presumption there.  We need data.  We don't have data from the companies.  I do want oversight with data from the companies.  And then out of that comes sensible regulation and legislation.  Right now it's being made on an emotional basis.  They could do something bad.  I disagree 100%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This report is very, very precise.  You got to read the report, Jeff, before you say that.  This report is very precise and very detailed and goes into a lot of, I think, very strong evidence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I also want to bring up the idea, because the report actually does a lot with this,  is the idea of how network effects, which are a viable and real proven thing in social networks  and the way we, it's not just social networks, but it's, well, it is social in the sense,  if you think of texting and things like that as social networks too.  And this report does a pretty good job of talking about the using network effects,  as they say, a flywheel to get more users and thus broaden your power in the advertising market.  I actually, I think, Jeff, it would be really interesting to read up a little bit more on that  and get your thoughts on that, because I know we talked about that.  I started, I just had Zoom calls last night.  Yeah, no, I'm just thinking about, we don't actually talk about that a lot when we talk  about monopoly, because I know you're an ardent supporter of First Amendment rights and press  freedom, but I do think there is a there there in terms of how we take advantage of network effects.  And then going forward, I think what's going to be really interesting is how we use and aggregate  data within our walled gardens to build services that further lock people, not lock people,  they just make it much more enticing not to leave, but competitors can't build those services.  And the question then, we can't actually measure harm to a consumer, because when we talk about  harm to a consumer in antitrust, we're usually talking about pricing. But right now, nobody in  this market charges consumers. Okay, not nobody. But that's kind of a thing that we don't really  talk a lot about. But changing how we think about antitrust is not a crazy thing to do here,  especially because we're moving more towards a data exchange economy in some of these areas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But here's the consequence, Stacey. Right. And I think that's a good analysis. But to look at  unintended consequences, this is part of the discussion I had on Twitter today, is in demonizing  the cookie and getting rid of third party cookies, because they were misused, they were screwed up.  I'm not I'm not arguing that. But in getting rid of that, what you're going to see more and more  and more and more is journalism and media will go behind pay walls. And that means that it's  redlined for the privileged. And I as much as advertising, I have problems with the way it  operates, right. So there's going to be unintended consequences that require and same as same as as  as has happened with regulation in Europe. So that's my concern is that we're going to find  ourselves where look at the Australian law, where Murdoch Murdoch just suddenly went down,  Murdoch suddenly has changed his tune utterly. Tax fine, because tax paying me. So all the things  that he had a principle to stand on as tech is awful. He was he was bribing him. He was using  his political clout to get all the storm going. It worked. He's getting paid. He's going to shut  up now. And that and the cynicism that's behind that is an issue because it's going to have  unintended consequences that is going to have regulatory capture to enable people like Rupert  Murdoch to get more powerful than even they are today. There's my fear will always. It's a legit

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  fear. But there is always having covered politics in policy rather not politics policy for 20 years  now. There are always unintended consequences. There is always going to be an adjustment period  where and then we move to regulatory capture. We are there like we are there post the bells  in the bells right now or sorry with AT&T in the I did. I mean, everyone knows, you know,  it's pretty clear how old I am. But so I think just to say we have to keep things going the way  and you and I we said this before to say we go this way because we're afraid of unintended  consequences is stupid. We know that there are we know that there are harms. Did you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  do what you really want to call what I said stupid? I just to wait. How about reduction

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to use that as our basis about reduction? Just to use that as the basis for not doing anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We know there will always be unintended on page 399. You got it. You got it. Really good.  We're almost there. We're almost at the end. Well, a lot of what is goes on in this report,  I think is quite interesting. The the staff is saying to Congress and the subcommittee,  we need to make some adjustments. The courts have significantly undermined antitrust law  and its original intent. And so we propose that you make laws to overcome what we consider  mistaken court rulings. They also I love this line in here. And it kind of goes to what you guys  are saying, clarifying that false positives, in other words, erroneous enforcement, erroneous  enforcement is not more costly than false negatives, erroneous non-enforcement. Yes.  And that when related and that when relating to conduct or mergers involving dominant firms,  in fact, non-enforcement is costlier. So they are very much aware of the arguments that we are

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  having here. And I think that Leo, yeah, the only thing I would say is then then treat that  generically. Say if we've got a problem antitrust this company, then deal with it and antitrust at  a large level to say we're going to deal with this only in the context of four companies is also I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  agree. Reductionist. I agree. I think these and especially since the cases are different in each  company. My new word for stupid. I'm sorry. It's a good word. I'm sorry to call you stupid.  Reductionist. It's a subtle. It's kind of it throws a little shade, but it's kind of like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  subtweeting. It's like a subtle. I was just really tired. But also I don't think you're stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, obviously Jeff's not stupid. Although he's a little bit of a broken record

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  on this subject. Because you are. I've got to meet your broken record with my broken record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do think I have to say having gone through this, it's an impressive document that addresses a lot  of the things we're talking about. Does not assume, all right, it's time you bring down the hammer.  But says in a very thoughtful way, there are some issues that we should think about.  One of which is that the courts have effectively undermined the original intent of antitrust

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  legislation. That's a big huge issue. But that's apart from these companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And well, maybe it's apart from these companies, but it is restore the anti-monopoly goals of  antitrust laws. I take you to page 391 section one, the antitrust laws that Congress enacted in 1890  to 1914, that's Sherman Clayton and the FTC Act, reflected a recognition that unchecked monopoly  power poses a threat to our economy as well as to our democracy. And then Congress reasserted  this vision through subsequent antitrust laws like the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and the Robinson-Patman  Act and the Seller-Keefer Act. Anyway, I can go on and on with the acts. In the decades since,  Congress enacted these foundational statutes, the courts have significantly weakened these laws  and made it increasingly difficult for federal antitrust enforcers and private plaintiffs to  successfully challenge any competitive conduct and mergers. So what in a way they're saying is a much  larger proposition that before we even address Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon, what we  really need to address is the tenor in this country, especially fostered by the courts,  but I think also by the executive branch, that we shouldn't leave that alone. Let it go, let it be.  Now, of course, that's why this is a Democratic report and I guarantee you it's that paragraph  right there that stopped the Republicans cold. But that's what Congress does. Congress can say,  that's the one branch of the government that can say, you know what, the courts made a mistake  here. And even though there's a judicial precedent, that's not our intent. So we're  going to be more specific because our intent was to prevent this concentration, this unchecked  concentration of power. And I think that that's appropriate. I don't think that's inappropriate.  And the courts are going to rule them for generations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They can do that, but it's harder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the cycle we're on.  That's the cycle. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because like 120 years ago, we had the type of income inequality we had now. That's kind  of what led to these was the robber barons of the late 1800s. And so we have some of these similar  things happening. So maybe this is that backlash that leads to that and boom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think in a way that's what they're saying. The pendulum has swung in the wrong direction.  We want to bring it back. Now, here's the question. I don't think you would disagree with this, Jeff.  It is possible for companies to have too much power, not necessarily a monopoly in the sense that we...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Define it for me in the statute is what I'm asking for. Rather than an emotional view of  they're too big or too much power. That's meaningless. Define for me and for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's where we get our laws from is these emotional things. And then we build statues.  And I think what Leo's trying to say here is that maybe it's time and part of this report  might be bringing up is it's time to reevaluate antitrust for the era that we're currently in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't argue with that, but I would not do it against four companies alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, and I think perhaps... If they do a law, they're using this as an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And anytime you build these, anytime Congress writes laws, I guarantee you there are companies,  the hullabaloo and the comment periods here are going to be, there are going to be parts of the  law that are going to be written only for two companies. Because that's the way we do things  in the US. But it won't be just for these. It will be for... Especially if they do things like data  portability and they address the effects or try to mitigate network effects. All of these things...  Yeah, we need to do something there. Buck said, I agree with the chairman

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that big tech has acted anti-competitively, but with a problem this significant, there are a variety  of legislative options. And I think ultimately, you're not going to get Republican sign-off on  this. And so, I think the Department of Justice is kind of waiting for this report. They keep saying,  any day now, we're going to come after Google. Remember, they've been saying that for three weeks,  it's going to be this week, it's going to be this week. I think they were waiting for this report.  And now, unfortunately, they're frozen in aspic because there's even within this committee,  there's a market disagreement. Some of it's from Jim Jordan, who's the top Republican on the  committee. You remember how he almost derailed the testimony of the...  Yeah, I think I just heard him trying to cut you off right now.  Yeah. Put your jacket on, put your mask on. So,  Jordan says he's not going to sign out of the report. Buck shared that third way draft,  but Jordan said, we don't have anything to do with the third way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they're going to go... Right now, before the election, is going to go full bore victimhood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, nothing's going to happen before the election at all.  Oh, God. But there was the rhetoric we're hearing.  Right. It's all about rhetoric. And I think everybody, anybody reasonable is going to say,  well, we're going to have a new Congress in a month or two. Probably we should just put this off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're all going to ride down the street on skateboards with cranberry sauce and the world's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  going to be a happy place. I got some dreams. It's not cranberry sauce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cranberry sauce. But wait, I have a question for you,  because this is one of those consumer harms things that I thought about last night when I was  not sleeping. Remember when we used to be able to call someone on the phone  and you would reach them? As opposed to now. I know it's weird, but now we're sitting here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At least she's dating somebody she likes.  No sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I'm calling, you know, you want to zoom, you want to Skype, do you want to  messenger? Where do I find you? Should I duo you? All of this does create consumer harm.  I was just thinking, like, I'm like, oh, I got my mom on duo, but my in-laws are on Amazon's  Echo platform and I want to be able to video call them. Gah. So just think about that,  because that is a legit consumer harm that, you know, is it catastrophic? No, but it's irritating.  And we don't really have a way to address that, because again, pricing is the only,  is one of the primary metrics we use there. So just throwing that out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you saying there's too much choice in calling? Isn't that a good thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm saying that we have all of these competitors in calling and the network  effects make it hard. They're trying to lock you into one place or another. So things like data  interoperability become really important, which is why I think we need to have a rubric that looks  at any competitive behavior for the modern era and tries to say, hey, it's really important.  When they broke up the bells, they talked about the physical underlying infrastructure,  making that available. I think doing something like that with technology to a certain level,  obviously, you can't go all the way up the stack, but those kinds of things will make life easier  for consumers and will cut down a little bit on the monopoly power that these companies have.  That's just at a consumer level that you and I would understand as opposed to like breaking up  the ad business of Google. Does that make sense? That's where I was going with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to call an adjournment on this session.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can erase my whiteboard now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, Nathan Appadaca has had car trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I told him that, Jeff. You're paying attention, you reductionist fool.  Nathan Appadaca, aka Dogface208, was having car trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those of you not able to hear that, to see that, and put up a screen and said thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Told them that. I said that already. I narrated it for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know, we're like old men. Come on, stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I told them that, Jeff. You're paying attention, you reductionist fool.  Nathan Appadaca, Dogface208, was having car trouble on his way to his job at the potato warehouse.  It's a true story. Car broke down, so Nathan popped the trunk and jumped on the longboard.  He always kept in the trunk as an emergency so he could get to work.  He happened to have with him a 20 ounce bottle of ocean spray crann apple juice.  Recorded a TikTok video to Fleetwood Mac's Dreams, which has now received 28 million views.  The sales of Fleetwood Mac's Dreams has tripled.  The streams have doubled.  We talked about this last week, this song that came out in 1977.  Mick Fleetwood himself recreated the video. He joined TikTok to do so.  Yeah, on the longboard. And as the bottom line, because poor Nathan has to get to his job at the  potato warehouse, ocean spray gave him a cranberry red pickup truck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And who says the internet's a bad thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, and it was filled with crann apple juice.  So who says the internet's a bad thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, it's a wonderful thing, people. Just go with the flow. Ride your skateboard and  drink your crann apple juice and everything will be okay.  Isn't it great? I love it. I just loved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the fact that this guy has 28 million views, which is like more than last night's tonight show,  of him on his longboard singing Dreams with his crann apple juice, lip syncing.  Wow. And you say the internet's bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are so many other people doing exactly what he did that just doesn't come off as good  and people won't gravitate towards it. I don't know how it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I get it. I mean, honestly, it's not the first time that's happened.  Fickle finger of fate.  It's the fickle finger fader or maybe bite dances, artificial intelligence algorithm.  Oh no, it's an algorithm. Oh no, change the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It really likes, it really likes Stevie Nicks.  It's a big fan of Stevie Nicks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of, you didn't fully erase it, did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, he knows better than that. He's going to pull the moral panic button a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think, I think, no, I like Stacy. I love your idea. I think we need, we need some neon.  I think we need a neon more panic sign. That's what I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff, we need a card so you can play the moral panic card and you just throw it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  And we're going to give you a reductionist card, Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we can have, if we work on this a little bit, we could have twig the board game  pretty soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to say, yeah, twig the gathering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twig the gathering.  Twig the gathering. All right. I think we probably.  So by the way, while we're on this, while we're on this, so tick, you know, fears of monopolies,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  fears of everything going wrong with the world. TikTok has passed Instagram to become number two  in the heart of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was one of our stories today. Yeah.  TikTok. Yes. So, so, you know.  Number two, by the way, with the teenagers, with the kids, with the youngs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's who matters on TikTok. There's five of us old people who are on it and you're there by

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  force. I am. I have an account, but I don't do it.  Have you made a TikTok?  Yeah. Way back when.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Didn't you all do it together? Didn't you all make a TikTok?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe. Oh, there was something like that.  Oh, no, those were Snapchat glasses. Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Jeff and I should do a Sandler and Waldorf TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One where you throw something at each other. It'll be fun.

Transcript:  That's right. We throw it. Yeah, that's right. That's right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a great story. Yeah. TikTok passed Instagram in the hearts of teens.  This is according to a report published yesterday. A survey, if you will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, neither is number one. What's number one?  34% of the teens list Snapchat. 29% TikTok. 25% Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  However, there is a engagement thing. I don't know how they measure it, but  Instagram still easily tops an engagement with 84% Snapchat, 80% TikTok, 69% up from 62%.  This is a report from Piper Sandler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a legit org.  Is it? Yeah.  Yeah. They...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it a bank?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, it's a research.  Yeah. All right. Pause. Let's have a pause that refreshes.  Drink your cran apple juice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ant also needs a cue card that just says, go to a commercial break, please.  Carson has that card.  Oh, okay. We're about to get it. We're about to get it. Yeah. Okay. Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Frank, Frank, our show today brought to you by LastPass.  As we know, a very important part of this operation. We're in the LastPass studios.  LastPass has been around committed to protecting its users for 12 years.  I started using them 12 years ago, right? When they first started.  In fact, we've been using LastPass Enterprise here at Twit for about five or six years.  25 million users now LastPass has, and 70,000 businesses. It's no surprise.  They're the award-winning number one password manager.  And why are more businesses using LastPass right now?  Well, because it worked from home.  When you're sending employees home with the passwords  to the most valuable parts of your business, your checking account, your business  line of credit, your website, your customer lists, your supplier lists.  You want to make sure you got your identity and access management nailed down.  That's what LastPass does.  Adjusting to an online workforce isn't just a logistical problem. It's a security issue.  LastPass has been a saving grace to so many companies, including ours.  One company leveraged LastPass to enable the team to set up, utilize, and share strong passwords  for their accounts and programs.  A crucial progressive step towards improved data security.  And I love this about LastPass. It also makes life easier.  It eases the burden of moving from the office to home full time.  How does it make it easier?  Auto-fill passwords is great.  When you create a new password for a site, it remembers it, it fills it in.  You don't have to share passwords with colleagues by sending them a text or an email.  That wouldn't be safe.  LastPass has built-in password sharing.  They have single sign-on, a 1,300 plus single sign-on apps.  Employees love that.  I love it because you don't have to have a password.  You just approve it on your phone and you're in.  And IT loves it because they always know who has access to what and from where.  The enterprise password management ensures oversight of shadow IT and enforceable policies  across all your password protected accounts.  LastPass implements multi-factor in their enterprise product.  Not just fingerprint and face recognition, but contextual cues like IP address and geo-location.  That makes it easier for employees and more secure for you.  The model is zero knowledge.  That's what they call it.  The zero knowledge security model assumes that everything,  whether it's inside the network or out, is a threat.  And it protects everyone in the enterprise from the individual user to the biggest organizations.  Security is LastPass's number one priority.  And because you can go passwordless, you can enjoy your work.  It makes it just a little bit easier.  And I enjoy it because I know we've been careful about assessing LastPass.  Steve Gibson went through all the code with Joe Segress, its creator, gave it their thumbs up.  AES 256-bit encryption, salted hashes, SHA 256, so your data is secure in the cloud.  In fact, your data is never decrypted anywhere but on device.  And your password is never transmitted to LastPass.  That's how you keep your vault secret from everyone, including LastPass.  LastPass has won eight awards so far this year.  PC Magazine's Editor's Choice, the Fortress Cyber Security Award,  their Business Insiders Best Overall Password Manager.  You don't have to take our word for it.  LastPass speaks for itself.  Speaking of speaking, tomorrow we're going to have so much fun.  We're doing another LastPass event.  It's Security Month.  October is online Security Month.  So we're going to have a special panel.  This is going to be so much fun.  It's called Attack and Defense.  We're going to have two teams, our red team, our attackers, our hackers,  headed by Father Robert Balasare, the digital Jesuit, and his buddy from Twyatt, Cheebert,  Brian Chee.  These guys have been on both sides of the security equation.  They know they're going to come up with some devious attacks.  But don't worry because we have some really good defenders.  Jerry Buchelt from LastPass, he's actually the CISO of their parent company, logged me in.  Certainly knows his way around a security perimeter.  And the very well-known, one of my heroes, Bruce Schneier, will be on the defense team.  I will be your white team, your moderator between the red and the blue,  trying to keep things on an even keel.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  It's not going to be a real competition.  There is such a thing.  They do these competitions, red, blue, white.  But I think we'll be a little loosey-goosey because we've got such great people.  But we will talk about how people attack, how they defend, how you mitigate, how you plan.  It is going to be a great presentation.  That is tomorrow, October 8th, it's a Thursday, 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern time.  You can watch it live on the stream at twit.tv slash live.  And of course, it's a twit event, so we'll put it out on our twit events  feed.  That's a brand new feed.  This will only be the ninth event on it.  So if you're not a subscriber, go to twit.tv.  John, is it twit.tv slash events?  Yeah, twit.tv slash events.  You'll see the previous events.  We did one last week with ITProTV.  And if you subscribe to that in your favorite app, you'll get it the minute it's available.  So that's always the best policy, subscribe to our events and all of our feeds,  twit.tv slash events.  There's no better time to get last pass.  Ease the burden for yourself and your remote workforce with a cybersecurity protection  you need.  Go to last pass.com slash twit.  Can you imagine Bruce Schneier versus the digital Jesuit in a cage match?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's kind of great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're both saints to me.  They're both saints.  They really are.  They're both saints to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So can I take you to a weird story that I think is fascinating?  Yeah.  Line 136.  I spotted this.  I follow Alexis Ohanian who I've known over the years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Founder of Reddit.  But more importantly, the husband of Serena Williams, the greatest world champion tennis  player in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And father of the cutest baby, cutest toddler.  And?  He's founded.  Well, he's not the founder of it.  He tweeted it.  I guess he's investing in helping out.  He's been working on it for a year.  Oda.  I'm eager to hear you guys.  Have you seen it yet?  I'm looking at it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Live performances in your home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you buy the speakers.  Oh, you have to buy speakers.  Well, you don't have to.  I don't think.  I'm not sure.  I don't think.  And then you buy separately a $79 subscription and then they fill them with live programming  a lot of the time.  And so it's a weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's not a concert.  You know, it really company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a content company.  It's a live performance company.  It's a subscription company.  Look at these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wooden frames.  They're strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Google actually was talking about this last week at their event.  Not this particular thing, but they had a whole section on recording artists in their home  and optimizing the way their speakers sound for that particular performance.  So that's what these guys are actually doing right here.  Doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so they have a they're producing a network of entertainment on a subscription basis.  They say, well, take no data and never sell your data to anybody.  No advertising support.  But the speakers and the subscriptions kind of support each other to support the artists.  Mainly music, but also some speaking stuff.  I wonder if there's an opportunity for journalists and things.  I just found this.  I can't get my head around it fully yet.  I thought it was smart or is it is it is it smart or is it reductionist?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they've already sold out their first batch.  Before anyone even knew about it.  Presumably that was one ninety nine.  The second batch is two ninety nine.  Two speakers plus a subscription that delivers in January.  And then the third batch is three ninety nine.  So the price is going up.  Wait a minute. The price does not include the membership.  So that's just the speakers.  So you have to also pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I tweeted about this.  They said, you know, can you come to the special jazz performance we have tomorrow  on sundown?  And it does today.  And I said, sorry, I'm on my podcast at sundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What a bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Consulate combination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I kind of like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there's this old school idea of craftsmanship tied to the physical object.  Right.  So there's some veneration of the physical object.  There is the serendipity of having a subscription where you could,  you know, if you subscribe to this, you have a random concert you could tune into  that is also bounded in time, which people are really high on right now.  Yeah, Jeff, this is really interesting.  I don't.  Oh, go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was going to ask, Gemma B.  Since Gemma B is the music fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. We were listening to his speakers  earlier.  He has some beautiful, what is it?  Dyna, Dynaudio speakers, really beautiful speakers.  He brought them in so I could hear them.  And we were listening to right of, no, the Firebird Suite by Stravinsky.  It was beautiful.  Really beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I, you know, is this something you would ever subscribe to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would you do it, John?  No, but it's not his kind of music maybe.  Yeah.  Is that why?  Or because you already have these speakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. And I have plenty of music to listen to.  Yeah. He says he has plenty of music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can they hear you or only me?  No, we can hear.  Oh, you can hear him.  Sometimes John speaks to me in my own head.  No, I'm using the big mic today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sometimes he speaks in my ear and I'm like, what's happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He can do that too.  He's kind of amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So anyway, that was that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I kind of want to do this.  It's very targeted.  But if you want me to buy something, tell Jeff about it.  I'm his programmatic advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Mr. Jarvis is an espresso machine I'm looking at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I already bought that.  Problem is it's not in your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I know Stacey, I know what Stacey wants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What does Stacey want?  Oh, she wants my thermomix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  That's what I'm after.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, just wait.  It's too bad you don't work in our studio because I do have  periodic garage sales where I take old stuff out of my house,  bring it to the conference room, put a sign on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're due in two months, right?  Yeah, we're due pretty soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the rule set about how that works?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I should make some because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it an auction or is it a garage sale?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, you just go in and whoever gets it gets it.  It's a little tricky right now because  Jammer B can get everything.  Jammer B basically gets everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe Jammer B and I need to team up.  Do you need a thermomix?  Are you interested?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think the thermomix is going to go there.  Dang it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't distract me.  I'm trying to buy this right now.  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, Stacey, find a nerdy story for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to see...  I was thinking about this and I'm like, this is a cool thing.  And if they succeed in selling lots of speakers,  then maybe they'll just provide the service over time.  And they'll deal with like a Sonos or...  Anyway.  Okay, find a nerdy story.  Hey, this is so terrible because it's promoting me,  but I think it's such a really important topic.  So I wrote about consent in our kind of building out the smart home.  And I wanted to call it...  This is actually a Google story too.  So I wrote about it tied to basically the idea being,  we have all of this stuff in our homes and it's not clear to everybody who lives in the home  how these things can be used to surveil you.  And I'm not talking about the companies.  I'm talking about just people in the home.  And so I put forth these nine ideas associated with this.  And this isn't just the home.  This can actually be in the enterprise anywhere there's sensors.  We're gathering a lot of data about people.  And the two things that I focused most on in this story was one,  we're gathering data about people.  And when I agree to share my data with a company,  there's no conversation right now about sharing that data over time  and through different AI or use cases.  So I might share my Fitbit data right now for COVID-19 tracking.  But if they look at that data and sometime later come up with an algorithm that says,  hey, we can actually tell if you're about to get Parkinson's now.  I may not actually want that.  I may not want my data used for that.  I may not want that associated with me.  And we don't talk about that.  So there's the consent like we don't know how our data is going to be used over time.  And then there's just straight up consent like you put stuff in your house  and sometimes people don't understand what you can see.  And I talk about tracking my husband on the Tesla all the time through the app.  And during the holiday season, I am shameless.  I will see what stores he is parked in front of so I can tell.  Oh, you are terrible.  Oh, that is awful.  Is it that terrible?  Don't you want surprises?  That is terrible.  So, yeah.  But so and then the other is tied to that, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's still a surprise.  It's just, you know, you know where it came from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like jewelry this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, dear.  I just bought you the velvet stand there on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I got you a box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You need more jewelry stands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the other thing is talking to the people who live in your home  about the stuff you're putting into your home and what you can see is really important.  And so Google actually did a good job.  I got a review unit at the Nest Audio and I'll show you all that later if you want.  Yeah.  Okay.  It was my thing.  So we're going to talk about it later.  Save your thing.  But when I signed up for it and added it, I got a little note on my screen saying,  hey, by the way, if you have other people in your house using this,  if they don't link their commands, if they don't link this device to their Google account,  their commands are going to show up in my account.  So let's say it's like, oh, it's asking and it just let me know.  So it was like, yeah, this is going to be the change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But go ahead.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they're like, let people know, which I was like, yeah, I tell companies they should let people know  because it's not well publicized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to say turn on guest mode for it to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yeah, anyway, I just wanted to talk about that because I think it's really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So talk about your list.  I like your list in your post a lot, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, let's find that list.  This is it Stacey on IoT.  And then after we do that, I want to take a break.  But we because we we've given we had to take a little breather after the beginning of this show.  Yeah, we did.  Because my blood pressure was a little high.  But now we're going to go back because the Supreme Court today is hearing Google versus Oracle.  That's another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The story that never ends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a never ending story.  So we'll get to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We should talk about consent in IoT.  This is the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  First one.  So most of these are really no brainers.  We've talked about that.  Provide transparency about your data collection practices.  Provide transparency about the sensors inside the device.  So like, is there a microphone?  Is there a camera?  Blah, blah, blah.  Protect the user's data through encryption at rest and emotion.  So be good with data.  Promote safe data practices with partners.  That's, you know, make sure your partners aren't like leaving their stuff on an unprotected  A3 or S3 server, right?  Develop a clear practice around the use of data after a merger and acquisition.  And I know that you can't do this exactly, but we should be talking about it because I think  the data is going to become only more valuable.  And explain your data deletion processor policy and give consumers a chance to delete their data.  I think actually if like, Google buys Fitbit, that deal goes through.  I actually think maybe Google should give me a chance to say, get rid of my data.  I don't want you to have that.  Promise users the device will work for X number of years.  I talk about that, the expiration date, patch devices.  And then the final one is what I've been talking about is push users to ask for consent from  others in their environment.  And that's telling users when they put something in, what people can see.  And then reminding them.  So this could be a sticker that says, hey, you're on my doorbell camera that goes up to the cloud.  It might be things like, hey, if like my smart oven, which if you download the app,  you see what people are cooking.  Remind the people in the house, like, hey, tell your family that you can see if they're  baking cookies or they're baking roast and broccoli.  You know, that's something that they won't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It should be like when you're on an airplane in the exit row and the flight attendant comes to you  and says, I need you to say yes to agree to this exit row policy.  But how would you enforce that?  Would Google say, please gather your entire home around my device?  Because I'm going to ask each of you if you agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a reminder to the people buying this device that the device affects everyone in the household.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a norm.  It's not a law.  It's a norm.  It's a standard that you put out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Today, I go in to use the Pilates reformer.  Our 17, soon to be 18 year old son uses it every day.  And the Google Nest is face down, even though there's no camera on it.  I don't think he's figured that out, but it's face down.  And I understand he doesn't know where that video would go and he doesn't want it.  He prefers the privacy.  So the thing is, it's hard to get people to take this stuff seriously from a consumer standpoint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can tell them about all this stuff until you blew in the face and they're going to go ahead and just click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you went around to the hardheads and said, hey dudes, just so you know, everything you say can be heard  by that Amazon Echo device or that Google Voice device, what would their reaction be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've had that discussion.  They all give me that look of, oh, wow.  They don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's OK.  But the point is that you're doing it like you're giving people a real choice.  So when people come into my house now, I'm like, hey, by the way, I have smart speakers everywhere  and their mics are on.  And is it a weird thing to say?  Yes.  But do I feel better for having said it?  Yes.  And honestly, we should be doing it for phones because phones are just as  potentially problematic as some of these devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what we do at the school, this is a model.  So the school, I had a little effect because every time we had an event,  somebody had to go around and they were having people sign releases  because we were going to put on YouTube.  And I said, what the hell are we doing here?  Let's put up a sign that says you're in this space.  We are going to record things here.  And it's big and visible and known.  And anybody there could never say that they don't know that they can be recorded.  If they don't want to be recorded, they can go sit in a place where they're not recorded.  They can leave the event.  There's lots of options.  But we're running the event.  It's our money.  So we say this is what we're doing.  That's a rule.  That's interesting.  It's transparent.  It's school though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Litigation, litigation, litigation though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the school is an interesting space because the school,  like we sign, actually I don't sign the releases for my daughter's school.  Right.  So they have to black out her image and everything.  But they do that because she's underage.  So I don't know if your school does it because in, you know.  Well, we're a graduate school.  Okay.  So then no.  And also because she doesn't have a choice.  I mean, yeah, I know that if you're doing an event, it's a little bit different,  but she's got to be in school.  So not for classes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, we have one with the art heads in North Carolina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The school would send out the notifications about the privacy and things like that.  And I've saw both sides of the coin where people were really, really upset  that this was being sent down because they never really considered the privacy implications.  And then you had the other set.  It's like, wow, this is good.  They're thinking about it and trying to protect our children.  So on and so forth.  Me, I didn't even worry about it because my kids are athletes,  which means newspapers are going to come around to talk about said athletes.  Their names and pictures are going to be all over the paper.  So I'm like, yeah, that's part of the territory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what are you going to buy the papers because the result and that's the economic summit, right?  We always said more names you put the paper, the more papers you sell.  That's it.  So Stacey, the one thing I think requires to put it in your normal picture, more discussion,  is the concept of my data, right?  Because in transactions, there's always two sides to it.  And the other party says, well, it's mine too.  And so there needs to be some ability to come to understandings about that,  that recognizes that multiple parties to data each have a right.  And that there isn't a singular right in all cases to all data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And, you know, if we, once we start talking about that, we also probably will come to the conclusion  that some data is different than others, right?  Knowing that my house has a kitchen is very different than knowing that last night I only  slept for four hours, right?  And that's, I think we get stuck on regulatory things because we don't really dig into that.  Anyway, we're back to regulation.  What else is happening?  Let's keep going here.  Yeah, let's keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let's take a break and then Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We were buying time for you, Leo.  It's what we were doing.  I bought it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Weren't you doing something?  I bought them.  Did you buy it?  Yeah.  You bought a thing.  Oh, you bought the Otis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you also subscribe?  I think they bill you later, but the problem is they say on the weekends.  So like, I'm going to be here working and all of a sudden those speakers are going to leap into life.  They also, I didn't recognize any of those artists unless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Lana, what's her name?  Lana Del, not Del and L.  I don't like Lana Del Rey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hope it's not Lana Del Rey.  I'm going to assume it's more like folky, acoustic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The one tonight was, I should have said yes, so we could have listened to it together maybe,  is a jazz piece.  That's perfect.  For sunset in New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Something acoustic so it'll play well on these speakers that look like they're tuned for.  Yeah, I think that's right.  Performance.  They did say Terrence Riley, but that can't be Terry Riley, the synthesizer guy.  That must be somebody else.  I didn't recognize anybody else on there.  Our show, we're going to take a break.  Come back, Supreme Court time.  And you're going to put on your robes and wake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What a thrilling tickler that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at that.  It's going to be in charge of our graphics from now on.  You already put up a sign that says Google versus Oracle.  Study up because that's the topic when we come back.  Our show today brought to you by Melissa.  Melissa, if you ever forgot to check the best buy date on a carton of milk, you probably know what  I'm talking about here when I say there's nothing worse than when your customer data goes bad.  They can really put a crimp in your rice krispies.  30% of customer data goes bad every year.  Email addresses change.  People move.  Phone numbers change.  Melissa has one job to make sure your data is accurate and current so you don't pester  the wrong customers.  You get to the right customers.  You don't send multiple copies of your catalog or your brochure.  Melissa got into this business 35 years ago at the time they were verifying zip codes.  But as times have changed, there's a lot more customer data and Melissa can verify it for you.  Automatically, they have so many ways to do this.  They have an API so you can build this into your own software.  Verify addresses, emails, phone numbers, and names in real time.  Bad data happens.  It's pretty darn easy.  Fumble fingered customer service reps or customers just accidentally putting in a wrong  number or a digit.  You don't want that to happen when somebody's there ordering your beautiful speakers.  You want to make sure they get to you and you get to them.  Melissa can also match and consolidate your records.  Their matching and deduplication tools help you uncover, merge, and purge hard-to-find  duplicate records.  Anybody who's ever synced their contact list knows how easy that is to get duplicates in there.  You want an accurate view of your customers.  They are so flexible.  Melissa can work on premises.  They can work as a web service.  They offer secure FTP upload and download.  So you can just upload them a customer list and download the corrected version.  It's also software as a service.

We thank you, Melissa, for supporting this week in Google.  Oracle versus Google, the case that just never ends.  How long has this been going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Feels like...  How long is this show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How long's Android?  Was it just a straight line?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's been forever.  This will be the last time.  This will be the last time.  This will be the...  Ten years ago, Oracle first sued Google.  The issue was Oracle owns Java.  Android is built on Java.  Oracle says, we never licensed Java to you.  In the ten years, there have been three trials, two appeals, millions spent on a parade of,  I'm reading for the verge, seasoned litigators, expert witnesses, and bizarre trial exhibits  intended to explain programming to non-technical juries.  May all have ended this morning.  Of course, they no longer...  It's a teleconference.  You don't go in person to the Supreme Court, but the oral arguments were today.  Decisions usually take a few months, so it's not going to be decided today.  But it's really interesting to know what this is all about.  At issue is not the fact that Google used Java.  They didn't.  They used the Java API.  In fact, 37 specific APIs that are at issue in the lawsuit.  At issue in the lawsuit, Oracle says, we own a piece of Android, billions of dollars worth  of Android, because you used not Java, but our API.  The issue is, can an API be copyrighted?  Lower courts have ruled that, yes, an API can be copyrighted.  There are issues because after all, Oracle, among other things, copies Amazon's API, their  S3 API, for Oracle's own database offerings online.  Oracle says, oh no, that's different.  Let me get Mike Masnick's article, because he talks about this.  Mike has so many good stories.  We could just make this the Mike Masnick Tech Dirt show, honestly.  Let me see if I can find this story.  It's buried now because he's talking about so much other stuff.  Good Lord.  I might have to go back to Google and search for it.  I think I do.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can we get Mike back on the show with Stacey at the same time?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's just great.  He's never been here with Stacey.  Mike Masnick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's so smart.  Did he sub for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think he subs for me a lot.  I've met Mike and we've had this like, I love your work.  I love your work.  I love your work.  You're so smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you're so smart.  It was mostly me just telling him he's smart, but he was gracious and did say he thought  I was smart, which was nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you're both smart, so there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's very smart about things I am not smart about.  And I don't really want to be smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I, however, am a reductionist to what that was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, my gosh.  I'm never going to live it down.  Oh, Jeff.  That was careless use of the English language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a third grade moment in scolding for that.  Yes.  Oh, come on.  So here's the story.  This was like a third grade.  This was from October 1st.  We're trying to vamp for you, Leo, until you find the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oracle is wrong about having permission to re-implement Amazon's API, but they shouldn't  need it.  Apparently, it has to do with bacon.  And it's like too complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, an API is, I mean, if Oracle was really pissed, they could change the APIs and break  it.  But no, it doesn't.  Break it for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is Google still using it or did they long ago get rid of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a good question.  I think they probably have proactively moved on.  Maybe that was the point of Dalvik.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google says that there's 11,500 codes encompassing these 37 Java APIs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google says they were written in a clean room, which is how you do it.  You say, we need this code to be given this input and to come out with this output,  but you figure out how to do it.  It's called reverse engineering.  It's happened.  That's how the PC marketplace started.  Reverse engineering the original PC BIOS with the Compaq.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot of tech is done today.  A lot of tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, Google and Sun, which owned Java at the time, were in negotiations.  Those negotiations failed.  Oracle bought Sun in 2010.  I remember talking to Jonathan Schwartz, who was the CEO of Sun at the time.  He was on a triangulation.  He said, the Oracle lawyers showed up and were completely uninterested in us until we mentioned  the patents on Java.  Then he said they started rubbing their hands with glee.  You could make the argument.  I think Jonathan was making the argument.  The only reason Oracle bought Sun is so that they could go after Google and other companies.  Oracle is not asserting that the APIs are the same.  They are saying that they violate copyright because they have the same function.  If you write code for the Java Standard Edition, it won't necessarily run on Android, but this helps.  The first run at the lawsuit resulted in a bifurcated trial in 2012, a trial for the patent claims,  and a trial for the patent claims.  The patent trial, the jury ruled in Google's favor.  In the copyright trial over APIs, the judge ruled.  The question that Google came down to was, is it fair use to use the API?  So really, fair use is on trial.  That jury hung.  Remember, this is the judge who taught himself Java so that he could be a good judge.  So that he could be the judge of this trial.  He ruled that the code was not covered by copyright.  However, the federal court in 2014 overturned that.  Another jury trial was convened two years later.  The jury once again ruled for Google.  Two years later, 2018, the Federal Circuit Court ruled that the jury verdict had to be set  aside in favor of Oracle because the evidence clearly indicated no fair use determination  could be reached.  Then it went to the Supreme Court, which I think sent it back down to the lower court.  I lost track at this point.  But this is a big deal because it could really affect the software industry in general.  The question of whether Java APIs could be covered by copyright really affects all APIs  and whether they are copyrighted and copyrightable.  There are so many examples of APIs being duplicated.  As I said, Oracle's even doing that right now with Amazon's S3.  They say because it's open source, we can do that.  We'll see.  We'll see.  Loop hole.  So this is the verge writing.  Let me see who wrote this because it's well written.  I give the author credit.  It's Sarah Jong.  She's very good.  She's very good.  She says the decade long grudge match between Google and Oracle is not entirely rational.  Google's re-implementation of the Java APIs is part of a long tradition of iteration that  was mostly taken for granted until now.  Products like Oracle's own MySQL were created as an iteration, aka homage, to IBM's SQL.  To put things roughly, coding is the process of speaking to the machine.  Very few people who develop software in this day and age  actually speak directly to the machine.  Software exists in layers upon layers, a game of whispers that eventually reaches the bare  metal of the computer.  New languages derived from old, new libraries built on existing ones, dependencies stacked  on top of one another like a game of Jenga that is about to end at any moment.  Google versus Oracle is a case that is happening at one of the lowest levels of an ongoing  game of Jenga.  And you know what happens.  When you pull out a little piece of wood at the lowest level of a game of Jenga.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How much money is at stake in this?  Do we have any idea?  Billions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they want to stake in Android.  They claim, Oracle claims, no, we should get a piece of Android for eternity.  So billions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Oracle bought a data, Oracle bought Sleepy Cat to get the MySQL stuff.  And the reason they bought it was so they could actually hobble open source.  Oh, that's a good point.  It's very similar to what Jonathan Schwartz was saying.  We want to regulate something, regulate that behavior.  And Oracle, dude, they own TikTok now.  They got it.  Donald Trump gave it to a man, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of people are concerned in the open source community because that's one of the  things you do in open source.  Something like Wine, which allows Windows software to run on Linux, is essentially,  it's not an emulator.  That's what it stands for.  Wine is not an emulator.  It basically copies the API.  And so when you make an API call that you think is to Microsoft Windows,  the Linux box handles it properly because it has the API.  Independently developed compatible API.  And so I can go, I could give you example after example in open source and in closed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  source.  Does Wine run worth a dang these days?  Yeah, it runs pretty good.  It gets better all the time.  It drove me nuts years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I think it's a lot better than it used to be.  Although I think it maybe its time has come and gone since there's so much good software.  Correct.  You don't really need to use Microsoft Office on Linux anymore.  Yeah, not anymore.  Court observers listening this morning found that while the justices seemed to side with  Oracle on the copyright arguments, they were deferential to the arguments presented by  Microsoft who had taken Google's side in this case because they're in a similar situation.  There was a good story about how Google and Oracle both have  generated huge numbers of amicus briefs.  This is how you lobby the Supreme Court.  In theory, these briefs are not associated with the plaintiffs.  They're just by people who are experts.  But it turns out many of these experts work for either Oracle or Google in one way or  the other.  Microsoft argued in an amicus brief that our ruling in Oracle's favor could upend the  software industry.  I'd agree with that.  Justice Gorsuch was also seen to focus heavily on the Seventh Amendment arguments and whether  the federal districts ruling...  Oh boy.  This is a complication.  It doesn't look like this is going to end anytime soon though.  It will in a couple of months.  This is it, right?  Unless...  Yeah, there's no way that's going to end.  Unless they send it back.  They can do that.  They could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got a hunch it's going to keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think it's done.  But it could be done in a way that we're not too happy about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Those lawyers still want to get paid.  They've been hurting during the pandemic.  So stretch it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  CNBC's Tucker Higgins.  Things got technical at the Supreme Court as the justices heard arguments this morning  in a blockbuster copyright dispute at the end of the hour and a half arguments.  Justice Stephen Breyer, who at one point read aloud some Java code,  appeared to be the only sure vote for Google.  Several other of the justices, including Chief Justice Roberts,  said they were sympathetic to Oracle's copyright claim,  even as they appeared to rule reluctant to rule in its favor.  So it's unknown.  It's unknown.  Brett Kavanaugh and Samuel Alita noted that Google's allies  had warned the sky will fall if Oracle won.  Roberts said, we're told if we agree with Oracle,  we will ruin the tech industry in the United States.  Brett Kavanaugh said, I'm not aware this guy has fallen in the last five or six years  despite Google losing its first battle in 2014.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We need Jim Jordan to come in and start yelling about it too.  That would set this off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So sometimes you try to read the tea leaves, like the questions the justices ask,  but it sounds like as is often the case, it's impossible to tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is one of those things I'm like, God, just let it be over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like, well, but I honestly think it would be a disaster if they ruled it.  It would be a disaster.  It would be really bad for Oracle.  It would be terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But dang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cannot pay me enough to care about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google confirms that Pixel 5 does not have the Pixel Neural Core.  The core is no more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What happened to it?  Was it no good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The hardware apparently was always on listening, would help with that,  it would help with learning.  I think that they tried to get the price down on the Pixel 5.  And as a result, they dumped a lot of features.  Ironically, and this is probably because they had a deal with Verizon,  they did put in millimeter wave 5G, which no one has, no one needs,  and probably only a handful of people will ever use.  At a cost of, it's estimated another $100.  So that $699 phone probably could have been $599 if they hadn't had to bow to Verizon  and put millimeter wave in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Such a racket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Another reason they didn't need the Neural Core, they got rid of the face ID.  You know, Soli's gone, the face ID is gone.  They use a fingerprint reader.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Seems like I saw a report that they weren't totally done with Soli.  Google, that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Google's, Rico Stolo said, it'll be Soli some other time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think your theory on this one was they needed a cheaper phone for this.  That's what they really wanted to do.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the rumor is that they're going to stick Soli in thermostat because  that would make sense.  Yeah.  Filing a while back on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Soli was the kind of the 3D radar that allowed you to,  and it never worked for me, I'll try it again,  wave at your Pixel 4.  Oh, for music?  Yeah, for music and for dang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it doesn't work with the dang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As in the words of Ant Pro, it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  doesn't work with a dang.  I love that.  Well, it reminds me of the Newton.  It's kind of midair Newton.  Yeah, it was dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would recognize that my hand was there.  I'd see the little highlight at the top of the bezel.  But after that, it was just dead.  It would never consistently work.  Such a flop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So one of the things I was excited about is it has a metal back, the Pixel 5.  And I was excited because even though it has a metal back,  which is right and good and proper, it still can do wireless charging,  which we thought was impossible.  It is impossible.  You can't do it through a metal back.  So there's basically a hole in the aluminum,  which is filled in with plastic, bio-resin, according to Google.  And that's where the coil lives.  Hey, but that's not glass, though.  It's not glass.  No, plastic's fine.  And it feels like metal because everything around it's metal.  So that's how they did it.  Smart.  Clever.  Just a matter of time before Jerry rigs everything, punches a hole in the plastic, though.  Did we talk about the plan to pay publishers a billion dollars last week, Jeff?  I can't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think we did.  That's that new.  It's that new.  But I wrote about similar things before.  I actually think it's a mistake because I think it sets a precedent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this the victory you were referring to with Rupert Murdoch earlier?  It was Murdoch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there's another story in the rundown about that, specifically for Maxios.  So it's not immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's over the next three years.  It's to curate high-quality journalism.  And this is how companies like Google do this.  They don't want to set a precedent by giving in an Australian saying,  okay, here's some money for those snippets.  So they create a new product.  They call it Google News.  Same thing Facebook did.  Facebook did exactly the same thing.  Google News Showcase.  We're going to give you money when we use your news in the Google News Showcase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We get a whole article, not just a snippet.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rupert gets his money.  We're syndicating the content.  He goes away, happy, and shuts up about the whole thing.  And so Murdoch was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this is okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's okay with Murdoch.  It's okay with Murdoch.  I think it sets a precedent because why wouldn't, you know, news is a tiny part  tiny, tiny part of search results.  And I can imagine others coming along and trying to say, well, I got value too.  Watch me and me.  And it means that we're, you know, if we don't have a search of everything that's available,  it's another case where we end up with pay walls that prevent the free exchange of knowledge.  And that's what scares me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you think of the product that showcase itself?  It hasn't launched here to launch first in Brazil and Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know because I haven't seen it yet, but the same, the problem with all of these things  is they're going to, they're going to naturally favor the big old guys.  And so all of this stuff prevents new upstart comers.  This is antitrust on the media part, right?  This is the media place using all of their clout.  You want to talk about the use of, of, of, of clout to get what you want.  Media has been doing that full bore, getting laws passed throughout Europe,  threatening things in the U S pushing the antitrust in Europe, especially pushing it here,  pushing it in Australia.  And so media have engaged in huge antitrust behavior and conflict of interest.  And every time they cover a story about the giants, don't, don't trust them folks because  they're in a conflict of interest.  Right.  They never acknowledge that.  So it's boring.  I don't want to bore the world with that, but I'm, yeah, I think it's, I think it's a bad move.  I wrote a post saying basically this is the fruit of bribery.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know, and you know, it is because Murdoch says, oh good, that's fine.  Well now I'm fine.  And do you think that Australia's legislators will say, oh, well, Frupert's happy.  We're happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they might.  Okay.  Right.  I think that probably got negotiated.  I think it's a cynical, I think I'm not, I'm not, I'm not blaming Google.  I'm not blaming Facebook.  They got stuck in a position, but what gets hurt, they,  yeah, when I defend against some of this regulation, I am not defending the companies.  I'm defending internet freedom of expression.  And the, the, these companies become the representatives and proprietors of the internet  as we have it today.  And so it ends up looking like that, but they're not good proprietors, right?  They're going to, they're Siva Vaadanaathan, he and I love each other, but disagree about things.  He would say, Jeff, no, a company is going to be a company company is not going to stand for  principle.  A company is going to be a company.  That's their job.  What's happening here.  Yeah.  That's what they're doing.  What's in their interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're just doing what's in his interest.  And we, the people, we just have to, right.  Just have to put up with it.  Speaking of which, I do like his dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rupert's dog.  Oh, his dog's great.  Oh, do you see his new dog?  Whiskey?  Whiskey.  Yeah.  Both the dogs.  Yeah.  Butter, butter and whiskey.  Yeah.  Which I said, what's the next dog to be named?  Bechamel?  Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where do you, where do you see this?  How did I miss this?  Is it Rupert's dog?  No, Siva Vaadanaathan.  Oh, Siva's dog.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Siva's dog is great.  So we're just on this topic.  He's got a very beautiful chirp.  Yeah.  James Ball, who's a guardian, former guardian journalist,  has a book coming out this week called The Tangled Web Weave Inside the Shadow System  that Shapes the Internet.  It was called something else in the UK, which is just absurd.  They used different titles.  I'll probably disagree with most of the book, but James is a very good journalist.  Is this the, is this the British name, the system?  That's the British name, the system.  Who owns the internet and how it owns us.  The Tangled Web Weave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Different cover, different title, which is absurd because this moment right now,  if somebody's listening to us in the UK, they're going to look for the wrong book.  Anyway.  What is the premise?  Who is James and what is he?  The premise is he gets into what is the real structure of the internet  and who owns it and controls it and how that affects us.  And I opened up my Rolodex and made lots of introductions for him.  He's a good journalist.  I'm sure I disagree.  I haven't read it yet.  I haven't had it yet.  I'm sure I disagree with many of his conclusions,  but he's a very good journalist and I am an open-minded fellow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you believe that the internet dream has curdled?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think that the internet dream that I had is not living up to its full  possibilities, but we've got about five centuries to go before we figure it out.  So we've got time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who does he claim runs the shadow system behind it all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He talks about computers and James was part of the team on the WikiLeaks.  He was part of the team on the Snowden.  Oh, Jesus, I should know this James.  I'm sorry.  I think he was at WikiLeaks and then I think he went to the Guardian  and worked with them on the Snowden piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's the American cover.  I'll give you the American cover so you get the right book.  Let's see here.  A couple more things.  Facebook has been queuing on.  What a surprise actually because Facebook really kind of, for reasons I don't fully  understand, has been resisting this all along.  It's because of the Republican Congress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why they get smashed.  They take anything down, including QAnon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is what's interesting.  We live in an interesting time.  Now there's a one month to the election, then there'll be a couple of months in  a regnum, a lame duck session of Congress.  Well, we'll see.  Maybe it will or will not be a lame duck president.  And then if there is a new president, January 20th will be a new president.  Are companies going to...  They're obviously very political, right?  So you're saying that Facebook's...  Are they actually predicting the election results and saying,  okay, it's safe to ban QAnon now?  Or are they...  I suspect they're really...  I think they're...  Well, they should have banned it.  Why they didn't ban it before is maybe a better question.  I also think there's some significant concern  come November 3rd.  And you're seeing Facebook say, we are going to be very aggressive about blocking  false posts on election day and the days following.  Twitter saying the same thing.  There's some concern that they're going to take the fall once again  for the results of the election.  Does that sound sensible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, whoever's loses is going to try to blame them, sure.  Sorry, Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you think?  I disagree.  I don't think that sounds sensible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're not worried about that.  They're just business as usual.  Because they know they...  You're right.  Doesn't matter what happens.  They're going to get crap no matter what happens.  Okay.  Fair enough.  Yeah, they have banned the conspiracy theory QAnon.  There's a really interesting piece in Bloomberg today  about the guy who really put it on the map  who was an executive, a technology executive at a big bank.  Was it Citibank?  I think it was.  Who created the first QAnon centralized site for information.  And it's quite a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's be clear about one thing.  Let's say that tomorrow absolutely every mention of QAnon disappears on Facebook and Twitter.  Our problems ain't over, folks.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but it helps.  There are lots of people being radicalized.  I don't know if you're radicalized in a QAnon.  People I love are seeing these and giving them credence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what? That's a good use of stupid, Stacey.  You're made stupid.  That's an okay use of the word stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, QAnon is not reductionist.  It's the exact opposite.  It's the most bizarrely elaborate influx theory.  The latest is the president's COVID diagnosis is all fake  because he's going undercover to set the stage for the storm.  Which, you know, okay, fine.  We've recommended in the past articles,  there was a great one on Atlantic about QAnon,  but this article at Bloomberg Business Week about a Citigroup tech executive  who was doing just fine but created a website that really launched QAnon.  By the way, website...  Who was part of it?  Well, no one's part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all been...  No, but he was a sympathizer.  He wasn't trying to expose it.  No, big time synthesizer.  Sympathizer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, no, no.  He...  So it starts about his radicalization.  Like many future Donald Trump voters,  giving credit to the author William Turton and Joshua Brustein,  like many future Donald Trump voters,  Jason Glynas felt something shift inside him during the presidency of Barack Obama.  Things were going okay for him generally.  He had a degree from Fordham,  held a series of jobs at big financial services firms,  eventually becoming a senior vice president at Citigroup  in the company's technology department.  He was married with kids, had a comfortable house in a New Jersey suburb.  According to those who knew him, he was a pleasant guy  who was into normal stuff, game of thrones, recreational soccer.  Things did get weird though when politics came up.  He was a registered Democrat in the run-up to 2008,  but then seemed to drift to the right.  And not an, and I'm going to vote for Romney this time sort of way.  He hated the idea of Obama, one of his friends  speaking in the condition of anonymity said he thought it was a setup.  And he, and Obama was elected to satisfy the black population.  He sometimes referred to him as the anti-Christ,  significantly immersed in right-wing internet conspiracy theories.  QAnon, which started on 4chan later migrated to 8chan,  kind of drew him in in 2018 while doing his job at Citi,  created as an anonymous side project,  a website dedicated to bringing QAnon to a wider audience,  soccer moms, white collar workers, and other normies like Stacey's family.  By mid 2020, the site Qmap.pub was drawing 10 million visitors a month  and was credited by researchers with playing a key role,  a key role in turning an obscure and incoherent cult  into an incoherent cult with mainstream political ambitions.  So that's the problem is that's a website.  Anybody who's into QAnon doesn't care if they could see it on Facebook.  What it would do is stop anybody who's not into QAnon, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I was going to say Facebook helps people find QAnon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Well, we just did too.  Well, what happens is, this is where Dana Boyd screams about this,  is that when you say things like, it's out there enough now,  if you say things like incel, people say, what the hell's incel?  They go to Google and they search what's incel.  And then it's primed, it's ready for you to do that  because they've planted the seeds across them.  And so you're going to go down their rabbit hole.  And it doesn't, so it doesn't matter where you hear about it.  You can hear about it on Fox.  You can hear about an email from your uncle.  You hear about it anywhere.  It's going to be out there.  Right. And so the idea that, I mean, I think the part of the presumption is,  is like, oh, what took Facebook so long?  True. Yes.  They should have had, my argument about Facebook is they should have a  North Star of decent behavior and this doesn't fall under it.  They should have gotten rid of it.  But free speech, blah, blah, blah.  Even if they get rid of it, it wouldn't have made much difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So he was doxxed and shut the place down.  Was fired from Citi.  This was back last month, September 10th.  Man, yeah.  Took that long?  Yeah. So that site is down if you go there right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to see if we could do a changelog soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. It's time for Stacey's Hungry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's time for the Google changelog that you did to get rid of QAnon.  Change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  G Suite has a new name.  Oh, F me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you still can't use it, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So don't worry.  Exactly.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is now Google Workspace, Gmail Drive, Docs and Meet.  And see the new logos.  See the new icons.  People aren't too happy about these new icons.  That's the bottom row.  That's the top row is the old icons.  They're really strange.  What is with them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're very flat.  They're googly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't mind that they're flat.  I like that they're consistent, but I have no idea.  I would never click on the Docs thing.  What is that?  Also, is that Meet?  That's Meet, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. It's a camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  Okay. I was like, is that Hangouts?  Is that Meet?  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're just googly.  It's just bad.  We know they're not great with design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ever since Marissa left for Yahoo, it's all been downhill.  Live View and Google Maps.  I think I did this last week.  Live View and Google Maps will help you visualize your destination in the real world.  No, I haven't talked about that.  Maybe I just told my friends.  Well, they've had that, but this was approved.  Yeah. They talked about it.  I didn't do it last week because we had one talking about the pixel all day.  All right.  You can access Live View from the Transit tab in Google Maps, and it'll help you.  I think this is really good.  They talked about this two years ago.  I'm glad they finally did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They did it, but it just wasn't possible to use.  I was like in Italy trying to use it.  Oh, I remember that.  Yeah.  I have to go back around and do this again, and it didn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'll also be able to do Live View and location sharing.  So you'll be able to open Google Maps, find your location,  tap on a friend's icon, and tap Live View, and then point your camera at buildings and  signs across the street, and then send it to the friend with a little thing that says this way.  So if your friend's close...  That's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's kind of neat.  I'm over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pins are more accurate because...  Does that mean I can find my car again?  Yeah, because one problem was the pin wouldn't be intelligent about where it was.  So it might be on top of a building instead of on the street next to the building.  I've got a weird problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  So for years now, Google doesn't recognize my house.  It knows where my house is.  It knows that in lots of ways.  But it says that I've reached home a quarter mile back.  And I know where home is, so that's not a big deal.  That's not good.  But here's the problem.  I can't keep my phone unlocked in my house because it doesn't recognize the geolocation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Well, you shouldn't have that long driveway and that moat.  No, I was going to say if you use...  The crocodiles kept Google away.  To create a recipe tied to your phone.  So you'll put the IFTTT app on your phone, then you'll go to IFTTT,  and you'll use your home Wi-Fi as a way to keep it unlocked.  Smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what am I calling for IFTTT?  What's the call in Google to let me unlock the app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you go to...  You have to create an applet.  Let's see if...  And actually, I don't know if the applet supports unlock my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what you get, Jeff, for blurring your house on Google Maps.  You're a blurrer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm the last person on Earth who'll do that.  Oh, that's right.  You don't like blurring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What am I saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was like, really?  No.  That seems so not Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, here's something I like.  They're going to turn off face retouching on the Google selfie camera,  and they're going to take away labels for the retouching that imply that you're ugly.  That's good stuff.  I think this is really good.  They're not going to use the word beauty anymore.  For the beauty filter, things like that.  I think that's really good.  You'll have a button that says apply face retouching,  and you'll have a choice between subtle, smooth, and off.  It's not going to say put on a beauty filter.  That's good.  Thank you, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The same functionality is there.  They just changed the labeling?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and it's not automatic either.  It's off by default.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's always really crappy when your app's like, you look like crap today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me fix that up for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me see if I can help you out.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I take a selfie and Google thinks, dang, do you have a dirty lens or something?  That really looks bad, brother.  That was a great-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the equivalent of, hey, you look tired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I hate it when people say that.  They say this to me all the time, and I just say, no, I'm just old.  I'm just old.  Interesting piece by Eric Fung in Medium.  Why is everybody adding stories?  Google, by the way, one of the companies adding stories.  Slack just added stories.  Slack?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How are you going to use a Slack story?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is just one more way to screw off at work.  Every single one, Eric writes, of the top eight most popular social platforms  offer their own version of stories.  YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Snapchat, Twitter, and WhatsApp.  It's all because of Snapchat, right?  Well, yeah, Snapchat invented it.  But now we have to add stories.  The kids like it, so we got to have it for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would like to create a LinkedIn story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not going to lie.  I would have so much fun making fun of that as a medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He writes actually a really good piece in Medium about why stories,  they can be emotionally deep, but they're relatively easy to do.  And I don't know.  Easy to consume.  Yeah, easy to consume, but they disappear, right?  You put effort into them.  You can't go across in an imperative way.  Is there anywhere stories don't disappear like your stories live on?  I would like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Highlights.  Highlights.  Instagram highlights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those stay.  And they're just like stories.  They can have video, text, all that stuff.  Okay, good.  So Google is introducing stories to the Google app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just what you need.  Nobody will see them.  Just what you need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly, Ant.  Exactly.  Now, these stories are not made by you and me.  These stories are made by participating publishers.  Full screen.  There we go again.  Yeah, it's a little slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're favoring the big old guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's keep going.  What else is happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't get me started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No sidetracking.  Keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google Wi-Fi is back.  99 bucks.  Get one of these pills.  Put it on your thing.  And that one.  I got a question here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, because that's not the 5 gig.  That's not.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't get it.  It's the AC 1200.  So it's not Wi-Fi 6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  Oh my god.  5G Wi-Fi 6.  It's not Wi-Fi 6.  Don't buy it.  Sorry.  Not Wi-Fi 6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But on the other hand, 6E is coming.  So don't buy Wi-Fi 6 either.  Don't buy anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  6E is not going to matter in your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I ask a question, old geniuses.  Yes.  So I'm trying to keep my deck going as long as I can.  I bought a heater for out there.  And the Wi-Fi is not perfect.  So I bought a fourth Google Wi-Fi thingamajigger.  Oh, you use that?  Oh.  I do.  So I already had three of them.  So I bought a fourth one.  And I guess it's too late to return.  So, shush.  And so here's the question.  Here's the question.  So to hook it into the other three,  I've got to switch my existing three from Google Wi-Fi to Google Home.  Is there any booby trap waiting for me there?  Yes.  It's going to be OK?  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I haven't done it.  But I can tell you that that's not going to go the way you want it to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because that's just Google Home.  That's why I'm asking, Stacey.  You're the person to ask.  Oh, no.  What's going to happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know how it's going to screw up.  But I guarantee it's going to break something that you've set up.  And you're going to have to deal with it.  I'm sorry.  I wish I could tell you something like cheery and happy.  But every time I've messed with a Google setup,  it's just delete everything and start over from scratch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why get a Jacquard backpack from Yves Saint Laurent at $1,000  when you could get one from Samsonite at $200?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm actually kind of like I'm jamming on the design.  I'm like, yeah, it's not crazy expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so the idea is you would what you touch the straps and you can turn the volume up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you can actually custom do this stuff, too.  So you can just be like, I really I'm trying to think of something I do a lot that would make  sense.  Like I listen.  I have your husband's on the Tesla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Where's my husband now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not going to be something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where is my husband?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have Google read my tweets to me.  And then I'll do my custom thing.  Maybe it's a bomb bomb bomb.  And then it'll be like, oh, she's making that sign.  All right, let's read her tweets.  That's a really stupid example.  I'll be honest.  But otherwise, volume, get down, skip songs, talk to Google Assistant, all of that.  You can do all of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobel prizes in chemistry for only I think the third time ever go to a woman for their work.  Ladies, Emmanuel Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna, the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for  Discovering CRISPR, the Cas9 Genetic Citizers used to cut DNA.  Nice job.  Nice job.  And they seem like nice ladies, too.  I like it when I like it when people win Nobel prizes.  There's also a Nobel Prize for physics going to the fellas, the three fellas,  who discovered or make big breakthroughs in black holes.  Sir Roger Penrose, the best known, Andrea Gays and Reinhard Gensel.  Penrose is a Brit, very popular in Great Britain for his science books.  He gets a half share of the Swedish 10 million kronor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And a stick of dynamite.  No.  And really, they should give him a stick of dynamite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because after all, this is Alfred Nobel's penance for inventing dynamite.  He gets his money for the discovery that black hole formation is a robust  prediction of the general theory of relativity.  Are we still on the change line?  Oh, no, we're not.  I'm sorry, I forgot to stop it.  And that's the Google change log.  Good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These are all things you can Google.  Every time we get sidetracked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google owns black holes.  Of course they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we should do a commercial and finish this up with your picks of the week.  So say us all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So say us all.  Aye.  See we all.  Aye.  Aye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This show is brought to you this week by Twilio.  Love the Twilio.  Do you ever do any Twilio stuff, Stacey?  It feels like you could might have maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  Well, and yes, yes, I have done things with Twilio.  I love Twilio.  Sim, they used to host our voicemail.  See?  They still host a phone number.  And they just forced me to move to two factor authentication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As they should.  They created Authy, which is the best two factor authenticator in the planet, the one  I've been recommending.  But that's really a small part of their business.  What Twilio really is, is about communication.  It's a platform for developers that lets you build new ways to talk to your customers.  Basically, wherever your customers might be.  Text messages, sure.  Emails, you got it.  Phone calls, video, newsletters.  Let me give you some idea of the scale Twilio operates at.  795 plus billion interactions with five nines of uptime.  That's 99.999% uptime and three billion phone numbers across more than 100 countries.  I think Twilio is the coolest.  I've had a Twilio account for years just for my little toy applications.  But man, big companies use it.  Shopify runs their entire global contact center.  More than a million customers on Twilio's flex platform.  That's their programmable contact center solution.  Blue Apron powers newsletter emails with Twilio's send grid.  Netflix, you ever use two factor on Netflix?  You ought to.  And of course, how do they do it?  Twilio.  Ride sharing and contactless delivery services like Lyft and Uber connect riders and drivers  over text messaging with Twilio.  Developers love Twilio and so will you.  Product and operation teams use Twilio to create new ways to communicate with their  users inside applications.  For everything from account notifications to text messaging to chat bots, yep, Twilio does it.  To securing online accounts with two factor.  Marketing teams will use Twilio to get the word out with text messaging and phone calls.  They send campaigns over email.  They build chat bots to answer questions.  Customer service teams love Twilio flex.  They can build global contact and support centers with flex.  It's a fully programmable contact center application.  Look, you don't have to be a telecom guru to create great Twilio programs.  You can do it with a few lines of code.  In fact, if you already know how to do web apps,  you have everything you need to know to build apps that text, call, chat,  video conference, because Twilio does the hard part.  It's built by developers for developers and it is fantastic.  Strengthen your customer relationships by uniting communications across your entire business.  That's what Julie did at Blue Apron.  Go to Twilio.com to learn more today.  Twilio, Twilio.com.  Twilio, it's time to build.  Yeah, I ask that question all the time.  And I knew if I asked you, Stacey, you'd say yes, because everybody I know,  I'm sure Andrew's like all over the Twilio.  Everybody I know who does anything in this area says, oh yeah, that's the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I need a shirt that says I'm all over the Twilio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the year 2245, if man is still alive,  Half the atoms on the earth will be digital data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No sense.  Only half?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, okay.  It's the transmission of electrons that flip in a transistor.  That's your zero or one.  So an electron is, it's part of an atom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is the work of Melvin.  Some guy named Melvin.  No, this is the work of Melvin.  Melvin's taking you to the...  Some guy named Melvin figured this out.  No, Melvin Vopson.  He's from the University of Portsmouth in England.  He started at the fact that the earth contains roughly 10 to the 21st or 100 billion,  billion bits of computer information.  Assuming a 20% percent digital annual growth rate.  He showed that 350 years from now, the number of data bits on the earth will be greater than  all the atoms inside it, of which there are 10 to the 50th or 100 trillion trillion trillion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The atoms are data.  No.  It doesn't make no sense.  It makes no sense.  There'll be more bits of data than there are atoms on earth.  What is a bit, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is a bit an electron?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A bit is a piece of...  Yeah.  It's a state.  It's a zero or a one.  That's how it's stored.  It's a state.  Yeah.  That's why I'm confused.  And then we're also going to be transmitting data optically soon.  So then what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And multiple layers.  Leo, that was a ticket ticket from the expert numbers.  You should have done 39.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was an awful number, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  Well, expert numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What the hell do you call this letter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a Y with two dots above it.  And how do you pronounce it?  Ye.  It's the first letter in...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that the next child of Tesla owner?  Maybe ye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It happens to be the first letter of a startup that just raised another $224 million,  adding that to its already impressive $148 million cash haul.  There might be a haul because their business is...  Speaking of black holes.  Raising bugs.  They're a big...  For food.  Bug.  Yeah, for food.  Yeah.  They're a big bug farm.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They want to do...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, it's for fish food, so we don't have to eat it.  And it's vertical farming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's not really vertical farming, but they've borrowed from vertical farming,  and they do these massive trays of mealworms, which I can't imagine...  If you imagine walking into a container full of mealworms.  Oh, gross.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  High-tech vertical insect farms.  Perfect proteins, these mealworms, for fish.  But what do the mealworms eat?  What do the mealworms eat?  When do we start creating farms for the mealworms?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, they're not flying in gregarious, y'all.  They love to be together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good, because they're kind of jammed together in that vertical bug farm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Crickets apparently are not good for that.  No.  Because they need more space.  Okay.  Yep.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder if they use TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My thing of the week, you guys, is great.  I really do like it, and it's plugged in kind of far away,  so it's hard for me to show you.  I'm trying.  This is the new Google audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's pretty.  In sand.  Very pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look, it matches my pink walls.  It's fabric-colored.  It is pretty.  Fabric all over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the back look like?  They never show the back.  Nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ta-da.  Looks like nothing.  Nope.  There is something.  There is a mic.  Yes.  This is the mic turn-off button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the mute.  Yep.  Always like that.  Thank you.  Mute.  Google always does that.  Google stuff with cameras, it blocks the camera too,  which is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  Cool.  The mic's off.  Oh, there it's off.  The mic's back on.  Okay, so.  The mic's back on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The mic's back on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it is...  What do you want to know about it?  Play some music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to hear the music.  Really?  Does it sound good?  What do you want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it sounds really good, actually.  I'm thinking I've got this huge space to fill,  and I think two of these might do it,  but I also want to test the Echo Studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could do stereo pairing.  You can do multi-resound.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you can say, send this music to the kitchen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do all these things.  Google says that it's adaptive,  in terms of if I turn on a fan or people are shouting,  it will respond to that.  In my tests, it told me to...  Google was like, take a toothbrush or a razor,  like a shaver and go near it,  and you will hear the music change.  But I didn't hear it in either day and night.  So I don't know what that's about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like the music will change if you're brushing your teeth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, like if you bring a noise close to the speaker,  it's supposed to somehow adapt to that and play it louder,  so it doesn't change the way you hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't have the equipment to measure that,  and just based on my hearing, I could not tell anything.  I don't remember what piece I was listening to.  I was listening to some classical music.  Oh, it was Yo-Yo Ma playing Bach, I think it was.  Oh, nice.  And the cello sounded really nice,  and then there was like some oboe maybe coming in.  It's still a low instrument, but it's different than a cello.  It was very distinct and clear, and it did sound good.  So yeah, I like this.  I mean, it's not going to compete with maybe your Otis,  or the Dyna drivers or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, unfortunately, I already bought a pair of speakers  during the show, so I can't buy any more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And these are only $99, and we'll be able to see  when we get the Amazon Echo 4,  which is what this is going to compete with at a price point.  The other thing is it's heavy.  It's like almost 3 pounds.  It's 2.6 pounds, I think, 2.8 pounds,  so it's a, which is nice for a speaker.  And yeah, I like it.  Do y'all want specs?  I have a spec sheet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, we can look that up.  Okay.  This was one more thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One more thing.  It's dual band Wi-Fi, so it will work on 2.4 and 5 MHz,  which is nice.  That's good.  And it has Bluetooth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Could I play, I wonder if it would play the high-res music,  say from Tidal or Deezer?  Or Prime Phonic, my classical choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know about that.  That's interesting.  They didn't mention that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  5G has enough bandwidth to do that for sure.  My pick of the week is this band I just discovered called Boney James.  You ever hear about him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He plays the sax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The best man on the sax.  I loved that.  I thought that sounded great.  Thank you, Anne, for that recommendation.  Really good.  A number of the week for Mr. Jeffrey Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With one number, I'm just going to tear apart all your arguments by antitrust.  I'm just going to make it all completely irrelevant  and show you that you're just behind the times.  You're just fighting yesterday's war.  It doesn't matter.  So in only three years now, TikTok is half the size of Facebook in the UK.  17 million people using it over an hour a day on the app versus 37 million users in the UK for Facebook.  So who needs antitrust regulations when the market will do something?  And by the way, you want to regulate TikTok?  Good effing luck.  British users are the most numerous in Europe, but they're not the most dedicated.  TikTok's 1.2 million Norwegian users open the app 17 times a day,  spending 74 minutes scrolling through the video because what the heck, it's cold up there.  There's nothing else to do but to recognize that you're in a wonderful place.  You don't have to worry about life.  You can just watch TikTok.  It sounds lovely to me.  I would love to do that.  France has 11 million users.  Germany, 10.7 million.  TikTok's pretty good.  So TikTok's growing away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Italians, I'm going to really miss them next month when they go away.  The commerce department cuts off the spigot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In Spain, the other three quarters TikTok users are female.  TikTok's Nordic audience is evenly split along gender lines.  And so that's my number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you, Mr. Jeff Jarvis.  And now Aunt Pruitt's pick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got two.  The first one is a bit of a bone to pick with you.  Uh-oh.  It's on the panel from Twit this past Sunday.  What did I do?  Talking about the $2 bill as if no one uses the $2 bill.  No one uses a $2 bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, look here, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where'd you get that?  Oh, it's got a Clemson paw print on it.  That is a Clemson tiger do dollar bill.  Can you use that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't that illegal?  Aren't you legally facing gender?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We go to the banks and we stamp our $2 bills for every time we go out of town for an away game.  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you've been to two away games?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, this is just one that I've kept.  That's cool.  But yes, the idea was...  The coach wanted to spread the word about Clemson fans traveling and going to the football  games and say, hey, pay with your $2 bills.  And it spawned into paying with $2 bills with the paw stamp on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That way the merchant knows, oh, they're in town for a Tigers game.  And so now we have...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I know it's different this season, but college football bowl season is pretty big for money.  And people are always sort of just hoping, please bring Clemson, please bring Clemson,  because Clemson fans travel and they spend money.  And there's proof of it right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, because we were talking about how $2 bills you can apparently,  I didn't know this, buy them from the US Treasury uncut.  So like on a sheet and that Steve Wozniak takes the $2 bills and binds them into a pad.  Here he is holding a pad of $2 bills.  And then when he goes to a store, he cuts a bill off.  So the whole game is he's trying to get them to accuse him of counterfeiting.  So he'll say things, oh, no, this is approved by the US Treasury.  Oh, geeks, man.  I love geeks.  They're so legit.  I love a geek.  So that's good.  So I'm glad to know there are other uses for $2 bills.  What town is Clemson in?  Clemson, South Carolina.  It's the name is Clemson.  So I don't think the merchants of Clemson have  underestimate the impact of Clemson football on their business.  I'm guessing.  I'm just guessing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We were always funny though, the couple of times that I've traveled,  not even related to football and people would know that I'm a fan.  They always mentioned, oh, we know when you guys are in town because you bring those dad gum,  $2 bills.  That's hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love that.  I did not know that.  That's a great story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What was your other pick?  My other one is October.  This is breast cancer awareness month.  I don't know how long I've been wearing this little bracelet.  I've seen you wear that.  I've had it for up to 10 years now.  I don't remember when I put it on, but it's been on here for several years.  But hey, folks, yeah, this is serious.  Men and women, there's been friends and family affected near and dear to me.  So yeah, let's raise awareness.  And if you can spare a dollar or two, even right now during the pandemic,  to help with the research, do so.  Breast cancer awareness month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's MP Jarvis.  I have a whole mess of whiteboards.  I don't know if you can see it here.  There's a whole bunch of whiteboards over there.  Oh, we got to get you some good ones.  Good Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good Lord, that's right.  He's got collection.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why do you have so many whiteboards?  Because I organized like a book chapter and then I don't want to erase it because I still  want to work on it.  And so I put that aside.  Then it's like Flintstone tablets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I was like, you could take a picture.  I'm like, I have one whiteboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, sir.  Maybe we can have Jeff singing...
