Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hi, good to see you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Once a month, we are blessed with Gina's presence  because of course she's got her own dang startup.  She's very busy doing-  She's doing a metal thing.  Doing think up, but it's going great, I could tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's going well, thank you.  Yeah, I'm happy to be here.  This is the first,  well, we got to do the I.O. keynote together last week.  That was fun, thank you for joining us.  That was really fun, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was actually jealous I wasn't on the air with you guys.  Did you want to join?  Oh, you were in the I.O.?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was in there, I was there, yeah.  Jeff Jarvis is here from the City University of New York  or is a professor of journalism, BuzzMachine dot com.  He's written the book, What Would Google Do?  And many others, including public parts  and his latest geek-sparing gifts.  And you were at Google I.O.  I was at Google I.O.  Fun, fun.  So was Mike Elgin, our news director.  Yep.  And he's here too.  And Jason Howell.  And Jason Howell, our producer.  Woo-hoo.  And technical director.  So golly.  You're surrounded by I.O.  Surrounded, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Surrounded by people who have the new cardboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go.  I am really close now.  I held off ordering the Gear VR.  I have a Samsung Galaxy S6.  But I think now I'm going to order it  because it's more comfortable than cardboard.  It has a strap.  One thing, it's a strap on so you can leave it on.  I shouldn't.  Oh, my doorbell's ringing.  I hate it when that happens.  I am a little too wired now.  But I think that, you know,  I've kind of come around on the VR thing.  Yeah.  And it's funny, it's cardboard that did it,  not Oculus Rift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, that's right.  It's the VR for the people  and the augmented reality for the people  because it's going to...  And I think one of the coolest things  that they showed at the event,  Google I.O. during the keynote,  was this new program to get cardboard into schools.  Yes.  And it's such a perfect solution  because it's not like Apple's plan to get iPads  into schools so that every school  has to pay 600 or whatever dollars.  But wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's cheap.  Cardboard's cheap, but what's driving it,  and the reason it's cheap is you still need a smartphone.  Yes, you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kids all got them now.  They, you know, it's like...  Oh no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kids don't all got them,  and especially below sixth grade, K through six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What they showed was boxes  that had the smartphones in them.  So I'm guessing that, you know, people will donate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They cost the same as an iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it depends on what phone you get, right?  I mean, there are definitely less expensive options.  What's the minimum?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's the minimum cardboard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just, well, like I bought my...  You don't need a phone connection.  You're on Wi-Fi at school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you could get, what then?  What if it was like an Android One?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can get an Android One for under $100.  $99, 100 bucks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I'm sure that, I mean, you said that kids under the age...  I've been reading a lot of stuff lately  that shows that in the United States at least,  a huge percentage of even sixth graders have phones  and carry them every day to school.  And so it'll be one of those things where they'll say,  okay, who's got their own phone?  Okay, who doesn't have a phone?  And then they can pass out the school's phones  for this purpose, but the benefit is that,  is as they talked about in the presentation,  is it's a way to get kids really super engaged,  to actually immerse them in the content  that they're talking about rather than just sitting there  listening to a teacher go on and on.  I think the value is massive.  And the additional cost, I think, can be very, very low.  Of course, Palo Alto School District  will spend a fortune on brand new phones for all of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's kind of my point.  This happens all the time.  The tech community gets all excited,  puts hardware into schools or sets this kind of stuff up  and says, hey, see you later, bye-bye.  And there's no curriculum,  there's no training for the teachers.  And in this case, there's this assumption  that everybody's got an Android or a high-end smartphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think they'd all have to be school issued  because the teacher is controlling them from the tablet.  So they've all got to be school issued for this to be.  This is not a cheap thing you're talking about here.  If they roll this out well,  they're gonna focus on lower income.  Kids really need it.  So I hope we're gonna see things like Donors Choose  and we're gonna see other programs.  Hopefully, Google's gonna throw money in places  other than Palo Alto and figure out ways to help people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google has a very compelling argument in the schools.  I mean, the Chromebook is, of course,  the best way to put a computing platform in a school.  But I'm not, everybody focuses on the fact  that it's just the viewer is cheap.  But I think the viewer is just a holder.  This is what you have to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The way to look at this, I think,  is that the alternative to something like Google Cardboard,  the alternative to low cost VR  and augmented reality is nothing.  It's not gonna get cheaper than this.  In order to do VR, you have to have a good display.  You have to have some sort of connection.  You have to have all the things that a smartphone has.  And there are very few industries  that have the economies of scale, entire industries,  entire countries that have built industries  around making all that stuff super, super cheap.  And so it's basically the only alternative argument to,  if the argument is that this is too expensive,  then virtual reality has no place in schools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that may be another argument.  Yeah, it's the cheapest virtual reality you can get.  Well said, Mike.  So a rubber wading pool would also be  the cheapest pool you could get.  Doesn't necessarily mean that this belongs to schools.  And there's this whole additional thing of,  okay, so you've got, okay, let's say you figured out  a way to get all the kids cardboard.  Now you gotta get the teacher a tablet  and you gotta get curriculum associated with it.  Remember the LA Unified School District  said they were gonna put an iPad  in the hands of every student.  They made a deal with Pearson to develop curriculum  and it's been a horrible failure.  They're suing both Apple and Pearson.  The curriculum wasn't developed.  The teachers weren't trained.  Most of these iPads ended up  in the back of the classroom unused.  It kind of makes me mad because I think Silicon Valley  and we tech enthusiasts love this idea of tech in schools,  but we don't follow through.  We don't go the whole distance on it.  Yeah, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Another thing here, Leo, is that  if you look at an elementary school,  it's not like every classroom needs a setup.  One setup for an entire school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're buying one per class.  You're buying a class.  You will buy one per school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And, you know,  Paulson just gave $400 million to Harvard,  the last school on the earth that possibly needs it.  No, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Equipping the school is probably the least of the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't wanna say this is the first thing to buy  at all, I agree with that too.  Museum of Natural History was at I.O.  They did one of the explorations.  I'm going through the same thing in news.  People were going gaga over VR  and I'm saying, well, hold on.  It really hasn't had any impact yet.  We really have, yes, it's the latest new shiny toy.  What's its real value gonna be, undetermined.  Nonetheless, yes, we go gaga and we say, that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm excited.  I wanna build a jump camera.  That's the 16 GoPro or 16, doesn't have to be GoPros,  but that's the demo, 16 camera rig that GoPro will sell,  but you could also build yourself.  And then the jump software assembles it.  And my sense is you could do this in real time,  which means I could say to our audience, watch live.  You can download the show later,  but if you'd like to watch live  as if you're in the studio with us,  we have set up one of these rigs  right where you would be sitting  and now you can look around and participate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  You can imagine a whole different kind of talk show  where it's not just a camera going one level.  It's that you're in the middle of couches of a discussion.  Right.  We look around as people talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's cool.  Imagine a round table like the kind that Alex Lindsay built  for other purposes for conversations  and you have it in the middle of the table.  Yeah, we could do that.  And that's the, wouldn't that be great?  And then you hear somebody talking over here,  so you turn this way and so on.  That's very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, and Dr. Maum's saying,  oh great, Twit's gonna now make me barf.  Believe me, I get nauseous with Oculus Rift, absolutely.  I've never gotten nauseous with,  I'm not sure why, with cardboard,  but I think it's because you're not moving  and the thing isn't,  you don't have this situation you did in Rift  where you're not moving physically,  but you're moving virtually.  That is disorienting to the inner ear.  That is what makes you nauseous, I think.  There's also latency issues.  I'm sure that that's not necessarily solved in cardboard,  but I never was bothered by it,  partly because too, because you can just go like this.  Yeah, right.  You're not gonna really spend hours,  you're not playing a game.  The games are what makes you nauseous, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My wife has inner ear vertigo problems,  and so Jake and I were showing her cardboard,  and I tell you, it was three seconds, and she said, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.  Yeah.  Then it maybe will make you nauseous.  Yeah.  They're telling me to pronounce it nauseous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But isn't that jump rig a reason  to have a reporter on the scene, Jeff?  Yes.  The reporter in the wind getting blown away.  With a special helmet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With the ring on the helmet.  Wash your mouth out.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff hates local news standups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but I mean, like an Insta expedition,  where we're here, come to the scene, this is where it was,  it'd be kind of interesting from a news perspective.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Apparently,  Hockey Night in Canada has done this.  Really?  Yeah, you can look to the two different team benches,  somebody in the chat room's telling me that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They should use this instead of the puck.  Imagine the view you'd get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ow, stop hitting me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, I should be saying nauseated, not nauseous,  according to Dr. Mom, they're two different things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And by the way, this is one of the reasons  why augmented reality is absolutely going to rule  over virtual reality because-  Because you don't get nauseous.  Exactly.  Or nauseated.  Exactly, you're seeing objects being placed  in the real world, but you still see the real world,  which satisfies your inner whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, cardboard can't be used as augmented reality,  but things like the Gear VR can,  because the Gear VR can use pass-through with the camera.  So you put your phone there,  I don't know why they didn't do this with cardboard,  but you could.  A pair of scissors and you could expose the camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think one of the reasons is that they are trying  to be ultra compatible with all the phones,  and they don't know where the camera hole is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Some can't, so you could buy one  for your specific phone that would work.  I would think so.  Or just cut a hole.  Or software.  No, I think it's already the software,  much of the software will do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It actually asks for permission to use your camera  when you install the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that maybe is just this cardboard that doesn't do that.  There are many cardboards in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you buy the second generation  cardboard out there already?  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really?  Google has a site, Google at least on their site,  says get a viewer and shows.  Are they selling them?  Well they have buy it links on all of these.  Let me check.  So let's see, the View Master was the Mattel one.  That probably is not yet out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  DodoCase.com has the new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's easy, right?  So this is View Master.  See this I could see in schools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See the DodoCase has devices that have the camera exposed,  cardboard kits that have the camera exposed  for augmented reality.  They also have a virtual reality hat  where the cardboard hangs from the brim of a baseball hat.  How about this one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the Knox Aluminium VR viewer,  the only machined and handcrafted metal VR viewer  with a hint of wood.  85 bucks.  Well, but that's cheap compared to an Oculus Rift,  which will be probably five or 600 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know the problem with it is,  I just want one where it doesn't show your forehead grease.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, you're gonna like this one.  This is the one, we have these lying around somewhere.  This is the CI or C1 glass, 22 bucks.  It's very lightweight, it folds up  because basically it's a plastic frame that holds it.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do all these now fit six inch phones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you'd have to get one that compatible with your phone.  This one says Nexus 6.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But these are all third party vendors.  I'm looking at store.google.com  and I don't see Google themselves selling it  unless I'm missing it.  Oh, they never sold it.  Well, I can buy.  Oh, okay, right, they never sold it.  They just published the plans.  Yes. Yes.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's by the way, the other way to do it  is just to get your 3D printer out  and download the plans and make your own, dammit.  That's what you should do if you're a real VR user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Real maker geek.  Real maker geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And of course, we were treated once again  to the site at Google I.O. of a large number of people  all using some sort of virtual reality.  And people always look like idiots,  like staring into space, especially in a group.  You really want to do this in the privacy of your own home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have a picture?  Let me look.  Okay, let me go plus.  Let me see if it's still around.  Google.com slash plus Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's see if I can find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what, this is good, because we covered,  and if you didn't watch, you probably should watch  our TwitLive special Google I.O. coverage,  Gina and I, and Aaron Newcomb and Ron Richards.  Nope, it's not there.  Not there.  But so you should know, and oh, and then Mike suggested,  and I think it was a brilliant idea,  that we also air the next day, the ATAP,  the Advanced Technology Group video.  That was really cool.  I was excited about many of the things I saw there.  But let's get the experience of, oh, here we go.  Yeah, you got the picture up.  Oh, there it is.  Oh.  Nurds.  This is straight out of Wally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you thought people texting in restaurants  was anti-social.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm depressed.  Wow.  And then here's the better, so at the Google party,  I guess because of noise regulations in San Francisco,  they had to turn the music off at nine o'clock,  so they distributed wireless headsets to everyone.  So they were all bopping to the music  that you couldn't hear.  I've seen that before, yeah.  All they did was that, too.  Headphone concerts.  And it would have been the ultimate Google experience  to make fun of for the world.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, you know, it's funny, the Samsung folks  did a demo of Galaxy VR for Nicole Lee in Gadget,  and one of the things they said,  it's really a wonderful social experience.  Because one of the things they have on the Galaxy VR  is the ability to watch a movie.  And you're actually in a movie theater,  you could see empty seats around you,  you could look at the screen, look behind you,  and they said, it's so cool when three or four of you  are sitting around with your,  now the nice thing is at least you could strap this on,  you don't have to hold it, watching a movie,  and you could talk to each other about what you're seeing.  Yeah.  Well, I hate people who talk in movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I hate that.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait a second.  Go to a movie theater in my own home  means that I'm sitting in front of my TV on my couch.  I know.  Like I don't need to see an empty theater surrounding me.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's what you're gonna see for a while  with all of this VR, is a lot of stuff, stupid stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And of course, Mark Zuckerberg says that someday  the future of Facebook is in virtual reality.  You'll be just hanging out with people in virtual reality.  I can't wait.  Yeah, that's gonna be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Aunt Gladys, nice to see you.  How's the hip?  I'll actually see.  Sounds like a nightmare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey look, a cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am gonna order one of these Gear VR helmets.  They said on a plane, then this is a good use for it.  If you really wanna get nauseated,  get on a plane, put on your Gear VR and sit back.  Just don't go like this to your person sitting next to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, an airplane is a perfect place for that  because they have a little barf bag right there.  Right there, you're ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would actually wear one of those on a plane.  That I would do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, isolate yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Isolate, right, it's the one place that you just wanna be  as far away as possible from everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what the killer app is for that?  It's an app that simulates you being in first class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, that's when you wanna believe  that the seat next to you is empty.  Exactly, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, right, you look down,  your knees are not pressing up against the seat  in front of you.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, go ahead, Effin Dunn.  Effin Dunn's, oh, you're not here.  He says his Gear VR is over on the,  he leaves it on the table on his desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Couldn't Samsung have made that for more units  than their own phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why should they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not how they roll.  You've got well because they could have sold for them.  Well, first of all, they say that this is  like a beta project.  They don't even say this is a finished thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They wanna be Apple.  They want you to have complete buy-in  to the Samsung universe in order for you to use it.  Yeah, how's that working?  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there's different, also there's more software  because Samsung has its own software suite for its own VR.  That's what they wanna sell right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sell the software?  No, the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah, why not?  In fact, this is specific to a Galaxy S6.  And the other one is specific to the Note.  But don't forget, this is an Oculus Rift device.  It says Oculus on it, even though it works with cardboard.  So there's kind of this, I think that's good.  That means there's gonna be kind of a,  and YouTube is gonna support this, right?  Yep.  In fact, I think I can, can I do now?  I can do YouTube stuff on this if I turn on my cardboard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can, you can do Google Maps stuff as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Neat.  So there is a section now in the Play Store for cardboard.  Get more cardboard apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And by the way, the thing we're looking at on the screen  is the Jump platform, which is the back end.  Yeah, and this is really sophisticated stuff.  People dial into the thing that holds the cameras,  and that of course is open sourced.  And you can essentially build your own  depending on what cameras you're using.  Not you, the user, but like companies that have cameras  can do this, GoPro did it.  But the really amazing part is the massive data crunching  behind the scenes to take all these  disparate live video streams  and to create new 3D surround video.  That is very complex and very computationally expensive  and complex.  And so that's the part that's really the magic here, I think.  Yeah, you know, Mike, I think the untold story of IO

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  was for that and photos and so much else.  It was really about deep learning, AI,  large neural networks.  Only Google, only Google I think  can do what they're demonstrating here.  The fact that the major computing power  has become trivial to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You do this analysis, it's amazing.  Go to the Play Store and look at,  I know you've left VR, but I'm back again.  Look at all the apps.  There's an Adult Swim app for VR.  Here's Jurassic VR.  There are paid apps for cardboard.  You're gonna start seeing, this may be,  it's so, you know what I love about this?  Google completely scooped Facebook and their Oculus Rift  by just saying, well, what if we did something on cardboard?  And what if, you know, and then already these are all apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have we ever heard, who are the two people  who sat around a beer saying, you know?  Wrote it on a napkin?  Who the heck does not have cardboard?  I wanna interview them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This to me is the essence of Google,  which is get something out there and then tweak it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look at this.  Instead of.  They used an Apollo at a Paul McCartney concert  and you can go there now and sit on the stage with Paul.  This is on the app store and it's free.  Isn't that interesting?  I mean, this is already an ecosystem  and they haven't released Gear VR yet either.  I'm downloading Paul McCartney right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't heard about the makers.  I wanna get these people in MakerBase.  Wouldn't they be cool?  Looking at the Wikipedia page,  I don't see who was responsible for this  because it was a 20% project, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you know what?  Google's 20% has really paid off.  What did they get out of that?  Gmail, some of the news, Google News, so many things.  All right, I'm sorry, I went back to Gear Cool VR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, I wasn't trying to change the subject.  I was just extending.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I think it's really interesting  to see what Google's up to.  I really do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But again, I think this is the essence of Google  and what gives them a huge advantage.  They have the guts to come out with stuff that isn't done.  Now, we're probably later in the show  and gonna talk about this thing  that everybody's complaining about  that you take a picture of your food porn  and tells you how many calories.  And it's like, oh, it doesn't work.  That can't possibly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, if it doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, people are saying that's inaccurate  plus calories is a bad measurement for food and so on.  But the Google philosophy,  unlike the sort of Oculus philosophy,  which is work on it, work on it, work on it,  for four years now, they've been working on Oculus  and still we have nothing in our hands.  Google just put something out there  and let's all keep working on it.  It's about agile.  Even as we use it.  Exactly.  It's about agile.  So I asked to download,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it turns out the Gear VR app as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you get that in 3D?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Download it.  It did.  It said, welcome to Gear VR.  Now download, take your phone out and download the app.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't try to do this on a live show.  Yeah.  It said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Steve Gibson was thrilled about his project solely.  So this is one of the ATAP things.  It's like radar.  It's a chip that sends out a,  I don't know technically what the technology is  It's like a theremin, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's a navigational theremin.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  And it can sense movements and stuff.  This thing was really very exciting  because it could be a whole new way of using your computer.  Yeah.  Or a computing device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, or yeah, a computing device.  Interacting with a vending machine or with a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or clothes.  Yeah.  Because of Project Jacquard, I mean, you could,  I mean, it's fair.  I just think Google is knocking it out of the park  in every respect, very exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's the use case that I think is the most exciting  is in a smartwatch because they made a big point  of showing how small they got the chip already.  And they haven't even, you know,  still early days in this thing.  And it's the size of a dime.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What I want is alternative air typing.  With some way to get to 26 letters by motions  without having to have anything physical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  You'd use some new way of gestures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like touch your knuckles or do a circle or...  Well, you know what it is?  Imagine ASL with that.  Exactly.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Everybody would have to learn that.  ASL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Teach your...  You know, Edda should learn ASL now.  Yes.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's perfect.  Because it's complete language.  You're preparing her for the future.  It's an approach to language that exists  in many, many languages.  That's perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it sound waves?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what it is.  Yeah, how does this work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's magic.  It's just magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's very low energy.  I asked, you know, maybe it's the,  I don't know what it is.  It's gonna fry us all.  Oh, it is, but who cares?  I don't mind.  I, for one, am prepared.  Welcome our new frying.  I welcome our new frying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love the fact that Google bought Motorola  and this was originally part of Motorola  and then they sold Motorola and they said,  you know what, we're gonna keep this bit.  Do they look crazy like a fox now?  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah, and that was the whole point, huh?  They kept the patents too, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the patents were valuable.  Yeah.  The phones, not so much.  Right, exactly.  Exactly.  Wow, you know, they look so smart.  We were talking, Gina, about Android M during the live stream.  What are your takeaways on the new version of Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I'm excited.  I mean, visually, it's not the kind of huge upgrade  that we got with Alipop Material Design,  but I'm really excited about some of the new features,  particularly around easier permissions,  permissions that don't make you feel  like you're signing your life away  the minute that you install your app,  permissions that happen in flow.  That's something I want to work on.  I like that.  Apple does that.  Yeah, fingerprint detection, excited about that.  Excited about Android Pay.  I mean, Google's taken a few shots at contactless payments  and just payments in general, but I was excited about that.  I think that, you know, in general,  I think in general it's a fairly subtle upgrade,  but there's some good stuff here.  Better battery management.  I mean, look, we're always trying to make our devices  go longer, but that Doze mode and battery saver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That may be the most important single piece.  If they really did impact battery life significantly,  that's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The other thing that I think is absolutely huge  is Google Now and Now on Tap.  Yeah, does that come with them?  Yes, it does, and it's one of the biggest,  it's probably the biggest reason to not use an iPhone,  because you can't do this on an iPhone,  and therefore this is one of the rare cases  where Google likes to have everything on every platform  that it can, but Apple won't give this kind of access.  So as an example, you're looking at any app,  and you can just basically press and hold the home key,  and it'll just pop up all the information it knows  about whatever's on the screen.  Another part of this is where you can basically,  developers can build in Google Now compatibility,  and then you can use whatever is going on  with the app in context.  So for example, let's say there's music playing,  and you're listening to a song on Pandora,  you can say, who is this?  And it knows who this is, knows what the word this means,  based on the context of the app itself.  And there, that's just one trivial example,  but it just turns, it takes Google Now,  and it puts it anywhere and everywhere, which is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Google has finally decided  that it's gonna ignore the privacy advocates,  and just go ahead.  And if you don't like it, if you don't want Google  reading every screen on your phone, use an iPhone.  Use Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fine.  In fact, that's what Cook's doing,  is differentiating himself, saying,  no, we don't have an advertising model,  we don't put the snoop on you, you also don't know me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, good.  And I hope they do that, because I'm tired of Google  kind of saying, well, we're gonna slow down,  we don't want to face recognition, we don't wanna do anything.  Slow down, we gotta, you know what,  Google should just say, okay, that's fine.  For those of you who are willing to give us more information,  we will be more valuable experience for you.  For those who aren't, we'll be less valuable,  and if you really don't wanna give us anything,  there's other choices out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tragically, one of the reasons they can do that,  is that we've all been bludgeoned by news  about all these hacks.  Our private information has been hacked at Target,  it's been hacked by the IRS,  it's been hacked in all these locations.  It's just, I think people have accepted the fact  that personal private information of the kind  that you interact with online is just available.  It's just out there for all kinds of uses,  and to serve up contextual advertising  and to give you better preemptive virtual assistant results  is the most innocuous result of that data harvesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you think Edda's generation will just say,  oh, who needs privacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, we're getting there, right?  I mean, I think there's kind of this feeling  of like the benefit of things like this outweighs the risk.  I think a lot of people feel like,  well, I mean, what do I have to hide?  It's just so convenient, right?  That's what the security versus convenience trade-off.  Yeah, that's the right thing to do, yeah.  Yeah, and I mean, I think we're maybe more aware of it  than a sort of normal consumer,  but I think that's generally the feeling.  I mean, that worries me a little bit.  I think we should need to think about the implications.  I mean, when they showed Now on Tap on the stream,  I mean, the first thing I thought was, wait a second,  they're now on tap,  they're summonsing this Now on Tap in a non-Google app,  right, so I know that Google has access  to all my personal data in Google apps.  I agreed to that, right?  There was a change in their privacy policy a few years back,  and I said, okay, fine, right?  Calendar knows about Gmail, Now knows about all of them.  Okay, fine, but if I'm having a private conversation  with my spouse on a third-party SMS app,  or I don't know, any sort of third app,  and even as a developer, I'm thinking,  okay, I make it to-do list.  Does this mean that Google Now on Tap now sees  my users to-do list?  Pick up the dry cleaning, Gina.  Yeah, I mean, I don't know.  Yeah, so that jumped out at me instantaneously.  I was like, wait a second, how is this happening?  Is the user granted permission?  Is it screen scraping?  What's going on?  So there's this assist API.  It's a brand new API that's gonna be in Android M  that actually gives access to any assistant type-like app,  like Now on Tap, so that's interesting  because there might be other assistant apps,  not just Now on Tap, and the developer sets a flag  that in a sensitive view  where you might have personal information,  the developer can set a flag that says secure.  That says Now on Tap can access this information.  Otherwise, the developer can expose.  Now, I feel like that's a weird role  for a developer to be in.  Well, the default is open then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The default is open because no app knew this existed,  so thus, people will have to go back in and retrofit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or if you have an app that has all sorts of private stuff  and it's not updated, does it just give it all to Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This should be my choice, right?  And so we don't know.  There's a lot of this that we don't know.  I don't know if it's on by default,  if it's enabled by default.  I don't know if users are gonna be able  to turn this on and off, probably, right?  Because you can turn Now on and off, so probably,  but it's an interesting thing.  Well, until you summon it though, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Until you, maybe here's the difference.  Maybe here's the difference.  It's not like Google is listening to all your activity  and all the apps.  It's when you push down the button,  you are purposely summoning Now on Tap to say,  please give me context for what I'm doing right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's an easy thing to do by accident, for one thing.  Well.  Right, you accidentally press and hold too long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, okay, you can do lots of things,  but I think as a principle.  I think there's gotta be an opt-in.  Let me find wrong here.  No, but as a principle,  the act of summoning Google Now on Tap is an opt-in.  Too easy to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, because why else would you do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not because, how do you summon it?  You do a long tap on the home button.  Easy, long tap on the home button.  You're not paying attention.  You accidentally forget to let go on the home button.  I do it all the time.  All right, all right, so I do a long tap

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  while scratching my head.  Are you okay now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'm just, no, but I'm just saying  what it has to do then the first time,  and I'm sure they will,  is do what they do with Google Now the first time.  Here's what it is.  Are you in?  And you have to say, yes, I'm in, or it won't do it.  It's got to be that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, but I think, but my point to Gina is  that let's say you generally say it's okay, it's on,  then it's not like Google is listening  to your app activity all the time.  It's when you ask it to,  it will give you contextual suggestions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then the other question is what happens to that information.  That is the question.  Is it local to the phone,  or is it sending back to Google servers saying,  hey, what are these pictures of Leo?  What is going on here?  Is there anything you can do with this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a lot going on behind the scenes here,  and while I agree that this is an incredible,  incredible feature, and one of the,  one of the, I think, the best things that they showed off,  I want to know more.  Well, and as a developer, you want to know more too, right?  Certainly as a developer, I want to know more.  I mean, I have a lot of users that are,  don't like the idea that their to-dos are synced to Dropbox,  which is a choice I made, like, oh, hey, let's sync to it.  So, you know, like if Google can look at your to-do list  or your private chats,  and I don't think this should be a developer choice.  I think it should be a user choice.  So, and maybe it's both,  but I'm interested to see how this is implemented  and how the permissions work.  But it's a very cool feature, and I get you, Jeff,  that you're summoning now on tap.  It's possible that now on tap,  I mean, it's using the Google view hierarchy  or the Android view hierarchy, I think,  to get to say what is contained in this view,  what text is contained in this view.  And it's possible that locally it's able to say,  oh, this is a pronoun that represents a restaurant.  But most likely, I mean, it's gotta be making calls back  to the server to say, what is this restaurant?  What's the number?  What options?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not the only context.  It's also gonna, it's gonna use the other things  that it can get, like location, time of day,  knowledge of where you live versus where you are now.  The point of this all is context, context, context.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Blood sugar level from your smartwatch, skin sensor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, with diabetics in the family,  yeah, that'd be a wonderful thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The watch can tell you when you're hungry.  So one of the interesting things that came out of I.O.  that's related to this topic, the topic being,  what does Google do with this personal information?  We've all been marveling and oohing and eyeing  over the Google Photos capability of recognizing dog breeds  and different kinds of food and things like that,  which just looks amazing.  How do they do that?  And one of the concerns people have is the recognition  of people's faces, which they demonstrated  goes all the way back to infancy somehow,  which that has not been explained.  And it does not work, I might add.  It doesn't work.  It works better than it should,  but not as good enough to really use it.  But the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Louise CK moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so, no, but-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, can you explain the reference without-  Everything is awesome and nobody's happy?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, gee, it missed me at four years old.  The whole thing-  No, I just want to point out, it's not perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How entitled we are.  But one of the interesting things that they said about this  in the Google Photos press conference  is that they're not actually doing identity.  In other words, they have a internal,  nerdy database entry thing of identity.  This is a person and there's all the things  we know about this person.  The Photos app doesn't use that.  In other words, it doesn't know the difference  between a grilled cheese sandwich and somebody's face.  It just knows that these-  These match.  These are associated with each other  and associated with the search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your eye is this far away from your nose.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  At this age and as you grow.  So for example, if I took a picture of one of my kids  and I labeled it grilled cheese sandwich-  It would from then on think that that was a grilled cheese.  Every picture of my kid would come up  when I searched for grilled cheese sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Given your love of food,  I'm surprised you didn't name your kid grilled cheese sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So how much of that has to do with this?  This is a big change in Google.  If you go to any Google page now,  remember you used to have a picture of yourself  and if you'd click on it, you'd drop it down  and it would show my profile.  No longer do you go, does it say my profile?  No longer do we push to Google Plus yet another way.  We're chiseling away at Google Plus.  It says my account now and you'll get this.  You'll get this page.  In fact, Google's been pushing people  for the last couple of days.  Anytime you go to your Google account,  to this page, my account,  control, protect and secure your account all in one place.  And this is not quite the dashboard,  but this is, I think in some ways,  this is Google's proactive way to respond  to some of the concerns in Europe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is the convenience versus risk thing, right?  So at I.O. they had to show off,  they had to emphasize the convenience  and in that new thing, they have to minimize the risk.  They have to make you feel like, okay,  yes, I have control here, I know what's going on.  I'm okay with consenting to this.  So it has to be really a two-pronged approach.  This is for people who aren't regulars of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've talked about this maybe a year ago.  This was a Larry Page interview.  Was it Larry?  I think it was Larry.  Maybe it was Bradley Hoare.  What somebody said, some Google executive said,  maybe it was Sundar, I don't know,  that there's the two faces of that coin  and that we've not done such a good job.  We've done a job of explaining the benefits,  but not such a good job of consent.  And they go together.  You can't do one without the other.  So you're exactly right, Gina.  This is in action, that philosophy that they described.  Gina, I think the other thing about it is too

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is that this allows Google to argue  that there is a benefit of pulling all your data together  because you can control it at once,  whereas the argument in Europe is,  oh no, no, no, no, just because you bought another service,  you can't pull there, but you bought YouTube,  doesn't mean you can have YouTube data in Google.  Well, now you can have control across all Google services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's take a break.  We're gonna come back with more.  There's lots to talk about.  Yeah.  I think we've talked enough about photos  on every other show, including Paul Therotte  on Windows Weekly who was singing his praises.  I was amazed at that.  He never liked anything from Google.  No.  It just shows you.  Everybody's excited about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was surprised that New York Times  led with Cardboard and VR.  In their story, I thought Photos  was unquestionably the lead of I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know why?  I've just been told there is a New York Times  magazine cardboard app.  Oh boy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What a surprise.  Great panel.  Mike Elgin, thank you for being here, our news director.  You see him every Monday for Friday on Tech News Today.  Yes you do.  It's a little early for me, that's all.  10 a.m. Pacific, that's 1 p.m. Eastern Time  and 1700 UTC Monday through Friday.  And it's always nice to have you here on the twig.  Always nice to be here.  Really nice to have Gina too.  Man, I feel like I'm surrounded.  I'm bathed in riches tonight.  Gina Trapani.  Great to be here.  I plugged Think Up, but I forgot to plug  your new Maker thing.  So it's called-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah, MakerBase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  MakerBase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  MakerBase.  MakerBase.se.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  MakerBase.se, it's Swedish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's called MakerBase in your address bar.  MakerBase.  MakerBase.  MakerBase.  It's not live yet, it's invite only  and I promised everyone an invite.  I got inundated with requests for invites.  We're catching up, I'm doing a little every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well I'm kind of mad at you,  because you know what happened?  Is you mentioned that if somebody who's on MakerBase  mentions somebody else in their MakerBase,  that then they will be invited to be in MakerBase.  So everybody said, okay mention me, mention me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you also get inundated?  Yeah, we're trying to spread the love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just stood back, I said I'm not gonna do anything  until it's not beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you understand why I haven't gone through all of this.  I have a lot of data entry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, I know.  Yeah, I didn't-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a few shows I am involved with here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just a couple, just a couple people know you online, Leo.  That's all forgiven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's really cool, MakerBase.se.  Just MakerBase, just type MakerBase.  What could go wrong?  Google will put the dot in for you  knowing exactly what you were thinking.  And also of course, Jeff Jarvis, we love Jeff.  Always great to have you,  it was nice to have you in the studio last week.  Somebody does.  You know what, Jeff, you and I have something in common.  We're cranky.  I realized, I realized I thought I was the nice guy  and you were the cranky guy.  I'm the cranky guy too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The old bad cop, bad cop routine.  Bad cop, bad cop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly.  No, but we'll, you know what, Jeff's a sweetheart too.  I want to talk to you about the new medium  when we get a chance too.  There's some big changes over there  at Ev Williams' medium.  Is it a pivot or is it a refinement or are they as-  A retreat.  Somebody just said throwing anything up against the wall  and seeing what sticks.  Our show today brought to you by SmartThings.  We're going to talk about smart homes for sure.  And SmartThings really is there smack dab  in the middle of this intelligent revolution.  It's exactly what you want.  Kind of think of it as an ombudsman for your smart home,  a central hub that talks to everything  and then your single application, you know,  that talks to it.  And I have to say, I was a little disappointed  when I read about what others are doing  because they still, you're still installing  a hundred apps on your phone.  I want one app and that's what SmartThings does.  SmartThings.com slash twig to learn more.  For your iPhone, your Android phone or tablet,  your Windows Phone 2, the SmartThings app,  it's an open platform.  So SmartThings works with Zigbee, Z-Wave, DropCam,  Schlagelocks, Honeywell thermostats,  well on and on and on.  Plus also they provide their own sensors  to complete the package so you could do most anything.  Turn on your lights from your phone  because they've got a plug socket.  So even if the light is not smart, plug socket is.  Of course, if you have Phillips Hue lights,  you could do a whole lot more.  You can have your music play when you enter the house,  thanks to Sonos.  You can get instant alerts if there's unexpected movement  or entry in your home.  You can have, they have cameras,  so you can set a camera or use DropCam  to take a series of photos when there's motion.  It all makes everything talk together.  Energy savings, water detection.  Now through the end of the month,  SmartThings is offering its three most popular kits  at a big discount for our Twit audience.  10% off either the smart, I'm sorry,  the home security, the energy saver,  or the water detection kit.  But you gotta go to smartthings.com slash twig  and the offer code of course, TWIG.  It's easy, it's fast, it's a great way to get started  with a smarter home.  SmartThings.com slash twig for 10% off  and free shipping in the US.  SmartThings.com slash twig.  I wanna put this on, I finally got,  I went, while you've been talking,  I've gone through the fairly elaborate onboarding.  Oh no, I just have to verify my email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I gotta say that sitting next to you here,  it's so much easier to look at your screen.  In violation of every social norm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look at my screen my friends, it's yours, I give it to you.  What did I say we would talk about next?  Medium, medium.  Medium.  Well that's not necessarily next,  but yeah we could talk about that.  What's going on over at Medium?  I actually was kind of excited  because I finally made a Medium account  and everybody I follow on Medium,  if they annotate an article, I see their annotations.  I didn't know about that, that's cool.  Is that cool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean it depends.  Well.  It depends on how many people are annotating it,  I mean it could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What was the article that I was,  oh it was Stephen Levy's interview with Bradley Horowitz.  Oh right, yeah.  And so I was getting Evan Williams annotations,  I was getting Chris Messina's annotations.  Yes, I want to see what Chris Messina thinks about anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well they want to turn it into a social network  and I guess that's one way to build comments  right into the body of the post slash article.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, and I love interactivity  and I'm Mr. Interactivity,  it's not the Medium I signed up for obviously,  it's changed.  And the problem is, you know the advantage I saw  is that the author of the piece  chooses whether or not to make public  the comments that are in line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So here's MG Siegler's comment,  or actually highlighting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All he did was mark it.  Mark it.  So it's not really,  so they also lowered the barrier to having an impact.  So you mark stuff but you don't make a comment.  I found my comments pretty much disappeared  to my latest piece as well.  Oh it's just highlighting?  It's just highlighting in that case.  But you can also comment,  but most times now it's just highlighting  because it's the easier path.  Right.  That's vaguely interesting.  But then if you go to the bottom of the piece, Leo,  they have responses there.  And so what's happening is the old bad comments are back.  Stupid, off topic, crappy comments are in there,  with smart comments.  Now Steven Levy explained to me that  what happens is the author of the piece  still has a special right.  Because if I recommend a piece,  it will appear on the first page.  If I don't, it won't.  Still there, but it's on the second page.  Recommend the comment.  I understand what Ev's trying to do.  People weren't spending enough time just reading.  So he wanted to have a network structure,  and I get that, but I think we've got to think real hard  about what comes that's bad with the network structure.  I met with one of the people at Washington Post  who's doing Project Coral,  which is an effort from Mozilla,  New York Times, Washington Post, and the Knight Foundation  to rethink comments on media sites.  And a guy named Greg Barber at the Washington Post.  What he was saying was that it's really about  trusted relationships.  So it's not necessarily about the content of the comment  or the content of what I'm annotating or reacting to.  It's trusted relationships.  If you look at something like Genius,  there where you do have true annotations,  where someone can annotate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you ever use Genius, Theo?  I don't know what it is.  You don't know Rap Genius, Genius?  Oh, Rap Genius.  Isn't that the one that got it?  It's now Genius.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no.  So now it's Genius, so there's News Genius as well.  And you could put an article or a speech  or anything up there.  They also have a means that if you put in...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know about this.  Did you know about this?  It's pretty amazing.  I didn't know about everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I saw the story go by and then I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is News Genius.  So what am I seeing here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this, you can take an article, a speech,  a book chapter, a song, and you can truly annotate it.  And they've also set up a structure  so you could do this on top of a New York Times page,  but the New York Times lawyers stopped them for now.  So the example I have of having annotated that,  I forget what I...  One of my German publisher guys put up a...  Or no, Robert Thompson from News Corp  put up an anti-German rant.  And so I could annotate it there at Rap Genius, a Genius.  It's very cool.  So there's all kinds of interactivity that can go on now.  My point is, on Medium alone, you have comments,  you have things you could mark, you have responses,  you have recommendations, you know,  it's the reasons you recommend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And because it was Rap Genius,  there is a definite urban slant  to every single section on here.  But maybe that'll over time change.  I think the idea is really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really, really intriguing.  I went to a meeting run by the Pointer Foundation,  or Pointer Group, whatever it's called.  Institute. Thank you.  In New York two weeks ago,  all on this notion of annotation  and trying to rethink what comments are.  So Ev, you know, Ev who caused blogging,  popularized blogging and caused Twitter,  is reflexively, I think, going back  to the value of interactivity.  But there's still problems to solve with interactivity  because some people are a-holes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They also got rid of some of the channels, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep.  Because they thought they were fully a content thing,  so they were paying for content  even before they had the monetization ready to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, Jeff, do you think that for authors  who are writing books and want to do it in public,  like Follow the Geeks, I think, is one example,  is either Medium or Genius a good place to do that,  to get to solicit feedback?  Really interesting question, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, Dan Gilmore put up,  is almost finished chapters of his last book long ago,  long before these things were there.  In a sense, I do that in my blog  where I throw up an idea and people react to it.  By the time you have a draft,  what are you really asking people to do?  You're asking them kind of to copy, edit and fact check,  which is okay, but you're not,  the reader then isn't really part of the process.  The reader's at the end of the process,  almost at the very end of the process.  The other way that people have used Rap Genius  is some authors and singers,  some singer songwriters have put up stuff  so they can explain what they were doing  and they can add, they can truly annotate  and add information.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, I'm downloading a perfect beach.  I see.  So that you can hear the water lapping,  you can hear nice meditation music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's going to his happy place.  I'm gonna put that on here

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and then you guys can continue without me.  Don't mind us, we'll just...  Goodbye, I'm going to my beach.  What the hell?  He was going to his happy place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not yet.  Happy place.  He's still in his unhappy place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I still have to do configuration for my happy place.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I think you're going to a dizzy place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a bad...  A dizzy place.  A nauseating place.  Wait a minute, I think my phone just died.  Your phone went to a happy place.  That's another thing with this is it will kill battery,  although apparently there's a little USB port on here  so I can just plug it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now medium says that they want to be more of a social network  and less of a blog posting kind of a...  Is this going to happen?  Think of your mind, Ev.  Is this going to be a good idea?  Do we want to use medium as a social network?  It's making me think, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, or maybe if that's fine,  but that's then not going to be the place  I post most of my stuff mostly.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  Jeff, you've like really turned a corner on this  a little bit.  Well, yeah, it has an impact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was debating whether...  I was trying to think about writing an email to Ev  but I haven't used it enough to get a good enough sense.  So I could change my mind again, been known to happen.  But yeah, it was a peaceful, quiet place to write  in a beautiful presence and feel like it was more polished.  And again, I'm a fan of interactivity.  I'm a fan of conversation,  but we got a lot of places for that.  Yeah.  God knows we have places for that.  But I understand the business probably wasn't working.  People were not spending enough time reading good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, is minutes read the main metric?  Because that was medium's metric, minutes read.  TTR, total time read.  Total time read.  Is that still the metric?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As of now, yes.  Okay.  As I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As I know.  I actually really liked the highlights  because I think that medium encourages folks  to write more than they need to.  Like whereas with Twitter, you're so constrained.  What I like about highlights is that,  especially writers who just aren't,  have been writing or aren't great writers,  just a lot of throat clearing,  a lot of ramping up to the point, a lot of...  So the highlights is like, show me the few sentences  of this piece that I need to see.  And also that's just the way I read online.  If I'm reading a book, I'm gonna take time  and I'm gonna linger.  What I have trouble with with medium,  I love medium and I've read such great stuff there.  Most of it is in my read it later queue.  And a lot of it I skimmed because it was just too long,  which I probably, I don't know if that makes me  anti-intellectual or ADHD or what,  but it's just the reality of how I read online.  So I like highlights for that reason  because I kind of get the, show me the great sentences.  And I feel like the best medium writers  just stick the landing and it's that last graph  where they like, kind of...  But I mean, medium, the platform incentivizes  its writers to do that, particularly its paid writers.  Because paid writers actually get measured  on minutes read, right?  On the number of minutes read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My friend Debbie Glant said one day talking to me,  said, a journalist would have said to another journalist,  I have to go write a six inch story or a 400 word story.  She said, I think I'm gonna write that about six minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm gonna write a six minute story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The latest piece I wrote on medium,  which was about Tomorrowland.  It's short, so what happened was,  except for my plug for my own book at the top,  which no one highlighted.  Except your mom.  Everything got highlighted.  So there's a limit to the scale there.  So over one thing, 42 people highlighted on one paragraph.  And so that tells you something, I guess,  but it kind of, it doesn't do that job.  Once it grows to, once too many people have read it,  it won't happen.  It won't give you the value you just wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, right.  God bless Ev, he's experimenting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, this is the thing.  People have such high, I think,  have really high expectations of Ev  because he's created two blockbuster products  that arguably really changed the web and changed publishing.  And so I think medium is so high profile  and got so many users so quickly just because it was Ev.  And I think that he is a guy who has a lot of money  and can experiment and is on the old web  where you did experiment and change things a lot.  And I think he just gets such scrutiny by the media  for like, figure this out, what's the plan?  And I think that he doesn't know,  but he's finding it out as he goes along.  But because he's so high profile,  it makes it, I think that he often gets painted  as a lazy billionaire playing around with his property.  I actually think he's an incredible product person.  And I think that he should follow his instincts  and go with it.  We should give him room to do that.  I mean, this guy has been designing text boxes  for like 15 years, more than anybody on the web.  And he's made incredible things that I've benefited from  and all of us have.  So like give him the room, it bothers me.  Like the negativity bugs me,  but I'm still a little bit circumspect around medium.  Because I'm not circumspect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I absolutely agree.  I don't want to sound like I'm negative  because I haven't thought it through yet.  And whenever I do figure out what I think,  the first thing I want to do is to give Ev  and the team feedback because I know it'll keep developing.  I know they'll listen to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you think Steven Levy is regretting going all in here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't think so.  He gave up a real job at Wired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, why was Wired real?  So like, that's interesting.  Because I kind of think of it that way too.  I was a little facetious.  Right, right.  Why is writing for medium not real?  I mean, part of that is like,  anybody can write on medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But he has his own magazine on it.  He has his own division of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What did he say when you talked to him, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He came to me at IO.  I don't think I'm revealing anything here.  But David Weinberger wrote a piece  where he took 10 questions that were asked  of a candidate on CNN and 10 that were asked on Reddit  and just said, compare contrast.  And then he asked Dan Gilmore and me and others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People do that all the time though.  I feel like that's too hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, he wanted to process.  So he asked Dan, Gilmore, and me and others  to come in and comment  because he wanted to kind of really oomph what one was  with lots of commenting going on.  And then David came back and responded to them  and they wanted to see  what a really rich conversation would look like.  And they primed the pump to do that.  Stephen was at the heart of that test  because Stephen has the content to do that.  So when they want to use, I mean, I think that Stephen,  I mean, my bet is that Stephen will be around forever  as if he wants to because he can be the guinea pig  for how content can work in new ways there.  Who better to do it than Stephen?  Here's an article.  By the way, Stephen was at the press party at IO  where I got to meet Larry and Sundar, which was a thrill.  As soon as Larry came in, Stephen was just with him.  But I think it was also to kind of make Larry at ease.  But Stephen's a hell of a journalist.  He just, when he has a source and he knows them, obviously,  he just, he sticks by there  and stays in conversation and learns things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's fun to watch a pro at work, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stephen's-  So I met Larry and I said,  I had some way to introduce myself  because the PR people said, you want to meet Larry?  I said, oh yeah, of course, of course, of course.  I go up in an awkward silence moment and I say,  hi, I'm Jeff Jarvis.  I wrote a book called What Would Google Do?  And he said, oh yes, I remember.  He said, what would Google do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you find anything out?  And I said, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was hoping you'd tell me.  He said, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  Your next book could be,  What Would Larry Think That Google Might Do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Something like that.  No surprise that Sundar Pichai really owned the stage.  Larry didn't show up.  Sergey didn't show up and fly in.  Nothing.  It was a Sundar Pichai show.  There's been a coup.  He's really, he's consolidated it, hasn't he?  He's like, he's the guy now.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He seems like he's a good guy.  I think he's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So thoughtful, doing good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He was comfortable up on that stage.  Yeah, he was.  He's got this.  You can tell he's in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so many of these shows we've watched,  there've been no women, no people of color,  no diversity in the audience.  This is not, boy, Google is so diverse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, on the stage, they still aren't as much otherwise,  but on the stage they were.  But yeah, that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But even in the audience, look at the audience.  Just, maybe not so many women,  but it was a very international audience, I thought,  which is really nice.  Very international.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're very international,  and they have gone to great lengths  to bring in more women into their,  it's hard to tell because they've gone from almost none  to a small number, but they've worked at it pretty hard,  and they've also worked at it  to have upper level executives be women and so on.  But their most recent report actually shows  that year over year they've grown the number of women  in technology-related positions from only 17% to 18%.  That's it.  And for African-Americans and Hispanics,  they didn't budge the number one bit  despite a lot of effort,  and so they're struggling with that as well.  It's hard to do,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but Gina, isn't it great to see women on stage?  Even if you don't have them on the rank and file,  it sends a message that in the long run

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  would improve it.  Apple had a fashion model on stage.  She was speedy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the people on stage really reflect the people  who are in charge of the various divisions.  I mean, they don't choose folks.  I mean, Samsung got actors up there, right?  I mean, I think that's a reflection of who's in charge.  So that made me really happy.  Totally subjectively watching the stream,  There was like one row.  I was like, oh, they put all the women in that one row.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that was weird.  Remember, we said, oh, there's where they put the women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I did see a photo, a friend of mine posted a photo.  There was a line at the women's room at Moscone.  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like to see, that's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was almost going to get a picture of it,  and I felt that was creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that would have been a little creepy, right?  You have to be a woman in that case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But how many times have I used the ladies' room  at Moscone during a big conference  because there's no one in there?  There's no one in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I don't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I did that too.  That's what caused the line.  They were waiting for me to get out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a man in here.  Last year they mentioned what the percentage of attendees  were, the gender breakdown of the percentage of attendees.  I remember they mentioned it last year  because I looked at Jeff and rolled my eyes  and said, oh, we're celebrating this  because it was a low number.  I felt like it was still like 15% or 18%.  They didn't mention the numbers this year.  I don't know.  I mean, I get that it's a short keynote  and they have to decide what points.  I would love to, I would be very interested to know  what the attendee breakdown was,  but I was really happy to see women on stage.  We probably will not see women on stage next week.  It's the next week, right?  WWDC.  And I feel like that's a one way that Google  explicitly tries to differentiate itself as a company.  Look at the Android ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's actually an important way.  Yeah. Very important.  You might say that, oh, that's just stage managing.  It's not real, but no, I think it's making a statement.  I think it makes a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think it also demonstrated,  they weren't bringing in random women  because they were women.  These are women who are heading divisions.  Regina Dugan heads ATAP.  I love that.  I think that's so great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That the coolest stuff coming out of Google  and it's a woman presenting it is fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and they all had titles.  Those were-  Yeah, they weren't actors.  They're leading those efforts.  So that made me happy.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We kind of did Google Photos.  I don't want to go back on that.  Yeah, we did that.  Too bad.  Because JR Raphael has a great piece on,  the six things missing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Louis CK moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did it.  It's another one.  Unlimited free storage.  Yeah.  It doesn't do this.  But to that point, there's actually quite a few things  that Photos on Google Plus did,  including much of the editing,  that weren't carried over,  but I have to think they plan on doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well, Bradly could not have been clearer.  This is this, even though it's not a beta,  it's a released product.  No, no, but they're slowly adding.  There's tons of stuff they know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But wither Google Plus, really.  Come on.  Well, fair to Bradly said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know what he said.  It's about connecting people to their interests.  So it's gonna become a subset of groups.  So here's the thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This stream is gonna be a separate product, right?  So stream, Hangouts, and Photos are separate products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google Plus is stream, is it?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The stream being the feed.  So here's what actually happened.  Google came out with Google Plus, they decided it.  Back in the day, five years ago,  Facebook was running away with all the traffic  and links and so on.  And so Google said, we have to do a social network.  And so what they did was, Vic and Doutra was in charge of it  and the strategy was to make Google Plus  the center of everything that Google did.  And it was essentially an unpopular,  internally and externally, political move  on the part of Larry Page and Vic and Doutra.  And they crammed all this stuff in there.  And everybody began to associate the forced integration  of different Google properties with what Google Plus was  the identity of Google Plus.  Now they're piece by piece dismantling  those forced integrations and people are saying,  oh, that means Google Plus is,  no, it's just not being forcibly integrated.  It's being disintegrated.  But not disabled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's do a long bet here.  Yeah.  And I don't know what I'll bet,  but since you are even more than me,  a defender of Google Plus,  even though we get heckled and laughed at for that,  especially by the way, Google crowds.  I can get a laugh every time I'm at a Google event.  I actually like Google Plus.  I'm not gonna make it much laughter.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Um.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh.  Cause they're tired of putting up with abuse for it.  A year and a half from now.  Yeah.  Will anything recognizable as Google Plus still be allowed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know, but I think yes.  I think it'll continue.  The thing that I can't imagine is for Google to have nothing  in the area of social networking.  So they'll either replace it again or they'll keep it.  They're not gonna just pull the plug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Bradley's title is streams, photos, and sharing.  Yes, exactly.  Streams matter.  Facebook owns streams.  Paul McCarty concert just started.  Instagram has minutes later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what's going on here.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was trying to watch a Paul McCarty concert  like half an hour ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leo's like eating lunch, watching a concert.  I love his show.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Please, don't let me interrupt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you know you could take your VR back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, so yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Google needs a stream.  Is Google Plus that stream or do you think Bradley  and all have something else up their sleeves  to get our attention for a flow of information  or a flow of attention?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that either one of those is a good  and likely scenario.  I think the only scenario that is impossible  is for them to have nothing in the area of streams.  They're gonna have a social network of some kind  and so they'll either replace it with something  they think is better, which would be great,  or they'll keep it around forever,  which would be great in my opinion.  But really they need streams for lots of reasons  that people don't think too much about.  For example, all of the wearable stuff  that's coming in the future is gonna need something  like Google Plus or something that would replace it  as the place where you do stuff.  You saw that with Google Glass,  you see it with Android Wear.  How do you know what the social networks are?  How do you know what the birthdays are?  How do you know what, where do you put the video  without touching any buttons or anything?  I mean it has to go somewhere.  So I'm super optimistic about it.  I think Google Plus is great.  They do keep improving it a little bit.  I think it's great that they're taking out hangouts  and photos because it just makes it easier  to share on other platforms.  And it's, you know, I would be,  I think they keep, all of their social networks  keep getting better.  Google Plus is a million times better than Buzz,  for example.  And if they come out with something,  if they're hatching some new scheme,  it could be really, really great.  And that would be close love.  But are they gonna get us again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They got us in Buzz, they got us in, you know,  they're really gonna be able to get us to,  you gotta be, for a stream to work,  you gotta be committed to it.  Now Google could just make a stream for you or me  because it knows so much about us.  Maybe that's what now is.  Maybe now is the stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now is the stream, right?  I mean, I don't know.  Does Google need a stream?  Why does Google need a stream?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  Because I think that, it's the right question, Gina,  but I think that Facebook, Twitter,  et al have some extended attention.  If you look at the amount of attention  that we give Facebook, it's considerable.  What does instant articles do?  It allows news to integrate,  to ingratiate itself into that stream.  That's where the attention is gonna be.  That's where you want to be.  Google doesn't have that.  Google still organizes the page-based web.  Mobile is about streams, is about rolling things.  The fact that Bradley has streams in his title  says streams matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I think the bigger reason is that people want to join  up together in groups to share their passions  with each other.  And Google could abdicate its involvement  in that human activity entirely  or they can facilitate it in places like Google+.  Google+, is amazing for that sort of thing  on thousands of different passions  that people have around photography and macrame  or whatever it is, scuba diving.  They're rich communities that exist  even though they're not Facebook-sized numbers.  And I don't see why Google would get out of that business.  It's great for harvesting data  about what people are passionate about  to serve them advertising on other sites.  Fantastic for that, theoretically at least.  It's great as a place for people  to have an intelligent conversation with other people  and Google can, like Jeff said,  be involved in those conversations.  I don't see any reason to not do something like Google+.  And besides, Facebook is terrible.  Twitter is very problematic.  There's gotta be some place,  we're getting to the user interest  rather than Google's interest,  there has to be a place online where people can go  and not be bludgeoned to death with advertising  to not be overwhelmed by trolling  and harassment and hate speech.  And Google Plus is the best place for that  even though the journalists on Twitter  have not recognized the fact  that the whole trolling, harassment, hate speech,  silencing of women issue is a Twitter issue.  It's exclusively a Twitter issue, really.  It really is and nobody seems to mind.  And privacy abuses seems to be primarily a Facebook issue.  So there should be a good place.  I think it's good for Google's reputation  to have the place where you can go  and not be harassed by all the things  that bother people online,  even though that's only a couple of hundred million people  and not 1.4 billion.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just don't think it's Google's core competency.  I think Google's really good at utilities  and not so great at social.  And here's the thing,  I look at tons of streams from Google.  I look at my Gmail all day long.  I look at Now all day long.  I'm constantly using Google.  It's not like Google's lacking for advertising space.  I mean, I guess, and the reason why Facebook,  the reason why the stream matters  is you wanna hold people's attention,  but that's so that you can advertise to them, right?  I mean, that's the goal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Gina, the opposite is true.  It's exactly Google's core competency.  Google Plus is nothing more than a search engine.  That's all it is.  When you go to any stream, any circle, any community,  you're looking at a search stream.  That's a search result.  That's what Google does.  It's a social search engine.  That's all Google is.  Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What I say is not the core competency.  I'm saying they don't have the usage on Google Plus  that Facebook and Twitter and even Instagram has.  We've seen other social networks flourish usage-wise  way beyond what Google Plus has seen, right?  I mean, that's true.  It doesn't have the users that these other networks have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I haven't seen any compelling evidence  that Twitter is more active than Google Plus.  OK.  I don't have the answers.  Among journalists, 95% of journalists  and one quarter of the verified people on Twitter  are journalists.  95% of journalists are on Twitter.  And there's very few journalists on Google Plus.  And journalists dominate the space  about what the conventional wisdom is.  But in actual fact, I think Google Plus is bigger  than Twitter and more active.  Really?  That's interesting.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that baffles me.  I don't.  It doesn't feel that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It doesn't feel that way, right?  That's because Twitter is an American lake.  It's an American thing.  Google Plus is radically international.  And if you post anything on Google Plus, 80%  of your responses are going to be  people who live in non-English speaking countries  and they're speaking English as a second language.  It's a very international.  And you actually interact with international people.  Facebook is international.  But when was the last time you had conversations  with people in Egypt and Tasmania and other places  on Facebook?  You don't.  You interact with people who are in your own state almost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The thing is though, if Google Plus's numbers were that good,  we would have heard about that on stage at I.O.  You know what I mean?  Google would be telling us, we've  got this many million active users in a stream.  But we never hear those numbers.  So when you're not hearing those numbers,  it makes you think, oh, these numbers must not be so great.  It's super frustrating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I wish they would release those numbers.  But look at Twitter.  Go to Twitter and you do a big post and look at the data.  They provide the information that Google Plus won't.  And look at the engagement on Twitter tweets.  It's pathetic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but that's because the stream is so big and so fast.  That no individual post is going to get all the attention.  You get attention on Google Plus because you're  speaking in a very small room.  And of course, you're going to get more attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Mike's right that Twitter is small too.  Well, Twitter's not huge either.  I agree.  Yeah, I've been talking about German editors around  of the hip media startups in New York.  And at three spots, they said to them, you're on Twitter.  You're putting out to the world.  They're not.  Right.  Yeah.  Remember that.  You're on Twitter.  They're not.  And I think there's a really good point there  that if you want to reach people,  I've decided I also helped.  I visited Facebook last week and I  was blown away by their attitude toward news  and everything else.  And so I'm trying to, I do move my Twitter feed  into Facebook because it's convenient.  Maybe I shouldn't.  But I'm trying to post on Facebook more  and understand it better.  And it rewards me.  I get interaction there.  It's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You remind me, Mike, though, of somebody like Robert Scoble  who says, well, you'd like Facebook better  if you were doing it right, or you  would like Google Plus better if you were doing it right.  I feel like, OK, maybe I'm doing it wrong.  But how should I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I feel the same.  I feel similarly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How do I do it right?  What's what?  How many people do you circle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do I have 5,000, exactly.  You're the maximum.  Maximum.  Every time I want to circle somebody,  I have to go uncircle somebody else.  I hate the limitation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You want as many people as possible in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I just try to circle my peer groups.  So I probably-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you uncircle rapidly?  Like if you start seeing a lot of cat pictures from somebody,  do you uncircle them?  Yeah, I block.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I block five people a day easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you don't block them for cat pictures.  You block them for bad stuff.  Anything that bugs me, I block people.  Even if it's like, OK, here's a cat picture.  I just don't want to-  Why don't you mute that post or why don't you get rid of that person?  You just block the person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mostly-  Most of my usage of Google Plus is I create conversations  and interact with people about the conversations I've created.  I go to the communities I've created.  You could use Medium to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I could.  I absolutely could.  But boy, you won't get much interaction there.  I mean, you'll get more now.  Yeah.  But that was the point.  You wouldn't get much interaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think it's around-  the narrower your passion, the more valuable Google Plus is  or the more technical.  So if you're an Android fan, Google Plus is heaven  because there's so many Android fans at Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Any Google product is much more popular in Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But also, if you are really into a certain species of tropical fish  or something like that, Google Plus is also heaven for that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And if you're interested in what's the current status of the nation  or who just died, you'd go to Twitter.  Absolutely.  Yeah, absolutely.  So maybe it's just different use cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  And again, my argument is not that everybody should use Google Plus.  I happen to love it.  Lots of people don't love it.  It's a lot.  And especially journalists don't like it.  My theory is that using Google Plus is kind of like being a journalist itself.  There's a lot of argument.  Everybody attacks everything you say.  It's a lot of criticism.  There's a lot of long-winded comments and things you have to interact with.  It's not easy.  It's not light and fun and frivolous like Twitter is.  Twitter is like you can toss off a sentence and then people joke around  and it's fun and it's light and it goes by.  And the stuff that you miss when you were gone, who cares?  It's temporary, yeah.  Where at Google Plus, you get in there and you feel like you're mired  in the quicksand of all this conversation.  There's so much.  It's too much.  And so I think that's why journalists hate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You must have millions of followers.  Well, here's the thing that's interesting about it.  I have never crossed.  I've never been able to get past 500,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm on the secret list of the recommended followers list.  But here's the interesting thing.  It's gone way up lately.  I think it's growing by like two or three thousand a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're the last person really using it.  Well, I mean, it's...  The more active you are in the smaller the universe, the more you're going to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I'm not as active as I'd like to.  Since I started here at Twitter, I've been trying to be active on all the social networks.  And so I'm no longer exclusive to Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I went through a period of being really active, hoping to boost my numbers.  Because I thought, well, maybe if I had more followers, I'd like it better.  And it didn't do diddly.  I got 10,000 more users over a six month period.  I am stalled.  Both you and and Gina and Jeff all have millions of followers.  So I don't know what's going on.  Don't you think...  What's your number now, Mike?  I'm sorry?  What's your follower number?  It's four and a half million.  Four and a half million.  Yeah, and it's nine times more than mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But don't you find that the majority of the Twitter audience is on Google Plus?  How many Twitter followers do you have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have 570,000.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So a lot of it is what you put in is what you get out.  Maybe that's it.  And maybe that's why I like Twitter better than...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, there's stuff I hate about Twitter, obviously, although they do seem to be doing  a much better job of killing trolls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're doing a much better job than they were a year ago, but less of a good job than  they were three months ago.  Oh, yeah.  I've noticed that for a while it was like, wow, they're getting rid of trolls in two  hours.  Now they're back to like, maybe they will, maybe they won't, maybe it's a few days.  So I think they made a big point of it and then they started getting flooded with...  But one of the great things, like you're using a third party app right now, I wish Google  Plus would finally open a real API and let third party developers do something interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It could be better if...  Be way better.  Yeah, yeah, if they had an API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, so there's a lot about Google Plus that really frustrates me, and that's one of them.  But yeah, but I think if you're into tech, I think Google Plus is a great place.  And I know that a lot of...  We do this thing on TNT, which is like, how do you watch TNT post a picture?  Well, it's probably 50-50 Twitter and Google Plus, and nobody does it on Facebook, even  though Facebook is by far the biggest social network.  So the technology fans, the tech people, are not excited about using Facebook.  So that's one point to be considered.  But there's a lot of activity among our fans on Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.  Every time you're on, we're going to end up talking about Google Plus, so let's stop.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that room yelling at us?  No, it was irrelevant.  No, nobody's yelling at us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's important to do, but let's stop.  By the way, a little schadenfreude, Apple is recalling the Beats Pill XL speaker because  of fire risk.  So if you bought one of these...  Oh my.  All of them are being returned.  All of them?  I think they're 30,000 units in North America alone.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, is that an XL?  That's not the XL.  Isn't the XL like huge?  Which one do you have?  It's the big one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I got the little pill.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You got the pill, but it says the pill XL.  Oh, okay.  I don't know what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is very good.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I have a confession to make.  What?  I'm very unhip about this because I'm older, so I listen to talk and talk, you know, Howard  Stern and books and things like that.  I'd never really use Spotify.  Oh, I love Spotify.  I started using Spotify and it's changing.  Do you see?  Yeah, I do.  Do you see that?  I read a great story that Farhad Manjoo had a really nice piece in The Times Today where  he was saying that Spotify says genres will end his kids young, like two and four.  I saw that piece.  This week, they're nuts about Simon and Garfunkel.  Isn't it great?  It's just music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They don't know music.  They love it.  30 million songs now.  It's phenomenal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course, Apple is going to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google Play Music doesn't have the curated collections that are as good as Spotify.  But if Stern leaves Sirius, and I'm thinking, oh, do I stick around with Sirius because  I get the radio?  I think, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why?  I don't know why anybody gets satellite radio.  I just tower-tour.  That's got to be the reason.  That's the only reason.  Because what you want to do is listen to music.  Spotify is infinitely better.  Infinitely better.  Not even close.  And the quality on Spotify is infinitely better.  I don't...  Do you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there a better service than Spotify?  In your view, is Pandora better?  No, Spotify is the one.  People talk about RDO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  RDO is good.  I like Google Play.  I'm in this weird place.  I tried to get a good service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm in this weird place.  I tried to get a good service.  I tried to get a good service.  I tried to use Spotify.  I don't really like that desktop client.  It's weird.  I don't really like the Facebook integration.  I was using Google Play Music for a while.  I just canceled my All Access subscription.  You did?  I wasn't using it enough.  So sometimes I listen to Pandora, but it's got the ads and that's annoying.  I don't know.  I'm sort of in...  Maybe I should revisit Spotify.  I'm in a weird...  I also just listen to a lot of kids' music all the time because of my daughter.  And so I've been coding sort of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Let me see.  Let me see if it has Rafi.  Let me see if Baby Beluga...  Oh yeah, you got Rafi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you don't do random.  You just play it over and over and over and over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's the problem, right?  Edda says, I want Baby Beluga.  But you can look at all the Rafi here, you see?  And you can put this on random and you got Rafi at the wazoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe I should just do that.  So wait, but it's a subscription.  I never actually subscribed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's $10 a month like everything else is.  We had a $7.99 All Access.  And we did too because we were early adopters.  So that's kind of an amazing thing that you canceled that one.  Here's one difference that I have to say, I should disclaimer here.  The new Spotify, which is launched right now on iOS, if you opt in and will soon be everywhere,  includes podcasts, includes all of our podcasts and includes video.  And this is...  He also mentions this in the article, Jeff, is a very interesting play because instead  of a Netflix style video, they're basically going to internet video creators and saying,  how about your shows?  It's great for us.  I think it's huge.  I think it is a whole new ball game because essentially it's like it's Netflix for internet  media.  And in addition to 30 million songs.  So I think it's huge.  If you have iOS, go to your settings on iOS.  If you have the latest version of Spotify, you should get a banner that says, would you  like to try the new Spotify?  Say yes to that and then click shows and you'll see not just our stuff, all the stuff.  And what's interesting is there have been a few people like us who have attempted to  take podcasts, not to...  You always made this distinction, hobby podcasts versus what we do, to the more professional  realm.  I think we have a lot of interest in others who are really creating real content.  And this is going to be very interesting to see what happens because of this.  So I confess, I have a little bit of a dog in this hunt because Spotify with its 60 million  subscribers is carrying us and that makes a big difference for us, I think.  That was part of the reason I tried it.  But it's also...  I will revisit it.  You know what's great is the playlist.  It was fun because I hadn't used it in a while so I resubscribed and all my playlists were  still there.  There's live playlists too so you can subscribe to Spotify playlists created by the BBC and  they continually update it.  So it's kind of like Pandora curated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's a question.  All the old days when people used to make mix tapes, can you make a mix tape on Spotify  and share that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You bet.  You can share the link publicly.  For Independence Day, I made a Spotify playlist a couple of years ago, which I shared I think  on Google Plus, ironically.  It's 62 songs, it's four hours of This Land Is Your Land.  And I shared this and I don't see the numbers but there are quite a few people who subscribe  to this and I think that that's one of the things that's also very interesting.  The curation is not just from the pros, it is from anybody.  You know what Andy Anaheco did?  I loved this.  Google Plus, he asked people to add comments to their face.  If they had only one song, they're kind of like the Desert Island disc.  He got 154 songs and then one of his fans, Fido, put it out as a Spotify playlist.  We used to put all the music out from the Tech Guy show that we used in Bumpers as a  Spotify playlist so people could listen to the whole song.  There's a lot.  There's audiobooks.  It's amazing.  This is a very interesting play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And of course, you know what?  I'm wondering about the economics of it because so far I haven't paid because I'm just seeing  what the ad experience is like.  And unlike radio where you had no verification of what ad was listened to, here on a one-to-one  basis you know the ads listened to and the revenue share back of that ad, I wonder if  it's not a lot more in the long run than radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't comment on that.  We hate that one.  I know.  I don't normally do this kind of thing.  That never happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina, the funniest thing last week is we had on Ars Technica.  Ron Amadio.  Thank Ron.  Ron Amadio.  And you know, he knew some stuff beforehand on embargo and four people in a row said,  don't tell Leo.  Don't tell Leo.  That's so funny.  And then on the air, he got kind of freaked because we got near a topic where he knew  something and we knew that he knew something.  Leo's asking him.  I love that.  I love not having NDAs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the funny thing is I don't do NDAs as a journalist, but unfortunately, I'm also  a businessman.  And as a businessman, in order to do some of the business that we do like this Spotify  thing has been in the works for six months, you know how hard it is for me not to say  anything.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're a natural sharer.  You're a natural sharer.  Your wife comes out ready to gag you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and Lisa knows more.  She is very judicious about what she tells me because she knows stuff.  And she says, I can't tell you because you are a blabbermouth.  I like natural sharer.  You're a professional blabbermouth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's an open book.  It's like it's endearing.  It's just like naturally you want to tell people about stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to tell people about stuff.  Plus I talk for like 40 hours a week.  I got to say something.  She can't say the same old stories over and over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Knowledge sharing is a noble calling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that we this Spotify thing is just a little part of what is I'm hoping going  to change transform everything is what because it's all internet media and internet media  needs places people can discover it can play it.  So this is just one we have other deals in place.  I mean, this is I just tell us about those.  Well, you know, most of them Stitcher, you know very well.  It's been huge for TNT because Stitcher features tech news today fairly frequently.  And we see probably a 50 percent bump in downloads because of that.  Yeah, they're huge.  It's huge.  There's quite a few slacker tune in internet radio.  Huge.  In fact, the Amazon Alexa.  If you say listen to TNT or tune into TNT, it'll do it to tune in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  And the other thing that's great about tuning is they have a live stream, right, which is  rare among these services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I feel very positive about the transformation that's happening.  The problem for us is, of course, discovery.  We, you know, we make the best possible product, the best product we can, and we hope people  find it.  But when people find it, I think they like it.  And I have a certain number of people like it.  And that the key for us is that finding it.  And what am I going to do?  Advertise on ABC?  That's not going to work.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's take a break.  Come back with more.  Do you want to do a change log?  I don't think we prepared one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The whole show is kind of a change log.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sorry about that.  I tried to put one together, but there actually wasn't enough that we wouldn't cover just  through IO.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll let you pick something.  Because there's some, I mean, we're only like a third through this, but we got to get rid  of Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When?  Soon?  Well, my fault, my parents flight has been delayed.  Thank God.  Thank God for snow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or whatever.  So you have a little more time because you were supposed to leave now.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, good.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll take a little break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  17 million Chromecasts.  Yep.  Another good thing for web media, right?  Really good thing for an intermediate.  We'll talk about that in a second.  But first, FreshBooks.  Hey, I got to tell you, this is a good thing for anybody who's a independent business person  or a freelancer.  FreshBooks makes your life a lot easier.  I did mine when I was sending out invoices and I had to send them to Canada and they  were in Canadian dollars.  It was just a pain in the butt.  But FreshBooks takes care of that.  Any currency.  5 million people use it now to send out invoices, to let their clients know how much the expenses  were, the time and hours to get paid faster, on the average of five days faster, because  your client can just press a button in the email and says, pay them.  And that uses all the online payment services, makes it very easy for your clients.  We want that.  And should a client be late, pay no problem.  Automatic reminders make sure you don't have to make that awkward phone call, but they  pay you.  The mobile app is great.  Use that to track billable hours.  You can even take pictures of receipts so that you can make sure they get in the invoice.  And if you ever run into a problem or you have an idea, they're great on that.  The FreshBooks supports rock stars are amazing.  Right there at the FreshBooks offices, a real person.  There they are.  They're nice.  They're Canadian.

We thought there'd be a Chromecast too.  That was one of the rumors.  But you know what's wrong with the Chromecast one?  It's pretty good still.  Yeah, right.  1.5 billion casts.  I often choose it as my, you know, there's, you can watch Netflix in a hundred ways, but  I really like the interface between, you know, using the phone to pick something, which  is a better way frankly than a remote on the TV, and then casting it.  And I find myself doing that more and more as more and more apps support it.  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, I really like that they quantified it as in touches.  I thought that was a cool, or taps.  It was either taps or touches.  But they're basically saying casts, right?  But it was like, you know, it was a very clear visual, like someone pressed this button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And with HBO now coming to them, the Apple exclusive ran out.  I think you're going to, I feel like you're going to see, you're going to see more and  more stuff.  And eventually it's just going to be, you just have Chromecast.  Do they build it into TVs now?  Do you want to have to buy the little dongle?  I think some TVs have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't know that.  I think so.  That some TVs have it built in.  They announced a few API changes too.  Like you can queue up things to cast.  What does that mean?  Oh, playlist.  Oh, that's nice.  Yeah, multiplayer gaming, a second screen.  So like you can make your app use the TV as a second screen.  So if your device was a remote control, the screen would be the second screen.  And yeah, multiplayer game power.  So really kind of turning it into a game console.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  And Sony and Samsung and other TVs do have it built in.  And yeah, why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anything with Android TV in it would have Chromecast as well.  Who's doing Android?  Sony?  Is it Sony now that's doing Android TV?  I can't remember.  Yeah, I believe Sony is.  I think so, yeah.  I think so.  I'm excited about Android TV.  Is that going to be...  The Shield looks really...  They handed that out, believe it or not, if you went to the right session at Google I  O.  The day before it all started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh.  Yeah, it was on the Wednesday, for what I understand.  Oh, the session's on a Wednesday, huh?  Well, or Nvidia had their own thing going on.  I want to buy that Shield.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That looks like the right Android TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a little more expensive, but I agree.  It's the right one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And this isn't the flip-up, the fuller thing.  No, this is a separate...  Okay, a set-top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a new product from Nvidia, running on their...  What is it?  K1 or X1 processor?  The K1 processor.  They're not selling that on the...  I'm looking on the Play Store to see.  They have Chromecast, Nexus Player, GamePad.  Yeah.  200 bucks, yeah.  But, you know, really, yeah, that's twice as much as a Roku, for instance.  Boy, it's a lot more capable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and for, what is it, 50 bucks extra?  I can't remember if it's 50 or 100.  They have storage, too.  Yes, right.  500 gigs of storage, which...  What would you do with that?  I mean, that's a lot of storage, but I mean, when you're talking set-top entertainment,  the Nexus Player comes with, what, 16 gigs?  Oh, so you would put apps on here.  Yeah, so that would be apps, and I imagine you could do offline storage of your media  and stuff, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So 200 bucks for the 16-gigabyte version.  It's hard to know whether you need the 500, but the 500 is $299, and it's available, released  June 12th, and you could get the 16-gig version today.  I'm so tempted.  It's Amazon Prime and everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just there all by me now.  4K support.  With a button that's easy to...  Oh, man.  Google Cast support.  What are you going to do?  One click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Voice commands.  Oh, my God.  It's just there.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You've got to...  Well, you would get the 500 gig if you were going to game, for sure.  But I don't know if I'm going to game.  What kind of...  What apps do you have to sit in there?  One little click, Leo, and I'll do the work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stop it!

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Stop it!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stop it!  Why is it showing that I can also put a micro SD card in there?  Does it support micro SD?  Good question.  Yes, it does.  So you could add...  Maybe you could add some memory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  128 gigs of SD card is what Edward is saying.  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, why...  I have 16 gig, and if I feel like I need more down the road, I can always do that.  I have micro SD lying around all over the place.  In fact, it would be better to add...  Oh, and you can add other USB storage.  All right.  Then get the 16 gig version, and you can just put an extra hard drive or something.  Okay, I'll just...  Let me just click buy now.  Oh, sorry.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Whoops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It happens.  Buy now happens.  There's a controller.  Does it come with...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I believe it comes with one controller, yes.  And one remote.  Or it comes with a controller or a remote.  I can't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you have an Android Wear watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't need a controller.  Can I do it with an Android Wear watch?  You can.  I could talk to my TV with my watch.  I think you...  I don't know about talking, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, yeah, the Shield Android TV comes with one controller.  So I don't believe it comes with the remote.  The remote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'll let you know when I get it on Friday.  Ha!  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's all it took.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's all it took.  I got a problem.  I admit it.  I got a problem.  They talked about Loon and how well Loon's doing.  That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, people were cheering for a lot of the facts that they trotted out about Loon,  and those are old facts.  They didn't announce anything new, new.  They're doing better with how many days the balloons can be in the air and stuff.  They were shattering records a year ago on that.  It's everything that...  The mesh networking, all the rest, is essentially what they've been talking about for many months.  So it wasn't a lot of new stuff.  It's just they're doing a little better all the time, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Patriot Act, kind of extended, but kind of not as badly.  Well, I think this is really big news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's good.  Yeah, it was great.  And I think that, damn it, Edward Snowden's a hero.  He's a whistleblower.  And he's changed the discussion as much as anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's got to feel good about this.  I think the demagogues in Congress can't have it both ways.  They can't voluntarily choose to change U.S. law based on what Snowden revealed and also  say he's a traitor.  And court cases are citing, explicitly saying, this is Edward Snowden, caused this.  Otherwise, we wouldn't be fixing this problem.  So I think that anybody who calls him a traitor in Congress and also votes to change the law  based on what they wouldn't have done if they didn't know what he revealed, they're just  full of crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do need some help, though, because like Ariz Technica said, what?  The Patriot Act, it's been extended, so snooping continues.  Let the snooping resume.  Senate revised Patriot Act surveillance measures.  The New York Times said, U.S. surveillance in places 9-11 sharply limited.  Which is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the coverage has been confusing.  Did we win or did we lose?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did we win or did we lose?  Yeah, like what happened?  So we won something.  So look, the Patriot Act was going to get extended in some form or fashion.  Yes, exactly.  I mean, yes, the clock ran out, but that didn't mean the Senate then says, OK, we give up.  They're going to continue on.  The House had passed what was the U.S. Freedom Act, USA Freedom Act, which did sharply limit  the kind of phone snooping they could do, the mass collection of phone data with some  additional checks and balances, but did allow it to continue.  So when the Patriot Act, those sections, the three sections of Patriot Act expired, including  215, that actually did end phone surveillance.  But the bill, the USA Freedom Act, reinstituted it with better protections.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly.  So that's really the biggest protection is that instead of the NSA having physical possession  of an unfettered access to these, the metadata, phone metadata, where somebody's like, I wonder  what my ex-girlfriend's up to, and they could just type it in and get information.  That data is now in the hands of the telecoms.  And when the NSA wants to get access to it, they have to go through a procedure and get  a judge's approval and all the rest.  So that's a big deal in that one area of mass surveillance.  And it's an upgrade.  It's an improvement.  But still, by and large...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So now the phone company collects it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that it's less of a...  I think that there's been so much press since the Edward Snowden revelations that any terrorist  worth his salt at all is not going to be ignorant about the collection of mass metadata.  So I think it's been spoiled already for the NSA.  And so I don't think this is anything worse for them in any event.  I don't think the benefits are still there for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mitch McConnell, of course, said, one more tool has been taken away from those who defend  our country every day.  Oh, he lost.  Well, he lost.  But he also didn't really lose it.  In fact, I almost feel like I'm a cynic.  Yeah, he played the game.  We want to hold on to this.  They got what they got.  There's still plenty of authority.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's still plenty of things for them to do.  And the phone company is still holding on to all this data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not like nobody's collecting your data.  Yeah, they're collecting it.  It's not like those judges on the FISA Court are that, you know, standing up for our rights,  are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think they care.  At least listen to an outsider.  Now more of that can be made open.  It was baby steps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It doesn't, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If I were John C. Dvorak, I'd probably say, ah, it's all theater.  By the way, speaking of security theater, you saw the feds tested the TSA, trying to  get guns and bombs past them.  95% got by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I saw a lot of photos that people took.  They received the news while they're sitting in the airport waiting for a flight.  They're thinking, oh great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So essentially, much like the mass collection of phone data, the TSA is completely ineffectual.  Yes.  Well, maybe they catch one in 20 guns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're the perfect government program.  They're completely ineffectual and super expensive.  And annoying as heck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, expensive and time wasted too, like for consumers.  For the economy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My sister, who's accompanying my parents up here for our daughter's graduation, she texted  me just a little while ago, my father carries a money clip that he's had for 50 years.  And it's a little tiny blade and the money clip's that big, right?  16 bucks, he had to mail it back to himself.  So he's grumbling all the way up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's the point, is that the TSA found his freaking money clip, but the guy with  the gun went right through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like my 90-year-old father in a wheelchair with a money clip.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We got him!  We got him!

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's even worse than that.  There have been studies that have found that because of the number of people who have avoided  flying and instead drove, because of all the hassles of security around flying, the number  of people who have died in car accidents that wouldn't have died is higher than the number  of people killed on 9-11.  So all of the security theaters killing people at a higher rate than the terrorists are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh my, that is the most depressing thing I've heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But don't bring that bottled water onto the flight.  Yeah, oh my, I haven't drank that breast milk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just prove it to us, come on, just have a sip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's this wonderful cartoon, I don't recall unfortunately who the cartoonist was, but  basically they said, oh this bottle of water could be an explosive, I'm just going to put  it here in this bin full of other potential explosives that's surrounded by hundreds of  people.  Yeah, that's a good place to stick it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But just for the TSA people watching, the Homeland Security officials who are watching  this show, I love it.  Keep up the good work, you're doing a great job, thanks.  I'll be on the plane next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, I do have to say, I do have to say the poor guys were there on the front  line, you know, and I don't want to, I've got to go to the airport so I'm not going  to get a 9-11 riff, but there is some level that we do need and I do salute it happening  to some extent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We know, you know, we're not willing, we know what needs to be done, but we're not willing  to do it because LL does it.  And it's a personal questioning of everybody before they get on the plane.  And with really well-trained security professionals.  But we're willing to take off our shoes, but I'm not sure, you know, I mean, we're all,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  every country in the world will eventually be Israel.  We're getting to that.  We're all Team Israel.  They're way ahead of the curve there on all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So sorry, I love the TSA.  Actually, I do.  Lisa left her iPad on a plane.  We had gotten out of the, by the way, this is not the right word, the word you use, sanitized  area is not the correct word, but can you stop it?  It's not sanitized in any way, but we exited the sense.  Makes you nauseous.  Makes me feel better that it's clean.  No, it's not.  We left the sanitized area and Lisa wanted to get her iPad because she knew where it  was.  And they said, no, no, you're, you're now in public.  You crossed the line.  And the airport shutting down.  So all the TSA agents were going home.  So there's no way to go through security.  And a very kind TSA agent said, all right, all right, hold on.  Let me, let me go back to the gate and see if you left it there.  Went, went back, got it, brought it to her.  She gave him a big hug and kiss.  So they're nice.  It was a violation of the law.  And I bet you anything he could have lost his job for doing that.  Yeah.  I said I would let you all pick stories.  Anybody?  I think we've covered it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't find anything we haven't covered.  You actually covered most of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We skipped around, but I mean, we didn't talk about Android Pay a whole lot, but there's  not really a whole lot to say.  We already have Android Pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was called Google Wallet.  Now Google Wallet will be peer to peer payment like Venmo and Android Pay will be Google  Wallet.  Right.  And a story.  Yeah, OK.  I like Google Wallet.  Keep doing it.  It's called Android Pay.  That was quick.  Anything else?  Yeah, good work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I probably need to go in about five anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, well, let me do a quick break and then we'll come back.  We'll let you start with your number of the week and then we'll wrap these things up.  You're watching this week's In Google with Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New  York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm actually going to Newark Airport.  Go to Newark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mr. Mike Elgin from TNT, our news director.  By the way, Mike will join me on Monday, Monday, 10 a.m. Pacific.  I will start a little earlier, right?  As soon as you're done with TNT.  Yeah.  For the Apple keynote at WWDC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I'm hoping we'll do what Tim Cook does in that when we really want to emphasize something,  we'll talk really quiet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very quiet.  I once interviewed Kenneth Branagh, the great actor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In the movie Henry V, he plays the king and he talks like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I said, Kenneth, why are you talking like that?  And he said, because the king doesn't have to talk loud.  In fact, the quieter the king talks, the more the courtiers listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's true of Tim Cook as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  True for Tim Cook as well.  Gina Trapani from SmarterWear.  I'm sorry.  Forget SmarterWear.  ThinkUp.com.  And MakerBase.  MakerBase.se.  MakerBase.se.  I love MakerBase.  When are you going public?  When are you doing that?  We're lining up a few things for launch right now.  I think it's going to be end of a month or so.  Let's say that.  I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You understand.  You understand.  Yeah.  I understand.  Our show today brought to you by LegalZoom.  I'm going to love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by LegalZoom.  Oh, man, if you are a business person, the next Steve Jobs.  You know, it's funny.  When Apple was formed, remember, it was Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and this guy, Ron Wayne,  who put in money and stuff.  And he said, you know what, guys?  They brought him in as a business person who understood stuff.  He said, I don't want to be part of this because you guys are not incorporated and I'm the  only guy with assets.  So please take this back.  I don't want it.  He'd be worth $10 billion right now.  But that's a very good point.  If you're forming a business and you know what?  This was a lesson I learned when we started to it.  Form an LLC or corporation.  You may say, I can't afford a law firm.  That's why you go to LegalZoom.  They're not a law firm, but they can help you get this paperwork done that helps you  start your business, protects your assets, protects your house, maybe keeps your partners  involved.  And if you need advice from an independent attorney, they can connect you.  It's really a great system.  Incorporate or form an LLC.  Trademark your products or services.  I did that too.  I did a trademark on the name twit and the service mark for the logo.  If you've got a patent, you can register, apply for a patent or secure your invention.  This is an incredible thing.  Over the last 10 years, more than a million people have used LegalZoom to start their  businesses, to turn their ideas into a reality.  And you can do the same for a lot less than you think.  Protect your family too with a will and more.  That's what we did.  Go to LegalZoom.com to get started.  They can even help if you have a great idea, but you don't know where to begin.

I'm going to do that so you will get out of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you.  I know.  I should have prepared more.  I've got all these numbers.  Which one do I want?  Which one do I want?  Oh, okay.  Well, this one.  I got one.  $150 off your Nexus 6.  Where's my Google Fi in?  I know.  I have no Fi.  I keep looking at my email.  Tony Wang, our editor.  I got one.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got a Google Fi.  They said it's going to be late summer.  Mr. iPhone.  With your Nexus and my invitation, imagine what we could accomplish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is a problem Tony had too.  So I think this confirms what we had said that people who are getting the invitations  are not Nexus owners.  They want you guys to buy Nexus.  Oh, that's dirty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait.  Can you buy a Fi invitation on eBay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tony, you said no.  He says, I think I'll stick with AT&T.  They emailed me again today.  They emailed you again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They told me I forgot to sign up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You forgot to sign up.  Yeah.  And you forgot to buy a Nexus 6 as well.  What are you sporting there?  What is that?  A OnePlus One.  A OnePlus One.  No wonder.  That's why.  Exactly.  You're on iPhone.  Yeah, I'll bring in the Nexus 6.  Except that 5.  It could be like...  But wait a minute.  That'll happen and then I'll get an invitation and I'll be angry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I already have AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile, and Verizon.  You'll have a complete set.  I don't need another phone carrier.  Collect them all.  How about this?  I got a number for you, Jeff.  I'll take it.  That's the bounty WikiLeaks is offering for details on the trade treaty.  Yeah.  How can the president sign a secret trade treaty?  Does he not work for us?  I know, it's really ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do they say, well, we would tell you, but if we told you, it wouldn't...  What?  It wouldn't be right?  We wouldn't be able to get the deals we were going to get because we're secret?  No.  Ridiculous.  You know what?  If they told us, we'd be angry.  Yep.  That's why.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  I'm going to depart.  See you, Jeffrey.  Thank you for letting me off.  Bye, Jeff.  Gina, come back sooner.  Mike, always good to see you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good luck with TSA.  Love you, my friend.  Yeah, don't watch the show.  That's not the same Jeff Jarvis.  It's a different one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm just picking up.  You're on our list now.  Oh, wow.  He left.  He's gone.  Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hi, Gina.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you have a tip or anything for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I get asked this question all the time.  It's like, how do I learn to be a developer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're going to be doing it in the future.  They're going to be doing it in the future.  But at the end, I mean, the goal is to get you to be a hireable Android developer.  That's the nanodegree that they announced.  But Udacity also just has a ton of other totally free Android courses and free courses that  can get you kind of from, you know, starting to be a beginner off the ground.  And it really looks like they're kind of up on with this partnership with Google, up on  kind of the latest and greatest of Android development techniques and tools and stuff.  So just looks really cool.  If you've ever been interested in or wanted to become an Android developer, definitely  check out the Udacity offerings.  You don't even have to do the supercharged, you know, 12-month nanodegree that costs $200  a month.  There's a ton of free material there, too, that can get you started.  So yeah, it's pretty cool.  And if you want to do the readiness assessment, it's just a few questions.  And it'll kind of tell you, oh, yeah, it looks like, you know, you're right for this or  maybe you should check out some of this other material that's more for beginners or for  people who have less time or whatever.  So I was really impressed with it when I checked it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I apologize because I mocked it because of the name during our live stream.  I said, when's the Pico degree and the femto degree?  It minimizes it.  Yeah, it does minimize it.  I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  12 months of 10 hours a week like this nanodegree just seems like a bad.  No, no, that was maybe a marketing mistake on their part.  Nanodegree seemed like a bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, a number of people wrote to me and said, this is a great program and I'm really  benefiting and, you know, I had to take a lot of courses and it's by no means, you know,  a diminutive degree.  It's a good degree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not a walk to the park.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I apologize.  Good on you, nanodegree.  And you go to Udacity.com.  Is that the place to go to find out more?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's udacity.com maybe slash Google.  That should probably should be on the front page.  This was a big announcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Put it on the front page.  I wonder if I'd qualify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I should take the qualification because I have no training.  I'd like to find.  I love programming.  I want to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a couple of questions like, hey, look at these two methods.  Which one do you think would work?  Just kind of to get a sense of where you're programming at and stuff.  So, yeah, it's worth worth taking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo, you need to take the femto degree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's this like they have this little video of these two folks saying, you know, there  are going to be times when you're going to get stuck and your code's not going to work  and it's going to be really frustrating.  And that doesn't mean that failure is happening.  That's what just learning feels like.  I mean, it's funny they have to do that.  Yeah, but that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's really true.  Most of my workday is spent feeling extremely frustrated because the thing I'm trying to  get to work doesn't work.  And that is just a part of being a goater.  So I really like their approach to it.  I felt like they couched it and very they explained it very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mike Elgin, you have a tool or a tip or anything you'd like to share with us?  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have a tool that was inspired by your clothing.  The great suspender.  Great suspender.  Wait a minute, I got to look it up here.  This has actually been around for a couple of years, but I don't think enough people  know about this.  And I certainly didn't know about it until very recently, maybe three weeks ago.  Here's what it does.  We all know that Chrome is a pig and gobbles up tons of memory, especially if you have  if you have a tab addiction like I do.  I typically run 20, 30, 40, 50 tabs open at once.  It just gobbles up memory and slows my whole system down.  So what the great suspender does is it removes the content of tabs out of memory and retains  the tab.  So, for example, if you've got 30, 30 tabs open, you can set a timer.  For example, I set mine for 15 minutes.  After 15 minutes, the tab goes to sleep, essentially, and it's removed from memory.  And so the ones that I'm actively using, the tabs, they're alive.  They're just normal tabs.  But the ones that I've been neglecting for more than 15 minutes are removed from memory.  And the performance is amazing.  Both my wife's MacBook and mine, we're both using it and we don't even use our fans anymore.  No kidding.  Our fans never kick in anymore.  Wow.  It's the most fantastic.  And it's very flexible, too.  There are other extensions like this, but this is the most flexible one because you  can say, OK, on this website, never suspend this website.  On this particular tab, I'll leave this open for now.  And or, you know, unsuspend all tabs, suspend all tabs.  You can do anything.  And here's the other good part.  When you've got let's say you've got three tabs open and ten tabs that are suspended  when you shut down your system, when you come back and boot it back up, it's still in that  state.  Those ten tabs are still suspended and those three tabs are still active.  It's really great.  You can just install the extension and forget about it and you're just going to have better  performance.  That's sweet.  Yep.  Or you could just close tabs.  You could, but that's not going to happen.  We both know that's not going to happen.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I close tabs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, it's so weird because you see people like you and God, Gibson.  Yeah.  Chris, apparently our intern, we're just they have you can't even read the tabs because  there's so many of them.  They're the size of a fingernail.  Yeah.  All across your page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can't even see the little speaker to know what the noise is.  You don't know what the hell it is.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Once you can see the speaker, I'm closing tabs.  I'm cleaning that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK.  I just think like, well, I just when I'm look how many tabs I got, two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's another extension called one tab that will take all of your open tabs and it will  put them all as links in a single tab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm doing a show here and I only got one tab.  As I do news stories, I close the tab when we're done with it.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leo, you and I have the same tab personality.  I think the tab management is probably really expressive.  What kind of person are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You need to close your tabs.  If you're going to have tabs, you need to close your tabs.  Closing tabs.  Closing tabs.  Tabs are fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love tabs.  I guess you want a cool tab trick.  Wunderlist, Wunderlist from Zechs Wunderkinder in Berlin was just sold to Microsoft.  You and I, who was it?  No, because Gina has her own to-do list program.  I should use to-do text.  I love it.  I've used them all.  I remember the milk, any do.  But I started using Wunderlist because it was very, very cross platform, including this.  It has a Chrome extension.  Then when I open a new tab, my to-do list pops up.  That's a good way to make sure you do your to-do list, right?  You can add to list there.  So Wunderlist, I don't know what Microsoft's going to do with it, but they bought Sunrise  and they bought a Comple and they didn't kill either of them.  So I'm hoping that that won't go away because it's a really nice to-do list.  Almost as good as Gina Trapani's to-do.txt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I think it's a little more user friendly than having to use the command line to add to-dos  That's why I like user.txt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a command line to-do list.  Now that's hot.  Yeah.  That's the new hotness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's make this as hard to use as possible.  I've been using the Emacs to-do and Organizer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a great PIM in Emacs.  It's just great.  Gina, thank you so much.  Please come back.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I will.  Thank you.  This was a lot of fun.  It was really fun to talk over Google I.O. with you last week and to recap today.  We adore you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You were on All About Android last night.  If people haven't heard that yet, you must listen.  It was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
