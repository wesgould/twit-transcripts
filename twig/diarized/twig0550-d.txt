Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is the wonderful Stacy Higginbotham from Stacy on iot.com and her great podcast with Kevin Toffoli iot  podcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know we were thinking Stacy a quick question last week we were all in suspense as to whether or not you were gonna do a  public event

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That night did you end up doing it or no? Oh, I did it was actually the next day and I did I went to a  Seattle and I gave my talk in front of a crowd of 250 people what?  They were supposed to be 400 something odd people but how you're brave  Well, I was on stage

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I bet you you couldn't do that today  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, cuz Seattle just said that we can't have any more than 250 people together in a place

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, Marin just announced our account. It just the south of us a hundred people  Yeah, this is but I all of this some people are saying well this is overreaction it's being sensationalized  But it and you know what with any luck in in a few months, it'll seem like crazy  We were we closed all that stuff with any luck. It'll it'll be the right thing to do and everybody would be fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anthony Fauci today testified that this virus is at least ten times  As fatal as flu  As of right now, it's thirty times. Yeah, he thinks it'll go down

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He also testified that the mortality rate was only 1% which is different than the who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so what he said was it's been it's running about 3% now  He thinks when we finally get testing in it's gonna reduce though in Italy. It's 5% Right? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's I was like without adequate testing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm so how do we how does you know but even but he was trying to make a place he should have expressed it  Different I think he was trying to make a point that even if you come down to kind of a lowest case  It's still worse still ten times

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And of course, yeah, there's no me because it's a novel virus and there's no vaccine. So people are vulnerable  The the really thing I the phrase I really like and I'm seeing it on Twitter and other places is flatten the curve  Zainab to Fiki wrote a great blog post in Scientific American  Explaining why that's really what we're all about here  The the coronavirus curve or any any epidemic  I  Am a member I just haven't logged in let me quickly log into the New York Times so that I can  Show you an example of this curve. The idea is  That there is a curve if it gets and by the way the who today declared it's a pandemic  There's a curve the dotted line is the number of cases  or I'm sorry the the  Y-axis number of cases the dotted line is the capacity of our health care system and  Without protective measures  The number of cases can go above our ability to handle it. That's what's happening in Italy right now with not enough  Hospital beds not enough ventilators with protective measures if  People do their best to wash their hands stay healthy not congregates, you know social distancing self quarantine  You can keep that curve below the line on our health system  Notice by the way with protective measures that doesn't mean fewer cases, right?  It spreads the cases out it flattens the curve and this is from the CDC and and Zainab's  Excellent article in the science a great illustration

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of doctors have been using that illustration. You see it kind of all over there. So it's quite  Standard in the field, which means they all believe it and it's important to understand it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and so that's and I think it's important to say it also because I think it helps people understand what we're about. We're not  You know, what we're trying to do is take care of people like Jeff  The oldest most vulnerable members of our society  But and and think of your parents my my mom and dad are 86, right and  It would almost certainly be fatal for them. The fatality rate is very high for people in their age bracket  So I want to protect them. That's what we're up to. Yeah some Florida

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Old folks homes are now restricting

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Prohibiting visitors. Yeah. Yeah, and if you're a kid don't even think about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'm not gonna make this show by the way be a coronavirus show  We're gonna get this out of our systems and go on but there is some  There are some reporting to do NAB has been canceled now the National Association of Broadcasting  Very big show in Las Vegas  Didn't see that so has e3 the big that by the way NABs in April  So they're looking ahead this is by the way huge economic problem South by in your old town Stacy  canceled and that means  hotels restaurants  These their employees which is the worst of it there  And then their employees as a consequence will not get paid. Yeah, it is a it is a cascade  I'm going to Stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No  I was gonna say South by they actually  The organization that puts it on lead off a third of their workers and they're contemplating bankruptcy because they

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can't so their insurance doesn't cover

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's one of the things that you know, I'm here  I am running a small business and we're also on the edge as a small business owner  I understand that by the way, this is not to add to your anxiety Stacy. Oh  It's gonna be fine  Sorry  Many small businesses including ours don't have a lot of cushion, right?  Nobody builds their business so that they could have no business for three months and then just spring back in action  No, so that is it's and there's a cascade effect from all of that  The NBA and the NCAA have announced that ongoing their basketball games will have no  Attendees the March Madness will have nobody in the stands. It's gonna be eerily quiet

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're gonna be just strangely quiet like watching a practice. That's a lot of people out of work

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a concession workers at security. Yeah, it's a lot of people who won't be working. Yeah, so  The other thing we want to do and this sounds self-serving, but I mean it in the best way when you're home listen to more podcasts  Yeah, yes  There are ways you can stay in touch  I think stay informed now is a good time to think about how you could perform your job at home  Certainly we are as a business, but I think you know and and to that gold Google's announced that they're gonna offer their business level hangouts  For free for the next at least through April with as for education

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They increased it mark 250 people we went to 250 plus recording which we didn't have before in our account at the school

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think every Microsoft's doing this with teams everybody's doing that it's you know, and it is it's I'm the cynic and say oh  Capitalism at work as they're figuring well, we're gonna get some new businesses way, but it's also the right thing to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's let me say this. Let me say this just just for my little  Defending the internet hat for a moment  We go from moral panic to viral panic  Imagine because this germ is just as German as German can happen whatever right so just imagine everything we're going through right now  If you were going through this with no internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, thank goodness. No Google. No Twitter. No Facebook. That's a very good point

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Something to thank goodness. Yes, I read I read somebody I like last week  I haven't written a response to this yet trying to say the internet's broken  We have to fix it and I just gets and the universe doing more harm to society. No  No, yeah, we got to fix it. Like we have to put the perfect supporting press. Yes fine. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But for God's sakes there are some instances where I'm gonna look squarely at Clemson University  I saw a headline yesterday that says a  potential coronavirus  Student or a person there and I'm like why even print that and put it out there?  It's it's they're sick, but you didn't necessarily have to put out there that they could possibly have the  Caution as they say and you know, that's that's full just just well well  14-day

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Incubation if the person actually gets it you don't find out for 14 days  Well be a little pissed at Clemson

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the other challenge is there's no testing right now  So you're gonna be possible for weeks without I mean you could die and still be possible for well

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Give you an example we went to  RSA two weeks ago you and I went to that party afterwards now  We've learned that two attendees did have coronavirus one of them a guy in his 40s is in an induced coma  He has it so badly  and so  That probably  Was spread throughout many of the attendees at ours  We don't know how many people they said hi to we don't and and who knows we we weren't at the convention  But we were at the after party after party. We probably talked to people who talked to some of them  So it's I get your point in it feels like sensationalism. You don't want to sensationalize. I think there's a really Bill Gates. I  Think did a very good job of all people  describing this he wrote a  Piece in the New England Journal of Medicine an opinion piece  He said we don't know this could be that once-in-a-century pathogen everybody's been worried about  We don't know and with  One hopes we pray that it isn't mm-hmm, but it would be foolish  And irresponsible not to act as if it were  Much better to act if as it were and and prevent millions of deaths than to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's probably not mm-hmm. It's a mistake and I didn't mean to step on you and which I did

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  know I stepped on you but because it just it pissed me off when I saw it yesterday because  that that's a small town in upstate, South Carolina and  I've lived there and I got a good feel on how people think and how people operate down there and everybody is so paranoid  My own family included I you have no idea how many phone calls I've gotten their texts  I've gotten about it and I'm like we all stop reading the news because well, that's the question

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Should you just bury your head in the sand? No, you know, it's but you shouldn't be

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Shape and don't have to be you know be informed be informed to be prudent. Yeah, but don't panic. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hard not to panic though when you're reading all this buying up all of the water on the planet

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, all the toilet tissue and all what is that doing? Somebody had a theory Karsten. Why did you buy up everything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  somebody had a theory that the toilet paper thing is  Is  Kind of an irrational it's inexpensive and it has to do with cleaning and it's so it's this irrational thing  It's not likely that anybody's so if you go to my numbers

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a paper the toilet paper was already gone by the time I got there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but you looked there's a Leo exactly what you're saying if you go to my numbers. There's one down there called  zero risk bias  An academic writing that's the name for what this is exactly because you you can't control everything  So you control the one thing you can control? Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Yes. There's plenty of toilet paper in the US. So why are people hoarding it? This is from the conversation.com  And by the way, this happens every time Johnny Carson  Created a fake toilet paper really rush many decades ago by making a joke about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's a showman. What do you expect? Yeah, and so

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well here it is. They actually mention it  Yeah government press release warning of a potential shortage in toilet paper led to a lot of press coverage  But no outright panic buying until Johnny Carson joked about it during his opening monologue instead of laughing people began to hoard  toilet paper

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now I have a better from Costco and they were horny. They were going after bleach. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So don't hoard don't panic oh man people were hoarding like crazy, but it's not a bad thing to I don't know Stacey I don't  What so I you you tweeted publicly about how you know you and you even wrote a post on your blog about this  You said it's like 2010 all over again  You can you can you start obsessively reading Twitter and and that's risky obviously for a lot of reasons  Mm-hmm. I know you love Twitter, but geez

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will say to because this is something I've obviously been thinking and writing a lot about because I've been so anxious a  Lot of mine comes from the fact that I am realizing  That I had a lot of faith in our government because I feel like the United States was you know first world country  We're we're pretty good at stuff like this  in what's come  What this feels like or brings home is  We have let basic  funding fail for a while  We don't really have the resources in place and we don't have the expertise or the leadership that may not be  Actually necessary, but is definitely psychologically necessary. So I feel like  Maybe a person in a in Venezuela might feel like I feel like a big  Support leg that I have counted on and not even realized I counted on has been taken away from me  and so now I feel like  This is this is driving all of that home and it's driving at home. I'm not worried about being sick  Actually, if I get sick I get sick, you know, I'm not actually worried about that, but I am worried about  Understanding like I'm worried about the lack of testing. I'm worried about the lack of clear communication  I'm worried that our government is actively lying to us in a way that I don't think our government has ever done in a  Time of panic and I'm also worried because I see people trying to be good and be their best selves, right saying  Oh, I think I'm at risk. I  Should get tested and make sure I'm not going to infect people and not being able to to act on those things, right?  So that's where my anxiety is coming from I have discovered it's an opportunity to though for people

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, first of all say a couple things first of all and and this is really common in the in the tech sphere  Geeks fear this this kind of cynical thought. Oh, you know governments are always a bad thing  You said Jerry pornell come on and he's just all government is bad and there is definitely that feeling now  We're you know, there there is a place for government  So I agree with you on that Stacey, but I also noticed that in tough troubled times I think in 9-eleven  in in troubled times  People step up and take care of each other in ways that  You know in during Katarina the FEMA was notoriously failed those people  But but but people stepped up in a way really gave me hope that you know, the people are good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right people not as good as dogs

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dogs are better. That's the thing in the world. If you've got anxiety just hug that puppy hug that good boy  Sorry about that  So I I you know, that's another way to look at it is here's an opportunity for people to step up and show  Our better side or better nature  When when government fails and sometimes it does it did it Katarina, right?  Katrina Katrina and yeah  Why do I call it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rico to Rico would rather that you call it Katrina Puerto Rico as well. Yeah, same thing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  after the big hurricane

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so I just saw this this is just over the  Lamar Alexander just blocked an effort in the Senate to require companies to pay for sick leave  So people are not gonna go people who are sick are still gonna come to work so they can earn the paycheck that they depend  upon and they're gonna spread the disease war as a result  There are this is the kind of short-term thinking we have in the new also blocking CDC funding by about

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep, eight times. I think yep. They're also blocking efforts to keep  pharmaceutical companies from overcharging for  coronavirus tests

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How much does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Coronavirus one guy got charged $3,000 son of a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah Gates Foundation is gonna be issuing  This is an example of the private sector stepping up issuing home testing kits for kovat 19 in Seattle  It shouldn't have to it shouldn't have right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because when private industries steps up they they step up  Yeah, they step up to their interests and it may be that their interests are everyone gets tested but  The role of government is to protect both the least of us and also those  Into practice as a herd right? So there's there's two priorities in  Neither of those are happening right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, anyway, no I I hear you I hear you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So one thing I want to ask you about your piece  The  The  And I don't do this  To defend the tech companies. I'm just curious a government certainly. I agree. Is there any more you think the tech company should be doing now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I think what I've been doing okay, it was it was a week ago. So that's one thing  So things change a lot. So at the time Microsoft is now  Well, they read your piece and they got their act together. So yeah, I don't know but in the point of my piece  Honestly is that?  Government is relevant and it is relevant in two ways one it funds infrastructure. We need to to build and  to create innovation for technology and to it's the entity that usually defines the data that we need and  Mandates its collection in ways that help us address systemic issues, right?  And that then the parallel why it's 2010 is because we had this chance with broadband and now it's coming back to bite us because  We're like, oh we need broadband for telework  But there's lots of people don't have access to broadband and and we kind of screwed that up a little bit in  2008 2010 timeframe anyway  So the point for the tech companies is they are Microsoft has announced that they will pay  People who are at the campuses even if their workers are not so if you're a cook  At Google, I think Google's also said they're gonna do this and a cook at Microsoft  You'll still get paid even if you don't have anyone to cook for  The I know that I've written about in the Microsoft courtesy the shuttles that take you from campus like  Building to building on their campus. Those people will still get paid even though people are no longer on the campus, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's good big companies can do that but little companies can't know right and that's part of the problem  Yeah, if you're a Google employee  You're gonna weather this storm fine and you're gonna be working at home because Google has told everybody work at home

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, then again as I mentioned on all about Android last night  They're telling people to work from home, which is essentially working from the parking lots there on campus with all of those RVs and stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they're at least they're stuck in there  but it's the little companies that can't that it's gonna be very hard to do this and I think  It's nice to say everybody should should give people sick leave but if you're Joe's burger shack  Can't afford it. I'd be able to do that afford you. Yeah, you're going check check, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know the privilege question here is this brings out a lot of privilege. There's a hacker news thread  Which is Google employees complaining that they don't have two bedrooms to have offices at home. Oh, and I get that right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a thing because

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry, what about the what about the person whose office is is a an ubercar or  a UPS truck or a restaurant kitchen, right?  And so we got to keep that in mind in these cases that yes  It's gonna be hard for a month or two to be on  You know your partner and you were gonna get on each other's case in a small apartment in San Francisco  Because you can't afford anything more than a studio  I'm not unsympathetic to that  But let's please keep in mind that that's still gonna be a privilege position is as you just said Leo you'll you'll go  You'll still be working at Google. You'll still be making money. It's okay. Sorry, Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I was actually gonna say as if this shifts to the concept of teleworking and more people working remotely  for a variety of reasons  That's it's an interesting shift. So I know that we're buying we're obviously in the market for a house because we're gonna be homeless soon  And we need two offices one for me one for my husband  Which is ridiculous because we only have one child, but we're looking at these like for better  Yeah, 2,500 to 3,000 square foot houses because I'm like  So so these are  I'm like I looking forward and this is this is one of those interesting. I couldn't get a partner desk with your husband

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Think I'm gonna be a good friend  Yeah, well we'll just look at each other across the way so as I'm doing twig

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hi honey you again, huh  White House has gone to Silicon Valley this morning  Apparently according to the Washington Post to ask them to help combat coronavirus  Misinformation they asked Amazon Google Facebook  IBM Microsoft Cisco Twitter  They met with for two hours with representatives from those companies looking looking for support and help  I would hope that they didn't say  Can you guys just stop talking about it during the session which participants described as a collegial?  Brainstorm the Post writes White House officials urged the tech industry to coordinate its efforts to stop the spread of conspiracy theories  Urging the companies to swap intelligence about harmful hark hoaxes before they go viral  And then that's completely reasonable  So we're all in it together I agree with you Stacy the government has a responsibility and when the government fails to do its  Job it's bad for you know all of us all of its citizens suffer  And I think the bit the worst thing is hiding the numbers  Suppressing the tests that kind of thing because so you can't fight it effectively without that CDC is but I've been tracking this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  over the last so CDC  Takes the weekend off  They don't update their numbers during the weekend, which just that alone just that's  Mind-boggling but that's so then when they came back to work on Monday  I was tracking versus Johns Johns Hopkins has and the links are on down in the numbers again  There's a there's a Johns Hopkins tracker across the world which is excellent right and it is invariably ahead of  The CDC and somebody said well no the CDC only reports confirmed cases. I look back at the fingers  There's no confirmed and presumptive cases. Oh, so they're at 938 right now and Johns Hopkins is at for the US is  at

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Loading it loads slow a lot of people 1135 that's a big difference. It's a huge difference. It's a huge difference

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know there's now a total so the Johns Hopkins tracker  122,399 total confirmed cases  4552 deaths and then there's their tracking the recovered to but clearly that's under reported behind  It's gonna be dust versus total will be

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I don't mind this so much  But we have all of the shows that we've done that have like this talked about coronavirus have been demonetized  YouTube because they don't want anybody making money on  It's not it's not a huge amount of money for us, but it's it's YouTube apparently is  After a lot of creators angrily said what the hell yeah, there's a slowly start monetizing  I think that that was not an unrealistic. It was an easy fix to a problem  Yeah, automatically demonetize it and then figure and then sort it out, you know figure out who because I you know, I understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's touchy on both sides touchy YouTube side and the creator side. Well, we don't it's easy for us to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's fine. We don't rely on YouTube money, but there are a lot of people who do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, and if you want to talk about the biggest story going on and maybe share sympathy and share right tips not disinformation

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  right or just hearing like, you know, people feel a connection to  People as hosts and they like what does Jeff think?  Right. I don't care the markets are down a lot  20% the Dow 19% since its peak on February 19th with S&P 500 so yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although somebody said now I understand what the kids are talking about when they say  So Steve Gibson yesterday talking on security now about Android  and  Really, I think a severe problem which is I think under reported partly because nobody wants to look like an Apple bigot or  Apple fanboy  But there are not only are there many phones that cannot be fixed from there's a number of Android exploits  That are fairly severe that require an updated Android operating system. Many of them are still being sold  There's a Sony Xperia being sold that can't be the effect if you look on Amazon  You'll find a lot of phones that can only run Android 8 and so as a result  I asked Steve I Steve Steve is it time to say  Stop buying Android or if you or maybe say if you own if you buy an Android phone only get it from Google  But even Google will not update the phone after three years and Android is ridden with show-stopping  Exploits severe exploits  You know every hacker I know  Who goes to Def Con or blackhat says whatever you do don't bring an Android phone, right?  Now we know all cell phones including iPhones have exploits thanks to this single SS7 the the radio  Software which is unpatched or never will be probably but those are a little harder to take advantage of  the good news is  There are at least there are Google Android phones that are less expensive and  Ev leaks Evan blasts had a picture. I don't know where he got this of  billboards oh  Shoot got brought me to the wrong part here it is  for advertising the pixel 4a  Which is pretty imminent unless the factory making it is closed  And look this billboard says starting at 399

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the A's aren't they this is not the four this is the a but I think and we're also seeing a hole punch

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're seeing a little bit of what it looks like it looks like it's got three cameras

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  65 yeah, nobody's gonna get them free at I Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, sorry no I oh for you. They'll ship them out  Actually looks like it's a big camera bump, but it's deceptive looks like it only has one lens and then a flash  It only has one lens only one lens  How do you live with your source camera lens on your phone I  Don't you know I love Android I think Google does a very good job with its pixels  I'm happily sitting right here with a pixel 4, but I'm starting to really wonder if we should be recommending  Android devices at this point

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go back again. Oh, we if you buy the Google  Pixel 4 you're okay. You're fine for three years the question remains three years

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's hard to recommend the people buy a  Phone that in three years you're gonna have to say you must get rid of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What Apple doesn't support their OS is for more than three years. Oh, no if you have an iPhone you have the latest

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have to go way back to get the get an iPhone that won't support iOS 13

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought it stopped like it the seven or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At this point do phone batteries last longer than three years good point can you get a replacement battery?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, boy, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Think a lot my portable one is that what you're talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me see how far what the oldest I'm I'm going back

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To get one the six so the iPhone six or the iPhone SE are your oldest ones

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Se okay, so I was thinking seven six so we're at seven eight nine ten eleven or five years after the six

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I'm pretty sure they they only promise a certain level

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, but it's not a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google to stop after two or after there was no

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Four years you're right, so it's only four years  How long does Apple support iOS  Yeah, you're right, that's a good point. I mean you shouldn't use an old phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Should you did it answer it? Yes? Here's the charge say three years. Here's the chart

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  13 goes back goes from 2015 so it's five years to 2020  But you can and if you have thing is you can still buy a brand new iPhone 8 or 10  Well, that's not gonna solve save you much, but you can yeah, you know  I think five years is not unreasonable, but two years is not two years and the real problem is you can still buy brand new  Android phones that are forever  Vulnerable and that's a problem. I think well the other problem is environmental if you make these things

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  disposable  with presumption of

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Disposability so anyway, we don't I don't know when the 4a will come out  That's probably up in the air because I don't know where they're making there is apparently a Cuban store already selling it  So that's a that means that it's probably not too far out Cuban store  To far out yeah the video comes from Cuba

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  For real though  This is exactly what happened with the last year. Yeah within yeah  The the previous two phones and it came from Cuba

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The 3a was Dominican Republic  Wasn't it okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So who we don't know where it's being made there's a video of it  Honestly use do you still use a 3a Jeff or did you get a four? I'm three  I think the 3a is excellent  I think the four would be excellent and at least we have a good Android phone that's 400 bucks that we can recommend to people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, I love the 3a. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The only thing is it gets a little weird sometimes  When I go from airplane mode to normal mode and my bluetooth sometimes gets a little wonky  But that is the only complaint I have yeah, and that's I think that's not uncommon with phones sometimes

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was gonna say I don't think bluetooth is perfect in any phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bluetooth is just not perfect. I'm a miss. Oh, you're right. It's awful

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's awful  Horrific it's terrible  It stinks  Anthony Levandowski you may remember he was a Google and engineer who went to uber and  was then sued  because  Google said you took  trade secrets over to uber he has been ordered to pay a fine of  179 million dollars to Google he immediately declared bankruptcy big dollars  That's a lot of money  He says she's not doing that bad in filing for bankruptcy protection  He says he has 50 to 100 million in personal assets. So like not bad Anthony  But he can't pay 179 million. That's crazy  Goodness Wow  Wow, I don't know which is more stunning the fine or the amount of money he actually has

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it always makes me wonder how does a  Team of lawyers come up with these actual dollar amounts for any of these cases. I mean that's pretty specific

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  179 sometimes it's not a team of layers. Sometimes it's a judge

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was a judge. I wonder how they come up with those numbers. So I would think he'd go through appeal before  Ant there are oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are actuarial tables that talk about like how much certain people certain jobs are worth and then they kind of roll from there

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  TIL and there may be actual losses or Google may be able to say well that you know  It cost us this much to develop it uber is gonna get this kind of benefit from it  Speaking of lawsuits. You don't know if you remember this. I forgot about it. Oh  Tulsi Gabbard sued Google  She's  She accused Google of infringing on her free speech when it briefly suspended her advertising account  last year  She sued for 50 million dollars a judge in the US District Court for Central District of California has dismissed  that case granted Google's motion to dismiss because  He said the campaign had failed to prove the First Amendment clause  That prohibits government from curbing free speech a pride to Google as a private company  You don't have a First Amendment right with private entities. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  President can't read the damned bill of rights figure that out

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't have a First Amendment right with the company  It was the first lawsuit ever by presidential candidate against a major tech company  She argued that Google by regulating political ads on its platform assumed to the traditional role of government in terms of regulating  elections and therefore was  Subject to the First Amendment the judge  Disagree, she's still in the running. She's not gonna be in the debate  Yeah, but she hasn't withdrawn yet  Google is not the government yet. Thank goodness

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right now I would take Google  Dr. Google would do a fine job

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These Swedes have fined Google a whopping 7 million euros  Because  It doesn't even matter why no because  Because Google had failed to comply with the Swedish data protections authorities orders to remove search listings  Google said we disagree with the Swedish decision. We plan to appeal I  Just give them the money. Honestly, how much it's gonna cost  Yeah, but you can't set a precedent right true. It's more about the press point, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The regular I'm just like so I'm well actually lady today. Sorry about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm Stacy. Well actually Higginbotham. She's actually just keeping his well actually  The regulator also found fault with Google's practice of notifying website owners of delisting requests and who requested them. What's wrong with that?  In its delisting request form Google states that the site owner will be notified of the request in a way that might result in  individuals refraining from exercising their right to request delisting  Thereby undermining the effectiveness of this right  Anyway, but this is completely unrelated but it's Spain the Spanish Supreme Court said that Google has a right to do that  It's the second GDPR fine for Google remember France sued the fine them 50 million euros  First yeah  Does someone need to get that no, thank you for asking well actually well actually well  All right, let's let's see what else here  I'm not gonna read that one  Facebook's now 40% female and 30% black. That's good. Hey, that's a run down

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we can we can we can we can I know where it is now we can edit that one

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, it's the one right above it, you know, which one oh wait

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hold on we got to do a little correction possibly was that seven million or seven million seven million dollars or seven minute Croners

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It said it says euros. Oh  Your political see that's a isn't that the universal symbol for a euro. That's what I thought

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but sweet  Sweetens not on the euro. They're not on the euro. They use maybe pull maybe that's the oh, I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe that's what maybe because Ireland is Dateline Brussels

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's very confusing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. Well, no, I just people people were putting it out and here's the I'm just saying that's what the headline read

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what I read you could figure it out. It's not seven million crawlers or whatever the hell

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like bring it every Swede gets a crawler on Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  The Swedes I will say the Swedes do love their sweet products. They they like your donuts. They like their cakes. They can bury jam  Berry jam

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually the Swedes have become very aggressive about encryption in a way some say  Is anti-democratic? Yes  And I always liked Sweden

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love Ikea. Yeah, Ikea

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Meatballs. No, and actually I've been to Stockholm Harry times. I've been a bunch of places in Sweden  That's a beautiful country. It's a great place. They like many other countries now are cracking down  I guess we could talk about the earn it act in the that's coming up in the  Thanks to our fine senator from California

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  First you want to talk about the Swedish act. This is this is actually pretty dang serious

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know what I don't know what you're talking about. The only reason  Well, you'll find out the only reason I'm waiting please

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the only reason I  I'm a little concerned about this is the source. I  Never heard of the source this for this story and I haven't seen it anywhere else  So next reviews, yeah Linux reviews, yeah, I don't know that I so I don't know  I have I have seen  Other articles on this. Let me see  Sweden has ended democracy. See that's that's a little sensational is it here we go with the passing of a new  secret electronic surveillance law the thing that's scary about this law it doesn't require law enforcement to have a warrant to  Install hardware surveillance hardware and software and electronic devices and according to the article and again  I really want to see another source before I get too hot head up about this  It would allow the Swedish authorities to install surveillance devices on a place that the culprit the alleged  Perpetrator might even be visiting. So if you think well, yeah, I think he's gonna go to Burger King tonight  You could put a camera up in there  again, and without a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Warrant, so I want to see another confirming the local which I just put up which is it which is a good publication in English in Sweden  Okay, five things to know about the law  Okay. All right  so  the police  National police chief says that in order to reach the most serious criminals  You need to be able to keep an eye on their communication  Otherwise, you will always be blind or half blind as criminals turn to a cryptic messages  We need to be able to follow them same argument every law enforcement  Everybody official the other law makes it possible to access devices to view encrypted communications directly at the source  Instead of tapping the messages while they're being sent

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The other thing that made me nervous is that the law comes into effect on April 1st. So I really want I'm glad you found a second source  It is  Really is a terrifying they can stall they could basically install malware on not only the suspects devices without a warrant  But anywhere the suspect might be going

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's terrifying I hope what does this law mean for Sweden's image as a mecca for Internet freedom and online privacy asks the reporter of him  or herself  The reporter him or herself answers this law cannot be considered as mass surveillance since it will be used in a targeted manner  Only when someone is suspected of a serious crime  Believe police have estimated they will need to use the law about 50 to 100 times though  I would imagine once you have a back door in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  well, and remember I  Think this critical thing is you you think they're gonna be somewhere you can install surveillance devices there  Mm-hmm that surveils everybody who's there everybody else? Yeah  So then the police are they gonna ignore everything?  They they see and learn there because they only want to get this one guy. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So wait, this is this is once you have a warrant to monitor a person stuff, it's no warrant warrantless  Okay, so did you guys see there are two stories in parallel one is from protocol it's from six days ago  It's on a company called  Babylon it's locate X. Let's see protocol  I'll get this  Surveillance firm banjo is the title. Did you find it?  Surveillance firm banjo used a secret company secret company and fake apps. Oh, no, that's not the one. Sorry my bad. That's vice  I'll find it maybe I had the link up earlier and now I can't find it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was it was basically a bunch of articles about bluegrass, so you're gonna have to yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's locate X and it's  There's a company name associated with it, ah, I found it protocol calm

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So through apps not warrants locate X allows federal law enforcement to track phones  Federal agencies have big contracts with Virginia based Babel Street. That's the babble  Depending on where you've traveled your movements may be already be in the company's data

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so this is without a warrant it's basically  Using a third party to gather information about where some a particular phone  So a particular phone has been based on the apps they have so like maybe it's it  I'm just using four squares an example, but it could be anything that grabs your location  they pull that data in and law enforcement can  Get access to the service from them that says when they when they offer a phone a unique ID for a phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They can just run it against this service is very closely related to what clear clear viewer  Good. No. No what Google has been doing  remember we talked about a number of cases where law enforcement would go to Google say give me the  Influence identities of everybody who's in this area during these robberies. In fact, they used it to track somebody down  He would he was in every single area. Mm-hmm  This is exactly what LocateX does Google's always fought those warrants  But as but as handing them over in time a former government official familiar with Localex provided an example of how it could be used  Referring to the aftermath of a car bombing or kidnapping investigators could draw what is known as a geo fence around the site  identify mobile devices  So not just an individual but in general that were in the  Vicinity in the days before the attack see where else those devices had traveled leading up to the attack or where they traveled afterward  So it's everybody. Yeah, and it's that you know, if you see a device that a month ago was in Saudi Arabia  You know, maybe Saudis were involved or maybe not  It's a lead generator you get a data point from there  You can use your other resources to figure out if it's valid. There was a recent story about this from a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bicyclist I think they were in Florida. Yeah, I remember that and  Yeah, that was within the last week or so. I believe he was in Florida an older lady. There it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We got it on the screen Google tracked his bike ride past a burglarized home that made him a suspect

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not fair but I get it. That's what the tech provided as a data point. Yeah, it's not fair though

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not very much different than having say a camera outside her home and then try to track down all the people that you saw  I just don't think Google should be involved in this and this what this underscores  Or does Google think they want to be right right this underscores the problem with these with our phones  It sounds like locate X was aggregating data from a variety of other of apps. Is that right as Stacy?  Yes, so you may have apps that feed your location to locate X already on your phone. Mm-hmm probably do I would bet

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but  Isn't Google?  Right now trying to go through and do an audit on apps that are right and Android just like iOS now does

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Prompt you if an app has is gathering your location behind the scenes all the time  And and by the way, that's worked really well at least on the Apple side  People who gather location information report that ever since Apple started saying do you want to allow this all the time or only?  When the apps running in fact the Apple pop-up doesn't even give you all the time  Says disallow or only when the apps running if you want to turn it on all the time as you might with say Google Maps  You'd have to go in the set dig down into the side and turn it on and that has reduced  Dramatically the amount of location information apps on iOS get it's a good thing. That's a good thing. It is I  have to say I  Love my Android devices and I love the configurability, but I have to say increasingly I'm thinking  If you really I mean if Apple at least steps up and tries to protect you it's not perfect

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google tried to protect this gentleman to that we just talked about  Said hey look these the law enforcement are trying to get this information  So here's our note to you. You have to get over there to the courts within X amount of days to fight this out  They didn't just fly out say this is you, you know, but they said it's up to you to fight it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They did say it's so the two remedies here Google either decides to dump that information  After a very short period of time which they could do it could yeah and or two  We write our laws to be a little bit more protective in this case of people who might be caught up in these sorts of drag

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nets. Those are your two. That's the key. That's the key and and  you know, it's like it's like the  The  Lie detectors  Right, so you can you can do that. You can test the galvanic skin response. You can get the data  What does it mean and how do you use it?  Matters  You can tap phones, but we put laws in place and said you can't do that without a warrant  We did not do that in the case of your mail  Electronic mail and that's the issue. So we've got it. We do not have a  high-level principle of privacy  Under which these things can then flow instead. We're doing a technology by technology  Episode by episode nuts what's wrong here the thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really bothers me about locate X is  That you know, if you go to Google you got to get a warrant you got a subpoena them they're gonna fight you  It's a higher standard. They're now even charging still don't like geofence warrants, but at least there's a higher standard  So the police what are the police to say?  Or we could just go to locate X and buy the information right and that's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's where it is sounds similar to that clear view AI. You're right. That's where it's similar. Yes. You're exactly right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  now one could argue though that in in in in a  Case the legal case if it becomes clear that this is how a company is getting their data  Then what you would see is prosecutor sorry going after locate X  Yeah defenders going after in trying to defend someone and going after it that way and you could invalidate  police use of this in

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One or two sweeping court cases. That's a good point if it just makes you if it's a good defense to say your honor  They bought this information from this sketchy company, right? They violated unreasonable searches features of the poisoned tree your honor  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't fight they just got data that's available otherwise, so they didn't use their power, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's for a judge to decide that's I mean unreasonable search and seizure  Alright so then I would go with fruit of the poison tree. I'm not a leader  I'm not a lawyer like saying fruit of the poison tree  Someone is going to have to come and fight that and a lot of people are just gonna acquiesce and get caught up in it  Most likely those who are poor and I mean this guy happened to talk to his parents and his parents were like we'll spend

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A couple thousand dollars for a lawyer. Otherwise, isn't that sad? They actually went out and hired a lawyer

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a lot of money. Yeah, and this is where like if Google's like screw it. We want to keep this information  I would like to see Google and all these other companies start looking at these laws and saying hey  We should probably make a lobbying effort to protect our customers because eventually our customers are gonna be like screw these phones  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Excellent point get on it. Well, I'd say see I would be on it  The platforms need to stand up and protect the Internet more  When it comes to section 230 Ron Wyden the senator who was a co-author of it is enraged to the platform is because they didn't send  Anybody high up to fight FOSTA sesta  Because who wants to stand up in favor of child porn was their PR view  But what they didn't do was stand up for the First Amendment of the of the Internet. They didn't stand up for free speech  so yes  With great power comes great responsibility. And if they are the proprietors of the Internet for now  They should be better protectors of it and I too get angry at them. Yes, by the way that works so well for

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  FOSTA sesta that now the government's working on the earn it act  I'll bring it back to earn it  this is a  By the way bipartisan bill  Sponsored by Matthew Green's article is very good. He's a cryptographer at Johns Hopkins and not a you know, a crazy flaming political  Guy this guy is very

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Differential privacy. Oh, yeah, he's like him a lot. He's he's one of the best

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Lindsey Graham and Dick Blumenthal boy if you wouldn't expect them in this sitting in a tree  co-sponsors  This bill is a weird bill it attacks some of the things we hold  Very important on the Internet in very interesting ways earn. It means companies will have to earn their section 230 protection  By doing everything they can  to capture  Child predators always a always a good thing as if as if the the platforms aren't this is such PR

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They as if the platforms are not in fact today doing everything they can

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They are not Jeff  Horrifying story in the New York Times about how they don't respond in time to police  Efforts to get data from them because they don't have enough people  You didn't see this go read that story because it is horrifying  In it. I'm not it doesn't argue for encryption or any, you know, it's not making those kind of arguments  but it's basically saying that these tech platforms are in a lot of ways complicit because  When investigators try to get data they have to wait weeks to get the legal  To get proof basically back from these companies and people are going free people  They can't catch them in time and maybe they're just maybe law enforcement is scapegoating, but it sounded pretty it's a very good

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thing to invoke think of the children  As a guy said again, it worked really well with FOSTA and sesta  Earn it works. This is Matthew green writing by revoking section 230 protections that you know  That's a sacred cow for us on the internet  It makes it possible for providers to operate on the internet by preventing the provider from being held responsible  For what their customers do on a platform like Facebook  Just like the phone company is not responsible the conversations you have on the phone  section 230  protected Facebook Twitter  More importantly at least from my point of view blog comment sections from the stuff posted there  the new bill  Green goes on to say would make it financially impossible  For providers like whatsapp and Apple to operate services unless they conduct and this is in quotes best practices  for scanning their their systems for child porn  but  Green says there are no best practices in existence and the techniques for doing this  And still at the same time preserving privacy are completely unknown  There's the rub the bill creates a government appointed committee that will tell technology providers what technology they have to use  The specific nature of the committee is Byzantine and described within the bill itself  Needless to say the makeup of the committee which can include as few as zero data security experts  Ensures that end-to-end encryption will almost certainly not be considered a best practice  You can't you can't scan those messages for for illegal activities. Well, you can't have that encryption  so  Green whose cryptographer thinks this is a backdoor way to allow the government to ban encryption on commercial services  Even more beautifully. It doesn't come out and actually ban the use of encryption. It just makes it commercially infeasible. It's like a little coal  And

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah clever isn't it  Yep, and small companies this could kill them  And so if you if you if you hate the platforms only in the world and you want some new entrants this kind of regulation

Transcript:  Want to quote most seri, but it is an interesting it is interesting  story Instagram head Adam Moceri on  How Facebook protects Instagram from scrutiny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says which is him also a little bit throwing them  Under the self-driving car just gonna say well they screw up we learn from it and we look better

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He said this on an interview on an NBC News buyers market podcast  for lack of a more elegant phrase Facebook as a company serves as a  poop umbrella for Instagram nicely done  Delicately so the idea is what oh, oh because nobody criticizes Instagram. They all criticize Facebook, right and  And so as a result Instagram kind of skates along

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, well, I think he's also saying that  When Facebook screws up they see they learn from those we learn to yes, we learn which Adam is really smart

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But let's remember he was in charge of newsfeed at Facebook. They were getting  criticized  So by the way his word of advice to Instagramers don't double insta

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  referring to posting twice to your Instagram feed in one day  only  Everybody double instas most triple double insta  Most triple insta you only post once you have a rule once a day. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't I don't install that often we instead see yes, and then we forget our account

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait a minute so who's saying this don't double insta head of Instagram Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He says I think it's okay, but young people don't think it's okay. It looks like you're trying too hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, so that's why I say that yeah  Yeah, other than that didn't do it if you're trying to you could try to push it up  Then yeah, you should the more you post you get pushed up. Yeah  I'm not trying to appease any young people. They don't give a crap what I post anyway exactly screw the youngs

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We don't need them

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This this whole  poop umbrella discussion  You won't bring that up. Well, I'm it was making me think is that  Similar to basically having like a shell game you have a larger company at the top as a umbrella if you will and under sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know you can nurture Instagram let it grow and then when it gets big enough it can be a poop umbrella  All right, it's sort of branches out but in the interim

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's more of a it's poop umbrellas all the way down kids. You hide some stuff there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're acting all pure tentacle about it, then you just can't stop saying it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we talked a couple of weeks ago about Amazon's  Grocery store. Mm-hmm.

Transcript:  I haven't used the big one. I've used the smaller Amazon go so it turns out now

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've learned that Amazon has made this technology so that they can sell it to other people

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mm-hmm. That's how Amazon does Amazon everything that Amazon builds is designed to be sold to other people  Even if it never gets there, they design everything as a service first. It has a terrible name. Just walk out technology

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just walk out just literal sounds you wouldn't want to name a movie that  You wouldn't want to name a movie that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I said that it was the Bob Ross of twit. He took it a little too much to heart  He worked on that persona  So they're gonna sell just walk out to an airport  Others but this is the first airport hospitality group OTG  Which operates York Airport has those you have these little corner stores the Seabow Express gourmet market  Yeah, so in fact, it's gonna open next week at Liberty Terminal C  If you want to try it out Jeff go steal a banana  It will then be followed by a bish additional stores both in Newark Liberty and LaGuardia

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think Newark has gotten this is this actually so Newark has gotten rid of  All kinds of staff  Yeah, so now every restaurant is a fake brand. They're all run under one thing, right?  They're all like my crystal these choices, but you've never heard of any more for is they don't exist. Of course  Yeah, oh yeah, that's what it is and there's one I've had in front of you well I was one kitchen was fewer kitchens  Shared  There's an iPad in front of you and you order from the iPad. That's the only way you can order that it's disgusting

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I hate touching like that either. That's too many hands

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then they come to you with with the stuff wherever you are and then in the stores  They also don't have a checkout you have to do the scanner thing. Yep, and so they've they've they've gotten the entire  Airport they have one Starbucks operating like an old Starbucks. They have one Wendy's leftover  Otherwise, it's all of this iPad stores big food stuff and fake store thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I guess this company is the one that OTG is the one that runs this stuff  But I on the other hand I think that that is a really good use of  Grab and go technology because you're running you're getting a plane you want to just get a couple of peanuts or whatever  But you got to have the  Out

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't have to have them stop stop. You don't have to have that you have to have a credit card

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they're gonna start using I think it's blue. She's le they're gonna start using a technology that will

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just scan it. Yeah, cuz they don't want people so they have they're they're using it's gonna be card based technology  And I'm not sure how that will work with like airports  But they they recognize that people do not want to have a bunch of different apps for each retailer  Right, so they've tried to tie it to a physical media  Which again don't know the details  Jeff you do really need to go steal a banana and see how it's gonna work

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've gone in no, I've gone on the one in New York and I bought stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I had that that uses the app right? No, but now you have to go into the oh you're telling me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Still have an event that I'm speaking at at the end of April. We'll see if that stays

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeff's like no, you're not with this with this using credit cards. They're not specifically talking NFC, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I don't know if it's credit cards or loyalty cards with like an NFC chip built in that is not  specified in anything that I've seen

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is NFC based though, okay, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And so now if it is NFC  I just wonder about speed and performance of that because I mean just using the tap and go stuff  Right now and your regular grocery store. It's it's still a little bit of a hang up in a delay  You know what is it for me it is just a bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, what if what if when you but the way this will change is you do it when you go in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay. All right before you grab yourself  Tap before you walk. I got you that makes no sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That makes more sense. Well, it figures it out later and sends you a bill  You're not waiting for it to happen  It just because that's the story that we had on on the show  Like when you try to fool it it took four hours to get the build to it was somebody had to watch it  All right, Sam story. I'm waiting for that story of the person in the Philippines who's watching people shop for things

Transcript:  I mean that's behind every automated system. There is a person  What percentage of transactions or videos or whatever?  Automated system, you know, you're part of is an open question is a 1% is a 20%  But there's always going to be a person checking to make sure that computer did what they need to do QA. Thank goodness

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow, that was a sound I've never heard come out of you Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have an amazing repertoire of sounds  Blue jeans so zoom is my absolute favorite because it's one click from your phone  And it's got a good mobile and a good web-based interface and it can do breakout groups. I'm told  Why do you hate blue jeans has Dolby voice? I don't care. It's not as easy to join from a mobile  Okay, and that's the reason blue jeans

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're raising everybody use blue jeans is because I've had that meetings with Facebook people and they're not allowed to use

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hangouts because it's Google. Oh, they can't use hangouts. Of course  we use zoom because it's part of we gave it free from our  phone ring central as a  It's a white label zoom and then I think we also use we have a zoom account through artisanal our ad agency  So we use them, but I don't know. I mean we use we're using Skype now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We use Skype a lot for broadcase. Yeah, but Skype for business is not awesome  And can I just say Microsoft teams just no one should send people?  Who like are outside of your organization teams invites because Microsoft makes you sign in to use it  No, you can't just be a guest and I'm like good. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, that's true. I don't like any of those services if they make you become a member. That's no good. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a non-starter. No, I like zoom better, but it did try to make me  Something oh you have to install you have to install

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Blue jeans, I think all of these make you install an app because they can't just do it magically  Blue jeans  Yeah, we have RTC would but most of these don't use web RTC. I think hangouts might

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hangouts will run in a browser. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who is it zip diddle it diddle you IPD TL we've used that  There's jitsi, you know use that in a while  There's a lot of you know, we've got to try some of these other services we just we're kind of  Fuddy duds. I'm a funny daddy. We've Skype works. We've used you are  2005 I'm just gonna work using it works  We get pretty good results from it, right? Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, Skype Skype is really still the best for any audio recording or podcast like zoom  I'll let you record but it won't let you export split tracks for example. So you're like I hate you there is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sam Abul, Samad  Who does the wheel bearings podcast uses a technology that automatically it does a double-ender  Which is cool, what does that mean you get a little one recording get local recordings with each of the hosts  You're all in a conference call, right? But then they locally record it that way  Oh, yeah full quality. What's what who does that again?  Sam uses it for wheel bearings. Let me see. He told me on over the weekend

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Radio interviews all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have one of those and I but the downside was you can't close that browser window until it's done processing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, it's something cast cast. I think it's just called cast zip cast

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  was a zip cast

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's see. I can't remember. No  Nope  that's a  Anybody in the chat remember what Sam said? Anyway, it looked pretty good  He says it works really well, of course  The reason we use Skype is because we don't want to do double-enders and the codec and Skype gives us good sound  And so I'm very happy with kind of the generically good sound that we get when we don't tend to get that with other conferencing  Things but if you could do a double-ender  The reason we don't do that is that's there adds additional time between the time the show's over and the time we can post it  We'd like to do it as quickly as possible, but it seems like a good thing. It does individual tracks for every host  It's a simple web login so you click a link and you're in it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there's a lot I have used this on multiple occasions. It's driving me nuts

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can't think I thought it was just called cast but that's I guess that's not it  Because someone else had to me as a guest on one of their shows and that's what they used

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Zen cast

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you, yeah, that's not ideal and I tried it for a couple shows it's it was a little  It broke

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's yes, yes. Yeah, that's it Zen castor. That's a high fidelity podcasting. So you didn't like this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, because it doesn't always work  The other thing is if you have certain settings on your browser your users are gonna get an error and they're gonna be like  Oh, you need to turn off this you know, so  When it works, it's nice  and for actually this show it could be good because we could all like  For your regular hosts  We would all put the effort in to make sure everything is set up correctly. I'll screw that up

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll tell you what we'll put this in our back pocket if we start having trouble with Skype  We will but we just it works so well at this point. Mm-hmm. Does it work on a Chromebook?  Zen castor it says it works in the way browser base. Sure. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have to check it well now that now that Skype actually does work on my Chromebook is okay  but I suffered all those years of using hip diddle and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We use something else too for a while Google lens remember they were talking about this at Google I Oh last year  apparently now it is  It is in lens when you're dining out you point your camera at a physical menu and you will get this dish  Recommendations and reviews and even pictures of the text based entries in Google Maps. I  Did it that's cool. I dig it. Yeah, that's very cool  Pointed at the menu and then it'll show you what they look like

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It'll even give you reviews because it's always begging the local guys to take pictures of their food and describe what it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is finally using the poop umbrella for good not even tation baby  So this is X there's a little button and lenses says explore dishes  If you point it at a menu, you'll get a pop-up that tells you  Stuff about the menu and then also shows pictures and gives you reviews. I think that's clever

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you downside is most people when they take pictures of their food. It's not very attractive. So you're gonna get a lot of like

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ugly food. Yeah, you can ugly food

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They also make like industrial H-vec stuff. They make lots of what's wild is that they're making quantum computers. I didn't even  Blows my mind like you could go out and buy what should we get one? Yes. Why not? It probably help us do Skype better  Google is giving away get it now three months of stadia if you have a chromecast  You don't have to buy anything else you're gonna get three months of stadia honest on any  on any supported  It's actually I guess they're sending it out in their chromecast marketing email  So look for your email and you can get a  Propass code and redeem it normally it's ten dollars a month and in the past you've had to buy a lot of other stuff  So look for promotional emails from Google it's a ploy to get you to read their spam, please  Please read our spam  We're giving away three months of stadia  This  Okay, another one for you, Stacey  You know what your card is Google's wearables, right? We've seen a jacquard jacket. I didn't know this  They're also making a new jacquard based  shoe in soul  Mmm, and this is meant to be worn in soccer shoes so they can analyze your kick

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

No, it's for gaming and what's great is this is only 40 bucks in jacquard  The technology is just sensor infused fabric with a little  Computing unit that that takes the data from those sensors and sends it computes it and sends it to your phone  But we had seen in the Levi's jacket the trucker jacket was actually kind of expensive  Yeah, and the you send out you send Lauren backpack was super expensive  So this is only 40 bucks for an insole which is a great price that people might buy I don't know  But I'm really excited about this. I think this is a really awesome use of technology and at that price you could see something  You know the basics are there to stick an insole into someone's shoe if you're like elderly or something like that  You could do like gait and fall measurements that might be  Interesting from health and wellness. There's there's some really cool stuff here

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what's the real reason?  What data are they getting they're getting gait analysis aren't they they want to be well I assume yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're they're getting an understanding of how someone's  They had to build the algorithms to see like when I when I press this way on a on the insole I am  Running when I press this way. I'm okay, so they're getting that kind of data  That'll come in handy for things that are not gameplay, but it's good to start there I guess  Then I see about games is when you make  When you're running and kicking those are very exaggerated big movements as opposed to like walking around all day, so maybe that helps you  Train your models better because the data so exaggerated in the first place. I don't know

Okay  and I tested it right I  was a shared hotspot in  The news that I was alluded to was that now it supports Laura  Radio, so now you can have any Laura device will talk to your helium hotspot, which is pretty cool  But the other thing I'm running because I'm doing this experiment with things that generate  Money for network services is basically the experiment. I downloaded something called nodal cache onto my phone and  nodal cache is  an app  nodle and  it  Basically makes my bluetooth accessible to other devices that need bluetooth access  So it uses my phone's bluetooth as a way to say like where something is so lime bikes are using nodal  If you've got a lime bike near you it's gonna be like boom boom it's gonna use my phone to say hey  I've been to ping it and be like I'm here. It's kind of like tile, but this gives me a token  So now I have earned a whopping  0.0014209 nodal cache so far. I was doing much better when I was in Seattle

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm gonna say you don't live near enough people to make this useful to you  Well, no, but I travel a lot. Yeah, cuz it's a mesh. It's a mesh hotspot the helium  Well, so it really makes sense if there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But helium has its own cryptocurrency. It does it has helium something that we're gonna have so many cryptocurrencies  Okay, so yeah you what you turn on the nodal and you're earning nodal cash. I'm earning nodal. I'm earning noodles

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because my phone is it's it's basically like if tile paid you  It noodles. Why do they pay you?  They want to incent me to use it. They want to incent me to become part of their public Bluetooth network  That's why they're paying anyone. It's like phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
