Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Leonard Towell professor for journalistic innovation at the...  Crank, crank, crank, new mind.  Graduate school of journalism at the City University of New York.  Director of the Townite Center, etc. etc. etc.  Hello!  Hello.  Did you eat that entire bag of Cacio e Pepe?  No, no I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The last time I had it was last week.  But I had some Cacio e Pepe puffs before the show.  I just want to make noise.  I had to show Stacy our find.  I am jealous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cheesy salty snacks.  They're the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're all the best.  Actually, Sunday we were talking on Twitter about using chopsticks to eat spicy hot Cheetos  so they don't get your fingers all orange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what people do for any sort of Doritos.  A lot of my engineering programming friends do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You want to have the snack while you're coding  but you really don't want to get orange on the keyboard.  It's bad.  Trust me, I know.  Also with us from Hands On Photography, Ant Pruitt.  Also the community manager of our fabulous club twit.  You have a bunch of events coming up.  Georgia Dow will be joining us for a...  What do you call it?  A fireside chat.  Andy Anacko was mind-bogglingly fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  His was an AMA and that was so much fun.  So there's a difference.  Yes, sir.  There is a difference.  The AMAs, I set it up to be geared more towards our club twit members to participate and get  their feedback and the fireside chats is more along.  I'm digging in and sitting down.  I'll take some questions from my members but it's more me trying to drive it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  January 28th, Georgia Dow at 3pm Pacific.  4pm Pacific, February 11th, Mike Elgin and Amira.  I'll be hosting that one.  Then the poll is up for the next book in Stacey's Book Club.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which was another great time.  I am so glad we're doing that.  We sat down before our AMA, Mrs. Stacey and I.  The book wasn't horrible, as I said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You didn't like it that much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You didn't like it that much?  No, I liked it.  Not horrible, that was the quote.  Sci-fi is just a different thing for me.  You have to be into sci-fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It had great issues to talk about though.  It did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even Mr. Jammer B joined in on the conversation.  He would cut our mics off and just take over the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, as you know, Jammer B is a big sci-fi fan, as am I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Something that was worth mentioning is we included our members in that.  We do it over Zoom.  Our members can join in on Zoom and pop up on the screen and talk with us.  All of that.  Hey, sign up for Club Sweat.  It's only $7 a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a good thing.  It's a good cause.  I'll give you all the deets a little later on the show.  The big story...  The poll?  Find the poll.  For the book?  Yeah, I had it a minute ago.  It should be pinned.  It should be pinned to what?  I can't find it either.  If you don't pin it to my sweater, I'm not going to find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Club Tweet events and then you twirl down Club Tweet events and you should see Stacy Higginbotham's book club.  Right?  And then you go to the Pins section.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel like it should be.  Maybe we've got to work on this.  I have events here. That's what I clicked.  But that does not include the poll.  Nope, not that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Keep scrolling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Keep scrolling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's Stacy and the Bestos.  Keep going.  Keep going because this is the show section.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's under this, Tweet Events?  No, sir. I don't even know where that came from.  It should be down under the general section.  You see the general section?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't think I'm...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me know when you find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I see general on my screen.  That's discourse stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't have a general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The excitement never ends here at the Tweet Farm.  Okay, this is still a work in progress, clearly.  But, you know, if I go to the terminal, I could probably get this working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, gosh. Please no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Please no.  Oh, dear.  The books are Noor by...  I'm not sure how to pronounce that author's name.  N-O-R.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cory Doctorow, Unauthorized Bread.  And Kai Fouly's AI 2041.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And right now Unauthorized Bread is leading the vote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, because Cory has been on the show many times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The author's name for Noor is Nidhi Okorafor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okorafor, I believe that's what she said last time.  Nidhi Okorafor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good.  Good, good, good.  Well, thank you very much for joining us.  That's it for this week in Google This Week.  That was exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This week in futzing around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you missed the fun part, Leo, telling stories before we got on.  Old guy Leo on the porch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is what I did.  I just tagged you in that channel so maybe it'll pop up as a notification for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are we still doing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, we're done. I'm done.  We got a show to do, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  Big story of the week.  And I don't really know if we have to talk about it on this show.  I guess it impacts Google a little bit.  We certainly talked about it on Windows Weekly.  Microsoft has put in a bid to buy Activision Blizzard.  I have to say, I loved the New York Times story on this.  Because they said for around $70 million.  $70 billion.  Big difference.  The irony is that it's actually $68.3 billion.  So somewhere in the authors' mind or the headline writers' mind,  they figured $1.7 billion more or less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is that? A bridge? A roadway? Who knows?  Just a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just a little bit.  Big story because it is the largest acquisition Microsoft's ever made.  It's $68.7 billion.  So they left out $1.3 billion.  It also is a story because this is the same Activision Blizzard  that was under so much heat for its frat boy culture,  for the Bill Cosby conference room,  and its CEO Bobby Kotick, who had been with the company since 1991,  kind of the poster child for all this.  They're being sued by the federal government.  A lot of employees very upset about how the company has been run, especially women.  So Microsoft is buying into this kind of toxic workplace.  And Microsoft has just recently had issues of their own.  In fact, they announced this week that they're hiring a white shoe law firm  to further investigate allegations of mishandling sexual harassment,  including from its former chairman and CEO Bill Gates.  So this is great.  The merging of two boys clubs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't get to catch Windows Weekly to hear Mr. Thuride and Ms. Mary Jo talk about it,  but when I saw this news, the first thing that popped in my head is,  why is Microsoft investing in such a mess?  Would Microsoft be liable for some of the lawsuits coming along?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a good time to invest in a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Their stock price is almost half what it was a year ago.  Although Microsoft is offering a premium.  But I think we concluded that it's a very good deal.  It's the right thing for Microsoft to do.  As expensive as it is, it's good for business.  Go ahead, Stacey. I heard an and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I was going to say it helps them set up.  If you think about Netflix or Google doing any sort of streaming games platform,  this sets them up for that.  Plus, is it Xbox?  Yes, Xbox.  Yeah, sorry.  I'm like, wait a second.  The one I can't buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My credit is not good enough, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry, dude.  Yeah, so this gets them also.  I mean, Microsoft, I know we don't think about it for gaming,  but they have a very reputable gaming platform.  Oh, they're huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They just bought Bethesda not so long ago.  They have, let's not forget, Minecraft, which has been a huge success for them.  And in fact, it's shown that they can be a steward of a game studio  and really let it do its job and make it better.  I think everybody agrees.  Minecraft is even better under Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think Minecraft is more of a games play for them  or more of an education slash world building kind of play for them?  I'll tell you what my thoughts are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think I remember I've been chewing over this for the last two hours  with Mary Jo and Paul, so I have...  You have opinions.  I have opinions.  You cheat.  I cheated.  I looked ahead on the test.  It's actually sensible.  Remember, Microsoft's under assault from meta, right?  They'd like to play in the metaverse.  Microsoft is a big games player.  Nobody denies that.  And they will become even bigger.  By the way, among other things they get with Activision Blizzard, candy crush.  So they get King.  So there's a lot of mobile.  So it gives them a foothold in a form of gaming they're not particularly big in,  which is mobile.  Call of Duty is also available on mobile.  It gives them...  I think it positions them well for what I think might be the next big thing,  which is e-sports.  You know, football and baseball in this country are multibillion dollar.  And in the NBA, multibillion dollar businesses.  I think e-sport is poised.  All we need is that game, that one game that everybody goes,  oh, this is incredible.  And it's going to explode.  So I think Microsoft's well aware of that.  They're also, of course, a cloud company with Azure.  Hmm.  UPS guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's my family.  Sorry.  No, it is UPS.  Okay, go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, here's how you tell.  Are they wearing brown shorts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've got a lot of UPS.  Brown shorts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know based on the dogs.  I think it's not my family because the dog would be less upset.  Okay, go on.  Keep talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they're also a cloud company with Azure.  And I think that this really what this is, and you pointed this out.  I mean, Google with Stadia, Amazon, NVIDIA, used to be Sony, all streaming game.  I think streaming games, a lot of people think might be the next big thing  because you don't need a lot of hardware.  It's a really good use of cloud resources.  So all in all, this I think integrates beautifully with what Microsoft's business is.  So as expensive as it is, it's half of Microsoft's cash position.  It's a month of revenue for Microsoft.  It's a significant amount of money, but they can afford it.  And I think in the long run, I think it's a good business proposition for them.  That would be my, I'm not a business person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Corey Doctorow came on Twitter and tamed a whole bunch of us saying,  don't say that they're buying it.  They're trying to buy it.  They don't have permission to buy it.  They could get turned down by the government.  Blah, blah, blah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I asked that question of Paul and Mary Jo.  Microsoft addressed it in the announcement.  Even with this acquisition, Microsoft is the number three games manufacturer.  They're not in a position of monopoly at all.  Tencent is bigger.  Sony is bigger.  So this would not make them a behemoth by any means.  Now I think Corey's right.  Under Lena Kahn, the FTC is, you know, I think there's this kind of regret that they didn't stop Facebook from buying Instagram and WhatsApp.  So I think they're looking at all acquisitions now with a little bit of a more evil eye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what?  Yesterday, are we going to talk about that?  That's like the biggest story in tech this week, which is yesterday's FTC Department of DOJ announcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we can talk about that because I mean, unless anybody has anything else they want to say about the Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The only thing I want to say about Microsoft is where I was headed there was that it's so funny that they're now not the evil empire anymore.  They're the nice tech company.  Well, that's the other thing.  Have you met Sacha?  No, but it is an opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's so nice.  It is.  I think it's time for Microsoft because while the eye of Sauron is looking at Google and Apple, you know, for the App Store, they're looking at Amazon.  Facebook for anything.  Congress did not ask Sacha Nadella to come testify.  He was the one guy out.  Who me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's the nice guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's the nice guy.  So I think maybe, and this does totally fit with Microsoft.  The other thing, he is a brilliant CEO.  He has pivoted Microsoft from being the Windows and Office company to being the cloud company.  And gaming is a big part of that for him.  So I think this is an opportune moment.  Corey's right.  I mean, it's got to get regulation.  Sure.  But I think there's a good case to be made that this will not be stopped.  Who else would have bought it?  Sorry.  They apparently were talking to Google.  They were apparently because Google, the price was pretty high.  Who were the rumors that they were talking to?  Although Bobby Kotick, the, can I say embattled?  Is that the word?  The embattled CEO and founder said that Microsoft was such a natural fit.  They started conversations a couple of months ago.  It just was obvious this is where we should go.  Of course, that's who got him.  So that's what he's going to say.  But apparently they went to other companies and nobody wanted to bite that big a bullet.  That's a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With the Google perspective on here, you were mentioning why Microsoft is so successful in this.  Is it because they have the Azure backbone?  Because Google has just as much money and resources to be able to pull this stuff off from a cloud perspective.  But it didn't work.  Right. Why didn't it work?  Why didn't Stadia take off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the worst run company in big tech right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's because Google makes deliciously beautiful tech and has no idea how to explain it to anybody who's actually going to use the tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they have some good stuff. I'll grant you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Any cool stuff they may have done related to Stadia, trying to communicate that to developers.  And also because Google has a reputation for saying, this isn't working for me.  I'm pulling the plug.  And no developer, I mean, building a good quality video game takes time.  Yeah, time and effort and money.  And you're not going to invest all that and have Google say, you know what? Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Remember, Google bought a bunch of, you know, they were going to do their independent studio.  They brought in big people and they folded it like three months later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then they turned around and sent them out the door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah. Like you would never build for that if you were a gaming company, unless you're like building Candy Crush or Wordle.  What are those called? Not parodies? Copycats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, clones. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Clones. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. It's funny because Sony, which is Microsoft's big competition in the console markets, stock went down $20 billion when this was announced.  Because there's a fear that Microsoft will take all these games exclusive and Sony will lose some of its biggest franchises like Call of Duty.  Microsoft said right now they're not going to do that.  Of course, that's really intended for the most important audience at this point, the Federal Trade Commission.  So let's get to story number two, which Stacey says is the biggest story in tech.  The FTC and the Department of Justice seek to rewrite merger guidelines.  They kicked off a process on Tuesday to rewrite these guidelines.  A request for comment, particularly about digital markets.  So go ahead, Stacey. Why is this the story of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I just realized it wasn't on our list, which.  Okay, this is the story of the week because.  Well, it just happened yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It just happened yesterday. That's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It did just happen yesterday and they actually just.  We don't usually get to things until they're three or four days old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We like to do, like to let them percolate.  I like to find out what I think ahead of time.  Until they get a nice cheesy smell.  Then we learn the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We wait for the cachoi pepe moment and then we dive in.  A nice rind on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what they did is they they pull it,  put out a request for information on how they enforce mergers.  And why this matters is because it's saying to the world,  both the DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission are going to be looking at how they evaluate mergers.  They're going to change.  Well, they're looking at changing our policies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's a big particular in the digital age.  What used to work does not work.  And I do. I think there's this bitter regret over Instagram and WhatsApp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they. Yeah, there's I think it's not just that.  I mean, look at how LinaCon looks at what Amazon's doing.  I mean, there's there's tons of things.  So they put out this.  It's a request for information and you can get a lot for how they're thinking by looking at the types of questions they ask in this.  So this is like just a 10 page document.  They want everybody to talk about like they have some things.  So they're saying, hey, the way we look at M&A, do our current guidelines really work for that?  The way we measure competition, does that work?  Which means we could see them look at mergers more like Europe.  You know how we used to talk a lot about how in the US we wait for harms to consumers in this document.  They're actually asking, hey, does this harm not just consumers, but maybe employees?  Does it harm innovation at different levels?  So they're actually open.  It is a big deal because they're opening up a lot of things that have been established and settled law for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I suspect that should say, Sacy.  Well, OK, let me just say I suspect that's what Corey's talking about when he says, wait a minute, hold on, it's not a done deal.  This is not. Yeah.  This the climate has changed.  Yeah. But that I echo Jeff's question, which is isn't this Congress's job?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No. So what Congress does is they write laws and then they let the regulatory agencies figure it out.  Well, I would phrase it differently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They write laws that say what the mandate is for those agencies.  Those agencies can only do what law congressional law has said they can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I so I could answer this question for the FCC because that's what I've covered for decades.  I can't tell you what laws govern how the FTC or the DOJ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. My sense of it actually is that the FCC is much more constrained by what Congress says than the FTC or DOJ is.  So probably. Yeah.  This is an interesting question.  And we'd have to get a governmental expert on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or just give me a week. I'll learn.  Will you? Thank you.  If you want me to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're our expert on everything. That's the truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's about restraint of trade.  Pulling up the Sherman Antitrust Act. Right.  And then starts off with restraint of trade.  And remember Congress is a consumer harm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Congress has been addressing whether the Sherman Antitrust Act is is is good enough in this age.  But it's always my sense that Congress has to decide that not the FTC can't just say, well, you know, that Sherman Antitrust Act is outdated.  We're going to do a different.  I don't know how much they can do that.  They can do that.  I wonder. DOJ is different because you can investigate.  Right.  They have an investigative mandate.  Some of the things they're asking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they're asking how should markets be defined when the potential harm to competition stems not from price increases, but from long term or other non-price factors.  So that's one of the things they actually bring up.  I can never say this, Jeff.  What's the word? Monosopi?  Monosopi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like Monopoly, but it's a monosopi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like the colonoscopy.  Monopsomy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Monopsomy.  Monopsomy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Thank you.  Yeah.  So how should the guidelines analysis of monopsony power differ from analysis of monopoly power?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the monopsony is kind of the opposite of a monopoly.  A monopoly is one company that dominates a business.  A monopsony is a market in which there's only one buyer for a product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  And then they have a whole segment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have one customer instead of one seller, which is weird, but it's a big deal.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they also have a whole section on digital markets.  So they're like, hey, how do M&A and digital markets differ from physical markets?  What does that mean?  There's a lot of really good questions they're asking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the question though.  These are legitimate questions.  They should ask them.  Then what?  And I think ultimately it's a court that's going to decide this, not the FTC, not the  DOJ.  The court and the court's going to decide it based on established law and precedent,  not on what the FTC thinks is.  But the FTC can bring a court case, so can the DOJ, but the courts are going to interpret  it and I think they're going to look at the statutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but here's how this works.  I mean, you see the same thing play out with like the FCC when they put out like a notice  of proposed something.  Anyway, they do the same sort of process.  So the process is this.  These guys are clearly indicating with this thing that they've sent out, what's it called  again?  The request for comment.  Yeah, request for comment.  They're saying, hey, we're thinking about this.  You've got X number of days, I don't remember how many days to tell us your opinions.  What they're going to do is they're going to come out from that and then they're going  to create new merger review guidelines.  From there, everybody's going to say, oh crikey, this is how they're going to evaluate this.  What will happen is when they apply those guidelines, the company that's affected by  it and is mad about it is going to sue.  And then we'll see that lawsuit come forth and the judge will say, I'm sorry, you don't  have the power to do this.  It needs to go back to Congress.  We actually saw this happen with net neutrality in the FCC.  Or the courts are going to say, keep going.  So ultimately, yes, it gets decided by the courts, but this is still a very important  process because it's possible that the DOJ and the FTC make it work.  And with most companies that want to be within the legal framework or with the companies  that are going to be doing these deals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, if you're a tech company, it's just one more thing that is kind of informing you  that, hey, they're looking at us, they're paying attention.  And that may be the main intent of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, the intent is actually to come up with new merger guidelines.  The intent is not to, we're not going to leave this process with everybody agreeing that,  oh yeah, everything we've been doing is still going to happen that way because it's so wonderful.  We are going to walk out with new merger guidelines.  Now I don't know if we're going to walk out with things like, hey, you're going to have  to undo those deals like what the UK is trying to do with Metta and Giphy.  Or yeah, Giphy.  But we are definitely going to have a new way of evaluating M&A, which is why it's such  a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So according to The Hill, the FTC and DOJ were tasked during the Trump administration  to look at antitrust enforcement.  They spent a year and a half looking at their joint guidance on vertical mergers.  They voted last fall to withdraw those guidelines on a party line vote.  So maybe it's in the face of this vacuum that they want to say, well, okay, we've withdrawn  our existing guidelines on vertical mergers.  Now what?  What should they be?  Right.  And of course, you know, this is the Biden administration in effect.  This is the executive saying, you know, we need to pay more attention to this.  I think Congress is split on this and I don't know where the courts stand.  So I think there are a lot of question marks.  It's not sufficient for the FTC and DOJ to say, no, this is the law.  They don't.  They just say what we're going to investigate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These are just their M&A guidelines that they're doing.  When you're doing a deal, you do pay attention to this because let's say you want to do...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't want to get investigated, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  If you're going to buy like a tiny little aqua hire and you look at this and you're  like, oh, well now it's no longer worth it, which is why we're going to see a lot of VCs  come in and talk about how, because this is going to affect their exit strategy as well.  You're going to see a lot of interesting players come out and be like, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In the joint RFC, they said, they're particularly interested in hearing about aspects of competition  that the current guidelines may under emphasize or neglect, such as labor market effects and  non-price elements of competition, like innovation, quality, and potential competition.  I think that's reasonable.  So instead of just saying, what's the harm to the consumer?  How is this going to affect prices?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All of those yield to harm to the consumer.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just not in pricing.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's what they're saying.  Is our current strategy for...  Because that's all we use right now for our M&A is price, whereas the EU looks at a broader  thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Critics of antitrust...  This is the hill again.  Critics of antitrust enforcement over the last few decades have raised concerns of focusing  solely on the effects of mergers and acquisitions on consumer prices, has allowed many anti-competitive  mergers to be completed freely.  This is especially a point of focus for groups worried about the consolidation in the tech  industry.  Let me ask our tech apologist, Jeff Jarvis.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Internet defender as well.  I'm sorry.  Defender of the internet, Jeff Jarvis.  You need a little peacemaker helmet.  That would be cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff, I put in the doc in the chat a link to the actual document.  Oh, here's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is this the RFC itself?  That's good.  That'll be good.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was also reading the Terminator Antitrust Act, but go ahead and ask a question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there is, on the other hand, a strong case to be made that we should let these companies...  Let the free market decide.  Let these companies battle it out.  The best case for innovation is for companies to compete as hard as they can and do the  best that they can.  Don't you think that there's...  I hear Stacey groaning.  Surprisingly.  Is the issue that they aren't competing as hard as they can, they're just acquiring?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, a few things.  One, as I reread Sherman, it's interesting.  It's all about conspiracies and collusion and bad things behind the scenes, not purchases.  So there's kind of a difference in what it was aimed for was these horrible bad tactics  that Rockefeller and the robber barons of the Gilded Age did.  This is different.  This says, okay, we established a principle there, to Stacey's point, and now we enforce  it differently.  I think what's really interesting, though, is you go back...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're also, by the way, if you read this request for comment, they're also saying,  do the guidelines properly reflect the text and purpose of the Clayton Act?  They aren't saying...  I was going to say...  We're not going to replace Clayton or Sherman, but are we actually enforcing what the intent  of these laws is?  Are we actually doing our job?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But even Clayton is about unethical business practices, price fixing monopolies, as opposed  to, gee, that's too big, or they shouldn't be together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Clayton says they want to prevent mergers and acquisitions whose effect may be substantially  to lessen competition.  And then the FTC and DOJ say, are they sufficiently clear about the circumstances in which that  happens?  What effects should be covered by the terms?  They're saying lessen competition.  Well, how do we do that?  How do we avoid that?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so the point I want to get to is to raise...  What you raised earlier is that if you really could...  Sherman turned the way back machine to whatever year it was, and Facebook's going to buy Instagram.  Instagram, small, they overpaid for it.  It's a perfect example.  Not much there.  Or farther back.  There were fewer than 20 employees.  It's a perfect example.  Right.  I'm going to say, oh my God, they should have seen...  Compare that to Microsoft's announcement.  Now, I'm not saying Microsoft's announcement is wrong either.  They're number three in games.  One of the new players is Chinese.  Who knows?  The world changes.  There's a RAND report that I call upon often from the 90s that said, yeah, we've got to  let this just kind of blow out and figure it out.  They're trying to think that we can control it now that we know where it's ending, we  know where we are, is hubris and won't work very well.  So yes, we'll make missteps and things that go wrong, but let it play itself out more.  So I think the question then becomes, we go back to our discussion of regulatory capture,  and we have Facebook out there begging for regulation because they can afford it.  What I fear for are the sprouts we can't see coming out of the ground yet.  The competition we don't know wants to start out there because it can't.  And how do you regulate to that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's just a silly red herring of regulating the stuff we don't know about.  I'm going after it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll take mine with mustard, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So to say that we don't know what's going to happen so we shouldn't regulate is silly.  We are going to mess things up.  Okay because that's what it sounds like you're saying.  And I'm like, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, what I'm saying is the thing I care about that I do want to regulate to is to enable  future competition.  But what I'm saying is because we don't know what that is, I don't know how to regulate  to that.  And so what happens is a lot of the regulation that occurs to date is stuff that only the  big companies can afford to do and new companies can't afford to do it.  And that's the unintended consequence of that regulation is that it stifles competition  because it sets the playing field at an impossible level.  And so how do you regulate to avoid that is what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So big companies will always, always be able to handle regulation better because they simply  have more money and infrastructure.  So that is a good point and lawyers, yes.  But I think by setting out new guidelines, I don't think that hurts innovation because  what will happen is you will have a clear set of guidelines.  And yes, the companies that are big and established will play within those guidelines and manipulate  them using their massive war chests and lawyers.  But it also makes clear where the new innovation can come in and kind of go in the cracks.  And that's how it's historically gone.  So you're going to change the field.  And there are companies right now, like small companies who've been playing under the existing  regime that are going to get screwed.  That always happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, the other way they're going to get screwed, Stacey, is the other thing I fear  is that, and I don't like this world where venture money controls everything, but we  are still in that world.  And if there isn't, if exit paths get cut off.  Well, and that's what I'm talking about.  The venture capitalists are going to hate this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, but there will be more investment once they figure this new thing out.  Venture capital is not, I know they like to think they're a leading indicator.  No, they're not.  So they're going to try to keep everything the same so they can maintain their returns,  which I don't blame them.  But that's also not great for innovation because we're way down this road and we're pretty,  basically all our cool stuff that gets invented gets invented to be sold to one of the big  companies sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I have to say, reading these questions, this all seems completely reasonable.  It doesn't presume an answer.  It just says, well, here's some things we really need to look at.  And in every case they say, you know, consistent with what Congress and the courts have indicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they have to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's, yeah, they are limited by that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's also better than a knee jerk.  We got to break them up to punish them.  Yeah, no, this is thoughtful.  And you know, Lena Conn, I think is very thoughtful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Regarding that failing firms thing, there actually is a whole section, section 15 on  failing and flailing firms in which they ask the question, in what situation should a weakened  competitor defense apply?  So for instance, T-Mobile, which was failing, was denied a number of mergers, but eventually  granted it.  I think also of Sirius Satellite and XM, both of which were failing and allowed to merge,  even though it created a monopoly.  So they're asking about existing doctrine and how does it change, how has it changed  in the digital era?  And I think these are all things you want to almost constantly ask these questions.  It's appropriate at this time to say, well, markets have changed a little bit.  The monopsony thing is very interesting.  As an example, its effect on labor markets.  If there's only one company hiring, that's a monopsony.  If they're the only customer for labor, then labor has no recourse.  They have no defense.  They can't say, well, we're going to go across the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Clayton actually addresses what they call tying contracts and that labor agreements  fall under Clayton.  So they have a justification for something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They also talk about innovation.  To what extent does a focus on product market overlaps fail to identify broader concerns  about incentives to innovate, particularly given that innovation may involve the creation  of new product or service categories.  These are all, I think, really appropriate.  Now the question is, is there an answer?  I think you have to acknowledge this is an imperfect system.  There are going to be 50 answers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are going to be so many answers.  This is why we hate talking about this because there's going to be 50 different answers depending  on where you're coming from.  The FTC and the DOJ are going to have to make some calls and they're going to be like, and  then the courts will rule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I think all of this is appropriate.  So get back to Microsoft.  I think maybe the fact that this came out the day before Microsoft announced the acquisition  of Activision may not be a coincidence.  This is just a question right now.  This isn't new policy.  I may have thought, now's the time to jump on this and get it in under the door before  the door slams shut.  So I think it's appropriate.  It's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Meanwhile, before we move on from regulation, we could be in a much better place, which  of course would be Europe, Line 51.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  Well, before we go to Line 51.  Let me take a little tiny time out and talk about our sponsor because we are at the half  hour mark.  Only if you don't include my long boring anecdotes about mattresses and Francis Ford Coppola.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or your efforts to find a simple link on the flicker.  Your deaf has cut that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I took out a whole 10 minutes in the overall timing based on me scrolling up and down.  By the way.  You're just it folks.  It was fascinating.  Oh man, we edited that part out completely.  But here it is.  Real doing UI.  Under general, there's a little triangle.  I missed the little teeny weeny triangle right there.  And there it is.  Stacey Higginbotham book club vote on the next book.  And somewhere the vote is here.  You can vote on the next book.  That's one of them.  Unauthorized bread, a radicalized novella.  And they talk about where you can get it and all of that stuff.  So it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The vote, you go to the pinned right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's good.  By Nnedi Okarfor.  Unauthorized bread by Cory Doctorow and Kaifu Lee's AI 2041.  You can cast your vote right there if you have a strong opinion.  And then when is the next book club?  It's going to be next month, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sometime next month.  March.  After we get our vote.  March, not February.  It had to be March.  Right.  We get our vote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  I interviewed Anna Lee in 2018.  Holy cow.  Yeah, Autonomous was an older book.  Yeah.  Well, three years old, not that old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, well, you know, she's got a new one out.  They've got a new one out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the European regulator speaking.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A member of the European Commission.  Unbelievable video of EU Commissioner.  Are you ready?  This is from Thierry Breton.  All right, here we go.  Let me turn on the sound.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, yes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  The ecstasy of gold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A new sheriff in town.  Wait a minute.  You recognize this Spaghetti Western?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's Clint Eastwood.  Watch out, digital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the good, bad and ugly, but the soundtrack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Counterfeit products.  Ah, but new EU sanctions.  Lobby efforts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just hope this doesn't get pulled.  I'm covering it with my whistling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is illegal?  There's a new sheriff in town and it goes by the name of DSA.  Boy, that makes me really shiver in my boots.  What is this crap?  Really, Mr. Jones?  What does DSA stand for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Digital Services Act, I think it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And what is it going to do?  Is it going to eliminate hate speech?  Oh yes, and disinformation and everything that's wrong with it.  Illegal content.  It's just going to get rid of all of it.  It's all going to be gone.  Because Europe knows what they're doing.  Because Thierry Breton is Clint Eastwood.  In the DSA at noon.  Oh, by the way, very first...  Oh, nice.  Peacemaker's here.  Very first response tweet to this video.  I'm curious, did you clear the rights to this footage?  Nice job, Thierry Breton.  You go to DMC De Jail.  Spotify's getting a little bit of heat.  Just a little.  Just a little.  Over Mr. Joe Rogan.  What is it?  17,000 scientists?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it really up to that?  Something like that.  That's why they hired Joe Rogan.  They wanted a little bit of heat.  Now they might be getting a little too much.  It's not 70,000.  But people are still subscribing though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  260 scientists in an open letter urged Spotify to take action over mass information events.  I think they mean miss.  I think the rap actually is a typo.  I don't get it.  Maybe there's a typo in the letter.  No, this is from the letter.  Baseless conspiracy theories, broadcasting misinformation.  They're particularly upset about a January...  Oh, the letter was dated January 10th, but they're upset over a New Year's Eve episode  of the Joe Rogan Experience, known as JRE to its fans,  in which guest Dr. Robert Malone promoted baseless conspiracy theories  by allowing the propagation of false and societally harmful assertions.  Spotify is blah, blah, blah.  What is Spotify's responsibility here?  Do they own Joe Rogan?  No.  Yeah, they pay him a fortune.  Well, they pay him for exclusivity.  Yeah, I don't know if that's calling him or anything, but it's still their platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think they should be held responsible for it because it's their platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unlike Twitter and Facebook, which is an open platform for all of us to say where the hell we want,  they in essence hired him.  So they are as responsible for him.  You want a media analogy?  That's a media relationship.  Twitter and Facebook aren't, but that is.  They're responsible.  So they can make a choice to have him or not have him.  I was talking about this with my friend Pete Dominic on his podcast.  And the fear is, Pete says, if they get rid of him or something, oh my God,  then he becomes an even bigger martyr for the cause of stupidity.  And so Spotify put themselves in a position where they're a little hotter to the collar, as Stacey said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where did 230 implications on this, if any?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have the right to have him or not have him.  That's the implication.  But it is different.  It's interesting to add.  It is a question mark.  I want to get one of our lawyer friends and have a half hour discussion about this to drive Leo nuts.  While you were gone, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kathy Gellis was great.  And we're going to have her back.  Absolutely.  But whatever you do, don't ask her about incidental copyright.  Ancillary copyright.  And of course, if you get her and Jeff talking about ancillary copyright, just sit back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's life's short, I'm a happy guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it worse than me on chips?  Talking about life's short.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was adorable and I enjoyed it.  I learned a lot.  So it was a good conversation about ancillary copyright.  But it's a really good question, Dan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'm not sure because in this case, they bought the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But wait a minute.  Is a radio station responsible for what Rush Limbaugh says on the radio station?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yes, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't the FCC kind of master the radio stations?  Right?  Yes, they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, because that radio is different.  Is the New York Times responsible for publishing an op-ed by Rush Limbaugh that libels someone?  Yes.  They can be sued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  Yes.  Although I have to say my syndicator, Premier Radio Networks, which carried Rush Limbaugh  and still carries quite a few people, or our competitor, which carries Ben Shapiro, they,  I mean, nobody stopped these people from saying things like what Joe Rogan said.  Because they're saying awful things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not necessarily saying actual things.  Hannity says, I'm not a journalist.  I'm an entertainer.  They're saying awful things, not libelous things.  Joe Rogan says, I'm an effing moron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does that let him off the hook?  No.  It was a joke.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was just joking.  You should decide whether you want to get a vaccine or not.  I was just joking.  But then this doctor comes on and says, well, it's much more harmful for young people and  you shouldn't get it.  You know, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Spotify has taken the measure of pulling down some Joe Rogan content that was bad.  Spotify is now shutting down Spotify.  Well, yeah, bad to find bad.  But they've pulled stuff.  They've even pulled some of his shows, more recent shows.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The issue is a moral responsibility, not a legal one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good point.  OK, there you go.  That's really the point.  There you go.  It's a moral or ethical responsibility.  Yeah.  We can yell all we want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I'm not arguing for any kind of legal action.  They are protected.  I'm not.  I'm the First Amendment.  Yeah.  But moral responsibility, yes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think as long as subscribers are still rolling into Spotify, Spotify is just going to keep  cashing those checks.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And, you know, I mean, yeah, they're making money on Joe Rogan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So theoretically, we don't actually know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, I think they probably lost money.  To be honest, they paid him like, what was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have they made good on that yet?  I doubt it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is a substantial amount of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  DirecTV has dumped OAN, your favorite network.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, because especially it came out there.  This is bad publicity.  This is a moral, not panic, not panic, a moral issue where and it was a business issue where  when the stories came out that AT&T was the primary supporter of OAN, was their biggest  revenue source.  Oh, that doesn't make us look too good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do they own DirecTV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, that sounds more like a commercial and not a moral issue, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the reason it's a commercial issue is because people have a moral objection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  So I don't know if they actually funded OAN.  They funded it was indirect.  But you're right.  I mean, that's why AT&T.  They were revenue source to them.  Yeah.  So AT&T, which does own DirecTV, apparently has decided to, I don't know, maybe or maybe  just DirecTV is autonomous.  Anyway, they're not renewing the contract for OAN.  But I think that's related because OAN is also a source of a lot of weird disinformation  and propaganda and conspiracy theories, even if you like it a lot.  OAN's market, according to Brian Stelter, is a couple of years ago, OAN's total subscriber  count is far lower than Fox News or even Newsmax.  It's half Newsmax.  It is a crazy person network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you watched OAN?  I've never seen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it?  I should watch it.  Oh, yeah.  Is it entertaining anyway?  If you don't mind your blood pressure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I was like, it's only entertaining except you were like, oh, no, people actually believe  this.  Nope, it's not entertaining anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They claim that COVID was created in a North Carolina lab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It would surprise me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We all thought it was funny, but that's how we got here.  We laughed at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and that's the same thing with Joe Rogan.  He says, I'm a comic.  I'm a comic.  I'm making jokes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  How about...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is not on the rundown, but Brandy Zdrosny, if you know of her, she's a brilliant orderer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  That story with the January 6th person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And Brandy's great because what I so love about her is that she's a librarian who became  a reporter who reports on the worst of conspiracy theorists and awful things.  But she's still a librarian.  I love that combination.  And she's very good at it.  She had a really good story.  She spent a year on, not like the New York Times say, let's go visit a Nazi and find  they eat in Panera.  This is somebody who tried to really understand what was going on in his head.  Somebody who got up to the steps of the Capitol on January 6th and then said, no.  And what happened in that process?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is from NBC.  Escape from QAnon, how January 6th changed one person's path.  The point here is, OAN, places like that, they're not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She makes the point.  There's no one source.  It's not like, oh, Facebook, that I turn off Facebook, everything's okay, or turn off  OAN, everything's okay.  No.  It feeds.  It's a whole bunch of stuff that feeds in.  Media have a major role here.  And once he was primed to believe crazy stuff, his first one was the pizza conspiracy in  Hillary Clinton.  Well, it could be.  And once he was down that rabbit hole, there was nothing but down toward the center of  the earth to go, and a lot of things push him there.  And so OAN has...  It doesn't have to have a large audience.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  His experience, I've had that experience when you're in a mob.  In my case, it was anti-Vietnam protests in the 70s.  But when you're in a mob, and he talks about...  He says, I saw their eyes change.  You know, when somebody gets really angry and you just feel like they're going to go  nuts, I feel like I was watching people get radicalized.  And that's what happens in a mob.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was in much more mellow anti-mortuary marches, Leo.  What kind of nasty marches were you in?  We were all trying to save the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we thought we were trying to save the world, but in particular, one, in the mining  of Haiphong Harbor.  Do you remember that?  When we mined the harbor?  It was in Santa Cruz.  I was in high school still.  And somebody decided we should march down Ocean Street and block the highway exit.  Go out and block Highway 1, I guess it was.  And I have a vivid memory of this.  I was carrying a Viet Cong flag.  In fact, I believe in case anybody wants to keep me from running for president, you'll  find a picture on the front page of the Santa Cruz Sentinel of me holding a Viet Cong flag.  Oh, my.  I thought, well, there goes my political career.  Oh, shucks.  Why are you making an actor?  I didn't think this was a good idea.  I thought this is just going to piss people off.  But you get swept away by it.  And then they started rocking cars.  And I could see how you slowly gradually escalate.  And then the next thing you do is you set a car on fire.  If you're angry enough and it doesn't take that's the point is maybe it's only 10% of  the crowd, but it's it's spreads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's infectious.  I covered the Harvey Milk.  You get angry.  I put Dan White in San Francisco.  Yes.  Yes, I saw that.  Yeah.  I organized a moratorium march that was very mellow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I went to all the teach ins and the mellow things.  I did that, too.  You know, I'm going to take off sixth period.  I'm going to a teach in up at the university.  OK, wow.  My parents were hippies.  It was OK.  I was allowed.  You know how paths diverge in the woods?  You know, we're back.  We're back on the porch, Grandpa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So let me tell you stories about the 60s.  Here it comes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to stop right there.  But I understand I do understand this article.  I mean, it has nothing to do with anything, but I do understand this article that Brandy  Zdrosny wrote for and reported on for NBC.  And I understand this this guy, which is interesting because I don't think most people  pull back from the brink.  I think you get sucked into it.  Right.  Exactly.  And I think he had a unique perspective where what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whoa, this is getting out of hand.  He also he arrived home.  His family could see where he was on his phone.  They knew he was at the Capitol.  They were afraid to death.  He arrives home and they did an intervention.  It was kind of a light bulb moment to say, oh, what was I thinking?  What's fascinating about this, too, is Brandy, who I respect immensely as a journalist, on  Twitter said she has a Miranda statement that she gives to sources.  That's smart.  She tells them if this is going to affect your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, that's really smart.  And all journalists should do this.  You should write this up and take it to your place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This guy, the story took three months longer because he wasn't ready three months ago.  And now he was ready and gave her permission.  They changed his last name.  But changed his name, right?  But really, really interesting piece because it's not that usual.  Let's go to the diner and understand what the crazies are saying.  Yeah.  This was trying to understand his real thinking.  And it's valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I don't think everybody gets a Miranda.  Like, I will talk to people and explain to them, look, you are clearly on the record  when you talk to me.  But I would say it's a very rare story that I would like if it's like more of a human  interest.  This I know this feels more than a human interest, but it is kind of human interesty.  But otherwise, no, in certain people in certain positions of power, you know what you're  doing.  And if you don't think you're talking to politicians, you don't need to Mirandize them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, I was like, I am not Mirandizing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, not a PR professional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but when you're talking to a normal person and you're about to write a story that is  going to change their life, I think it's appropriate to be honest and forthright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, yes, I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I bet you, you do things like say, I just want you to know I'm recording this, etc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do it when I even do it for the CEO of a startup because I have had so many of them  just say the dumbest things to me.  I'm like, I am not your friend.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They should know that, but they don't often or they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Some of it is like if they have PR representation, I don't go out of it.  But if it's like there's a lot of people listen to the show and they're like starting up a  company and they're trying to do something cool and I'm like, hey, I'll write about your  gadget.  But then I'm pretty clear with them because they're like, yeah, this is going to change

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  your life.  You are going to sell a million units.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you ready?  Hey, speaking of which, I blame you for the success of Nanoleaf.  You were the first person that told me about it.  And then Micah Sargent, they are retiring those original HomeKit light panels that you  showed us.  But that's good news.  They're not HomeKit.  Electra's items, Stacey.  Oh, they're not HomeKit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they work with Apple, but they're not home.  This was pre HomeKit.  They launched these in 2016.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they're 50% off now, if you want to snag them.  They are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're not going to sell anymore.  You can only buy expansion packs for the original triangles for like till they run out.  Now, I did ask them, I said, hey, how long are you going to do security updates and support?  And the answer, if you're wondering, since we're talking about it, I'm just going to  tell you, they are going to offer it indefinitely.  Custom support and app features will be available, including group scenes, allowing users to  control their light panels with current and future Nanoleaf products.  So all of that is still going to stay.  And I even, a year after this, they launched the Nanoleaf canvases.  And I was like, are we going to expect those to become a legacy product in a year or so  from now?  And she's like, at this time, there are no plans to transition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what was normally, say, $680 for the 30 panel rhythm starter kit is now $499.  Expansion panels.  That's not quite half off, but a pretty significant reduction.  So if you've thought, oh, I'd like to have these Wi-Fi controlled LED panels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're 30% off the light panels promo and 50% off accessories.  I'm so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it said the article we were reading said 50.  So you were not mistaken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm reading the original press statement.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I see.  The article says up to.  Up to.  Up to.  As little as.  Yeah.  All right.  So anyway, that's, but the thing they're replacing it with is better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Nanoleaf shapes, it is.  And they have a, they've done a really, okay.  Let me just be real for y'all for a second.  I've now had my elements.  Please and thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're always real, Stacey.  I know.  I've never known you to not be real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The secret here, when I say I'm going to be real, that means I'm about to say something  bad about something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.  This is she's.  The Nanoleaf elements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  Change your life.  They suck.  Oh no.  They are the most frustrating product I have right now.  You never told us that before, young.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is, we were, so I was in love with them and then I updated it to the Threadborder  router, because you know, it's a Threadborder router and I love Manor.  Right.  Who doesn't love Manor?  And then they started getting wonky.  Wonky.  And I was like, oh, they would do things like turn on in the middle of the night for no  reason.  They would do things like not turn on at all.  That sounds awesome.  And I was like, what the?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sounds like the IoT life, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is kind of, so and then what happened is I talked to them and they were like, it's  a software update.  Only a few people are affected.  It's an IoT life for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  An IoT life for us.  Lights go on, they go off.  I don't switch.  I don't know.  It's an IoT life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just because it's in bad taste.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They promised an update.  The update came through.  It did not fix the problem of them randomly turning on, which is why I'm finally giving  up on them.  And I think if they don't, I've emailed them again this week.  I was like, look, if these don't stop turning on in the middle of the night, I mean, we  have to literally unplug them when we go to bed.  Are we going to fix this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dwindle has the elevator pitch for these when they came out.  He says the elevator pitch was disco floors for your wall.  That's not bad.  I think Dwindle's got it.  So I can't recommend them anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So don't buy them because their software is glitchy unless, and if you do buy them, don't  put them anywhere near a room that you sleep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I learned that way back when we were the first Hue lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, those are fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they fixed the issue.  I know they fixed it, but that was it on Hue for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's on top of your IoT buyer's remorse list?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right now, that is the device causing the most pain in my marriage.  Do you still have them on the wall?  Yeah, they're still on the wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does Andrew do things like, Stacey, the nano leafs are on again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, two nights ago, four in the morning, they had turned on at 1 30 and I turned them  off at four in the morning.  He pokes me hard in the shoulder and he's like, the nano leafs are on again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did he say your nano lights?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As he should.  Nailed it.  Yep.  Yep.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When Andrew suffers, I know.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have I told you the story of the mattress pad that cooled your dad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel your pain, man.  I really do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Please do tell it again.  You've just a great story, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no, because we got to end the show by five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Y'all.  You know what was 10 years ago today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was it SOPA?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A victory for the good guys.  Yeah, I remember this well.  John, remember we went to black and white for the whole day.  SOPA, which was this, what was it?  It was the Stop Online Privacy Act.  Piracy.  Piracy, not privacy.  Stop Online Privacy Act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm in favor of the Stop the Privacy Act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this show has changed.  It was the largest, even to this day, the largest online protest ever.  SOPA was, you know, Congress was considering it.  But the blackout, which was 24 million people did it.  Many sites just went dark.  That was the most how you did it, which is a black page.  We didn't want to go dark that day.  So in support, we went to black and white.  We became this whole all of our shows are black and white that day, which I think was good.  And we wanted to keep doing it.  And during the show, say, here's why we're black and white.  Here's what you could do.  It worked.  Congress was spooked by the whole thing.  They killed the bill in 2012 and no significant copyright legislation has been introduced in the 10 years since.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that was an amazing victory for digital activism.  And it also set the it set actually a lot of things in motion for how activists deal with issues online.  So it's definitely not just our websites going dark and like but even like how people communicated bad in Twitter and shared information.  It was a and remember they got us to like they set up like a bunch of Twilio kind of things where you could automatically dial your congressman and leave a message.  I mean, brilliant.  It was it was the it was well organized at the beginning of digital activism, but it was a case study that helped like.  But let us know for digital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a bunch of white geeks fighting for the technology.  Where is the effort to do the same right now for voting rights?  Good point.  I wish I wish we could see the same kind of mobilization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good point. Now, in the democracy in its defense, SOPA was a direct attack on the Internet.  So it was reasonable for the Internet to respond that way.  But I think you're right.  I think I just don't think there's a unity in the same way as the Internet had unity over that in the same way over voting rights.  I think that's a well, I think some leadership by us there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If somebody would stand out, we're going to bring a bad signal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a bad thing.  Here's what I when I when Lisa and I watch the TV and we are.  I just say, you know what?  There's only one solution to this, which is elect more Democrats.  The reason people like Kirsten Sinema and Joe Manchin have so much power is we have a razor thin majority.  If there were 60 or 70 Democrats in the Senate, this wouldn't be happening.  So in a way, this is reflecting the will of the people.  This is who got elected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So well, it's it's I mean, OK, but no, we're not going to talk about it.  Let's not do this. It's politics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just saying it's not like he's already lost.  It's not like Joe Biden's blowing it.  No, there's 50 Democrats.  It's it's not a hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's hard to elect Democrats because there's there's gerrymandering.  There's also the fact that it's hard to elect Democrats because no, it's true.  If you've got two senators and, you know, California sends to and North Dakota, we have a structural problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Electoral College has broken too, but that's the way it is.  So if you care about that, Democrats, if this is something that's an issue for you, here's what you do.  You don't say White House should do something about it.  You go out and you elect Democrats.  You go campaign for me, you fundraise for him and you get them elected because that's the way to solve this.  That's the way to solve the filler.  The filibuster just reflects the fact that we don't have a supermajority period.  We I shouldn't say we they Democrats don't have a supermajority.  So that's the solution.  I mean, it's not go out and get people elected.  That's you know, that's the way that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if you're but if you can't give water to the people who vote, if they have to wait six hours to vote, look, there's a lot of people trying hard to make this hard and an imbalance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I understand that you have to overcome that.  OK, that's a bit.  There is a path.  That's the path.  Instead, people go away away away and comes November of this year.  You're going to really be crying when we lose the House and the Senate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, while media might my damn colleagues are are who should never be allowed to predict the future are just presuming that it's lost because it was in the past.  Right.  They didn't predict midterms.  They didn't get the election.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But but I'm saying when when when is not the answer.  Go out, do something, fundraise if you care about this.  There is a path, but you've got to follow it.  You can't just whine about it and say, well, it's Joe Joe Biden's job to do it.  No action.  Bernie Sanders is not going to convince Kristen, Kirsten Sinema and Joe Manchin to change.  You know what it is?  Who is the voters?  So go vote.  And admittedly, it's an uphill battle because of things like the, you know, the voting rights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's an impossible battle.  You should look at how Texas, Jerry.  Oh, my God.  Oh, I know. It's terrible.  I know.  It's terrible.  The same structural inequities that are.  But that happens because there's a Republican legislature in Texas.  Right.  But we have a Republican legislature in Texas because the people in certain areas have half like the people in liberal areas have half the people in the liberal areas.  Have half the people representing them.  I mean, it's the same structural issues.  So that's why we have.  Why are we talking?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's a good thing.  Let's talk about.  Let's talk about SOPA and PIPA.  This is a really good report.  I found this in the Tech Talk article by Yochai Benkler at the Berkman Center a couple of a couple of years after the big protest.  Look at this.  This is a book based on this.  Yes.  Yochai loves these things.  These network maps.  This is where the the big dots are where the organization happened.  Look, Tech Talk is a big dot there right there.  It's almost as big as CNET there.  So this is and Wikipedia went dark.  I remember that.  There's a big deal somewhere.  There's a little dot for twit here somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somewhere there's a little dot for GigaOM.  I remember.  Yeah.  There's Boy Boing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's Gizmodo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this was a decade ago.  Hard to believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember turning on the stream just playing this deck and see it right now and just black and white like it happened yesterday.  This is a decade ago.  Oh, you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's neat.  It was a tough decision because I really wanted to support it.  I really was a strong believer, but I also didn't want to go far.  We also had to talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why I did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what we ended up doing something similar because we're like we came as a news site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  Ten years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I recommend Yochai Benkler's Network Propaganda, which is the invention of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's great.  And the Wealth of Networks.  And you know what he does, which is great?  He offers them for free as a kind of creative commons download.  You can buy the book and you should, but you can also download it for free if you want.  At least he did that with the Wealth of Networks.  I don't know if he did it with the...  I don't know if it was for the letter one.  I think that's his policy anyway.  If the publisher lets you.  Let's see.  If the publisher lets you.  Hey, big props to IO.  Do you know who IO is?  IO, IO, it's off to work we go.  This is a court action, a landmarks, kind of like the SOPA PIPA battle, a landmark copyright decision.  IO is in Hamburg, Germany.  We've talked about them before.  They run a number of ad blocking tools, extensions.  Adblock Plus is the best known.  They went to court over whether...  Springer went to court against them.  Axel Springer said...  Axel Springer?  Axel Springer said...  On the bed of the NMALA.  IO's ad blocking violates our copyright because it looks at our HTML on our website.  So IO, to their credit, fought this.  And this is in Hamburg.  And IO won.  This is the 16th time IO has prevailed against lawsuits and defended the rights of internet users, code developers, publishers.  In 2021, the lawsuit was brought by Axel Springer, which is the big publisher, right?  They publish a lot of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they also...  The Fox News Corp of Germany built is the very conservative tabloid paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The lawsuit sought to dictate that the HTML language used to render a website page should be protected under copyright law,  which would make it illegal for any technology or even an individual to change the appearance.  So if you ever use your own custom CSS to make the page look different, if you make the text bigger, is that violating the copyright?  Maybe.  Of course, the W3C, the World Wide Web Consortium, and a lot of us believe that that's the whole premise of the web, is that you should be able to modify that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, IO's model, though, has always been questionable to me, where we have...  We block ads, except unless you pay us, we'll let them through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't...  Well, that's why they have the money to fight this.  I know, but...  So, okay, I don't recommend Adblock Plus.  We always tell everybody, use Ublock Origin.  It's free because Gorsuch, the guy...  Gorrhill, rather, the guy who does it...  Gorsuch is somebody else.  Gorrhill's the guy who does it, is kind of cantankerous, doesn't want to make money on it.  He just hates ads.  So he makes the best adblocker out there.  But he has no money, no wherewithal to fight Axel Springer.  So, on the other hand, Springer, I think, understands that IO is probably much more of a problem for them.  So the Hamburg court rejected the copyright argument, once again decided in favor of IO,  and thanks to them, you can still use HTML in any way you want to.  It's still an open standard.  Thank you.  And yeah, IO has this acceptable ad standard thing where...  We've talked about this before, where...  Yeah, yeah.  Over the years.  Yeah.  You know, I understand that's a problem on the one hand,  but on the other hand, it's because it's how they have the money to fight this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually put the story on the run down first in German, because it's the only version I could find.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you for finding the English version.  I had bookmarked it as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The non-German version.  The other one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had bookmarked it as well, maybe in English.  You see Crypto.com everywhere.  Have you seen...  And I know you watch football.  I cannot watch a football game without Matt Damon saying,  Fortune favors the brave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That commercial confuses the heck out of me every time I watch it,  but I'm still more fascinated by the fact that they brought the name and rights to the Coliseum in Los Angeles.  Staples Center.  And they are all over F1.  No one's watching F1 now.  They got a lot of money.  No, they got a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Crypto.com.  It's like, wow.  I have some strong feelings.  I'm starting to have stronger feelings about NFTs and Crypto, that it's a scam.  All told, it's a scam.  But I know that that will make people yell at me, so I won't say it out loud.  However...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I see.  I was thinking that.  Did I say that out loud?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you say that?  It's a scam!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, because I know that I'm uphill on this one.  Everybody says, no, it's a great thing and it's going to change the world.  I think all it's doing is a big transfer of wealth from the suckers into the...  From the stupid to smart?  The bros.  Stupid bad to good or good to bad?  I don't think stupid and smart is right.  I think it's suckers and bros.  Or con men, PT Barnums.  Anyway, Crypto.com just suffered a hack for 15 million...  Are we going to talk about my favorite story of the week?  Well, let me finish this story and then we will.  Crypto.com just suffered a hack.  I was just explaining the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I forgot.  It was the intro.  It's like a Morty and Joe question that goes on forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Popcorn.  I need my popcorn.  So much love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just trying to do my job here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you think I'm verbose?  Have I been verbose?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm embarrassed that I forgot you were doing a story.  I had to lash back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff was on Twitter while you were doing that, Leo.  I heard him type in a tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This guy is so verbose.  He never stops talking.  When is it my turn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't care.  I don't even like this story.  What's your story, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's the related one.  It's the Dune guys, the Dune Dorks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love this story.  This one I can really dig my teeth into.  You know what a DAO is?  D-A-O is...  Derps and Derbers.  No, it's distributed.  Anyway, it's the idea of the first...  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Decentralized Autonomous Organization.  It's a decentralized autonomous organization,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  which is basically a group of people get together to try to raise money.  The first one I heard about was to buy the Constitution,  a copy of the Constitution, the Constitution DAO.  Well, this is the best.  This is better.  This summarizes the whole problem.  So there was a DAO put together to buy a copy of Dune, the book.  It's called the Spice DAO, because as you know, in Dune, it's all about the spice.  They raised...  Keep going.  They raised 2.26 million euros for to buy a book.  There's the book, a rare copy, I guess.  Of the 10 copies extent.  Yeah.  It's not even Frank Herbert's Dune.  It's like some sort of graphic novel or something.  So their goal now, they raised all this money from the Spice DAO,  they raised all this money from all these suckers, I mean contributors.  Their goal is to make the book public, to the extent permitted by law,  which is none.  They edited that.  Produce an original animated limited series inspired by the book  and sell it to a streaming service, support derivative products from the community.  They apparently think that if you buy a book, like if you go to the bookstore  and you buy a copy of the latest Danielle Steele novel,  that you have now the rights to make a movie out of it,  it doesn't work that way.  But apparently...  I didn't really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought that was people making fun of...  I didn't actually think that's what they thought, but that's actually what they thought.  Yeah, people looked into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But, but...  Because I thought there were actually two stories that were done early on this.  I forget which one I put in the Kotaku.  There was also a BuzzFeed version that linked to another report that said that,  well, after this guy supposedly put in three million euros of his own  to prime the pump here and get it going,  then he supposedly raised something like 12 million euros to make the damn movie.  So the question is, was this, to prove your point, Leo,  just a front to raise a lot of money from a lot of idiots?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is Alejandro Jodorowsky, who is, according to BuzzFeed, legendary.  For what? I don't know.  So they have apparently liberated...  They raised the money and liberated his Bible for a movie, which was never produced.  Orson Welles was going to play the Baron Harkonnen.  Mick Jagger had signed on, I'm not sure for which part.  Pink Floyd had agreed to do the music.  And Salvador Dali would play the Emperor of the Universe.  By the way, Dali's fee was $100,000 per minute of screen time.  He printed 20 luxurious volumes detailing the screenplay, illustrations, and designs.  He called it the director's Bible.  That's commonplace, the TV show.  You make a Bible, which is kind of like everything you need to know about this.  The studio said, no.  And the film was never made.  There have been other adaptations, as you know.  Over time, the Bible's...  This is a BuzzFeed story.  ...attained almost religious status among revelerentials, scholars, and sci-fi obsessives.  It vanished from the public eye until this November, when number five of the 20 came up for auction at Christie's.  Appraisers thought it would sell for $40,000.  They never heard of Bitcoin, baby.  The winning bid, $2.9 billion...  I'm sorry, million.  It should have been billion.  Million.  Placed by Soban Saqib.  He's a 25-year-old cryptocurrency nerd, NFT collector, and this is the most important part, freshly minted millionaire from Woodland, California.  He says, this is pretty much my entire liquid net worth, but I fronted the three million knowing that the community has my back.  The community is the Spiced Dow, this cryptocurrency distributed autonomous organization.  So apparently, by the way, a week later, they went back and said, we need six more million dollars to buy...  That's the thing.  ...to buy the Bible.  To buy a copyright lawyer?  Another $2.2 million to make an animated film inspired by the vision.  I guess that makes sense.  If Jodorowsky is behind this, he's saying, yeah, yeah, it's okay, you make the movie.  He probably is the one who has the copyright for it.  But he doesn't have the copyright for Dunes.  Well, so call it June or Spoon.  June.  Or the Spice Chronicles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Pepper Chronicles.  The Book of Spice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Spice Boys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Spice Boys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is not Sobi's first NFT.  He sold in August an NFT that looks like Odell Beckham Jr.  He sold it to Odell Beckham Jr., who was on the L.A. Rams himself for $2.7 million worth of...  This is where he got the $2.7 million.  It was a crypto punk of OBJ.  I know, Ant, you have NFTs and I don't want to rant on your proof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, sir. I've said before, I have a love-hate relationship with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know you're not scamming anybody at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I look at stuff like this and it just, it burns me up.  It burns you for it.  Yet then there's a lot of other artists out there that are making some unbelievable art and are getting stiffed.  But yet somebody just throws eight pixels on the screen and it's popular, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When you pay gas money, whose pocket does that go into?  The miners.  Whose pocket does that go into?  That's the miners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So this is one of the elements of crypto is that not only does the initial coin have to be mined by a computer  or a bunch of computers doing hard math problems, but it also, all transactions have to be registered in the blockchain by a miner.  So miners can do either, they can or both and many do.  And you make money for either. In the case of mining, you get the crypto.  In the case of verifying transactions, putting transactions in the blockchains, you get some, you get paid some crypto.  And often if you notice when you do a transaction, I've seen this with Bitcoin, you can decide how fast you want that transaction to occur.  And if you are willing to pay more Bitcoin to do it, the transaction will occur quickly.  Bitcoin is very sluggish and so sometimes a transaction might take...  It might take only half an hour.  Or days even. Maybe it's down to half an hour now.  So that really, so you can, in other words, if you don't pay anything, it may take days or may never be registered.  So it's, I think it's honestly...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Personally, I'm looking at some of the other options.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. The people who cheerlead this are, I think, mostly people who stand to make money for it, probably.  Yeah.  And it's a very good scheme in the city.  And the underlying technology is interesting.  The people who own, say, NFTs can't say this is bunk because the whole premise is they got to find somebody else who will pay more than they paid for it.  So they've got to promote it up. So it's kind of this ginned up propaganda. It's a bubble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I've moved my stuff, well I'm still in the process of moving it all up.  I'm trying to move it to something beyond Ethereum and all of that gas stuff.  Because there's other protocols out there that are a lot cheaper and people are still buying art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or what about this? I will sell you a print of my photo.  I do that too.  Signed and numbered.  That seems to be an honest, relatively honest transaction to me.  I do that too.  Yeah. Signed and numbered. And now you have it.  And maybe you don't have the provenance of this photo on your blockchain so you can't prove it's signed and numbered by Ant Pruitt.  But I don't think that's the end of the world. At least you have a photo you can put on your wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And the thing is, my audience or slash customers or what have you are the people that could care less about blockchain authenticity.  If it says it came from me, they're probably happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think honestly, if you're a big Dune fan, you might want to own this book and have it on your coffee table.  Awesome. Now for only a few hundred dollars, you can own a link to something.  You know what? I don't know. You own the right to resell the link.  Which is I think what this is all about.  Yeah. Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Again, it's a love-hate relationship for me because I do like the idea that artists can continue to have another revenue stream for their work.  But at the same time, it can cost that artist a lot of money and a lot of headache.  And then there's ways of getting ripped off with just people right clicking and downloading or the hack, as we saw on Crypto.com.  But art is stolen and pirated or what have you in regular life outside of the digital world.  So the risks are there either way you look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's true. What's cool is Saqib actually bought the physical book. He has the book now.  And it sounds awesome. It's got illustrations by H.R. Geiger and Mobius and Jean Giraud.  That's Jean Giraud. And so I mean, it's really this is a real...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who was bidding against him to get to that price?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. But I could say...  How did that process...  If you love these guys and you love doing this is historic and there's only 20 of them. So it has value. Yeah. I don't know.  Well, it has scarcity.  Scarcity. Christie's thought it'd be worth 40,000, not 2.0 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. So how did it get from there? I mean, I'm going to bid $5. I'm going to bid 2.6 million.  Is there another Dow?  Yeah, that's the thing.  I think everybody... What I love about this story is everybody's looking at it and saying, no, they can't be that stupid. No, they can't be.  And so either they are that stupid or it's a scam in the sort we don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think after reading the BuzzFeed story, I think it's a little bit misrepresented that they thought, oh, good, now we can make this movie.  I think they must have known better. But on the other hand, now they want to raise more money to make the movie.  But...  Anyway, I don't know. Look, if you want to throw your money away, go right ahead. There's worse things to do with your money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are also better things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there are much better things. You could buy some nanobooms.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's not an option.  You could annoy your husband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could tell your hers.  Let's take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, I do want to tell you about something that everybody... Now that we are in... What is this, year two?  Oh my God.  Unfortunately.  It soon will be year three, won't it?  If you have people going back to work, of course you want to have your huddle room well equipped for meetings.  You don't want to have to make people sit side by side.  You want to be able to have people socially distanced.  But this means your audio suffers, doesn't it?  No, it doesn't. Because Noreva solves this problem.  Normally, I mean, I think if you've ever set up a big audio conferencing room, especially the big ones, the larger ones, you realize how expensive it can be.  You've got to get... You've got to design it.  You've got to hire a team to install it, technicians to configure it, a dizzying array of mics, speakers, DSPs, and then there's the wires.  And it's just, you know, it's just crazy.  Your room will be offline for days and will have to be regularly calibrated.  Noreva is so much better.  They have something they've patented called the microphone mist technology.  All it takes is one or depending on the size of the room, one or two integrated microphone and speaker bars.  They fill the room with thousands of virtual microphones.  There's no dead zones.  Everyone in the room can be heard no matter which way they're facing.  It means people can talk and move naturally in the space.  They can socially distance.  You don't have to sterilize microphones or anything because it's all in this sound bar, which you, by the way, can mount.  You don't need some fancy guy coming in.  You can just hang it up on the wall yourself.  Noreva sound microphone mist technology continuously auto calibrates.  So your room is instantly and always ready with optimized audio.  You don't need an outside technician.  This installation is trivially easy.  You can do it yourself or, you know, you can get your handy guy to come in and do it.  It's a simple thing.  Management is simple, too.  You get a Noreva console.  So you have have multiple Noreva rooms.  You can monitor, manager, adjust the systems.  You don't even have to be on site.  So IT doesn't have to go from room to room.  They can do it all remotely if they need to.  So if look, this is the installation.  In fact, you should go to the website and find out all about it.  Noreva.com.  Noreva.com.  It's by the way, it's also an attractive solution.  It's kind of magic when people come into the conference room.  They'll say, where are the mics?  Where should I?  Where should I talk to?  Which way should I face?  Any way that you're comfortable because you're going to be clearly heard no matter where you are.  Ask yourself, do you want to go with that costly, crazy, complicated, traditional system  or make the leap to the simple and economical Noreva?  I think I know the answer.  N-U-R-E-V-A.  Noreva.com.  N-U-R-E-V-A.  Noreva.com.  What a great way.  What a great way to get that huddle room sounding good.  And you know I'm all about good sound.  Really important.  And who of us hasn't had a horrible experience with the phone in the middle of the table?  I mean it's just, you can do better.  Noreva.com.  Thank you Noreva for supporting our fine program.  We talked about, go ahead.  Oh I'm sorry, you're just saying woohoo.  I'm so used to Jeff saying line 29 that I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can I go back to the derps for one second?  Yes, the derps, Dow derps.  So the Dow derps, so there's a, because I happen to look at Twitter even though I'm not allowed to, I did.  There's a guy named Mike Dunford who's a lawyer who's trying to give them advice.  And one angle I had thought of here is the tax situation.  He says that you made an agreement to raise money under certain promises and that gives you all kinds of legal issues, that's one.  The other one that occurs to me is somebody now got a whole bunch of money and doesn't that somebody owe a whole bunch of money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  I guess so.  Christie's I guess and whoever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Buying and holding art is subject to different tax arrangements because it's considered a collectible.  Oh.  So collectibles, and don't ask me what the rules are because I don't remember, but collectibles they're different for inheritance taxes.  They're different when you buy it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, if you do go to forum.spicedow.xyz, you can read what they're proposing to do.  One of the things is to upload individual pages so that the ownership is democratized and then burn the books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Never burn anything that involves burning a book.  It is optional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is optional.  You don't have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's like taking a Gutenberg Bible, cutting it up into pieces, making Xeroxes of it and then burning it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here, by the way, is the it's both a meme and a bell curve.  The meme and bell curve of what people want to do.  Of course, on the thin ends of the bell curve, burn the book and burning achieves many goals at once.  In the middle, the fat wedge.  No, you cannot burn the book, which is our single asset.  But that's only 34%.  So it's definitely, you know, we got a ways to go.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you for that.  A one megabyte page would cost 177 M gas approximately, which at a cost of 100 GW EUI per gas results in 18 E per page.  Yeah, I'd bark too.  Thank you, Biscuit.  That's the gas fees are 18 E.  That's cray cray.  Oh, and the guy who wrote this is, of course, anonymous.  Pseudoanon XEE postdoc in a university now full time in crypto inventor of JPEG mining.  JPEG mining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I shouldn't.  Wow.  It's the wave of the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lucky students who don't have that person anymore.  How's your word score, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Get them fired up now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Block that word everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You got it in three.  I would have gotten in three, but I guessed the less obvious version of the word and I got it in five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should rather see you do user interface than this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, let's do user interface.  You said it, not me.  Let's see what else.  Oh, this is another one kind of like the other one.  An Austrian watchdog.  I think that would be pronounced watchdog.  How do you say watchdog?  That was that was Hunt.  Hunt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  An Austrian dog.  What's his dog?  Hunt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is Hunt?  So what's a watchhunt?  I don't know.  A Wiener Schnitzel.  An Austrian Wiener Schnitzel rules.  German companies use of Google Analytics.  Wachhunt.  A Wachhunt.  I'm watching your Hunt.  Is breaching GDPR because it sends data to the US.  Where the government might get it.  Thanks to Schrems II, which is the EU-US data sharing rule.  The Austrian data protection Wachhunt has ruled that you can't use Google Analytics because it sends data to the US.  It's getting ridiculous.  It's a violation of GDPR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is maturation of an industry, y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is what happens.  Do we still use Google Analytics?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I tried.  I tried really hard to convince management here not to use Google Analytics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She said not until you fix the bed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Management is going to come running in here again and start throwing things at you.  There's more than one person in management.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I tried to convince them that we should not have Google Analytics on our web page because who cares?  Like Mike Masnick, who got rid of it.  Yeah, that's when I tried.  I said, look, Mike did this and I think it's the right thing to do.  And no.  So now maybe we have to because we don't want to violate GDPR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're not in Europe.  What are they going to do, arrest you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, OK.  So that's a good point.  They'll find you.  But that's an interesting point.  Should I say if you're in Europe, you can't look at our site?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I was going to ask.  We have European listeners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that happened with a lot of news sites where they just like the Tribune, blocked Europe.  So you're worth nothing to us.  You're dead to us.  It makes sense for the Chicago Tribune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, given their...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we, I mean, when GDPR went in action a year ago, it's been a year now, we had this debate.  Well, wasn't it January?  No, GDPR went into effect May 18th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, good God, you know this?  19 or 20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's the rain woman.  This is beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Definitely in April.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I could be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me just double check that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, I take you as my...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In effect, I thought it was May 25th, 2018.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So May 25th, 2018.  So it'll be four years in a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's amazing.  Anyway, at that time we thought, well, what should we do?  And you know the shruggy guy?  Right.  Yeah.  That's what we decided to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, here, there's a new thing.  All of us shrug it.  Ant.  Ant can't shrug and take the screenshot or produce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's very hard to do.  He is really multitasking.  He's producing the show.  He's doing it.  There's the man behind the curtain.  So I don't...  That was good.  He turned into Stacy for a moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He just played the Stacy flailing arms.  He turned into Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Search engine land.  What happened, they say, when we turned off AMP?  AMP, of course, the Google technology we've gone back and forth over over the years.  Intended to speed up pages, but I think lately we've seen it.  I think lately we've realized maybe also intended to kind of centralize Google's control of the Internet.  Search engine land made the decision to stop publishing AMP versions, Google's accelerated mobile pages.  They said just, you know, we didn't want to have to put our content third party servers, et cetera.  So since then a lot has happened.  But bottom line is, according to search engine land, we've seen very little disruption in our traffic.  And now have a much clearer picture of our audience analytics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sometimes using that middle man, not great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I want to know.  How do they get a better vision?  Well, with AMP going on.  Everything comes off their servers instead of going through other servers.  Oh, it's just cash. Got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Got you.  Which does speed up things, but it also centralizes control in Google.  And at the time, Google said, oh, no, it's an open standard.  Anybody can run AMP servers and nobody else runs AMP.  Nobody's done it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Chat room does the shrug.  I love IRC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Shruggy.  Google kills YouTube originals.  Did you know that they had originals?  Sure you did.  Because Cobra Kai was awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The only one I knew was Cobra Kai.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What, Jeff?  Scare PewDiePie is gone? Oh, no.  Scare PewDiePie.  There was more than two.  But honestly, I think Google's probably right to shutter it.  Because anyway, according to Variety,  this YouTube originals division founded six years ago to make exclusive original content  for the pay-per-month YouTube premium service.  I do pay for that, but that's not because I want to see Cobra Kai.  It's because I don't want ads.  Now the group is being shuttered and YouTube's head of original content.  Suzanne Daniels has announced she's leaving in March.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that was the whole pitch at...  What's the conference I used to go to in Anaheim with all the video people?  VidCon.  Thank you, VidCon.  That was a big deal at VidCon.  Oh my God, the huge banners.  We're going to come in the new network and then, never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody else started doing original content too, so it didn't help them.  It was stiff competition out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Remember when Google had like $100 million that they were going to give creators?  They've done that a couple of times.  Creators Fund, TikTok does it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Instagram's starting to do it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I remember we were told, we had a big time entertainment attorney in here.  He said, you guys really ought to go after that Google money.  They could give you $10 million.  Here's from Robert.  Is it Kyncel?  We've had this conversation many times.  Kyncel.  Dear creator.  I think you know him.  Don't you, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I've met him.  I hate to think of Davos.  He's chief business officer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You mean it's a world economic forum?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those days are over, Stacey.  I'm just not on the need not to invite Liz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We got a Davos and a Gutenberg in this show.  I'm liking it.  And a few anecdotes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where's your bingo card?  Jarvis bingo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Today says, Robert, there are over 2 million creators in the YouTube Partner Program.  Our creator of community has never been more successful.  We've paid more than $30 billion to creators, artists and media companies.  Oh, probably more to the media companies than to the creators.  I'm guessing.  So they don't sue us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, things like license fees.  However, with rapid growth, this is going to be fun.  However, as soon as I see that in the memo, I'm going, oh, this should be interesting.  However, with rapid growth comes new opportunities.  And now our investments can make a greater impact on even more creators when applied to other initiatives like our creative shorts fund.  Is this for people who have new design ideas for shorts?  Underwear. Yeah.  Yeah.  Black voices fund.  That's good.  Live shopping programming.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Live shopping is a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Makes over the world.  Yeah.  But in the case of YouTube, what are you shopping for?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Makeup?  Let me see.  Slime?  Probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jewelry?  Do they have a live shopping channel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do they call it?  Brickerbrack?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Brickerbrack.  Oh, Shachkies.  Hummel figurines.  It's the Hummel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, my friend, a friend of mine used to do it in China because that's where this kind  of concept, I think, I don't know if it came from there, but I mean, QVC does it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's influencers, right?  Selling stuff that they, I would guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  YouTube.com slash shopping, it says, and there's nothing there.  Nothing but growth then, Leo.  Do you remember the beta store?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you remember the beta store?  They're doing shopping.  If you go to their website, they do live shopping now for like gadgets.  What's the beta store?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Beta store?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, the beta store, it was created by some of the founders of Nest and they had physical  stores where you could go in and touch like complicated products and play with them and  then buy them if you wanted to.  And it was more of a...  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was that like the come on, come in and touch complicated products?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, that's the Stacy real talk right there.  I like it.  And companies would pay, it was like a marketing expense for companies, not like a retail strategy  for them, if that makes sense.  Although they did sell a couple of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're shopping right now.  Here's the VAC One Coffee Air Brewer.  A complicated product to make a simple drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so they've pivoted to doing video shopping because of COVID.  You'll be buying one before the show is over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they got the right guy.  Look at that.  Oh, she's doing the universal sign for that's a chef's kiss.  Water should drop.  Yes, water should drop.  Oh my God.  We went to a fancy Michelin two-star restaurant a couple of months ago or maybe a month ago.  It was my birthday present from Lisa and they had the most elaborate Victorian era coffee  making machine I've ever seen.  It was like a show.  They have this vacuum tubes and these chambers and they pour water in there and then they  turn it upside down and it goes, siphons up into the thing and then you wait and then  you pull the thing and it siphons back down and now you have coffee and it tastes exactly  like a Maxwell house.  It was a fine cup.  And even the guy who's doing it, like the waiter's doing this, it's like 10 minute  process, he's doing this whole thing.  Even he says, yeah, it's just kind of for fun.  I think this might be the modern version of this VAC-1 coffee air brewer.  I think it's the same idea where it's using, yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, scroll down.  They have other products.  The Willow Toothbrush FAQ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I need this, the Navian Bedwarmer.  Now that I have a bed cooler.  I should really have a bedwarmer because you know, what goes...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How does that work?  Does it microwave your head?  Oh, it's exactly like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's exactly like that.  It's just a small version.  It's got a little water pumper, but it's good.  Instead of, this is exactly what the 8 Sleep looks like, but it just goes into a little  pillow instead of the old bed.  Here's something I could get.  The Hypnos anti-snoring sleep mask.  Sure, I'll be wearing that tonight.  And it's got an app.  If you want to look like the elephant man, you need the Hypnos.  What else we got?  Silken pure silk pillow case.  So this is it.  This is home shopping.  I don't know what happened to YouTube's home shopping.  It's funny that Robert Kinsel said, say, we're going to put more money into that one.  In fact, if you go to youtube.com slash shopping, nothing happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's why they're putting more money because there wasn't any before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nothing but growth, man.  Nothing but growth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.  I guess they did it for the holidays, I guess.  Holiday streaming shop.  But then they stopped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They'll be doing it for singles day, which is coming up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, look, the Morrell twins, Gordon Ramsay, who can't...  Donut Media, Patrick Starr, Jackie Aina, Manny Mua, MrBeast, the richest man on YouTube.  He is, by the way, according to Forbes, the richest man on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Out of North Cackalacki.  MrBeast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Renee said he and his other YouTube creator friends thought that that list was not exactly accurate.  But I think MrBeast makes a lot.  Anyway, Robert Kinsel, together these factors contributed to our decision to reduce our YouTube's original slate to nothing.  Going forward, we'll only be funding programs that are part of our Black Voices and YouTube Kids Fund.  We will honor our commitments for already contracted shows in progress, and creators who evolve with these shows should expect to hear from us in the coming days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The issue I have with some of that stuff, like you mentioned the Black Voices stuff, I looked at at least two different things on there, maybe three, and did nothing for me.  And I think that's why a lot of these things just sort of fall through the cracks, because sometimes the content just isn't good.  There's just too much competition out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's hard to do good content.  I think a lot of...  I mean, look at us.  I know. See what I'm saying?  I've been trying for 15 freaking years.  I think a lot of people, executives, people in LA, just say, oh, you throw money at it.  This is what YouTube learned.  You throw money at it, good content.  Magic. And it's not.  In fact, YouTube's real model is not so much throw money at it.  In fact, I don't think they believe that throwing money at it does anything.  They work for Netflix.  This is the difference.  YouTube's got a better model.  Act as if you're going to make a lot of money and attract, what is it, 500 hours a minute or upload it, something like that.  Attract a ton of stuff.  And we'll just let the crap float away and the gold will rise, or I guess gold sinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was like, both the crap and the gold should sink.  But sometimes the crap floats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The crap floats and the gold sinks, and then you dig up the gold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to get past the crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When you pan for gold, you slosh the water around and the silt comes off.  And what's left in the bottom of the pan, solid gold nuggets.  What if we let the cream float to the top?  The cream will rise.  And out of the 500 hours, 491 hours and 59 minutes will float down the river and be somebody else's problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They sink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The 491 sinks.  The other eight minutes is the cream of the crop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nine minutes close to the top where we see it in the recommendations.  They rise to the recommendations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what the number one viewed video on YouTube is?  It is the cream. This is the cream.  Oh man.  Do you know what it is?  Ten billion views.  Ten billion views.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you just gave it another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just gave it another.  Actually, this one's only got two billion.  Oh, this is a special World Children's Day pink phong.  But Baby Shark, the original Baby Shark, ten billion views.  How many people are there in the world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like seven point something billion.  So who are these extra three billion people?  Have you ever met a toddler?  Children, children.  Toddlers play this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't understand how any video could be viewed ten billion times and there are only seven billion people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are seven point nine billion people now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here it is.  I was wrong.  It's ten billion, forty five million, six hundred ninety six thousand and five hundred six views.  Unbelievable.  So where are all those extra people coming from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, before you ask what's on OAN, I just tweeted what was on OAN two minutes ago.  Oh really?  Are you watching OAN as we do the show?  It's on my TV.  I just want to see.  It's better than Baby Shark right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would watch it too.  I think it's better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They had the pillow guy on and then they had an ad for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You'll see it on my Twitter feed.  All right. On his Twitter feed.  Ladies and gentlemen, here is the free Trump gift for kids.  From Mike Huckabee.  The kids guide to President Trump.  First family.  Why did Donald Trump decide to run for president?  Drain the swamp.  What is mega?  That's great.  Good for them.  Oh look, there's a picture of Barron, the youngest Trump.  That's great.  Very fun.  And this was an ad like to buy this?  Yes. Yes.  It was Mike Huckabee pushing this.  That's the thing I think is most interesting is how all these people who hated him until he got nominated.  The Republican Party grift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought you were going to talk about how they're all making money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it is.  It's like A, I think they're scared of him.  But B, also it's a great opportunity to cash in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just like buying the Dune book.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm going to tell you all that at five o'clock I have to wander off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's wrap this up and get your pick of the week.  Stacey is back to suffer dementia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm giving you 30 minutes to get us time to get through change logs and other stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, did you forget to do a certain beloved feature of the show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think there's a change log in this rundown today.  Oh, wait a minute.  Oh, there was a whole blank white space and now there's a lot more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was like, we didn't talk about Google.  Oh, we talked about Canada jokes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's McDonald's eggs.  We talked about four.  Oh, this actually is a big story.  For the first time ever, a driver using Tesla's full self-driving is facing felony charges in a crash.  Actually, it isn't FSD.  It was the autopilot.  California prosecutors have filed two because this has been the question all along.  In fact, Lisa just asked me this other day, who's liable if I have an auto park thing?  I stand out there, press the button.  My car crashes into another car.  Who's liable?  Well, California prosecutors have solved that question.  They filed two manslaughter charges against the driver of a Tesla who ran a red light and killed two people in 2019 while using autopilot.  Now, I think that this isn't going to be the test case because at that time, in fact, I don't know if it even does now,  but at that time, autopilot didn't know about stop signs or red lights.  So I used it a lot in my Model X, but you know, when you come to a red light, you got to stop.  The car doesn't know that.  So I think maybe this is really is the guy's fault, not the autopilot's.  I don't think it is.  What?  Because he's responsible for his car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Andre Leon Talley, he just died.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You didn't know this?  Did that happen?  No.  When did this happen?  Who died?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Andre Leon Talley died.  Fashion icon.  What was it yesterday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Sorry, y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've apparently been under a rock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm under such a rock.  I don't know who he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was the amazing creative director of Vogue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did he invent the giant puffy jacket?  Kind of.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He just styled it.  Quite positively.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's just rocking it.  He's just rocking it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was Otto Wintour's right arm and then she dropped him and he ended life poor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Arguing over if he could live in a house funded by which fashion house?  It was crazy.  Anyway, the point is the man was a genius.  And anyway, sorry, totally not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just stay on it for a second, Stacey, because actually I worked at Cotty & Ast.  I know he was beloved.  What was his primary contribution to fashion?  What was his vision?  Apparently, he's a giant jacket.  Well, that's what he got me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He recognized, he, like Anna Wintour and possibly more than her, recognized designers and promoted  and styled and then styled the clothes for the fashion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He did Michelle Obama's clothes for many years in the White House.  He was brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just, I never saw the essence of Andrea Leontelli.  A lot of it's risk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Taking risk on these different artists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's because Anna Wintour took a lot of his...  Exactly.  But...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but yeah, that's what she does.  Anna used to have in her office, and I've sat in them, was fabled the most uncomfortable  possible chairs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here is Anna Wintour with Mr. Talley in 1989, before her hair went white.  That looks like a fun party, don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, her hair isn't white.  Is she wearing white hair now?  Doesn't she have, well, it's gray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or is it blonde?  Anyway, she's a...  No, it's dark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's an ash blonde or ash brown.  Ash brown.  Ash brown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah, there she is.  There they are in 2014 with her ash brown hair.  So that famous...  Is it a pixie cut?  The bob?  What has she got there?  That's a bob.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the Anna Wintour head.  It might as well be a Jennifer.  It's like, it's its own thing now.  Okay, I'm sorry.  I'm like, I have to leave, and then I sidetracked as Toshi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I didn't know you were so into design because I just went to the San Francisco Museum  of Arts, Patrick Kelly retrospective, and it was amazing.  I mean, he, another very famous black designer who passed away, far too young in his case,  but he made some amazing stuff.  And we saw this in San Francisco.  I didn't even know it was going to be there.  Oh, that's cool.  It was so cool to see this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is one of my favorite books right here.  What?  I'll show you.  How to Read a Dress.  Oh, I wish I'd read that first.  I loved, well, this is for women's fashion specifically, but it's just like, I love,  yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You would have loved this exhibit.  It was, it was amazing.  I would have.  I love all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm the person the Met is pandering to with all of their costumes and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of the things that's interesting about Kelly, first of all, he fled to France because  of course he couldn't, you know, get a fair hearing because he was black, but also in the  US, but also he collected racist memorabilia and turned it into his fashions in many cases,  which is pretty neat.  That's crazy.  He got a lot of heat for that.  You'll see effect in this picture.  He's wearing kind of a pin.  That's like a black Sambo pin.  And it was a way of saying, you know what?  Take it back.  Yeah, we're gonna take it back.  And I loved him.  And so did France.  In fact, here's one of his collections had Eiffel Tower hats.  They were so great.  So great.  So Stacey, I didn't, I don't know this other guy, Tally, but if you like Kelly, Tally wasn't  a designer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He just discovered people like Patrick Kelly, but come to San Francisco and see this.  It's an amazing show.  Okay.  I will highly recommend it.  Look at this.  Look at this lip hat with a lip suit.  It's not hysterical.  He had a great sense of humor.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What else before we get rid of Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Android 12 updates.  I just got one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you do your update?  Did it make your picture better?  I think it broke my Bluetooth.  Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think I'm having better performance.  Good.  Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A happier hands?  I could not connect my freaking headsets and get them to work for like.  Okay, I got a tip.  The last two or three days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got a big tip and I did this on Windows Weekly because both Paul and Mary Jo use Pixel  6 Pros.  The new January, the January update did come out and it's supposed to fix all these problems.  But, and I found this on Reddit, there is a trick, at least with ambient lighting and  I suspect with maybe fingerprint and other things, you almost need to do a reset of the  phone and there is a reset hidden in the weirdest place ever.  So I'm going to follow along over my shoulder if you would, John.  Can you pick up my, over the shoulder?  He has to push some buttons and make it work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was all ready for the changelog and then you changed the button off.  This is the changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is my Pixel 6, by the way.  I think Andy and Aka recommended this case.  I like, or was it you, Ant?  Maybe it's you.  It's the Spygun.  Okay, nice case.  Anyway, so go into settings.  All of you who have a Pixel 6, follow along here.  Because you'll never believe where you find this setting.  Go to apps.  Apps?  Apps.  Hold on.  See all apps.  And this is because the only way you can get to this particular app, device health services,  is through the apps settings.  So this is, remember when Google decided to move updates into the store in many cases  because companies weren't passing along their updates.  This is one of the places where you have to do this.  Device health services.  Storage and cash.  Manage space.  Holy cow, does this have anything to do with that?  No.  Reset adaptive brightness.  If you've been having trouble with adaptive brightness, do that.  And then, I think this actually is the one you want.  Which is clear all data for device health services.  Including battery statistics, adaptive brightness data.  I think that after you do the January update, you should do this.  Because you have a lot of old cached data.  Removing that, I think fixes a lot of things.  The other advice that I strongly suggest if you've had trouble with the fingerprint reader,  is deregister your fingerprints and re-register them after you get the January update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You mentioned something a while ago.  There came a point with my phone where suddenly I'm at home.  I have to hit the power button before I can use the fingerprint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think this fixes that. I haven't had that happen in a while.  But again, I'm just going to run through this real quickly because I know it's weird.  We'll put this in the show notes.  And I don't know, Jason is out, so I don't know if they talked about this yesterday and all about Android.  But again, settings, apps.  Just because you have to get to this weird device health app.  See all, and then device health.  And this is a weird trick.  Because I didn't even remember.  Okay, now I have to go to storage and cache, which makes no sense.  Manage space.  And then that's where you get these settings to reset adaptive brightness and clear all data.  And I suspect that that's what's going on.  That there's cached bad stuff from the old days.  Because this seems to help.  I have one meg of it.  Yeah.  I only have four kilobytes after clearing it.  And if your fingerprints are still not working, re-register those.  So that's your Google change log.  Oh, jeez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good stuff.  I fell asleep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually pulled this for you.  We do have to do an ad and then picks and then we'll go.  But I do want to just read this, Jeff.  How Campbell's Soup turned New Jersey into a tomato growing state.  I wonder how this ended up here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to tell you something in a second.  But go ahead and explain why that's here.  It's from the Smithsonian Magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I had no idea.  You know, they call New Jersey the garden state.  My family was in Leonia just over the bridge.  So it's kind of still metro sprawl.  But you're in a very nice part of New Jersey.  And as you go south, it gets beautiful.  It really is beautiful.  It's beautiful west too, where I am.  But it turns out it's a perfect growing area for tomatoes.  The soil, especially, by the way, the inner coastal plain, which is.  You scroll down just a little bit in that photo.  This one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, the people, the meeting on the farm.  Maybe it's up now.  No, that one.  There it is.  I lived in Cinnamonson.  I didn't live in Cinnamonson.  I lived like there.  I lived on the old tomato fields for Campbell's Soup.  You lived in tomato fields?  I lived on the old tomato fields.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So because of the perfect soil for this, particularly in the inner  coastal area, loamy soil, the very famous tomatoes were bred by  Campbell's Soup, the Rutgers tomato, which is now gone, by the way,  although Rutgers is trying to bring it back because a few seeds remain  in the Campbell's archives.  The Rutgers tomato, they stopped selling it or using it, even though  it was perfectly uniform and everything, the skin was thin, so they  wanted a thicker skin.  But anyway, it was a great article by the founder of the Library Seed  Bank.  He's a seed activist, Jeff Quattrone, and he talks about the Garden State  tomato, the Rutgers tomato, and most importantly, the JTD.  If you like Campbell's Tomato Soup, it's because of the JTD, which is  actually named after the CEO of Campbell's.  He was a Densmore or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I forget what his name is.  John something.  So did you read the article?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John Thompson-Thorens.  That's it.  Thank you.  He was the president of the company, the JTD tomato, released in 1918.  Bread there in Cinnamonston.  It's a medium sized red tomato.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  C-I-N-N-A-M-I-N-S-O-N.  You learned how to spell that early.  So is that where you were born?  No, I went there from second to seventh grade.  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had no idea.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now we're going to take a quick break and then it's a Picks of the Week and  then Stacey is going to go somewhere and do something we only wish we could  follow along.  Maybe make cookies, maybe have dinner.  I don't know.  This episode of Twig is brought to you by brand new sponsor.  Welcome CDW HPE GreenLake orchestrated by the experts at CDW.

But still, to this day, many workloads remain on-prem.  You've got complicated legacy applications.  There's also the issue we've talked about this, we just did, about data  sovereignty, compliance issues, or maybe just you're afraid it's a serious  thing to migrate sensitive data to the cloud.

Now, usually I start with Stacey Ann with Ann.  Let's reverse it.  Ann, what's your pick of the week this week?  Let me make sure I'm off of mute.  I took you off guard, dear.  Sorry.  I didn't expect that.  He thought he had a few minutes.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did.  Well, my pick is Canon again.  You know, they've been dealing with some stuff in this photography industry, but  today they announced a new camera body and it's the EOS R5C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The R5 is mind boggling, but this is a new R5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a new R5 with cinema capabilities and it sits right in between the R5 and the  C70.  So you're going to get cinema capability up to 8K.  It even has an internal fan on it.  You can record up to 8K raw internally.  This looks like a beast of a camera and I believe it's going to start you at about  I'm curious about the current R5 owners because this still allows you to shoot stills in addition  to having all of that extra video horsepower.  And it's what?  48 megapixels?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  40 megapixels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  So I'm wondering what my R5 fans are thinking right about now.  Well, it'll use those lenses, yes.  Right.  Yeah.  I don't know.  That body is sitting right in between this one and the C70.  The C70 is a dedicated video cinema camera.  Which is like the best of both worlds, right?  You get both in effect, I would guess.  Right.  Yeah, that was this morning and I think it's a pretty good price and hopefully I'll be  able to get my hands on one to test it out soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  8K raw, 422, 4K, 120p.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  120p and you still get the audio for the slow motion.  It doesn't totally warp it out.  Pretty good features built in here.  No ND filters.  The in-body stabilization has a 1.4 crop on it.  But again, all of that stuff can be worked around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When I got Henry an R6, because he needed a set, I wish this had been out, but the R6  was less expensive.  But even it has very good video capabilities.  R6 is great.  Yeah.  He has all my old Canon EF lenses.  So he just, like I said, we'll get an adapter and the lens will work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep.  Saved a lot of money, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So he has my old Mark IV, 5D Mark IV, and now he has the R5.  And I bet you if all things go well, did you see Chrissy Teigen retweeted his reel the  other day?  Yeah.  Oh, good for him.  Apparently he's been going back and forth with Chrissy Teigen.  They want to do a cooking show together or something.  But anyway, if all that pans out, maybe he should get an R5C.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This would definitely work with that.  I'm not lying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Shout out to salt underscore Hank for real.  He's doing great.  I really enjoyed the salt that we got here at the house.  It's good salt, isn't it?  The pesto one.  The pesto one is really good.  I'm a fan of the garlic truffle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just had that on an avocado toast.  It was so good.  So good.  SaltHank.com.  And AntPruitt is of course, Ant underscore Pruitt on Instagram.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Give me a follow over there.  I'm still putting stuff on Instagram and still interacting with people there.  I tell the people that watch my show and listen to my show to just follow me over there and interact with me there.  And I do my very best to follow up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When you took this profile photo, were you thinking, like you're looking at the camera, were you thinking, I love you, man?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's my normal happy face.  I can't read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's all.  And so it's like the Mona Lisa that follows you around.  I can't decide.  Is it, I love you, man, or I'm going to rip your heart out through your lungs.  Or I don't know.  I can't tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a damn good poker player.  It's poker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what it is.  Are you?  I bet you are.  I am a damn good poker player.  See, I see the smile here.  There it's like, I can't read him.  What's he thinking?  See, have a royal flush.  I don't know.  Maybe.  Number of the week, Mr. Jeff Jarvis.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is the ultimate me.  I said, no, it makes Stacy happy for me to bring up this word Gutenberg.  Two hundred thousand dollars.  Two hundred thousand dollars.  This makes you go to this page.  Go to that page.  All right.  So this is a fragment, discovered fragment of the Donatas, which was a grammar book that Gutenberg, it is believed.  You don't know anything printed before the Bible.  And there's very few examples of this.  And they're all just pieces that were used in later bindings.  So this is this is a fourteen ninety book.  And this this book guy, Patrick Olson, is representing this thing.  And if you go, you can actually open it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  So the book is not what you're thinking of.  It's go to, oh, it's column one, column one, row two.  So you don't care about the book.  It's the thing they made this book out of.  Exactly.  So go to that one.  See what's right there in the set.  That's the Donatas.  That is the Donatas.  It's the sliver of the Donatas.  And the great thing is it's a wonderfully written explanation of why they know this and how.  But it's two hundred thousand dollars, has a price on it.  And as of yesterday, it had a put in cart button.  And I have to admit that I did it for just two seconds.  Oh, yeah.  I want to have the sense that for one second I had this in my in my cart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they reused this old book to make this newer book.  But this old book has been identified as being a very early Gutenberg.  It was a kid's grammar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a school grammar book, a Latin grammar book.  So they weren't meant to be saved.  Right.  So if you go to that first photo right there, that's the outside of the body.  And you see those little letters right there?  Yeah.  Those are little tiny bits left of Gutenberg's Donatas.  Yeah.  So I was I know this has nothing to do with Google.  I think you should buy this as an NFT and burn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to say I could then burn it.  Yeah. Yeah. Who needs it?  Just make an NFT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  If you want it, go on over to Olsen Rare Books dot com and Peacemaker will be glad to burn it for you.  And now, ladies and gentlemen, Stacey Higginbotham's Pick of the Week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, y'all.  This Pick of the Week is a little crazy.  Let's see if we can get Leo to buy it.  It's not as crazy as mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got a crazier one.  But go ahead.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mine is the oven that I actually bought in November, but it arrived and I've gotten to play with it.  Is it from June?  And I am so excited.  No.  No.  This is a slide in range and induction smart range and oven from GE Cafe.  And the reason I'm talking about it is because it's the first appliance that I've actually like big appliance that I've connected to Wi-Fi because it's freaking awesome if you connect it to Wi-Fi.  So I love the idea of an induction oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We want to get induction cooktops.  We actually have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is an induction cooktop.  It is an electric oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I get it.  It's a stove as well as an oven.  Yeah.  We love induction.  Yeah.  Do you love it?  Is it good for catch your baby?  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, actually no.  My corns when I do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is a regular oven, but it's Wi-Fi enabled.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it is the first thing I've ever put on Wi-Fi.  And the reason is it talks to both Madame A and Google.  So I can tell Google to preheat my oven.  Yeah.  I love that.  And I can ask like how much time is left on the timer if I set it from the oven.  But GE has also been very active in updating things.  They actually prior to Thanksgiving did an update to these, to many of its ovens, not  all of it, but any of those that were capable of it.  They did the turkey update that did a cook program for turkeys.  So you just put the probe in the oven and said you were cooking the turkey.  And it was like, boom, I'm on it.  Don't worry about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got this.  It's got an air fryer mode.  Yes.  It's got, even though it looks like a standard stove, it looks like it has two.  It's got, what do they call that?  The Dutch oven?  It's got a Dutch oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, this one's the one here.  Mine is, which one are you looking at?  Yours isn't the Dutch oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was looking at a video that had a Dutch oven.  Mine is not the Dutch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Mine is the, cause I already have the June is my, I don't need two separate little tiny  ovens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I need a big oven.  This is not cheap though.  It's four grand for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  Well, induction ovens are expensive.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's my oven right there.  I'm going to get an induction cooktop.  I'm really, it's been a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this gets into the next thing and in like two weeks I'm going to have a new thing related  to it, but I'll just sneak peek it.  This works with the Heston Q smart pants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have Heston Q smart pants.  Pants?  Pants.  My pants are smart.  Pants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So because I have to buy new pants for the induction cooktop, I was like-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Hestons work with induction.  In fact, they come with a little induction, little burner.  Well, I don't need that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're integrated with GE.  Nice.  So I will talk about-  Oh, that's cool.  Oh wait.  So the pan, we'll hear about it in two weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a smart pan.  So the pan recognizes information coming from the app or in this case with GE and the integration,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the oven.  So it will, it also sensors in it to detect how warm the pan is.  So it will, there's a couple of things you can do with that.  You can keep your pan at exactly the right temperature, which allows you to sous vide  in it if you would like.  It also allows you to do things like melt chocolate and delicate kind of heating things  that normally you have to babysit as a cook.  The other thing it's going to do is you can tie it to some of the recipes and it will  follow some of the recipes.  It's not a thermomix, but it's still going to be pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, I have, Alex Lindsay talked me into getting these.  I have a couple of Heston Qs and it comes with its little induction unit.  But if you had a stove that was Stacy's call for empathy there, not a thermomix like Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  has one.  I have some more.  I just spent $3,700 on a range, but I'm going to complain about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When does it come?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is, it came.  No, I bought it in November.  It came.  You have it.  Okay.  I like set it up.  That's why it's my thing.  Did you have a nice stove you got rid of?  No, I had a failing Bosch and I was just like, so that oven, it was horrible y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We had a Bosch dishwasher we got rid of because it was just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I like my Bosch dishwasher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this one, all the circuit boards fried, all of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would be a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a little too computery.  Hey, I got one for you, Stacy.  This will go very well with your cocktail party later.  This is, you know, you know about Shazam, right?  Which identifies music.  This is Cheez-Am, which identifies French cheese.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it based on smells?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you have to take a picture of the cheese and then drag it to the dot here.  Cheez-Am is the brainchild of a few data scientists at a company called Prevision.io.  For lunch a few months ago, a debate took place as to which type of cheese we are served  on a dessert tray.  Yes, things get pretty wild at lunches outside of our Paris, France office.  Just imagine what these folks are like on the weekend.  From that lunch, an idea was born.  Can machine learning be used to identify a type of cheese?  Now, I have to say, Cheez-Am, which is by the way, literally trained, but was trained  on a data set of French cheeses only.  So don't expect us to work on your cheddar, your Edam.  Your Vermont.  Brouillere, not your Edam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Brouillere, Compte, Rochefort, Le Brie, Le Camembert, that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can only predict the type of cheese, but I don't know.  I guess it's good.  Have you tried it?  No, I haven't tried it.  Are you kidding?  I just thought, wow, that's French right there.  Cheez-Am, Cheez-Am, it detects French cheese.  There's even an API if you'd like to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was a startup who actually used molecular chemistry.  Oh, yes.  Smells it.  It smelled it.  This was a startup I saw present probably four years ago at a food tech conference.  I was like, it was also a French person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gotta respect that passion.  Yes, it has a big nose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It makes it easier to smell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's be passionate about cheese.  Oh, God, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why wouldn't you?  Why wouldn't you?  It's the best.  By the way, you will like this, Stacey.  If you do use it for cheese recognition, it will also recommend wine pairings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  With all this cheese that makes us thirsty announcing the newest features of Cheez-Am,  wine pairings with direct purchasing enabled.  All right, Stacey gets to go now.  Thank you.
