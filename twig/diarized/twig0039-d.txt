Joining us right now from his home where he's been very assiduously watching the  Facebook Developer Conference keynote by Mark Zuckerberg, we've got Kevin Marks from BT  British Telecom and Ribbit.com.  Hi, Kevin.  Hi there.  Nice to see you all again.  Thanks for joining us on short notice.  I really wanted to get your thoughts on Facebook's announcements.  Also here with us, for the first time we're doing a live show now on Wednesdays and for  the first time from his office at, are you at City University?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I have all those lights that every 10 minutes takes time to die and just happened.  I love those.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis of BuzzMachine.com.  Glad to have you, Kevin.  Of course, from New York City also, just down the road a piece.  We should have gotten you two together.  Gina Tripani, she's at Fast Company today.  Hello.  Yes.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  She does.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Show us the view.  Yeah, here it is.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Let's see.  Oh, isn't that great?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That is really kind of gorgeous.  Yeah.  Pretty good.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  29th floor, World Trade Center 7.  Thanks to Fast Company for hosting me.  Their conference is actually today as well.  Oh, good.  We'll talk about that as well.  Yeah, I was at that earlier.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Gina is of course a blogger at SmarterWear.org.  Her blog, she was one of the founders of Lifehacker, still writes there.  The new book is the Complete Guide to Google Wave at CompleteWaveGuide.com.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Indeed.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And she's at FastCompany.com.  She's very serious.  We're getting together for weekdays.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's a lot more serious than Saturday.  Should I get dressed up?  Should I be in a suit?  I've got to be in an office.  I've got to be up on my stories.  Okay, get silly.  Get silly.  I have colleagues walking by in the hall because it's a glass wall and I've got my laptop up  on a box so that I have it at eye level and my headset on.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I do too.  I should do that.  My months you love.  I've got my laptop up on a stack of Fast Company.  High is good.  High is good.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  The first thing you learn in television is you always shoot from a distance.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You always shoot from a distance.  You always shoot from a distance.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You always shoot from a distance.  The first thing you learn in television is you always shoot from up down, not down up.  My space angle is really good.  There you go.  My space.  Now pose.  So you're looking up so you don't have double chin.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  I hold this over my head.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Exactly.  Just like that.  Then of course if you're like a professional news anchor you'll have an eye light which  gets rid of all the bags because there's no wrinkles or anything because everything is  so brightly lit.  So Kevin, you were watching Mark Zuckerberg speak today at the Facebook Developers Conference.  I didn't realize they were streaming it.  That's very handy.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  It seems to be the trend now.  I did last week with Chirp as well.  It can actually sit in your office because if it's the keynote thing you don't get a  lot from being in the room.  You can't talk to them.  But you can watch the stream and it's actually easy to track it and you've got Wi-Fi on a  comfortable sofa.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I'm even more meta because I track it by tracking your tweets.  That's how I...  I didn't even know you weren't there.  I just...  I'm watching your tweet.  So did Mark announce anything of great interest?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Oh, there's a bunch of interesting stuff.  So let's see if I can get them all in the right order.  So they announced what they're calling the Open Graph.  And basically this is...  They've changed their API so that you can get access to any information Facebook has  with a straightforward REST API.  They've made it such that any website can become effectively a Facebook fan page by  adding metadata to the site and then connecting to that.  And then the other thing they've added is they've...  Instead of having connect, they've taken away the name Facebook Connect and they've now  got the idea that rather like we did with Google Friend Connect 18 months ago, two years  ago even, you add a little bit of iframe to your page and that connects to Facebook  and then shows you information from Facebook about the page it's on.  But because it's Facebook, you don't have to log in because they assume there's only  one possible source of information in the world and that's Facebook.  So unlike Google One where you had to log in through Google or Yahoo or Facebook or  whatever, this one is like, no, you're logging into Facebook.  So there's a little iframe on the page that shows you if your friends have visited that  page and liked it or other information about the page that Facebook has about it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is it a one-way street or is it also...  Is that potentially a way for, I think it is for Facebook to gather information about  you and your friends?  Oh, very much so.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  The point is that you have a little like button everywhere on the web.  If you click that, then it posts a Kevin likes twig thing to your Facebook feed.  The other thing they said was rather than...  They're also changing the way the profiles work.  So before the assumption was that you would fill in your profile once and you would say  what your favorite movies were and your favorite records and all that stuff.  Records?  Records, what are those?  Your favorite music?  Classic.  Your favorite music feed combos.  Do you remember records?  I still have some in the gallery somewhere.  So you can...  Before you used to have to type this in as part of your profile creation and then they  got stale and sat there forever.  So the idea now is that these likes will be a dynamic part of your profile.  So when I like twig, twig will show up in my Facebook profile by my clicking on the  twig page.  That's actually quite a nice, clever idea.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But that's an explicit action.  It's not going to be just doing it just because I go to Sally's...  You'll have to push the button, right?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  You'll have to push the button, but they will know that you visited that page.  That's what's creepy.  Because they know the iframe.  And so that was the thing we did differently with Friend Connect was you had to log in  before we captured any data about you.  Whereas if you were previously logged into Facebook, you were logged into that iframe.  So just by visiting the page, Facebook will know you've been there and it'll show you  information about that page.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Hold on, Kevin.  Let me make sure I got this straight.  So if any site on the web puts up that iframe, then Facebook will know that I visited that  site so long as I'm logged into Facebook.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, if you haven't logged out of your Facebook...  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I mean, it's...

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Yeah, really.  It's the same kind of thing that the ad servers do, right?  The ad servers have a cookie on you and they serve a page...  Right, but they never publish that information.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There's a chance that Facebook will publish that information.  And if I don't set my defaults right and blah, blah, blah...  That's a good point.  There was a great post about a week ago that said that setting privacy defaults is the  new programming in your VCR.  Right.  That's the point that you made, Kevin, that it's too complex, thus we don't do it, thus  the default matters.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  When they changed this default, just as a proof of concept on Twitter, I called my mom,  who's on Facebook, and I asked her if she knew about the privacy settings and it confused  her.  She had no idea what we were talking about, nor the fact that because she never set privacy  settings, her privacy had now at this point defaulted to none, to public basically.  Right.  I wonder what percentage of Facebook users never set privacy defaults to change privacy  defaults.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  They're doing a little dance here about what's public and what's private.  What they have is they're trying to make more stuff public so it can be shared.  They're trying to do that, but at the same time, this data that they have, you can only  really get access to this so-called open graph API if you actually authenticate against it  as a developer so they can shut off your access again.  There's a sort of back and forth.  Basically, they're getting this set of data, but I think they're designing in such a way  that, say, Google can't index it.  So the likes page is a JSON structure.  You have to have auth to see my likes.  You can see by the graph.facebook.com slash Kevin Marks metadata about me, but that's  just the minimal metadata.  If you actually want to get richer stuff, then you have to authenticate against it,  which is mostly a good thing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So the site also learns data about me?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Can it share it?  You have to log in to do that.  I understand that, but if I go to Kevin Marks's bazaar, you're using all this, I'm logged in.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Do you get data about who visits your site?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  If you're correct, right?  I don't get that directly.  I have to log in, as you would do now with Connect.  So Facebook gets the data.  But you get personally identifiable information about your readers.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yes, you can do that.  So long as those conditions are set.  Yes, if they log in.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  In the same way that you can now with Facebook Connect.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And that's not an explicit action per site for me, the reader?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  No, you have to make a specific action to give it to that site.  I do.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  All right.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  So there is an isolation.  So there's the iframe that has the Facebook stuff in and there's the outer site.  And to jump back across that boundary, you have to give permission.  So again, it's very similar to the way Friend Connect works.  So that was the thing that when we designed Friend Connect, there was a separation between the two so that the site wouldn't get stuff unless you made an action there.  But in this case, it is rooting off to Facebook servers.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  My concern is that this stuff is so complicated and difficult to understand what data is going where and who's getting what about me.  I mean, if I can't understand this or I have to make an extreme effort to understand this, no normal person is going to understand this.  It seems to me Facebook is moving a little faster than the public can keep up with.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  I think people, you know, what you'll see is you go to the page and you'll see Gina and Jeff like this page and you'll see their faces by it.  And you go, oh, okay, that's interesting.  And then you can like it too.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I understand the public facing stuff.  What I'm worried about is what's actually going on behind the scenes.  It's all that stuff going.  There's a conversation going on between sites I visit and Facebook now.  And I don't really know what's going on.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, somehow I'm a lot more comfortable with like an ad company associating my IP address across two sites that I visited, you know, through cookies.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right, because Facebook knows so much more about you.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Facebook has so much more information about me personally and how I interact with my friends and my name.  You know, ad companies don't have that, even though they sort of tackle it.  You know what they're after, Gina, right? They're after targeting the ad and then they're kind of done.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So, Kevin, so you're saying so if I wanted to so so say I integrate this on my site in order for me to get the information about the visitors to my site, I will have had to create an app that authenticates and that the user would have to also grant access to in order for me to get that information as the site publisher, as the external site publisher.  No, yes, yes, we would.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  You would have to get them to you can get the likes to hit the like button, then you could go and get that feedback from from Facebook because you can query against your domain.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not so worried about the publisher like okay you go to twit.tv press like if if you've logged into twit.tv then I can get some information.  Yes, but I'm much more concerned about the fact that the more people put every every site I go visit now that has a like button if I haven't logged out of my Facebook account, Facebook is aggregating information about me.  About my travels.  That's a huge amount of information about my travels.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I don't really have I'm not even opting into that particularly because I forgot that I logged into Facebook and didn't log out.  I mean I think maybe the lesson here is you should log out of Facebook every time right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I was gonna say when's there gonna be an app that sandboxes the tab that you're logged in with Facebook and keeps other sites from seeing it.  Yeah, that's interesting.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Legal reasons too, Gina. You're right.  It's it's it's it's a discoverable thing.  Right.  You know how long is Facebook going to hold on to this?  What do they know versus the ISP?  I could be using a library machine somewhere but now my identity can be set and tied to me.  I'm Mr. Publicness and I'm fine with that but yeah I think you're right Leo.  This is this is potentially way too complicated to understand the implications.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This open graph that Facebook's talking about really is is more like your life is an open book.  To Facebook.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Yes.  I'm I'm you know I'm slightly grumpy about them calling it open graph.  I think that's that's slightly abusing the term open.  But we go back and forth in these debates at the time because basically it's a graph that a set of data that is stored on Facebook servers that third parties have access to that you can update.  So it's not it's not open in the sense of distributed.  It's it's it's centralized and available from Facebook.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's open in the sense of your your underwear drawer.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think this is really interesting.  I think and by the way I have to say I'm a little bit colored because I've talked to people who think that Mark Zuckerberg is the devil incarnate.  And and then there's people who think Mark is just a nice young guy who's trying to figure it out like we all are.  But I keep seeing Facebook make moves that it's kind of like Apple where you can interpret it from their point of view as as positive for their business.  And I think you put it for the users point of view is good for you.  That's good for you. You put a like button on your website and you know what people like.  Oh isn't that nice. And I'm building a so you know he put up a social graph that says I am friends with Chris Cox.  I live in Palo Alto. I eat a lot of fried chicken.  What could be wrong with that.  But there's there's kind of this dark side to it that nobody Facebook doesn't seem to acknowledge.  And but they I which I I don't know I think they're very aware of.  I think in a way it feels like they're doing something a little covert here.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Well I'm not sure. It's slightly covert in that you know so somebody described it as being like Beacon.  Beacon was like the first iteration of this which was purely focused on commercial.  This is trying to do that again but actually provide some value to you.  So the value to you is the kind of thing that Jeff and I have talked about before of when you're browsing the newspapers seeing your friends faces on the on the stories they've read.  That's actually quite helpful and useful.  And getting people to sign in to do that was it was a bit of effort to do.  I'm getting them to choose which of six sign ins to use was it was even more.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now we got Facebook Connect. Just use Facebook.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  The other half of this is it's a pushback against the anyway stuff that Twitter was launching last week.  Right. Say OK you know we're the one true source of knowledge on the Internet.  Twitter isn't. And you don't even need to click a button to log in with us.  We just we've already got you logged in. Look here's the information.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  My concern is that this is something that even a web adept finds complex and difficult to understand and a normal person is not going to understand at all what's going on.  And Facebook I think is playing on the fact that this is kind of difficult.  So that you can easily sell it as well.  It just means you don't have to log into a site.  You got a friend connect Facebook Connect. It's easy.  You've got the light and it's easy.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  What could be making it easy to use their busy in the background collecting data because no one else you know no one you know understands how to opt out or opt in or you know what's going on in the background.  I mean it doesn't seem like they're doing a lot in the background you know without because it's easier.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well it's just bugs that they're using all these nice open web APIs for seemingly malign data gathering techniques.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What is the benefit to the consumer or to the user.  What's the sell on that of why this is good for me.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  So what's good for you is that when you browse the web you can see the stuff your friends like you can see their comments on it from the activity streams.  You can get recommendations of other stuff to look at based on that.  So they're doing the sort of graph analysis stuff that you know lots of people are doing but bringing that out to the to the rest of the web.  So you know that's a valuable thing.  I did the friend connect demos of that last year and we were playing with that stuff and if you can get people to log into it that works quite nicely being able to.  If you have a site that has a lot of separate pages a newspaper site is a great example.  Knowing which stories your friends read is really useful which ones they recommend and correlated by that.  So they're doing that stuff and doing that fairly nicely.  But the challenge is they're doing it in a way that is assumes that you want to be logged into it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But then Brett Taylor comes up on stage and says something that sent a chill a little bit of a chill down my spine.  He said a user should be able to show up and never having visited the site before have the site personalized for them based on their social preferences.  Yes. Holy grail.  Now you know some users are going to go hey that's great.  The New York Times knows that I'm interested in stories about this this and this.  And I've never been here before. Isn't that wonderful.  But in my mind I start it starts to I start to think about well wait a minute what's what's what's the process that made that possible.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Wouldn't Google love to do that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah I mean so you go to the New York Times.  First of all I think there's a lot of value and go to a web page and seeing your friends faces on it and names that they've been here and they liked it.  There's I agree with Kevin.  There's a lot of value in that.  So I go to the New York Times and I can see all the articles that my friends have posted to their Facebook walls in the past.  You know I have a friend of mine who always you know he's like my he's my New York Times editor.  He picks out all the good articles that I would care about and I see them on his wall.  So I would see them on New York Times.  There's a lot of value to that but it's also a little freaky as well.  I mean I think people will see that and be like oh hmm.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's also social pressure to use this.  So as a site as a content creator there's a huge amount of pressure on me to put a like button on everything.  I've been co-opted by this.  To put Facebook's like button on it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yes.  New York Times has times people which no one uses but that's they try to build this on the time site.  So this makes I mean the fight here is not only who owns your identity right who has the identity online.  And then also now who has this relationship machine and media companies and retailers and so on hate somebody.  This intermediating the relationship but that's exactly what Facebook is doing under the guise of saying no no no no no we're improving the relationship here.  But but Facebook owns that data.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know why but it doesn't bother me when Google does it for some reason.  Well I mean look at Buzz.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean Buzz used relationships across several networks.  But look at the heat they got because it was very easy for people to see oh you're exposing my contact list.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean that was very easy for people to see.  What Facebook's doing is much deeper much more profound and potentially much more risky for privacy.  And yet it's so obscure you know Google's mistake was having that page pop up saying here's your friends.  Facebook's not going to do that.  They're going to keep it all.  They're going to keep their cards closed.  Well there was something on Facebook.  I mean the other day they did improve the permission stuff this time around.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  So at the moment when you sign in you have to do sign in a Facebook connect you have to go through a whole bunch of permissions dialogs.  And they've unified that and made that clearer.  They've cleaned up the API so that the this new API is the same thing you use whether you're developing an app on their site or you're developing it on Facebook.  Developing an app on their site or you're developing it remotely.  So they don't they actually look at the API clean up.  They're done is rather nice and the permissions are more granular now.  So when you sign into the site we sign with an app it will say I want to see your photographs and this and this and this.  It doesn't just give you a whole bunch of them by default.  So that that's that in theory that should be better.  I haven't actually explored that yet but that that sounds like an improvement over the what you have to do at the moment.  So there's you know they seem to be thinking some of this stuff through quite nicely but the other bits of it sort of annoying me a bit.  The other thing they've done is they've done the the bit that I was getting grumpy about was the the way they want you to mark up their page.  They basically say you can add metadata to your web page and then we can make sense of your page and put it into Facebook.  But it's their own namespace in meta tags in the head.  It's not it's not using microformats for each card or you know rail friend links or anything that already exists.  They basically made up their own thing and said put this extra stuff there as well so that they're trying to get you to explicitly remark up your web in their language so that they can make sense of it and not reuse the stuff that everyone else is using.  So that sucks that you know other people will be able to pass that markup too.  But the other thing that Zuckerberg kept saying which was really you know which is why my tweets really grumpy about it was he was saying the web is linked together.  But what we need is social connections between people on the web and that's what we want to add to the web because the web doesn't have this.  It was like OK I know you're selling this but Jesus Christ I haven't been paying attention.  That is the web.  The web the links on the you know wouldn't it be great if you could link things together.  I said well we can link together.  They're called links.  They've been in the web for 20 years.  That's actually what the web is.  The web is made of links.  They want the links to exist on their site on their service.  That's the key.  We want to own the web.  To me this is.  A graph belongs to them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is to me what seems to be happening is and you know it's scary because Facebook has so much 400 million users has so much power 400 million many of whom are not sophisticated in the least.  It seems to be a huge power grab.  Now it's interesting because it may stimulate kind of a backlash.  Rick Boucher who's a Democrat from Virginia is talking about legislation.  He has been for a while in Congress that would allow basically would would require opt in for the privacy rules for.  And you know and Google by the way says we don't know that's a terrible idea.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We also have privacy czars in a half dozen countries Canada and various in Europe that sent this letter to Google yesterday.  Right.  That's I think fairly scary because by talking Germany that I'll be putting up later tonight the German paradox about privacy and publicness and penises is arguing that when they go out for things like Street View in public they're robbing from the public.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah we talked about that on Sunday but I don't I don't buy that so much.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well but now you have these people saying that we're going to try to restrict you Google from taking pictures in public but nobody else and they even complained they even complained about Google putting out a beta.  Oh please.  And basically saying no no no no because this assumption from the old world is no no no you should put out this product absolutely fully baked fully thought out perfect.  Or else because it's not a car they're putting out it's just right chat.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're going to talk more about this and all the other subjects but right now I want to mention a word from our sponsor as they say go to meeting is an online meeting service that is just the best effect they just did a go to meeting.  I'm so cool on my iPad.  They have a free little app.  So I was going to get shown some software so the folks said okay go to go to me and they gave me ID.  I didn't even know this they can hear me because I have a speaker on my iPad and I can hear a mic and a speaker.  I didn't even need to use the phone for this meeting.  I just need to the I could have said I could sit out on the bench with the Wi Fi and have a meeting.  It is amazing.  Go to meeting means you don't have to travel as much.  You could get the job done without going across town or out of the country.  If you've not tried go to meeting I want you to try it free right now.  You probably have tried other meeting software and I don't want you to get scared away because that other stuff is not as easy to use not as easy to configure.  Go to meeting is very simple.  In fact if you go right now to go to meeting.com slash twig G O T O meeting.com slash twig you can just sign up for 30 days free.  No cost or obligation and see how you'll have it installed within a second.  I mean it takes about 20 seconds to download and you're done.  No firewall port forwarding or DMZ or configure it off to call the IT.  It just works.  You will cut costs by eliminating travel.  You'll improve communications with the people you work with.  You'll work smarter.  You work more efficiently for product reviews sales present.  That's what we were doing by the way the product reviews for sales presentations.  By the way we use it all the time for that training sessions collaboration just taking a conference call and making it more engaging.  Go to meeting.  Go to meeting.  It's the best.  Go to go to meeting.com slash twig this week in Google twig and try it free for 30 days right now.  We thank the folks at Citrix for making the show possible.  We appreciate it.  So Boucher says consumers should be able to opt out of first party use of the information and for its use by third parties or subsidiaries.  Consumers should be able to opt in to use the information by third parties for those parties own marketing purposes.  They should have the choice.  Google says there's a position paper that just came out.  They call this opt in dystopia environments in which cumbersome opt in requirements could discourage users from engaging socially on useful sites.  Could push service providers to over collect user data at the point of consent.  And could turn the net into quote landscapes of walled gardens in which consumers are reluctant and even afraid to explore new services.  Amen.  What's wrong with that?  They say here's the quote opt in.  This is from the Google position.  Opt in is a rhetorical straw man that cannot really be implemented by regulatory policies without creating a number of unintended side effects.  Many of which are suboptimal for individual privacy.  Is that true?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And the economics of the web.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  So the issue is I can see what they're getting at there which is you don't have to fill in a form on every damn site you go to.  That's kind of where we are at the moment.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, but Facebook will fix that.  Facebook will fix that.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  True.  What I've been trying to do with a bunch of other people is to try to do this in a way that doesn't involve having it in one place but having it in a place of your choosing.  Not one giant database that is then subject to...  That's a good idea.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I create a set of privacy policies that are my personal privacy policies.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  You could host your personal information on your own site.  It could be an open ID kind of thing.  Here it is.  That's the idea of Webfinger.  Webfinger is here's my address.  You look the address up and then it can derive the rest of this stuff from that.  I've been meaning to ask you about Webfinger.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I love that idea.  I remember the old Finger protocol.  It was such a great idea.  We used to use it all the time.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  So we got this.  We got OpenID.  So OpenID proves I own a URL.  Right.  Right.  And that's basically all OpenID does.  But what that means is once I've got a URL, I can go to that URL and fetch the web page there and look for links from that and look for information.  So you can get information and endpoints and so on.  I can have an XFN.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You can have an XFN link.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  You can have an H card.  You can have links to API endpoints to get more data.  So once you've got a URL, that's a powerful thing.  What you have with...  The problem you have with login is that people don't tend to use URLs to log in.  So the WebFinger idea is you use an email address and then we have a set of rules to get from an email address to a URL where you can get that information.  So it's a way of locking in with an email address and it will then do the OpenID or OAuth or whatever it is from that.  So that's the goal of it.  That's the way to do it.  But the point is it is truly distributed.  So if I have Kevin at KevinMarx.com, that will then know to go to KevinMarx.com to look it up.  Or I could have used KevinMarx.gmail.com and then it would go to Gmail to look it up.  But I'm choosing where it's going.  It's not rooting through one central...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is that possible to implement in a way that's friendly so that my mom...  I hate to use the my mom meme, but I've got to...  Could do it?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  That was the...  Well, it was...  Blaine's grandmother was the original use case.  Because Blaine's grandmother knew his email address but couldn't remember any of his URLs.  And she said she wants to look for Blaine.  She wants to type in...  Blaine.gmail.com  Blaine.rmita.org or whatever it is.  And get and look it up from that.  She wants to type her own email address in and look it up from that and have the two connected.  You can't necessarily remember URLs for other people.  So that was Blaine's worldview is that email addresses are identifiers.  People have actually learned to remember.  Let's go from those.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What's wrong with that?  That's perfectly...  I mean, it works.  It's got...  The namespaces all work.  We don't need to invent a new namespace.  The problem is it's not...  Can't be commercialized.  So Facebook and Twitter and Google don't really like that so much.  I mean, I'll leave Google out of that because I think Google has mixed motives.  But clearly Facebook and Twitter have very clear motives.  Right.  Well, yeah.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  You're sure Google's got mixed motives, but they tend to move in the...  I don't work with them anymore.  They do tend to move in the direction of doing this in an open standards way.  Yeah, I think so.  I can be honest about it.  And they obviously want you to fill in profiles on their site and get more information about you and target ads.  That's part of it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It doesn't matter as much to them though as it does to Facebook and Twitter.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The way it matters to them is that they want signals to personalize your experience of Google more and your relevance for Google.  And so having a tie into that is business benefit to them, which is different, I think, from Facebook.  How?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Wouldn't Facebook benefit from having some sort of connection to say Twitter?  I mean, if you could...  So on your Google profile, you say, here's my Facebook page, here's my Twitter page, here's all my other URLs.  But Facebook doesn't say, what's your Twitter username?  You can't really imagine them doing that.  But it would be beneficial to them, wouldn't it, for them to know your social path on another network?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I connect my Facebook to Twitter.  I can't remember how I do that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But you would feed your status updates into Facebook, right?  But connecting to Twitter and saying, here's my Twitter username, you can get my social graph.  I mean, can you imagine Facebook recommending a friend that you don't follow on Facebook but that you do follow on Twitter to you?  Sure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If it should.  It's their interest.  Their goal is to collect it all, right?  I mean, right now I authorize Facebook to access my Twitter account, right?  Is that not how it's working?  Or is it the other way around?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think it's a Facebook app, right?  The other way around.  The other way around.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  That just falls in your feed.  Yeah.  But I think the thing that Facebook doesn't want you to do is point a link in somewhere else and say, that's me, right?  They let you like pages.  Live on Facebook.  But they don't want you to point out.  This is the world, but live here.  The Google profile and the Twitter profile and FriendFeed and a lot of these others say, okay, here's your thing on this site and here are pointers to you elsewhere.  And that's part of our goal.  And that's a piece that's.  That's the difference.  Well, Facebook's AOL.  It's just the AOL for the 21st century.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a walled garden that's going to let you leave the garden, visit around as long as everything you do is pumped back inside the walls.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There's a great moment on Twitter the other day that Steve Case saw someone say that, oh, Facebook is just like the AOL walled garden.  And Steve Case said, ah, reminds me of the old days.  The good old days.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So what about what about Docs.com?  That was interesting.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  I had a quick look at that.  What's the story there?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So actually, Kevin was listening, so he probably has the details, but it looks like Microsoft launched a partnership with Facebook, a Docs.com where you can share office documents with your Facebook friends online.  They're.  Yeah, that's kind of a big deal.  Well, it's Google Docs.  Yeah, that's why I'm saying, you know what, Google, you're not going to take over our Docs business.  And what better.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And see, this is what's going to happen because Facebook is again so much power now can go to Google's natural enemies, its hereditary enemies and say, play with us.  Doesn't that mix?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Isn't that isn't that isn't that a weird kind of mix like buzz and Gmail in the sense that it mixes potentially your personal and your professional lives in ways that people aren't going to like?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And then again, I mean, on Facebook, maybe your network, I mean, my network on Facebook is Gawker Media, which is my publisher.  You know, I can't.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  How many people, you know, Gina, who just don't want their business people to be part of their Facebook?  Oh, lots of people.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Really smart people who have, you know, button up jobs and, you know, want to post their Facebook about personal stuff.  I don't know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm allowing.  Let's see, Docs to access my public information and send me email.  Yeah, sure.  Why not?  How convenient is that?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You're so cynical today.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I just signed up.  I'm not that cynical.  I just signed up.  I can now see my friends, Docs, so they're not sharing it with me.  You know what?  This is very interesting.  Holy cow.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  I just put a link into one from Lily Chang, who's, you know, Lily Chang at Microsoft.  Yes.  Runs two slabs.  This is one of her projects.  So what was it?  Docs.com slash 43 capital G is her intro document to that that shared in there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, it's when you sign into Docs as well, it's the first thing.  Some Docs you might find interesting.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This exploration exposes yet another facet of Ray Ozzie's broad.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Here's Ray Ozzie's.  Got a Ray Ozzie's.  Got a PowerPoint.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  His broad and long held vision of social productivity.  I like social productivity.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's how to be the most dull friend in the world, sharing PowerPoints with your friends.  Who can imagine that?  Is Microsoft something friendly and social?  Come on.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's not only that, I have to update Silverlight.  Damn it.  All right.  I just did that.  I just have to do that on my back.  This is no, I think this is really a shot across the back.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Your approval dialogue.  And it doesn't let me uncheck things.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, you didn't want to uncheck those.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  It's like you didn't.  You didn't want to revoke.  Yeah.  Yes, you can.  You can get my email address and stuff.  I don't want you to post stuff to my wall.  Can I turn that one off, please?  No.  Let me do that.  No.  It's a no-raw-nothing doc.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it is a fail.  This is the Wednesday, Leo.  You never saw this before, Gina.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I was going to say, the Saturday Leo is usually much more relaxed.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm exhausted by then.  I still have some spunk left in me.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I was going to say, a little fire in the belly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I mean, I've actually always been a little bit worried about, I don't know why, and I'm  willing to be talked down on this, but much more worried about what Facebook's intentions  are than what Google's intentions are.  And I think it's not at all surprising to see that, Mike, this confirms my suspicions  with Microsoft doing a deal with Facebook.  You're going to see all of, it's just a matter of time before Apple does a deal with  Facebook, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Maybe not.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe they're the third leg of the story.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think you're right, Leo, the third leg.  Sorry, Gina.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, I was going to say, I mean, it feels like Facebook doesn't really even try not to be  evil.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  They don't care.  Their attitude is, go ahead.  Are we evil?  Are we evil?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Figure it out.  Right.  I think you're right.  Evil?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Come on in and check us out.  I don't know.  It could be.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I had a different theory at one time where when the news feed started and everybody went  ballistic, the truth is that Zuckerberg was right.  The news feed had value.  He just announced it wrong.  Then came the ad program, and it did make sense, but he announced it wrong and had to  kill it.  Right.  And he just put stuff out there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He's just a young guy who's got great ideas and he throws stuff up against the wall.  Let's see what sticks.  Yeah.  Let's see what we can fool you with, I'm starting to think.  Let's see if we can sneak this one by you.  And now it's gotten so convoluted that only somebody like Kevin Marks, who's an expert  in web APIs, even can begin to understand what's going on.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The implications of it all.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Well, that's the point.  I mean, Zuckerberg was using the word magic in his keyword.  It's magic.  He's picked up the jobs thing there of like, and here's Brett Taylor to explain how this  magic works.  And it's like, hmm.  You don't need to know.  But that's the point.  I mean, for most people, it is magical thinking.  It's like suddenly, magically, my friends are here at the New York Times reading the  paper with me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's very tempting as a con.  And this is what really worries me.  I could see as a content creator, it's extraordinarily tempting.  We even, you know, I looked at, for instance, what ABC and Facebook did with the elections  page.  And that was not a Facebook page.  It was an ABC page that merged your friends chat about the elections and stuff in together.  And it's very tempting.  It's very tempting, especially with 400 million people on Facebook.  Basically, everybody's on Facebook.  Why wouldn't it play?  So it's going to be very few people who are going to be willing to say, wait a minute,  yeah, this is this is this shirt chocolate covered thing looks good.  But do we really want to eat it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, here's the other thing, Leo, if you're a publisher, you're trying to figure out how  to get a direct relationship with the readers and only the New York Times, the Wall Street  Journal and the FT require registration at all, let alone paying.  So if you're the Chicago Tribune, you don't know who anyone is.  So Mark Zuckerberg now has them buy the shorts.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He's the guy.  Mark's the man.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So the only way to have a direct relationship is that.  So look at the complaints the publishers have had like the New York Times with Kindle.  The complaint is I had a billing relationship with that reader.  Now I don't.  You do Amazon.  Right.  Right.  So now if you want to try to implement, let's say a billing structure across multiple newspapers,  if Zuckerberg says, you know what, this closed wall I have is really comfy.  Want to come inside?  We'll do that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We can do that for you.  Yeah.  Well, he's in.  It's all about wall building.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The app world that I keep complaining about, you keep ignoring because I'm full of crap,  but fine.  I think it's a walled issue.  And now Facebook is a walling issue.  It's walled versus open.  And then we have these privacy bozos and China and Google putting out, we'll talk about later,  the censorship.  There's a lot of wall building going on.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  The other thing that Google published yesterday was the here's the count of requests we've  had from different governments and blocking things.  Yeah, I thought that was interesting.  That was very interesting to see, especially as I was looking at per capita.  And that meant the UK was way in the lead, which obviously makes me nervous given the  laws they just passed there.  So that's a, yeah, I think that for them, that's a very effective counter to the privacy  stuff from the governments to say, okay, here's all this stuff that you're trying to do.  Because there's this weird asymmetry in privacy.  I think this plays the jest point a bit, which is they're all very worried about Google  Street View because they can see what's going on, but they're not worried about the CCTV  cameras that cover the entire country that are being recorded by private individuals  and shared with their friends and being used as zoom in and harass people.  But because they can't see that.  And there's this sort of there's this weird assumption of symmetry that we have because  we assume if I can see you, you can see me.  Google is trying to say, okay, we found this thing in public.  We're going to make it public for you, too.  And this Facebook movie is a bit like that as well.  They said, OK, we've got this graph data.  You can now read the graph data, which is a good movie in that direction.  But the what we're seeing from the government's is how dare you gather this information.  But at the same time, they're subpoenaing them and saying, give us all the information  you've got.  The geolocation one is the best example for me.  This is this is where at the moment the phone company and the police know where you are,  but your friends don't.  And people are going, oh, no, the people can find out where you are.  It's like, well, people have already been able to find out where you are and being able  to abuse that.  The difference is that now you can find out where you are and you can decide who to share  that with.  And that's going to be sort of move it back to that conversation rather than the should  be banned this conversation.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We need to take a break.  There is some other stuff to talk about and we do have to get Jeff out of here in a few  minutes.  So let's I hate to move on.  This is such an interesting and I'm fine for a while.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's an important conversation.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I have to say there are some other things that Facebook announced, for instance, no  longer 24 hours limit on the on the caching of Facebook data, which I think is great because  that was a real that was a bizarre kind of limitation that was imposing.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  And they also added web hooks that will update you.  So you can say, tell me when this profile exchange changes and it'll it'll call you  back.  So that's so awesome.  So that's those two go together quite nicely.  So rather than having to pull them all the time and saying, has this stuff changed?  You can register and say, call me when this changes.  So that's very handy.  The actual API they've done that Brett has done a lovely job that if you go more, more

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  sponge sugar around the little gingerbread around the house.  Come on in, kids.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's warm.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's warm.  I'm telling you, I'm very nervous about all of this.  And it's a and it's a juggernaut.  I mean, this thing is that's what really scares me.  If Facebook were the size of even Twitter, I wouldn't worry so much.  But it's massive.  You're watching this week in the Google.  A great cast, Kevin Marks, Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis talking about Facebook's F8 conference  and more.  But I need to interrupt because I forgot to say something about carbonite.com and I want  to get this in here.  Carbonite is backup done right.  Carbonite, C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E dot com combines the two things that are most important with  backup.  It's automatic, so you don't have to remember it.  You don't have to think about it.  It just does it.  And it's off site.  I still encourage people to make local backups.  That's fine.  It's always good to have multiple copies of everything.  But what if the worst happens and somebody breaks in and steals a computer and your backup  or the house burns down, the office burns down, then you've got nothing.  So you've got to have really two copies, I say three copies of everything, your existing  internal drive, the external backup drive and carbonite off site backup.  Carbonite is just great for your peace of mind.  You can look at your carbonite files, see that they're there.  You can check them with an iPhone application or from any computer you can get online.  You can restore easily with just a click of the mouse.  And carbonite is unlimited backup for all those personal documents on your internal drive.  Everything that's there for one low flat rate, $5, actually less than $5 a month, $55 a year.  Try it free for 15 days just to get an idea of what carbonite can do for you.  Of course, you have to have high speed internet to make this work.  And it will take a little time for that first backup, depending on how fast your internet connection is  and how much data you have.  But once it's there, the trickle up backups in the background always going on without slowing down your system.  So you're always up to date.  Try it right now.  15 days free.  You don't even need a credit card.  All you need is this twig.  That's the offer code T W I G.  Go to carbonite.com.  Sign up for that free trial.  Use the offer code twig and you have 15 days free.  And then after the trial, if you decide to buy two months free when you use the offer code T W I G.  Carbonite.  It's in the cloud.  It's encrypted.  It's automatic.  It's backup done right.  You got to back it up to get it back with carbonite.com.  Now back to the show.  No more HTTP.  I think that's kind of a smart thing.  I do too.  I think it's great.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's just it's there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You don't need to type it.  I remember when we started doing years ago in 1994 when I started doing a TV show called The Sight on MSNBC,  they would still in the lower thirds type HTTP colon slash slash.  And Soledad O'Brien would say every time she said a website, HTTP colon slash slash.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What I hate is when they say forward slash.  Oh yeah.  When do you use the backward slash?  Only in Windows.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  But also it's not a forward slash.  It's a slash.  It's a slash.  But the forward slash is the thing using Windows Pals.  It's not the one that goes that way.  You're kidding.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  It's a I don't know.  Depends.  It works.  Wait a minute.  So you're saying Kevin that a regular.  It's a standard slash.  That that's a backslash.  Maybe in Britain it is.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Well, so Stephen Fry said we should just call it say stroke.  Stroke.  It's a much nicer word.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And it's a single syllable.  And then what's really nice is when you want to do the other one you say backstroke.  Or as you would say, brilliant.  I like that.  Anyway, Chrome no longer even shows you HTTP colon slash slash, which was the most confusing thing.  Now that the entire world has memorized that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The other thing it does is that I did a I do a lot of site colon searches, you know, to restrict the search one site.  It now takes that and turns it into a little gray box.  It says search buzz machine.  That's brand new.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's really cool.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  You know, you consider it to that by changing our habit, by getting rid of the Google search box.  Of course, I'm now in the habit fully.  I use Chrome all the time.  I just put searches right into the bar.  I love it.  And the beautiful thing is Google now knows even better what I'm searching for where I go.  See, that doesn't bother me.  I don't mind.  I don't mind either.  Let them know.  I'm a Google fan boy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because you remember when who was it?  Altavista.  Somebody released all that search data and it took a reporter like two days to figure out who this anonymized search data was from and call her at her home.  So all they need is, you know, what you search for.  They know everything.  The AOL.  The data.  It was AOL.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I don't think most of our listeners ever heard of Altavista, Leo.  I think we're dating ourselves.  I remember.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You remember dogpile.  I loved that.  Altavista.  Yeah.  Northern Lights.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I thought that was Northern Lights.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Who do I know that used to work for them?  Maybe Dane used to work for them.  Hey, good news.  Android 2.2 is on the road map on the horizon and we may get it first on our Nexus One phones.  Whoop whoop.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Whoop whoop.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is that how you're supposed to say whoop?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Whoop whoop.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Whoop whoop.  Whoop whoop.  Can you loop that Leo so you can just hit the button whenever something good happens?  That's my new ringtone.  Are you kidding?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Whoop whoop.  I can't even get that hot.  Whoop whoop.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Whoop whoop.  Apparently we'll also include Flash 10.1.  Do you want to whoop that?  Not really.  Ain't no whoopin' there.  What else will be in Froyo?  You must know some stuff, Gina.  You're like a developer inside developer.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know what else is going to be in Froyo.  All I know is that it's going to be called Froyo.  I'm really excited that it's coming down to the Nexus One.  My latest Android thing is the Incredible, which looks quite incredible.  Don't you want that on Verizon?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Kind of, yeah.  It's an HTC and it's kind of what it's kind of, I think it's HTC's response to the Nexus One.  It's like, well, that was nice, Google, but what about this?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  What about this?  And we're just going to pick a really good adjective and name it that.  It's incredible.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Incredible.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So the only thing I'm worried about is instead of the ball, which by the way, apparently in new Android 2.2, the rumors are will be multicolored now.  Your Nexus One will suddenly do the color thing it was supposed to do.  Uh-huh.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Which Cyanogenrom does now.  Right.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And so like you could have a blue for SMS notification and red for a Google Talk notification or whatever.  But theirs is optical.  And some people are saying the optical is not so good as the trackball.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The trackball, it goes, you know, it's like being behind an old lady on a stair.  I hate the trackball in the Nexus One.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  With a walker.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  With walkers.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And then the 8 megapixel camera.  Will there be a front facing camera too, Gina?  Because that's the iPhone I think.  That's the Apple.  iPhone's going to have a front facing camera.  Oh yeah, that's the iPhone.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Which no one will be able to use.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I have a Nokia N900 with a front facing camera.  You can't call anybody because nobody else has that.  You have to use Fring.  So maybe when everybody has it on their iPhone.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I can use it to be on Twig.  You could.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You could walk around with that.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Which, have they picked a carrier for the Incredible?  Yes, Verizon.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  There's definitely Verizon.  Another thumbs up, right?  It's Verizon.  That'll be available soon.  June, when is I.O.?  June 4th?  May, mid-May.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Like the 16th I want to say.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's when we think Froyo will come out because of course that's when all the developers who  go to I.O. get their very own Nexus One or Android for free.  Yeah, we get the Droid.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's May 19th and the 20th.  That's it.  Oh, so you think they're going to push down 2.2 then?  Of course.  Or right around that.  It makes sense.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're going to get the Droid with 2.1 on it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it makes a lot of sense.  Although they're shipping the phones out before the event.  So they're not handing them out at the event.  So that's kind of interesting.  They said they wanted you to get started earlier on your app.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  When does yours come?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It should be in a week or so.  I'm in New York now, but I'm hoping that when I'm coming back to San Diego this weekend  it'll be in the mailbox.  I got the confirmation.  So I wonder if it'll ship.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You don't have to go to a German bar to steal it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're a journalist.  What's your take on this whole.  We talked a lot about it on Twig.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'll bet you did.  I'll bet you did.  I say it's a new world.  It's public.  I mean there's stuff about whether or not it was stolen versus just left there.  But if it's left there on the bar store or on the street or whatever, and Nick Denton  makes clear that he buys news.  He has no pride about that.  I say welcome to the new world.  What do you think, Leo?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and by the way, Gina, we're going to let you recuse yourself because you still  do stuff for Gawker Media.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes.  Okay.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, she has an opinion, as you may say.  Nick wouldn't care.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right to you.  I'll tell you my opinion, but I'd like to hear yours.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, I think it's reprehensible.  And I think that Nick may be going to jail, to be honest with you, because I think he's  broken the law.  He receives stolen merchandise.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What made it stolen?  Yeah, but he didn't know.  There's a California...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, no, it doesn't matter.  California state law, if you find an object, you must make a good faith effort to find  the owner.  And the person...  First of all, if you believe Gizmodo's story, which they clearly published to justify what  they did, that the guy left it on the bar stool and then the guy picked it up and he  asked anybody, whose phone is this?  And then he placed several calls to Apple's switchboard saying, I have your phone.  But I can't remember his name, but somebody pointed out that he not once did they ask  the bar's owner if the person had called.  And apparently the Apple employee called multiple times, very agitatedly saying, has  anybody found a phone?  Has anybody found a phone?  So there really wasn't a good faith effort to find the owner.  I bet.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But that was by the seller, right?  By the seller.  By the seller.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  But if you purchase...  It's the fall off the back of a truck rule.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, okay, so Leo, so one of your acolytes comes into the cottage and says, you won't  believe what I found, Leo.  I found the next iPhone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We'd look at it.  You wouldn't put it on, you wouldn't show it to me, you wouldn't show it to us.  I would, no, I might even show it, but I wouldn't pay five grand for it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, I mean, they didn't know whether or not they were getting a Chinese knockoff.  Denton pays for stories.  He's real clear about that.  He's done it before.  That's, you know, that's whatever, that's choice.  They held onto the phone, they checked it out.  They tried to figure out whether or not it was...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The worst part is they tore it apart, right?  Yeah, they broke it.  That's the kind of...  That's a little gloomy, honestly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They broke it.  As somebody pointed out, they've never shown us a picture of the screen with the connect  to iTunes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And Apple very cleverly bricked it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They bricked it immediately.  I feel bad for the poor kid who lost it because he's...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He did the right thing until obviously telling him right away is, uh-oh.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, we don't know if he told him right away.  He could have bricked it himself.  Oh, really?  Sure.  You could brick it yourself.  It's a nice feature of mobile me.  Press the brick button.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  That better have a warning.  Are you sure in front of it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A couple of warnings, I would hope.  I don't know.  I have to say, by the way, and somebody's pointing out, and you're right.  When Gizmodo first published that story, I tweeted it, you do not want to be this guy.  Put the guy's name on Twitter.  And now I deeply regret it because I feel really bad for the guy.  As somebody's pointed out, any Google search for this guy for the rest of his life is going  to turn up this story.  He's now branded.  Yeah.  Would you hold this for me?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Never mind.  None of us get that kind of publicity when we make those kinds of mistakes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was his birthday.  He was in a bar.  Let's be honest.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Lots of things.  Yes.  Absolutely.  Gina, I don't believe this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And now that Facebook knows everything about you, Gina, those pictures will live forever.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We'll all get to have his experience.  Yeah, that's probably the case.  Yeah.  I understand why folks are upset about it.  Hey, I grew up as a blogger under Denton.  I know he buys stories.  I didn't think it was...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'll be very curious.  I think Apple could sue him at this point.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They're returning it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, then the discovery is all kinds of fun.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, then maybe they don't want to.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  That's the Streisand rule, isn't it?  I think they don't want to.  They want the story to go away.  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Do you think this job's called Denton directly?  No.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He got a letter from...  In fact, they published a...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, but there's also this report that the job's called Denton.  And Denton's response when asked whether this happened, well, if that happened, it would  be confidential.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, Nick would love you to think that Steve Jobs is placing personal calls.  Oh, exactly.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think that happened.  I don't buy that.  I have no idea.  I haven't talked to Nick about it.  I don't think that happened, though.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Steve would not humble himself to that degree, I doubt.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, no.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If somebody called it, it wouldn't be Steve.  It would be somebody...  Steve wouldn't call Denton.  Somebody with an S-quire.  Someone who's inside the circle.  Yeah.  That's true, too, right?  He would call somebody he knows.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, Gizmodo destroyed any further future relationship with Apple in terms of covering  the product.  Who cares?  That's nothing.  But I mean, they were willing to...  Well, I won't...  I'm not going to talk about it anymore because, yes, I work for Gawker.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I certainly don't want to pull you into this.  I think it's reprehensible.  It is checkbook journalism.  I guess that's the way we are now.  Jeff, I defer to you.  You're the...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, no, no, no.  I know I'm destroying journalism like Nick.  People would...  Oh, it's your fault.  Journalists in schools saying this, I think someone will come in and beat me up in a moment.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You posed a good hypothetical, though.  If somebody walked in here...  I have turned down stuff and I've also accepted stuff and not published it.  Several times I've received what looked to me to be confidential Apple documents and  read them and destroyed them.  Did not show them on the air.  But I read them.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There's another story this week.  A coach, I'm forgetting his name, said controversial things in a bar.  And Jerry Jones.  I don't know Jack about sports because I'm not a real man.  But he was criticizing Bill Parcells and Tim Tebow and somebody in the bar recorded this  and played it and there was just much angst among sports journalists, if that's not an  oxymoron, saying, how dare you do this?  But it was in a public bar.  He said it.  If I told a friend about it in a gossip column, what's the difference between that and me  recording it?  The difference between Nick buying it and then Nick tearing it apart and Nick showing  it, the damage to Apple in that sense is the same.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And let's be honest, it ain't the Pentagon Papers and the dang things coming out in two  months.  Really what this comes down to is the very vicious news cycle and competition between  Gadget and Gizmodo.  If there's anything to blame for this, it's that.  And as consumers who will go to whichever gadget blog has the scoop, we're to blame,  I guess, indirectly for it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's our version of a Paris Hilton story.  So sad we are.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The story did better than any other sex tape that a docker ever published.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It worked.  It was well worth five grand.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  There you go.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know if it's worth public.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Nobody's buying into the this was leaked by Apple nonsense, are they?  Oh, God, no.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And you worked for Apple.  You know better than anyone that that's not so.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't make any sense.  The point about this information coming out can only damage sales of the current iPhone  so that Apple keeps that close to their chest than anything.  The other thing is that they make more than one prototype just because this one has those  features in it.  If it's a prototype, there may be another one out there that has a different set of features  in it.  Apple will build a bunch of these different ones before they decide which one to manufacture.  Why wouldn't Apple just say that?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Say what?  Say again?  I don't understand why they didn't just say that.  Say, oh, yeah, we got 20 of them.  Ha ha ha.  You found one.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  They don't want they just want this to go away.  They want they want.  They don't want to talk about it.  Yeah.  Because if it if it escapes out of our geeky little world, we know there's a new iPhone  coming to the mainstream and it hurts sales.  That costs them real money.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  By the way, Jeff, I loved what you said about stop being an audience and start being participants.  I thought that was so right on.  You are the crazy homeless guy who turns out to be right.  That's a quick reference.  Somebody tweeted that.  But I think that's so that's exactly right on.  And I love that.  This was a speech that you gave where?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Tedx New York NYED.  And you know, I made fun of the form of Ted lectures, thus making fun the form of education  lectures.  Yes.  And I'll keep the language clear here.  But I started off with some potty mouth.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, you can watch it.  It's on YouTube.  The end of the age of content.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And I'll put up another one tonight.  My German thing I'm putting up tonight in video.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is it German?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, actually, the first first two sentences are but then transfers from bad German to  bad English.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  One of which is your native tongue.  We won't say which.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I always have an American who speaks like an American one point one languages.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Was it Churchill has said Britain and America are two countries separated by a common language?  Yes.  Let's get to our tip.  We don't we don't have to do a tip number in a tool.  We've used up our time well enough.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And I'm still on if you want 10 more minutes.  I'm good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  OK, well, then we'll we'll we'll do a tip from Gina if you've got one.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That means I got to find a number now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You got nobody has anything.  OK, never mind.  We should.  Whoops.  I should mention that we were going to do it well.  It's my fault because we were going to do a call in only show.  And then F8 happened.  I had forgotten about the Facebook conference.  Kevin Marks very kindly at the very last minute agreed to come on.  And I thought that this was such a good conversation.  I did not want to not have this.  But we will do a maybe we'll do a call in show on next week.  But I would love to do a call in show.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We spent so much time on if I may if I may extend this for a moment on the one aspect  of Facebook and you you at the beginning of the show went through the other.  Are we missing anything major from from implications of Facebook moves?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  That was the thing.  The key thing they were pushing was that with these two of these changes, the implications  for me was this something that was disappointing in that they seem to have some of its good  and they've gone to or they've gone to Jason.  They've got a bunch of opens Santa stuff there.  But for that they've they very much for the markup the web staff.  They haven't gone with microformats.  They haven't gone with existing stuff.  They've said here's our own markup.  Put it in the head.  It's our own.  That really stinks.  Is it FML or is it?  It's no it's it's it's meta tags.  Meta.  So still XML.  It's yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They had an opportunity to promote a standard and they totally didn't do it.  That's sad.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Some of the schema is there an overlap.  But I was disappointed they didn't pick up the activity stream stuff or use the activity  streams community where we've been trying to define this stuff in a collective way to  drive that.  So it's very much we've decided what the schema of the world looks like.  And here it is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Turns out Chris Messina should have taken a job at Facebook not Google.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They could have used.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  I think that's quite fair.  I think that the guys who've been doing the open stuff they have been doing good work.  And I'm I know Monica just joined there and has been working on this stuff.  And I'm sure she'll help to bring that stuff.  Monica Keller that is and will help to bring that stuff back to the open standards.  The rest of us are working.  She's been a big proponent of those.  I think what there's there's there seems to be a lot of Brett Taylor in this.  And a lot of that is good influence.  Yeah. That's great.  The API is now much cleaner and much more sensible than it was before.  If you actually compare the API they've got now, it's much closer to the sort of  cleanliness of the FriendFeed API than the sort of accumulated craft of the previous  Facebook API.  But at the same time, it's still a we've decided what what the parameters that define  the world are and here they are.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Brett, we should say was co-founder of FriendFeed and as CEO.  And and along with Paul Buchheit, the big acquisition of FriendFeed was really about  these guys. And now it's clear that they're not there to develop FriendFeed.  But they've brought their good work to Facebook.  So that's great. Yeah.  Mark Zuckerberg said the Web is at an important turning point.  He says the default has been most things aren't social and don't use your real  identity. Facebook is learning looking to change that.  He also said that when he was a kid, he remembers thinking, man, the world could be a  lot better and we can make it that way.  So I feel better about the whole thing.  What is that, Doctor Who?  What are you watching, Doctor Who?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  That's my phone ringing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're going to let you take that call.  KevinMarxRibbit.com.  It's great to have you on.  Thank you for doing this on such short notice.  Really good to have your comments on all of this.  And if anybody doesn't know who KevinMarx is, just go to Wikipedia and you'll see what  a legend he is in this business and how many things he's had a hand in, including the  other day. Kevin's in the studio and I'm talking about, you know, getting Skype better  and stuff. And he said, well, when we wrote iChat, we made sure it did.  And I thought, oh, of course, doi.  Next time we'll use iChat.  Thank you, Kevin. Really great to have you.  Also, on our new time, we really appreciate your flexibility.  Jeff Jarvis, I know you have a train to catch and people to see.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I want to show you that I've got my replacement for the iPad.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What is that?  Whoa, what is that thing?  A TRS 200?  Was that from Tandy?  What is that?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The Moro Kibitz.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, the Moro. Oh, my God.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The first portable computer, not transportable like an Osborne or Cape  Road. So I now have my  Museum of Dead Technology boarding in my office here in New York.  This thing weighs about 20 pounds.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  George Moro was a great guy, a real innovator and  yeah, brilliant, brilliant fellow.  And I always wanted one of those.  And I'm impressed that you have one.  Did it come with WordStar? I believe it did.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, with WordStar and the whole office.  It used D batteries.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Making it even more heavy.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, it might help if my iPhone were used from D batteries.  I could last all day.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think the new one has a replaceable battery, at least if that prototype  that that $5,000 prototype has anything to do with it.  Jeff Jarvis is at BuzzMachine.com, the author of a great book  that you have to read if you want to understand what Google's up to.  It's called What Would Google Do?  Thank you, Jeff. We appreciate your being here.  Is this time working for you?  Yeah. Good. It's great for me.  It's nice to be able to get this show out a little bit earlier.  Gina Tripani is what can I say? The greatest.  She's the author of The Complete Guide to Google Wave at complete waveguide.com  and blogs at smarterware.org  and is giving us a great view of New York City.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yay for Twig on Wednesday.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yay. Look at that. Look at that skyline.  Oh, wait a minute. That's that's a see.  She's got a better view than you do, Jeff.  Yeah, much better view than Jeff's looking at a quadrangle.  You're looking at the World Trade Center.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  New York, baby. New York, New York.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Thank you, everybody. Well, we're so glad you're here again.  We do this show now Wednesday afternoons, 4 p.m.  Eastern Time, 1 p.m. Pacific 2000 UTC at live.twit.tv.
