Gina Tripani from Lifehacker and SmarterWear.org.  Gina, it's great to see you once again.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Time flies.  We're having fun.  I can't believe it's been a year.  Isn't that amazing?  Amazing.  Amazing.  So happy to be here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Our most successful show launched today.  It came out of the box with a huge audience and has only gotten stronger.  That's because of people like you and Jeff Jarvis who is...  Now we owe AOL money.  Knock it off.  Jeff is with BuzzMachine.com.  He's also a professor of journalism at the City University of New York and the author  of What Would Google Do?  Good to see you.  You're at home today.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I am trying to write the book.  I'm doing a very good job of it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, well, there you go.  It's called Public Parts.  At least we know that much.  Yes, we do.  Also joining us, very happy to have him.  Former Googler, former founder of Jaiku and now just man about town, Yuri Engestrom.  It's great to see you again.  Good to see you guys again.  Thanks for having me back.  Are you kind of just an early stage angel investor now?  Is that what you're doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's mostly what I've been up to since I left Google late last year.  And I'm also working on something new.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, are you going to tell us or is it a secret?  A hint?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mobile.  Something involves mobile again.  Surprise, surprise.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Mobile really is what Jaiku did so well.  One of the reasons I really liked Jaiku and was a big fan of it was integration with the  Nokia phones.  It was kind of a Twitter that had all of the features you wished Twitter had.  You may still wish Twitter had because it doesn't.  And did you work on Buzz at all when you were at Google?  Because Buzz seems a lot like Jaiku.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, so when we arrived at Google, Buzz didn't really exist.  You and Petra?  That's right, our team.  So we were involved.  I was actually the product manager of something called Activity Streams, which then evolved  into Google Buzz.  Also Google Profiles.  I think I was the first product manager of what eventually became known as Latitude.  So all these social products that nowadays sort of have their independent lives in the  Google Cloud.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you could probably give us some insight into whether there might be a Google Me, a  Facebook type connection between all of those into one social network.  Does that seem like something Google's working towards?  I hope so.  He's not going to tell us.  He's going to be coy, isn't he?  All right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What's a Googler always a Googler?  I had to ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's still a fact.  I can't give it all up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, no, no.  But if they were going to do something like that, how can...  Jeff, you help me.  You're the journalist here.  Ask him a question.  If they were to do something like that, what would it look like?  What would it be like?  Nothing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  He's not going to say a word.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He's silent.  Is that a question for me?  Yes.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, here's my...  If we're going to talk about this, am I as well?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'll tell you why I ask.  You know that I was one of the few thousand people who gave up on Facebook due to privacy  issues and I definitely miss it.  I was just signing in.  There's a new iPad application called Flipbook or something like that.  Flipboard.  Flipboard that aggregates your Twitter and your Facebook into a magazine.  But I feel like I'm missing a leg because I don't have a Facebook.  But I don't want to go back to Facebook.  I have no desire to go back to Facebook.  But I want something Facebook-like that I can trust.  And that's why I'm hoping Google will do something like that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Me too.  I think that what my experience at Google was sort of managing these products was that  as part of what I'm frankly frustrated about is that you see mobile client but it's been  kind of integrated into Google Maps and it's not as latitude.  And we have...  It would start off as the activity stream equivalent to the Facebook newsfeed which  been shoehorned into Gmail and then we have Google profiles that became linked to the  Google search property.  And all of these to the user appear to be three distinct separate products that nobody  is able to use them.  You can use Facebook as just one coherent whole social product.  And so that's what I'm frustrated about and that's what I think Google needs to fix.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah they've got the pieces in other words.  But they haven't joined them all together.  And I think everybody on this panel certainly I would count myself is our heavy users of  all of those pieces.  I use Latitude.  You know you're talking...  You're wearing a Foursquare shirt.  And Gina last week and I were talking about how Gina had poo-pooed Foursquare for years  and now is a Foursquare user.  I'm a convert.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  A convert.  I'm an addict.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm coming back.  You're coming back?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  I just was out of the habit.  I'm seeing Dennis Crowley on Friday morning so I'd better be on.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I just hope that it doesn't do anything yet.  It just you know you check in and you know I saw the other day the bakery that I was  nearby had a deal for the mayor.  So I'm starting to see little things like that coupons.  I think Starbucks gave a buck off Frappuccinos for the mayor of the local Starbucks.  But it seems like there's so much more in that information.  I know lots of people are talking to Facebook about making deals for that information.  Google for one is talking to Facebook about integrating Facebook results.  Location is huge.  You've known that, Yuri, for years.  It just can't get started.  So I decided while I continue to use Latitude, the only real use for me for Latitude right  now is Google Talk.  I pipe Google Talk, my location into Google Talk so people know where I am.  I don't know what else to do with it.  That's useful.  Yeah.  If you look at my Google Talk status, it says where I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well that's the difference between active and passive.  Latitude sort of hovers through the background and sort of forgets about it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But people are concerned about that because in fact Google now sends me an alert every  week or so saying don't forget.  Everybody can see where you are.  Understandably there's some concern about that.  There was a lot of heat over Apple's new iTunes terms of service that says we're going  to aggregate information about your location and send that off.  Google's been doing that for some time.  People don't like that idea and yet there seems like there's so much value in there.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think actually that we learned that in Jyko in the early days because we started off with  a passive client that was just active in the background.  It was only for Nokia phones.  But it did put latitude down today which is just broadcast your location.  In fact it broadcast a lot of other stuff too such as whether your phone was on silent  or if the ringer was on so people would know what your status was, whether they could expect  you to answer if they tried to phone.  It's so useful.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh man.  You remember all that.  I loved it.  I got a Nokia phone so I could use it.  That's right.  I remember.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  I loved it.  What one of his 347 phones?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No.  It was my N95.  I loved that N95.  Yeah.  It was a full spoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  But it's equivalent to today's.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  Android, we're back to square one with battery life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the point was we pretty quickly realized that actually active as counterintuitive as  it sounds, the requirement of making people do some work to check in is actually much  more engaging than just passively following their presence.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It gives you more control too.  Users want it and the data is more valuable.  If I write, hey, this place has the best croissants in town, that's valuable.  And Gina and anybody who follows me now has a, when they go to that store and they check  in it says, oh, by the way, Leo says try the croissants.  That's incredible.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It is.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's powerful.  Well, that's beacon.  That's beacon brought to life.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's what Facebook was trying to do.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Kind of way it ought to be.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  They just said, hey, Leo Laporte just bought some Viagra.  Maybe you think you might want to think about it.  And then Leo Laporte went, what?  I didn't give him permission to use my picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So obviously that's the reason they shut down.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Beacon was a bad idea.  Beacon was one of many bad ideas Facebook's had.  It seems to me Facebook also like everybody.  This is, I think what's going on.  Everybody sees the power and the value of this.  Facebook was willing to just say, okay, we're going to do it.  We're just going to go ahead and integrate it.  And its users went, oh man, what are you doing?  And there was a big backlash.  And now everybody, including Google is saying, we better, you know, they learned their lesson  from Buzz.  We better really step back and think about this.  Is that your sense of what's going on here?  Is it really fear holding people back now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if you look at, you know, Google, when they launched Buzz, this was, I think we probably  talked about this last time on the show when Google had launched Buzz, when I was here  for the last time was, you know, Google had its own privacy issues with Buzz.  That sort of, I don't, I wouldn't think it's fair to compare it to Beacon, but, you know,  they wanted to make it very easy for people to share as much information as possible.  So by default, they enabled, you know, your friends, your buddies, your contacts to actually  show up on your profile.  And obviously that created a huge privacy issue for some people who wouldn't like that at all.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it's reasonable for people to get into Google to be a little skittish, gun shy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, what I think this all goes to say is, it turns out that it's actually  some friction is good.  You know, we can see both in the privacy sense that you want to have these barriers that  actually make people, you know, consciously give access to others.  But not only that, because this is another thing that we noticed when we did Jaiku.  I believe we were, you know, among the first, if not the first to actually aggregate what  we were calling the live stream at the time, you know, when it was not just your status  updates, but we also pulled in feeds from the other services that you were using, which  then became very popular with things like FriendFeed and now even Facebook's doing  this.  And, you know, when we look at the stats, the usage stats, we quickly realized that the  updates that actually got the most engagement by far were the ones that people were still  manually typing in, you know, the stuff you see on Twitter today, whereas the stuff that  was pulled in automatically from other feeds, I wasn't really getting any engagement at  all from people's audiences.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You guys are, it must gall you a little bit that you were so far ahead of everybody else  and still are actually, they still haven't implemented some of those things that you  were doing in Jaiku way back when.  It galls me.  I don't even, didn't even have anything to do with it.  So let's talk, there's quite a bit of a news story.  And I guess since we started with the Buzz topic, let's start with Buzz.  Buzz has a fire hose and five new fire hose partners.  The fire hose is that thing we talked about a lot with Twitter, the idea that you could  get every update, every bit of information.  By the way, with Buzz is a lot of metadata.  There's a lot of extra information, things like comments, likes, shared counts, plus  all the buzzes.  And those will be given or sold, I'm not sure which, to collect a Gnip Superfeeder One Riot  and Postrank Analytics.  Now you have something to do with Superfeeder, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right.  I'm an advisor.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you must know then what the deal is.  Is it a freebie?  Do you pay for it?  How does this work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's available.  I mean, the Buzz fire hose is available for free basically to these companies.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You do have to make a deal with Buzz though.  You can't just walk up and say plug into the fire hose.  I believe you can just walk up and plug in.  Oh, that's neat.  Wow.  What does Superfeeder plan to do with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well Superfeeder is trying to real time enable all the feeds out there on the web.  And so what it does is obviously the Buzz feeds are actually already real time enabled  over this protocol called PubSub Hubbub that is basically a way of doing updates and push.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So anybody who used PubSub Hubbub could subscribe to the fire hose.  To the Buzz fire hose.  That's correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  Yeah.  And you can now do it with a single subscription.  Before it was also possible, but you had to separately subscribe to all of the public feeds  of each Buzz user.  So now you can just basically do that with one single subscription.  So it's made very easy.  So anyway, what Superfeeder then does, for instance, with the Buzz data is that it normalizes  this format that's called activity streams, which is like a standard for representing  these activities across different services.  And then it just makes it very easy for subscribers to subscribe to the Buzz fire hose, but also  all the other fire hoses or feeds, updates from other services that they aggregate and  enable you to do stuff like, for instance, track, which is essentially define a set of  keywords that will then trigger push updates to you.  So you can do things like, you know, I don't know, track your brand name or.  I see.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I've signed up for Superfeeder and I get, I see these little snippets that I could then,  these are API calls.  Is that right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So basically what you're doing is this is like a server to server, sort of like a B2B  service.  Using Java.  Right.  Yeah.  So all you're doing is basically, if you're a publisher, you know, you can delegate your  feeds to Superfeeder.  So for instance, if you already have RSS feeds, but you don't want to build your own, you  know, scalable way of pushing these feeds out in real time, then you can just basically  say, well, I don't want to build this myself.  I'd rather just delegate the Superfeeder.  And so you, you basically let Superfeeder then start to do the pushing for you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I've subscribed for instance, to our RSS from the Twitter page and now it's going to  be delegated to Superfeeder and then I can now use it in some way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, right.  So after this, you know, Superfeeder will automatically push you an update every time  that the feed gets updated.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Using PubSubHubbub or how does the push work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Using PubSubHubbub.  I don't know how to make some people interface, but I think PubSubHubbub is more popular there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I would have an endpoint of some kind.  We've talked about, for instance, a river endpoint.  We would use this like crazy.  A river of data from a variety of sources.  So we would provide that endpoint.  Actually we'd use probably use a Jabber server as an endpoint, pushing that then out that  people could subscribe to it.  And so they'd get all this, you'd be aggregating all this stuff into it.  We'd create an endpoint and then people could subscribe to our endpoint and we'd get it  all from Superfeeder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's possible.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is that a common usage case or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think so.  You really need to talk to Julian Genestue, who's the founder.  This is actually, this is part of what I like about this.  The way I discovered Superfeeder was I was still at Google and I was helping Brad Kittspatrick  and Brett Slatkin with a pet project of theirs called PubSubHubbub.  I'm not an engineer, but I was, you know, sort of helping them a little bit with the  product and messaging of it.  I don't know, basically did some slides.  And so one day this, you know, French dude kind of, you know, just walks up and says,  hey, I want to build a business around this.  I want to create a startup completely around, you know, like this protocol and enabling  everybody out there to basically create a hub of their own for free.  And that sounded like a really fantastic thing to do.  So I got very excited about it.  And then the day when I left Google, Julian actually came back and said, hey, now that  you're free, would you be willing to become an advisor?  And you know, it's basically one guy.  And I think he has one part-time contractor somewhere like Germany.  And if you look at the amounts of data he pushes right now, I think he's pushing...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  1.6 billion entries delivered so far.  And look at that counter turn, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this is all, you know, basically the same work that somebody like Twitter is doing.  So it's pretty incredible that he's pushing right now, I think about half of, about 50%  of the amount of data daily that Twitter pushes, which is about 25 million feeds.  I think Twitter is around 25 million updates today.  I think Twitter is around 15 million.  And it's just one guy basically.  So as an engineering feed, I really respect that.  No kidding.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No kidding.  And this is part of the, this is part of the tooling that's going to be needed, kind of  the piping that's going to be needed for real time everywhere eventually, where just data  is constantly flowing in two directions, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the main point, the reason why this is relevant, I think for anybody out  there who's wondering what the heck is real time about is it's just, it's a question of  engagement scores.  So if you take any updates and you watch the impact it has, if you can push it out immediately,  it's going to have a much higher probability of actually engaging your audience.  And if there is delay, and this is really what we're talking about here is improving  engagement.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's exactly what we saw.  The reason we do this live now, we still allow, encourage people to download the majority  of people still download all of our shows.  But I feel in the long run engagement exactly goes up as people are participating in this  show as it's being produced.  Go ahead, Jeff.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm sorry to mean it.  Well, doesn't it help too that if you have these various feeds in one place, it enables  new kinds of analysis to help you prioritize the feeds and and whatever that name of that  iPad app is, link out to other things and display them in new ways that you're not trapped  in one feed and one client.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  This is what we always wanted from Twitter.  All Twitter ever really gave us was search.  But really, what we'd like to do is analyze it and say, you know, I mean, I guess Twitter  trends now is kind of going part of the way there.  But it seems like there's so much data that this third parties should be able to have  their way with it and come up with interesting.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So Leo, what is the name of that new app?  Flipboard, is that what it's called, Gina?  Flipboard, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's actually the first app that's made me want an iPad.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is this thing so wonderful or is it just a Scobal moment?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jury's still out.  Feels like a Scobal moment, doesn't it?  You know, and as I said, I'm using it only as a one legged user.  It's beautiful.  I mean, it has that going for it.  But because I'm only using it.  Let me pull it up and I can show it to you.  Only using it as a as a Twitter thing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Does it do analysis of the feed in or is it just give you it is just go in and fetch the links?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Good question. I don't know.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It looks like it's just a really nice browsing experience.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a pretty way to look at it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, with with images and links, it looks like if someone tweets a link.  Now, I'm saying this, I don't own an iPad and I haven't actually tried it.  I just watched the video and kind of drooled a little bit.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Watch this. You know, this is cool.  See, there's no. When are we going to stop?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We didn't know, you know, we're turning the page.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's just like paper.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Wow. It's pretty.  Just like the old days. Remember that mod?  We used to have pages.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is exactly the stuff Jeff hates.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's so whimsical.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'll tell you, the other problem right now is it's getting so much press  because of the big influx of money and so forth that I can't sign into my Twitter account.  It's a new way to get a fail whale.  It is is what it is right now.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And it's the beauty of fail whales.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let me see if I can sign in now.  I've been trying all morning to sign into this darn thing, and it's just not been.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Today, if things be that Google News was down, Facebook stories,  their whole new thing was down.  So there's bad karma today.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Can't connect to Twitter. Yeah, it's broken.  So I'm sure it's wonderful. It's pretty.  Just, you know, I mean, this really this really defines the iPad experience.  It's pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they said something online about adding new users and waves  that they're just being hammered right now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, obviously they're being hammered.  Well, that but what that does show you is there is a huge amount of interest  in these in these kinds of things.  We are interested in getting information in new ways.  We are interested in parsing that information.  And I think we're this is actually how the conversation got started  before we went on the air.  I'm getting the feeling that there is some more engagement happening with Buzz.  People are finally starting to get around to finding out about Buzz  and participating in Buzz.  And you're you said a number that is unverified,  but would be astounding if true that there's what?  10 million active users daily.  No, you didn't say that, did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's just a rumor I heard.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That would be stunning.  What is Twitter? Is it 100 million?  80 million, 85 million.  I can't remember what the daily actives is on Twitter.  10 million would be truly mind boggling.  That must be the Gmail number.  Or maybe because of Gmail, it has that kind of a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Well, you would expect, you know, Buzz to have a pretty high number  just because of the fact that it's embedded in Gmail.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's it's of.  Have you noticed this, Gina?  Well, I do know us because Gina is now in it.  She was just porting her tweets to it.  Now she actually buzzes.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Once in a while, once in a while.  So I still need it to be in my Google Apps account.  Yeah. But I can't do that yet.  Not yet. Not yet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I'm a I'm a it's been a long time coming.  Yeah, I'm a buzz fan. I still like it.  I like the engagement and the conversation that goes on in buzz.  And it is the first place I check now.  I do not check Twitter particularly often.  Really? Yeah.  Really? I'm just a weirdo.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think there's a value in having threaded  conversations where you can follow a conversation that's connected.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know. So yeah, but it depends on the quality of the conversation.  I guess I'm really dumb and dorky conversations going in buzz.  And so people, I'm sure, are mad at me that I don't join in,  but I kind of think I'll go to another cocktail party.  Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That hasn't that hasn't turned off Leo before.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm used to dumb and dorky.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm used to dumb and dorky.  In March, PC World says that according to RJ Metrics,  Twitter showed number of Twitter users at 75 million.  That sounds about right. Yeah.  Is that daily? Is that daily?  Monthly? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I bet you that's monthly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's monthly is the number that Facebook uses.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It says between 10 and 15 million active Tweeters.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A day. No. I'm guessing.  Well, if you're active, you're going to tweet daily. I mean.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, what's the definite?  I think I think we have 500 million number for Facebook.  That's monthly. That's monthly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. By the way, that tonight,  Diane Sawyer will interview Mark Zuckerberg and become the 500 millionth

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Facebook user. That's all friender.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think it'll be an actually good Zuckerberg interview?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Forgive me if I'm skeptical.  I have never heard of a good interview.  He won't sweat. I can almost almost guarantee you there will be no sweat.  Richard Nixon moment.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I have faith in Diane. I have faith. I'm holding out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You think showmakers make him sweat?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't know. I don't know.  I'll be I'm going to watch it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I wish it were Barbara Walters. They cry.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Why are you Mark Zuckerberg like a tweet?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What kind of story would you be?  But I think that the Facebook bashing is getting to be predictable and boring.  That's why I stopped it.  I didn't. I I will.  There were three stories this week that I blogged, you know,  about about positive Facebook news, and every one of them,  the reporter has to find some way to take it to a slap in a snipe. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Here's a metric from our chat room.  The TPS tweets per second  and the average TPS is 750.  But during the final of the World Cup, 3000 TPS, four times the normal rate.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's crazy. Superfeeder doesn't store the data, right, Yuri?  It just it just it's just kind of a middle server for passing the pings  back and forth for saying I've received the pings and I'm going to ping the subscribers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right. Yeah, I don't think they're currently storing the data. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what you're doing with Think Tank.  Do you have a new name, by the way? Should I call it something else?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Not yet. Not no new name yet.  Yeah, but you know, I'm not think tanks is purpose is definitely not to store  the fire hose, it's to store just the people you care about, your networks data.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, in fact, that's what  one of the things that when when people were begging for the fire hose last year  from Twitter, that's one of the things they said is, oh, you you can't handle the truth.  You can't handle the fire hose.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I wouldn't even want to try storing the fire hose.  It's just just just handling the pings at that rate is an incredible engineering feat.  But storing that data is like, you know, no one can do that except Google.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You store mine, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But I can store yours and I can store your friends and I can store your followers.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yes. And because you're storing it, you can analyze stuff, right?  Are you learning stuff with that data?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, exactly.  That's the kind of thing that we want to do.  Sentiment analysis and keyword frequency and keyword clustering and and just,  you know, trends amongst your social circle, that kind of thing.  It's all about your network.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Are you more interested in the human relations or the content relationships?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The content as it sort of comes out of the human relationships.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think that's this is where the power lies. Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But, you know, I mean, and that but that's for kind of a regular user,  for a user like the White House or, you know, I don't know, the city of New York.  It's about sort of connecting with citizens and coming up with policy ideas from that.  And that's a little bit of a different relationship. Right.  But like for me and my readers or Leo and his readers at U Jeff, like,  it's about friendships and relationships, you know, as more traditionally defined  versus fans of like some big brand.  But I think there's use, you know, both ways.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a very interesting tension because going on right now, because we all want this.  We all would love this information.  There's a huge monetary value in this information.  And yet there's this huge fear over privacy.  And this is why I'm sure Mark Zuckerberg continues to say over and over again,  we know you want to connect.  We just want to help you connect.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, Twitter, but that's the kind of knee jerk thing that happens here.  Twitter, you're publishing to the world unless you made it private.  You're telling the world that anybody can follow you unless you block them.  And so what privacy? Right.  You know, Facebook, I think is different because of and we've discussed  this the show before the notion that you're you're creating a closed society.  But as long as you can respect that  and, you know, on the issue that the people didn't really understand  the defaults and fine, fine, fine.  But, yeah, I think he's got a point.  I've seen two studies recently, one I've learned about one I didn't  that showed people who were given the opportunity to have more privacy than less.  And even though they'd say in their in their, you know,  if you ask them like a survey, oh, yes, I care very deeply about privacy.  They would not act that way.  In both cases, they were given discounts  to reveal information and they said, fine.  People yelled at me online that, well, they all lied.  Well, maybe so.  But but if they were trying to protest against privacy policies, they didn't like.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But that's the logjam.  That's the roadblock that keeps us from doing all these cool, neat,  wonderful things with aggregated data from people.  So maybe should we just get over it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think it's, you know, it's kind of pointless to argue  about whether public data or private data, you know, which one is better.  The, you know, fact is that  what we just need is for that to be a transparent consumer choice.  Then, you know, people will just make up their minds about it.  And I think there's a lot of evidence towards saying that, well, you know,  generally, individuals tend to get a lot of benefits by, you know,  opening up and being more public about.  I think we all attest to that as users, because, you know,  I'm assuming we all have public public streams and, you know, it helps us  get ahead in life, because, you know, it's just like before we started the show.  Leo, you were on your chat channel asking somebody a question, right?  Or just posting a question out there, which you wouldn't be able to do  if you had a very close group of people because they might not  just be online at the moment. Right. So.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  For example, because my God, Leo was showing his ignorance.  He was revealing something of himself.  I do that a lot. I was happy to do so because good things came in.  It does reward ignorance, doesn't it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Or at least a willingness to ask for help.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I've been reading this ridiculously thick book.  I'm sure off. Yeah.  The printing press as an agent of change.  And what was fascinating to me and I'm long as the other day  was that in the early days of books, they knew they were going to mess up.  The scribes had always messed up movable type. They messed up.  And so they got in the habit of having a rota and they it was  it was an open door to collaboration.  The knowledge that you were going to mess up and make mistakes  is what enabled people to correct and map makers.  This was a fascinates me. It's just like today on the Internet.  One map publisher would reward people who would go off and correct his data  and find new data and people would do projects and new kinds of things around it.  It was a very Wikipedia kind of thought.  And we turned books into stone sculpture.  And they really at the early days were wet clay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Isn't that interesting?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's just I'm fascinated by this stuff.  That's amazing.  There's a cultural attitude that comes with both privacy  and this notion of control and perfection and all kinds of things.  You're not going to get these benefits if you don't open up, as Yuri says,  and show your ignorance.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But, you know, I think public interaction sort of leads  to really high quality private interactions to Jeff.  Didn't you say that a friend of yours asked you a question about surgery  that maybe he or she couldn't have asked if they didn't know that you had gone through it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Recently. Exactly, Gina.  But but but it only happened because, as you say, I was public.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Public. Right. Right.  Because I mean, I would say that some of my higher quality interactions happen on Twitter,  you know, are from protected users or DMS that sort of get sparked from sort of from a public tweet.  You know, so I think there's definitely value in having those private channels.  Those private channels are very valuable.  But but but a lot of conversations can start with the public.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That was what Yuri is saying, too, is that the control is in your hands.  You know, what is what? This is an email.  The fact that they're asking an email means that I'm not going to reveal it.  I've had one email conversation, one Facebook conversation, and yesterday someone well known  sat down next to me in a meeting in the morning and wrote on a pad of paper that this person had just had a biopsy.  And the reason this person said it was because didn't she talk about your cancer?  Because of your blog. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  See, what's different is biologically, we're tuned to do that in a select case, you know, in shared intimacies.  This is something we've always had. We have shared intimacies.  It's a way of building intimacy.  Doing it in public kind of shorts.  It's a natural urge, but it short circuits that to and fro that that parody.  So you're sharing intimacy globally with people.  I mean, you would never have done that in the past.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, except that I could have written an article or something.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The means were there.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The means came along or the stage came along.  You were speaking to people who were strangers, right?  And you were making them less strange.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I guess your point is you're the modern man who lives, or person, I should say, who lives in public.  And what you're saying is look at the benefits I reap from living in public.  And are you saying that they outweigh the negatives?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm saying that every time we decide something, we should make the balance.  And that certainly it's your choice.  If people have prostate cancer and don't want to tell the world, I don't think I should out them.  There's no reason to, but that there is benefit to the individual, to the people they talk to.  And to the group to be revealing.  You know, crappy if I'm wrong here, but I think that if  gays had stayed in the closet because they were cowed to do that,  wouldn't have the rights we have today.  Now that led to a logic that said you should out people.  And I think that is going a bit too far.  Nonetheless, to convince people that there is benefit in coming out and being out  then leads to a greater benefit for the whole of the community.  And it, you know, the publicness is the, it's the weapon you have against those who would try  to make you stay secret.  And whenever something is revealed, it doesn't say so much about the person who reveals it.  If you're afraid of revealing, it's because people are bigoted around you.  It's a mirror.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's why Stonewall is so important.  That's why Rosa Parks is so important.  It's a public act.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So to me, the challenge for Facebook, the interesting challenge for Facebook,  I think Zuckerberg truly honestly believes this.  I really take him at his word on this.  That he does think an open world is a better world.  And I agree.  So the challenge becomes how do you sell that?  The same way Google has the challenge constantly of selling the idea  that shared knowledge is going to benefit everybody.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What about the cases, notorious cases of somebody being in public and becoming, being attacked,  whether it's Kathy Sierra or this poor 10 year old girl whose YouTube video was 4chaned and  and now she's getting death threats.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There are edge cases and there are bozos.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So those are edge cases.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But if we had to manage all life based on what could happen,  sorry, I'm going to go to my cave now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here's another sort of, you know, now that we all agree that, you know,  this is a personal choice that people should be allowed to make  and that there's clear benefits for probably both sides here.  But definitely, it's certainly for being public.  And Facebook's kind of, I think, behind Twitter here in the sense that, you know,  they started off with a private model and all of this commotion about Facebook's privacy issues  has to do with the fact that they are trying to, you know, little by little,  move the dial from private towards public.  Now, we've got another player in the picture, which is Twitter.  And since I'm coming to this because we talked about the Google Buzzfire house  and, you know, a major idea behind the entire web.  And if you go back to the starting days of Google, you know, and PageRank and Search,  the fact is Google was made possible.  Google couldn't be possible if all that data hadn't been out there on web pages publicly crawlable.  Right.  And if you look at what's going on right now, we have millions of people on Twitter who are  making the conscious choice of making their tweets public.  However, that data is then kept from becoming publicly crawlable.  My problem with Twitter is in a nutshell.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Very well said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well said.  And that's from like, you know, I'm a sociologist by training.  So from a societal perspective, I think, you know, Twitter, I know I have tremendous respect  for, you know, probably the entire management of Twitter, which just keeps getting improving  with better and better people.  But at this point, I strongly disagree with them because I think it's almost, you know,  if you claim, you know, what is their thing, be a force for good, then it arguably is one  of the key aspects of being a force for good to enable this data to be out there because  then other people can build the types of super feeders and whatever, you know, we've seen here  that will actually, you know, deliver more value based on that data.  And that's impossible if we have to make these backroom deals to access the firehouse.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So question to both you, Ieri, and to Gina.  What is the one thing you wish Twitter would do?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Open up the firehouse.  Yeah.  Well, we've been begging this of them for two years since Bearhug Camp.  I vividly remember this conversation going on.  And Facebook's the same way, by the way.  Facebook, well, now they allow you to keep that data longer, but they really don't open  that data up.  Of course, their problem is they have a compact with their users kind of not to open up that data.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, now they really kind of can't, especially now.  Yeah, that's the difference.  But Gina, is it just a question of getting the firehose?  You said that the expense of taking it is extreme.  Is there also an API to the stored database that you might need to pay for,  but that would enable you to do more valuable things?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, I mean, definitely.  Yeah, for me, it's less about the firehose and more about like if I've posted more than  3,300 tweets, I should be able to get all of them.  And right now you can't.  And it's kind of an artificial limit because it's a performance thing.  And they keep promising, hey, we're going to make this available eventually.  But right now, I couldn't just go to the API and get all of my tweets in 2007, right?  Because I posted more than 3,000.  And there are few limits like that.  You can't go back to all the tweets that have a particular keyword in them.  It only goes back a few days.  And a lot of people say, hey, it's a femoral.  That's the whole thing.  But that bugs me that that data is just sort of gone.  Especially my data, the stuff that I've posted.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Clearly, Twitter doesn't believe that or they wouldn't have given their data  to the Library of Congress.  They know it's not ephemera.  Yes, exactly.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, and the changes in the analysis matter.  It's that story I've talked about here before that Twitter is 97.3% accurate,  particularly in the success of movies at the box office.  There's data there that you want to compare and say how much more are people talking  about this or that.  There's news value there.  Larry Page says that data saves lives.  By keeping data out there about flu and health, we're going to save lives by knowing where  the gigantic epidemic is going to come from will save lives.  Well, I think at some point that's true of Twitter too.  Twitter saves lives.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Well, if you could analyze and say...  It did in Haiti.  Absolutely.  People were tweeting, I'm stuck under a building.  Save me.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Or if it's the analysis of data too that says, my God, look at the increase of the word fever  in this part of the world.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There you go.  But it's not.  And the thing is Twitter is just a little thumbnail of what all is possible here.  And that's the key.  And that's what's so interesting about having these emerging standards like PubSub, HubBub,  and Salmon and all of this stuff and the ability to stitch something together out of all of these  emerging standards and for developers to have access to this data so that we can see innovation  and see interesting things happen as a result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's the reason I'm frustrated, Leo, about this is that we've spent a lot of time  working out these standards and that's non-trivial work.  And there's a whole community of people out there, people with leaders like Chris Messina,  David Cornyn over at Facebook, great people at Twitter as well.  The issue is none of this work, none of the standards work has any value at all if we  don't have access to the data.  It's very frustrating to be working on this stuff and then just having people not see that value  because in the end what we want out of the internet as a whole and specifically the social web  is for it to continue to be this rife pool of crazy life forms emerging.  And that's just not possible unless you have that data out there and those standards on which  people can build.  So we can do stuff like, we were already talking about prediction, market prediction games.  Think about all the kinds of apps that you could build if you had access to all this  Firehose data through places like Superfeeder instantaneously for just playing around with  ways to predict stuff, anything from the stock market to these epidemics we're talking about.  That's like a huge potential there.  We have stuff like analytics for impact analysis.  How efficient are your tweets?  How do you optimize your publishing?  All that requires a lot of number crunching based on the statistics of all the aggregate  data out there.  So you can't build any of this stuff unless you have access to this data.  So what makes me very frustrated is that I see a huge tremendous business opportunity  that we're just beginning to scratch.  And it's not just business opportunity.  It's actual value for society at large.  And we really need access to this data in order to realize that potential value.  I think we're going to get there.  The idea is it's our data.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, we're pumping the data in and then there's this blockage.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Who owns the wisdom of the crowd?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In Twitter's case, the blockage is a technical one.  I don't think they're perhaps they're trying to figure out how to monetize,  but I think there's also technical issues involved as well.  I mean, you know, let's give them the benefit of the doubt.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There's another question here that I have for you guys.  There's some discussion, always has been discussion that Google should release the scrape database.  A lot of people do the crawling is kind of a waste.  That's a standard.  That's one level of the discussion.  The New York Times was talking about how, and I think this was so John Henry or another,  but they were talking about how the Google's too powerful, says the argument,  show me the line where it says what's powerful enough.  And thus the government should regulate its algorithm.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, boy.  That was a crazy article.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  It was insane.  But is there, but it's what you were saying.  There's some level where we're saying that there's an ethic of releasing things  and making them open because it's our stuff or because there's greater value out of it,  because it's a smart thing to do.  Where's that line?  If Google does the scraping, but it's scraping the web, that's our kind of web,  should they be revealing that so that others can build on it?  Would that be smart for them to do?  I would say, here's my thought.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Here's my thought that the raw data belongs to all of us, that that is the public resource.  But that just as you should be able to patent an innovation, I think people should be able  to innovate and feel like they can generate value out of that innovation by protecting it.  You add value in your algorithm.  So if Gina wanted to say, I'm not going to tell anybody how Think Tank works,  but the raw data is available and the results she might want to sell, I think that's fine.  I think that that's how innovation happens.  People are much more likely to do it if they can benefit from it, don't you think?  Maybe there's a patent system though, some sort of expiring kind of protection.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Google just got a patent.  This is a fascinating reverse here.  Google got a patent, it's on the friend feed, for revealing topics in which there's inadequate  content, not enough content, which of course is the demand media model where they go looking  for that to see the opportunity for creating SEO valuable content.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Sounds like a defensive patent, maybe.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Exactly.  So the speculation is that Google will open that up to the world, which just kills demand media  and says, hey, whole world, fill in these blanks in the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And that's kind of fascinating to me where it's a turnaround to saying that by having  this analysis and opening it up, which is only speculation, and by the way, Matt Cutts  and Hal Varian are two of the members of the patent team.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.  Well, they're the anti-spam guys, right?  Yeah.  So what does the acquisition of MetaWeb say to all of this?  Actually, let's take a break and come back.  We're going to talk about MetaWeb, the redesign of Google News and the big, big announcement,  the redesign of Google Images.  And of course, we've got your pics, your numbers.  I've got a tip.  We've got some Android news as well.  It's all with lots of stuff to talk about.  And we have about another 25 minutes to half an hour to talk about it.  Yuri Engestrom is here.  He is a former Googler, founder of Jaiku, and now a man about town.  His blog is engestrom.com.  Gina Turbani from smarterware.org, buzzmachine.com's Jeff Turpani.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You've been meaning to tell you something, Leo, yes.  Oh, boy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis is here.  More coming up in just a bit.  We do want to thank our friends at Citrix who are sponsoring the show today.  Citrix creates a great array of remote access products.  Some of the best out there, of course, is Citrix Enterprise.  Many of you will know and use in business.  Go to Meeting.  Go to My PC.  And for those of you in support, go to Assist.  Go to Assist.com.  You can find out more about it.  In fact, if you go to gotoassist.com slash twig right now, you get 30 days absolutely free.  Go to Assist.  This is really designed at the support professional.  Really a useful tool.  But I have to say, as somebody who supports family and friends, I find it useful too.  They've got day passes for people like me so I can once a month get a day pass and fix  everybody's computers and move on.  But if you do this day to day, you're going to really want to take a look at the monthly  subscription.  It is cost effective, easy.  It lets you fix the problem without being there in person.  You can view another person's computer online and control it so you can resolve the technical  issues quickly.  It's remote access put to its best use, if you ask me, fixing other people's problems.  You can use Go to Assist right now by going to gotoassist.com slash twig free for 30 days.  Your clients do not have to have it installed ahead of time.  You just send them a link.  They follow that link to gotoassist.com.  Install the software.  30 seconds later, you're in and fixing the problem.  From then on, if you wish, you can have unattended access to that machine.  You can have up to eight sessions at once.  So it's great if you're starting a scan or an install.  You can move to the next machine and next and next.  You can even drag and drop fixes and files from your computer to theirs, which is really  great if you have malware bytes or something, you want to drag it over and scan their machine.  It also allows you to do an assay of what operating system is running, what software  is running in the background, including security software.  Mac or PC.  So you don't have to have a PC to fix a Mac or a Mac to fix a PC.  It really couldn't be better.  I just love what they've done with this program and I want you to try it absolutely free.  You'll increase revenue, reduce travel and support time, serve more clients,  become a support hero.  Go to assist.com slash twig.  Give it a try today.  I think you're going to find a lot of use for it.  Even if you're just the support person for your family and friends, go to assist.com  slash twig.  We thank Citrix for their support of GoToAssist.  So given what we've just talked about in all these subjects, MetaWeb makes a lot of sense.  What is this?  This is a semantic search startup.  What does this add to Google's portfolio?  Is it just a hire for the engineers or is this free base, this open shared database  of the world's knowledge that MetaWeb does?  Is this kind of part of what we're talking about here?  Yuri, are you familiar with MetaWeb?  Do you know what it does?  Anybody?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Uh oh, I lost sound.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yuri, I don't hear you.  Oh, did I turn you off?  No, you're still there.  Are you there?  There he is.  Okay, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  MetaWeb obviously is assigning machine readable meaning to the web and operates free base.  But I don't have intimate knowledge of the details of that acquisition.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It could be that Danny Hills was the point, the guy who started it.  It could be that the free base is the point.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It seems like a general overall trend of interest towards structured data for Google, right?  On top of the travel database, I mean, there have been a few stories like this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's pretty clear that Google realizes a mere index of web pages is not a good business going  forward. You need to do more with the data that you're getting. You need to have more data.  You need to be able to look into the dark web. You need to get things like travel information.  You need to be able to put that information together for your customers to provide a better  experience. That's what Bing kind of forced Google into, I think. That's kind of the idea  behind Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. I think we're seeing, I haven't heard many people talk about Wolfram Alpha recently,  but there's something here that would suggest that Google is sort of thinking about ways to  sort of maybe perhaps venture into the same space and do it their own way, obviously.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I guess MetaWeb is like Wolfram Alpha, isn't it? In that sense.  It's understanding more data.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Whatever happened to Google Base?  I haven't heard that in a long time.  Yeah. Google Base. Remember that?  What was that?  I'm looking at it now. Yeah, it was a structured database, a way that you could do  real estate listings and job listings. I just went to base.google.com and it says Google Base  beta. I'm getting a sign into Merchant Center. But this seems like something similar to Google Base,  which I haven't heard a whole lot about. I remember writing it up on Lifehacker quite a long time ago.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, I think it's different, Jada. Google Base was that you could submit data that was then  searchable in a new way by Google.  Is that like null?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's what the difference is.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, you're right. You're right.  So it was knowledge.  It was knowledge. Well, null is more like a wiki, right? But base was more like a  spreadsheet or a database of data. But you created it and you entered the data.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So if you're an economist that had a huge big data set, you could put it in there.  Google would be able to chew on it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it classified ads seem to be the big thing that it could do, kind of like Craigslist.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's why the merchant login. That's why it's now going to Merchant login.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess I'm looking at the Wikipedia article. It says October 2009,  it was announced that Google Base's separate search page would be discontinued.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, one page not being discontinued, one page that's growing. Google image search, 10 billion  images served a day, 1 billion page views. Clearly, Google sees this as a very valuable  product. In fact, they had an event, a search event in San Francisco this week.  Marissa Meyer announced a revamp of Google images. It looks just like Bing.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It does. It looks very much like Bing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Google's getting Bing-ish.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm going to talk about what you can do with it in my tip.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, good. But we won't give that away.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I can't even give me that pretty stuff.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, okay. So do you not want me to talk anymore about this, but save it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, yeah, we can do it. We can do it now if you want.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, no, no, no. Save your tip. We'll talk about Google image search.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We're so sensitive about our little terms.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, don't mess with the tips, baby. Google energy bought its first property, wind power.  I love it that I have to think it's Larry and Sergey who are the activists here,  that they really want to promote their agenda.  And in this case, and it makes sense because Google's a huge consumer of energy.  Google energy agreed to purchase 114 megawatts of wind power per year for the next 20 years.  So they locked it in with the Iowa wind farm called NextEra Energy Resources.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I saw a tweet, and I didn't see a source for it from our friend Siva,  that I believe said that 10% of the energy in the electricity in the US is now used for computers.  Holy cow.  I don't know if that's true or not. I'm sure Siva wouldn't, but just didn't have a link.  But it says that that gives you an idea of the, this is enlightened self-interest for Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If they can get good clean power cheaper than coal,  it's better for nobody in the economy practically than them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They invested $38 million before there was a Google energy in NextEra Energy's  wind generation projects in North Dakota.  They also have bought startups like Alter Rock Energy, eSolar, and AlertMe.  So some of this is philanthropic and some of it is self-interest.  And it's nice if you can combine both.  Exactly.  Yeah. Yeah. The purchase of these wind megawatts actually is just blocking in their business costs.  Pretty interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. I mean, actually what they're purchasing is the RSCs, right?  They're not actually planning to directly use that energy.  Oh, they just get the credit.  Yeah. They're just buying the credits so that they can, you know,  Pollute.  Proceed on the way. Yeah, exactly. Become more carbon neutral.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's good. So really what they bought is carbon credits then.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You had an article on Buzz Machine. Google takes the FTC to school, Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It was kind of beautiful because Google, I've been arguing, has been trying to make friends  with people who only want enemies, that is to say newspapers.  Right.  And they've been, you know, working with kid gloves and working together and saying that since  they finally, the FTC, and I've talked about this on the show, came up with these ridiculous  suggestions from people who testified for how to fix the news industry, which is to say how to  rescue newspapers. And Google finally, I think, must have had it and wrote this wonderful  document that's a primer taking the FTC and the newspaper industry to school and just not taking  their bull anymore, not accepting the myths that search is bad. It kind of explained the industry  to them. There was this wonderful first paragraph that just said, or that I put on top of my post,  that just explained to them that we're in an abundance economy now, not a scarcity economy  anymore. Things have changed. It's never going to be the same. Deal with it.  And it was a very good document. I put the highlights on Buzz Machine.  Yeah, I like this.  It's about a 25 page document. It's a long document, but it's really very well done.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The current challenges face-  Read Jeff's post.  Yeah, it's a really, really good post. The challenges faced by the news industry are not  legal problems, they're business problems. And they can only be addressed with business solutions,  not regulation, things like that. Yeah. So this is in response to a discussion draft from the FTC  that would have what purpose?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, the FTC is out there contemplating what to do and the FTC could come along and do some very  dangerous things. Google's real goal is to not get them to support things like extending copyright  in ways that would support news organizations to go for this hot news doctrine that would  say that someone could own facts and news for some period of time, not to limit fair use,  not to enable newspapers to operate in antitrust and do price fixing or gang up on Google and  other aggregators to charge them with the support of government. These are the things that the FTC  is talking about in there. And though they're saying, oh, it's just discussion, we're not  endorsing anything, but it's what they chose to discuss. And Google finally sees danger there  and came up with a very strong, sensible, smart, well researched statement. And part of this is  just the history. It's like we're talking about books before. We've been here before. Newspaper  people thought the radio was going to ruin the world and TV was going to ruin the world. Now the  internet's going to ruin the world. Well, it's the world. Interesting. The Guardian calculates

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  that the Times Online, which put up its paywall recently, has lost 90% of its readership.  The number of people, that's a one quarter of people landing on the Times  registration page sign up, but that the website is now receiving just 4% of the UK's online  newspaper visitations. So clearly the paywall is not a solution that the Rupert Murdoch hoped it

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  would be. Well, they all say that they don't know yet and they were still talking. Or they don't care.  Maybe they're happy with 10%. That they would get the 10%. But it clearly is not a strategy for all  and for the future. And I still think it's a surrender by Murdoch. He didn't have any new  ideas for advertising. He didn't have any new ideas for growth. And so he's retreating, which is odd  for a guy who's normally so macho. So I think that the Guardian was looking at this further.  Other times people will say back to the Guardian, well, the Guardian is losing a fortune. They

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  haven't figured it out either, which is true. So more revisions in the Google News site, not in  response to this, but in fact in response to user and reader complaints. They're kind of cleaning  it up a little bit. I may be one of the few that actually uses news.google.com all the time.  I actually like it. I do too. Oh, okay. Good. I use it occasionally. I thought it was just me.  Okay. Is it like your homepage or what? No, but it's a place I go for my beat check.  So in fact, there's two places I go for my beat check pretty much regularly. One is TechMeme  to see what people are talking about. And TechMeme still is pretty valuable, pretty good.  And then so that gives me the human. It wasn't human powered for a long time, but it is now  human powered. But human powered in the sense that it's kind of saying here's what people are talking  about versus the kind of purely mechanical results that I get from news.google.com. But I do like to  check it because it does tell me at least what the stories are. I guess the difference is,  it's not so much how many... Google news seems to be how many stories there are and these are the  most written about stories and TechMeme seems to be these are the most talked about stories,  things people are really caring about. So I think that's a good combination, the two of them together.  How many RSS feeds do you tend to go through? I still do go to Reader. I have a Google section.  So before I do the show, I will go to reader.google.com and look at the Google section,  which is all the Google blogs, all a thousand of them or whatever it is. There's some unknown  huge number of them. And then a few sites like Fandroid and stuff that cover Google products.  It's really kind of getting bigger all the time now.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I had kind of a fun experience this week. I did a post about Google Voice. I've been covering this  sort of Google apps accounts catching up to regular Google accounts for a while. Yes, yes.  And so I had a reader. So I kind of worried aloud about, I said, well, I don't mind exporting all  my data from one account and importing it to another. But Google Voice is one of those things  that I was worried, how am I going to get my number from my old Google account to my Google  apps account? And so a reader of mine said, hey, there's this form that Google set up and you could  just issue a request. And so I tried it and it worked. They transferred my number. So I did a  post about it and then Lifehacker picked it up. And then I got a voicemail from the Google Voice  product manager. Really? And I don't give out my number very much. I'm kind of protective of my  phone number. And my first thought was, how do you get my number? And then I thought, oh, he's Google.  He knows all. He's the Google Voice product manager. Yeah. So anyway, long story short,  the form doesn't work for everyone. And they've just been doing it for a small subset of accounts.  But there will be a way to port your Google Voice number over to your apps account once the app stuff  they're testing does go live. And they're also testing multiple sign in from, so like you're in  one browser window and you say, hey, I've got these two Google accounts. You can assign into them at  the same time and switch them using a dropdown. I think that's also in our friend feed this week.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Good. Good. Good. You know, I've gone back and forth on the iPhone 4 and I finally just gave up  and I've bought the Droid X and I am really liking this. I really am. It's a nice big screen. I  think I'm now converted. The Evo started the process, but once you get used to having a  4.3 inch screen, it's kind of hard to go back to the smaller screens. And I just kind of get all

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  your apps there. That's the key thing for me. It's like, you know, I find it hard to  not get some of the apps that I rely on. So I'm curious. Well, it depends what your apps are,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  obviously, but I get the apps that I want, I guess. Mint, Recall, which I use as my to-do list,  is on Google. Seismic I use, Foursquare. Bump, Evernote, Audible has a great app,  which I use all the time, LastPass, Pogo Plug and Dropbox, Yelp, Zagat, Trippet. You know,  I would say Major League Baseball. It's interesting. There's a really large selection of  apps on here now. Pandora, Skype. This unfortunately comes with a lot of Motorola baggage on it, which

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  is too bad. That's what Gizmodo did a pretty good review and said that the kind of default  apps were really, that the home screens were super cluttered and you had to clear away all  this other stuff. And there's also the issue- Well, I'm going to talk about that in just a little bit.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'll tell you how you can fix that. Oh, okay. Okay. And the eFuse?  You know, that's an interesting issue and it hasn't been confirmed. Initially, they said it  bricks the phone if you try to root it. And now, you know, I was going to do it on the show,  but nobody's got a root for it yet. So I have to wait. But once the Cyanogen ROM comes out or a  root comes out for the DroidX, I will be glad to do this on my DroidX just to see what happens.  What Motorola says is, first of all, it's not eFuse. That's a trademark name that I think IBM  came up with. It's nothing like that. They said to protect- and actually, I think this is legitimate.  To protect the user, if the baseband of firmware has been modified or some of the key firmwares  modified, it boots into recovery mode. And from there, you can boot back, you know, get a standard  firmware and boot back to it. It does not brick it. It just forces it into recovery mode. You know,  of course, I want it to be an open phone. And I think if people want an open phone,  they should get a Nexus One before they run out because Google has stopped selling them.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, they sell them. Carriers will have them, Christobona said.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Really? Yeah. I love the Nexus One. I think the incredible is pretty close. But the thing about  the Nexus One is it's pure. It's pure Google experience. There's no crap from a carrier on  it. It's pure. And it's the only phone running 2.2. Yeah, although, not Eris, this is supposed to get  to August 15th, DroidX. Oh, that's soon. Yeah, that's what they told me at AT&T. I'm counting on  that. AT&T? Yeah. Verizon, sorry about that. That's one of the main selling points, by the way. It's  not AT&T. I've been very happy with it. I like the big screen. What about the rumors that LTE is  going to be out this fall? Well, then I'll have to get another phone, won't I? There's also rumors  flying now that Verizon's about to do tiered data as AT&T does. And I imagine everybody's been  watching carefully with AT&T to see if there are howls of pain. And since there haven't been any,  everybody would like to do tiering on their data plans. So I think that's what you're going to see  on every phone company. One phone company or two maybe that also runs, maybe Sprint and T-Mobile  will probably be holdouts on this, right? Say, no, no, we'll still give you all you can eat.  But I have a feeling that Verizon and AT&T for sure, maybe Sprint as well, will do tiering  sooner than later. Kindle's on this. And of course, all the great Google apps that I love,  Shopper and Goggles and Gesture Search and all of that. I'm really a fan of Android.  I went back to the iPhone 4 just briefly just to see. The antenna issue really did hurt me. I was  getting a lot of dropped calls. And I really missed Android in the power of Android. I got

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  permission to get one for my birthday. Happy birthday. He's got an iPhone 4 everybody.  I got it. And I think I kind of have to have it. My wife looked at me dubiously when I said that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I think you do. I have one. I'm not going to give it back.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think I do for school and everything, the video particularly. But yeah, the thrill was gone. It  just said, okay, so it's just another phone now. Yeah. They haven't really advanced the art

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  in significant ways. No. And in fact, I think at least in a couple of areas, notifications is one,  screen widgets is another. They feel a little antiquated. I wish I could customize the screen  more on the iPhone. It's a beautiful screen, but it's just a stack of icons are now folders.  And I feel like actually Apple is very much in the situation they were in 1994,  or maybe even earlier, early 90s when they had a huge lead because of Mac OS. And Microsoft was  chugging along, chugging along, finally came out with Windows 3.0, then Windows 3.1, then Windows  95, and it effectively achieved parity. And I think what you're seeing here is the analogy I  make. I really feel like the iPhone is very much like OS 7 was, System 7 was. And the Android is  very much like Windows it was. It's catching up and it's iterating much more quickly than Apple.  Apple can only iterate yearly. Android is iterating monthly practically. New handsets  all the time. An interesting new hardware. You've got a variety of hardware, which is part of the  power of the PC platform. You could put Windows on a variety of different hardware and that  diversity really helped the PC world. Apple was only on Apple stuff. And I think that that's a  very close analogy. I also feel like there's a little roughness, rough edgedness to Android  that some Mac people say, oh, I miss the elegance of Apple. And I think that's very much like  System 7 versus Windows 95. But I think it's very clear that Android is catching up. And in fact,  if you look at installed base, Android is gaining rapidly on even the iPhone 4 as well as that sold.  Far more Android handsets are being sold right now.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Number of the week.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I won't say it. I won't say a word. I won't say a word. So I didn't think this would happen. I  thought I was going to go back to the iPhone 4 and it was the reception issues that finally did it  for me. And yeah, there's two applications I miss. We Rule and Words with Friends. They're better  games, I'm sorry to say. Much better games on the iPhone. Has anyone made an app that allows you to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  just like copy all your apps, basically one for one from the iPhone to the Android and vice versa

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  if you wanted to switch? You mean an emulator? Wouldn't that be cool? An iPhone emulator?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Never happen. If I switch phones, I could just copy my experience.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, I see what you're saying. To me, that's a real strength of Android is that you can move from  phone to phone and take your apps with you with AppBrain or Froyo lets you. I think Froyo lets you  do that. What is it? Is it a Froyo thing, Gina? I can't remember. I had to reinstall all my apps,  but I just went to AppBrain and I said I have a new phone and I was able to very quickly get

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  all the apps moved over that I had. Yeah, just say install all. I think that app data gets,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm not sure. I'm not sure if apps go. There is some good Motorola stuff on here. There's a  backup program that backs up all of your apps and files onto the SD card. I think that's kind of nice.  There's a Blockbuster app. Who cares? Need for Speed Shift. I have to say, it isn't that you  can't write a good game on Android because this game is amazing on Android. We were having a  little debate on MacBreak Weekly over that. I don't know how hard it is to develop for Android,  but I have to say it's clear that you can make a very good game. Need for Speed Shift on the  DroidX is really pretty spectacular and plenty fast. All in all, I'm very happy. Battery life  is the only sticking point as always. Jeff, has your experience with battery life been  pretty good on the iPhone 4? It has been on mine. I'm sad to say. I haven't been using it enough.  Yeah, I wish I had that kind of battery life on this thing. It barely gets to the day.  Better than the Droid?  Yeah, the DroidX is... The problem with all of these is you use them so much. The screen is always  on because you're always playing around with it. I don't know if it's a good test really. Maybe as

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I get used to it. Anyway, a little thumbnail. My master plan is to have the iPhone and then  get the DroidX. That way I get a Verizon and I still have a GSM phone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's my master plan. That's exactly what I did. That's exactly what I did.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Will you carry the iPhone still?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No. That's for international travel. Did you get a bumper?  Yeah, I had to get a case and it still didn't help.  It still didn't help?  Well, in New York you probably don't have this problem, but I'm not in a good area for AT&T.  It just drops calls like crazy. That was what finally did it for me. I dropped my fifth call  in two days and I was like, I can't. I cannot do this. I'm dying here.  It is a phone.  It's a phone first. If it's not a phone, what is it?  All right. I'm just going to play the Need for Speed. You guys continue on with the show,  will you?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, I want to see this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It is an awesome, awesome game, I have to say. It's a lot of fun.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm already afraid for my productivity.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, are you going to get a DroidX as opposed to... I mean, I still... Every time I pick up  the Nexus One, I go, boy, this still is a great phone.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So does this not run? Oh, this doesn't run. You can't install this on the Nexus One? Is that  the deal?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know. This just came on the Motorola.  Oh, it just came on it. Interesting.  I haven't tried it on anything.  That looks really good.  Oh, it's fantastic. The big screen really makes it a lot of fun. It's got an accelerometer.  Yeah, that looks really fun.  Just like the iPhone. I think the graphics clearly keep up. Oh, I just shattered the windshield.  Oh, no. I'm not a good driver. It's really fun.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm going to be heartbroken if this isn't in the market. My phone's in the other room.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'll go check for you. You like driving games?  I do.  Look what I did with the windshield.  I spidered it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It doesn't look stuttery at all.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No. No, the frame rate is quite good. I mean, I don't know if you can see how the resolution  is not... It's not super, super, super, super good, but let me see if I can...  Where's the camera? There it is. I'll get it a little bit closer.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  There.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's so nice.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's definitely playable.  Oh, it's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that looks really fun. I'm mesmerized.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay. I just brought the show to a halt. I grinded it to a halt. Let's check on AppBrain  whether it's available on other platforms. But I guess the point is... And somebody... John Gruber  was on MacBreak Weekly yesterday and he said a developer friend, a well-known developer friend  of his said, it's very hard to develop for Android because of bugs in the OpenGL implementation that  are different on each platform. And that makes a lot of sense. So it may be...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This mixed platform thing is going to be...  It's going to bite them.  It's going to be the problem. Yep.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But again, it's why they can iterate so fast. So it is both the strength and the weakness of it.  And Microsoft had this problem in the early days of PCs and Microsoft had to act very aggressively  to do things like DirectX and make sure that there was a standard... This is what Google's  going to have to do is say, no, look, we've got to have a consistent, reliable OpenGL implementation  that can be written to across all platforms. Screens... Differences in screen sizes, I don't  think is the issue. I think the problem really is because it's a cell phone, you've got carriers  and manufacturers modifying it. And they can't stop that because it's open. And I think that's  the real problem. But, boy, we've come a long way, haven't we, Yuri, since the early days of Nokia?  I mean, these phones are very powerful. Nokia looking for a new CEO, in fact, because they  have just been suffering against the iPhone. Share price is down 40% since April.  Yeah. It's too bad. I mean, they have Symbian, which is, I think, a very nice OS. They've got  Maemo, which I haven't been too happy with on the N900. It's a little heavyweight for a portable  device. But they've got some useful stuff. And, of course, they still sell more handsets than

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  anybody in the world. So this is an interesting step, by the way, where we're talking about  developing for these different mobile platforms that I just picked up on Twitter, where the months  to mastery for a developer to master a mobile platform, Symbian 15 months, iPhone seven and a  half months, Android only five months. So where did that come from? Let me check.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Need for Speed Shift is, in fact, in the Android market. Gina, you can get it.  TechCrunch. Interesting. Yeah, they're both, you know, I mean, Gina is a real developer. I'm just  a toy. But Gina and I have both been learning Android. I don't find it a particularly difficult  learning curve. Java is very straightforward. I think a lot of people have trouble with Objective  C. There are a lot more Java developers out there. A lot of people know Eclipse. It's not difficult  to use the framework. I think it seems very strong. I don't know if it's buggy, but it seems like it's  got a lot of features. The library seemed very, very well developed. You got a great bunch of  people working on it. It's a mature OS. I would expect it to be competitive. So just for the source

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of that information, this is a research report by Vision Mobile called Developer Economics 2010,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  and it's free, available online. Very interesting. Cool. All right. Any, let's see, any other big  stories that I've missed? There are quite a few. I have so many tabs open, I can't even see now.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Which one is the big one? You mentioned the

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Apple's big earnings, I guess we could say that there is no doubt that Apple is still a very strong  player and getting stronger all the time. In a way, that is validation of their closed platform.  I think people perceive it as more secure, safer, perhaps more elegant and yet, yet, ironically,

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  the US Special Forces, the latest story on the FriendFeed, has selected Android to be their

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  platform for experimentation. Oh, that's interesting. Yeah, this is the app that I want. It's called RATS.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They have one called RATS, Raytheon Android Tactical System. Can I get it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Does it allow me to do pilot Predator drones? So you could pick up aerial images for unmanned

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  aircraft and satellites and then focus it on details such as license plates on cars and  facial features and then you can follow or buddy a device. So you can follow, for example,  a plane and constantly watch what it's doing and track the locations of other members of this crew.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  According to Raytheon's Vice President of Business Development, Mark Bingham,  Android was selected due to its open source nature, which made developing applications easy.  So there. There you go. There are rewards. You know, I think that there's proof is in the  pudding. And look how fast the Android marketplace is growing compared to the iPhone marketplace.  And in fact, at this pace, it's in a year, there'll be more apps on Android.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, but again, I think the problem remains that quantity and quality is going to win.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I have to say, as somebody who does both, that most at first, a year ago, that was a big  complaint was I can't get mint. I can't get recall. I can't get audible. I can't get a lot  of things that I want on Android. But for the most part, those have disappeared.  Yeah, that's true. That's true. The big apps that I really need are available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Another interesting stat that I just read on Twitter yesterday was, I don't know if you guys  noticed this, but a prediction that by the year 2012, I believe there was going to be a bigger  market in the app stores in Middle East and Africa than in North America.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and that's again, where open development is going to really help  these developers around the world be a part of this. You know, 99 bucks to become part of the  Apple developer team and you have to have a Macintosh. I mean, you can develop for  Android on Linux, Mac or Windows equally well. That by itself should make a difference, right?  Yep.  All right. Enough of that. Let's move on. We are going to get our number and our tool  and our tip of the week. Let's start with Gina Trapani because I'm dying for a tip on Google

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Images. Google Images has been revamped and it's rolling out slowly. I am getting it.  Jeff says he's not getting it. I hear that if you go to the official Google blog and you click on  the link in their post about it, that it'll set the cookie or do whatever it needs to do.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Tulips like I've always gotten tulips.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. Tulips like you always get tulips. Oh, that's too bad.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Look at that. And not only that, it's an endless stream of Gina Trapani.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. It's an endless scroll. And it's got keyboard shortcuts, right? So if you hit page down,  it'll just, you know, you'll just keep getting more images and you never have to click to the  next page. If you hover over it, you get a little zoom up. It kind of, you know, yeah, the thumbnail  fills in, you get a little caption with some more information. And then if you click on it,  you'll see the image in context of the page that you found it. I just love this.  With a little kind of overlay. It's a really, it's a really nice update. And a thing that I hadn't  realized, but they pointed out in the post about this is that you can specify what color you want  to see. So like if I search for tomatoes, I can say I want to see green tomatoes. I want to see  red tomatoes, yellow, black and white. And it's pretty incredible. See, yeah, if you go to see,  if you see the color palette there below black and white, it even works with pictures of people.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So these are predominantly yellow pictures that I get when I search for Gina Trapani.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Isn't that bizarre? But it actually works. Yeah. Yeah. So that's a really kind of fun little widget  as well. But yeah, I'm liking the paging down, paging up and down and the tiling, the images are,  the thumbnails are just denser. So you get a lot more images on one page. And if I just want

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  pictures of your face, I click face and it just gives me face pictures. This is, this is so cool.  Plus I can get social results. I'm not sure how that's different, but.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  What'd you click on? Social search. I guess it's just Facebook. These are Facebook results. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Interesting. Yeah. Any size, medium, large icon, larger than exactly any type, face, photo, clip

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  art. Here's all the Gina Trapani clip art. Wait, Gina, you've got a lot of glossies in there.  You have an acting career. You haven't told us. Look at this. Look at this. If we get, if we get

Transcript:  Gina, they should have headshots. Here's Gina's headshots. This is her acting. I want the hairdos

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  through the time. I know. Yeah, this is fascinating. Hair throughout the ages. I'm sorry to make you

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  the subject of this, Gina. I know. I'm blushing over here. I got a needle stuck into the middle of it.  Well, there's just weird, every once in a while there's some weird. There's something weird.  Like there's Bill Gates with the crazy glasses, but it says your name. This says my name. Well,

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  there you go. Yes. You can see my bad hair through the years. You have great hair. What

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  are you talking about? I like the cute pixie-ish look a lot. I do too. Everybody loves Gina Trapani.  Just get over it. Oh man. Get over it. All right. Who else should I search for? Let's see. Let's do.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Let's search for Joan from, Joni from Mad Men. Joni, what's her name? I think it's,  what's the actress's name? I'm not sure what the actress's name is. Well, I'll just search for Joni

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  from Mad Men. It's coming back this week, right? Oh, don't we love her? Very excited. Joan Holloway.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  She is my favorite. And if you specify red, you know, she's a redhead. She's going to only be red.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In fact, it looks like we got that anyway. Yeah. Geez. This is just Joan in red. I wonder if I  specify a green, if we'll get. Yeah, there's some, some Betty White pictures too, somehow just snuck

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  in there. Isn't this incredible? It's fun. You can spend some time with the new image search.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's really neat. I love it. Very, very good tip. And so you're actually the real tip is if you go  to the Google blog and click on the link there, it'll set the cookie and you can have this. You

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  can own this. Jeff, did that work for you? That's what they, that's what my, my informants on Life  Hacker were saying, but I'm not sure I hadn't tried it. Which blog is it on? It's on the official  Google blog and the post is, I think it's one down on the page. Oh, Google images presents.  Sorry. So I clicked on the tulips. Yeah. You can click on the leopards.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Did you get it? Awesome. There you go. Cool. And by the way, and this is really why they  might've to make this a big announcement. Notice the ads for tulips at the top.  And they really, here's the weird thing. Oh, I'm sorry. They see this as an opportunity to make a

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  lot of money, obviously. Yeah. The leopard's example is really neat too. Let's look at that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Go ahead, Jeff. When I search for me, which of course is the first thing I do,  I don't get me at all. Well, you got to work on that. I don't get photos. So then I go and face

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  and I get everybody but me. See now, because I did a certain kind of search, it narrowed down the  options in the left, but I can go back to reset tools and I'll get all the other tools. Yeah,

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Jeff, I have a page full of you. There's a great photo of you making the funniest things.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Now we got to do Jeff Jarvis. I hate from Scoble. Scoble took it. It's the one that's everywhere.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm looking really sour. Yeah, there you go. Which one? The one where he has his hands up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This one? I like this one. Yeah, that one. I like that one. Yeah.  Wow. Wow. That's from the Neiman journalism lab. Wow. What would Google do? Wow. I love it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The one I hate is on the top row, third from left.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That is not a good picture. That's the Scoble picture. And it's the one that ever is on my

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Wikipedia. It's what everybody uses. And I hate it. It looks like we've got a doll on the rear end.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because he made a creative comments. The key is to have somebody.  Somebody has to take a good photo to make you create a comment. That's true.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think you look very distinguished in that, Jeff.  I hate it. I love there's a Jeff Wirtle in here. And I love that we're Googling ourselves.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I'm going to do Leo. Google.me. Leo, do yourself. No, no, no, no, no, no.  I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader. Your number of the week, Mr. Jarvis.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's a nice fate there, Leo. Oh yeah, we're out of time. Can't look for myself. All right.  So John Battelle did some analysis of the numbers out there on the sales of the phones  and says that three million iPhones sold in 23 days works out to 130,000 phones a day.  But Google has announced that they're activating 160,000 Android devices every day, 30K more per  day. And he took another number and divided and found a hundred thousand dollar gap with  Android ahead. So he's figuring that iPhone can only slow down now and Android as it ends up on  more and more devices and more places, it's really going to speed up and Android's going to win on

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  market share. I truly think this analogy is apt. That Android is Windows and the iPhone is going  to be a narrow niche market for people who really want to spend a little bit more and care a little  bit more about fit and finish perhaps, or just want that feeling of superiority that they own  an iPhone. But this is going to be the smartphone for the masses. I have to think that. Smartphone

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  and device. It's going to power everything from tablets to cars to droids in Afghanistan.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because it's open, it's free. It'll be everywhere. And it's kind of interesting because  Apple has again dug this hole for itself. I remember Steve Jobs telling me when he was still at Pixar,  we had the lead when we came out in 1984 with the Macintosh and we didn't innovate fast enough  and Microsoft caught up. And I think history is repeating itself. I really do. So my pick of the  week is actually in response to getting this DroidX and not being so crazy about the Motorola  the Motorola Blur. All of these have launchers on them. The Nexus One is the only one that's just  pure Google launcher. There's the HTC Sense. There's a Motorola Blur. Samsung has its own.  The Blur isn't awful, but I just kind of missed my Nexus experience. And then I found a program  called Launcher Pro. Now this is free in the marketplace right now. And I have to warn you,  if you're going to put it on the Nexus One, you can go back and forth because the Nexus One gives  you access to the launcher in the apps. And so you can choose. But once you put this on Motorola,  there's no way to go back. One of the things I don't like about Motorola is that they don't  put their own applications in the application directory. And so you cannot change the default.  So perhaps not something you should do. I did it as an experiment. I'm very happy with it.  Launcher Pro Plus is out for $1.99, gives you some additional features. But look at one of the things  I can do. I can change this dock. I now have a scrollable dock with a variety of icons in  the bottom here. You can make it be just like the default dock, but you can do more with it.  Also, you might have noticed I have five rows of icons, which is great. And I've taken the labels  off the icons. So even though I have five rows, it's very spacious. You can have anywhere from one  to seven home screens. And it has a lot of additional features in the preferences for how  the appearance looks. There's a variety of different little switches, on-off switches,  and so forth. You could change the number of screens, the default home screen. You could turn  trackball on or off. You can control the dock. I have tried a lot of launchers and to always take  them off because they bog the system down and they make it a little bit odd. But the author of this,  I think he's done a very good job. His name is Frederico Carnales. And I think he's been  working on this for several months. And I think he's done just a superb job of this. There's some  very nice features that I think. And this is again, this is the advantage of an open system.  I can change the entire look and feel. So even though this is a Motorola Droid X, it doesn't  have any of the feel of the Motorola Droid. The Motorola widgets are still available, but they're  also in the Launcher Pro, some new widgets that he's putting out. I just think this is a very  nice feature. If you have a Nexus One, it's probably a no-brainer to at least try it out.  My caution to those of you who want to try it out on phones where you cannot change the default  launcher. You could tell that by the way, by going into the systems settings and running  applications. And if you can see and manage applications, if you can see the launcher,  then you can always go back to the launcher. But if you can't see the launcher in your list of  applications, a change to the launcher will require a resetting of the entire machine. You'll have to  reinstall everything. I don't currently want to. I'm very happy with this. This is Launcher Pro  from Federico Carnales. It is free $1.99 for the Pro version. I have not been able to download the  Pro version yet because he has a little bit of a bug in his downloader that is making it impossible  to install on the Droid X. But I've sent him a note, I'm sure he will. And he's working on some  really interesting additional widget features. And I'm sure with, you know, they're telling me  in the chat room if I use home switcher or something, I should be able to change the launcher.  And it's possible that I should be able to do that. I just haven't figured out ways to  mess around with that. But I haven't had much impetus to do that. Really cool. It's nice to  have a scrollable dock at the bottom there. Launcher Pro. That's my pick. We are out of time.  Yuri, I really want to thank you for joining us. As always, you add immensely to the conversation.  Thanks.  Yuri blogs at zengestrom.com.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And you're comfortable now, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I love it now. I'm much more comfortable with it. But I was all worried about hearing my own voice.  Yeah.
