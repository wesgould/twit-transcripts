Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think they're on there.  Oh, let's go to Cameo right now.  Before I do that, let's say hello to Aunt Pruitt,  host of Hands On Photography.  Now I'm gonna be-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute, we do need to check this out.  No, we can easily put that on a tricaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let's see.  Here's the chairman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry if I startled you with my weight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I searched for choir and I got Sharitza Mae,  Trisha Fukuhara, Big E at WWE Superstar,  Amy Phillips, television personality.  Tip unavailable.  Brandon Evans, an actress in P Valley.  I'm not sure I wanna know what that show is.  Pepper.  Oh, that's a great show.  Chrissy Teigen's culinary mom.  Tyler Oakley.  I don't-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These people can't sing.  I don't see choirs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Benny B's a hip hop artist.  We could do the hip hop version.  That would be no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Search on Mormon maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Really, really Jeff?  Tabernacle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, let's search on tabernacle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's only two tabernacles and neither one-  On one pops up, really?  He's a preacher in hip hop personality.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, I think cameo's got a search problem.  Mormon tabernacle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or maybe everybody's busy since the pandemic slowed down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is the holiday season, so they're probably rehearsing.  This is what I get.  Ricky Morton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is very strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Very strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These are just all the people available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know what I do when a search doesn't work on a site?  I just do Google.  So let's search for cameo choir.  Wouldn't it be funny if-  Or you know what we could do is we-  Here we go.  Oh, these are gospel.  I wonder if Randy Travis-  Randy Travis?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis.  Randy Travis to sing something to my dad and I dance to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here we go, here we go.  From our own, very own producer, Jason Howell.  He says, go to Fiverr.  Let me click this link here.  Fiverr, have a choir, I will have a choir,  sing your name, jingle or message.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yes.  Oh yes.  Oh yes.  For 15 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Make it so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh golly gosh, Reno.  Commercial use, I guess this is commercial use,  but it's only 35 bucks.  Add an orchestra?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Only $15?  No, no, no, let's not overdo it.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh my gosh.  All right, I will do this for,  I won't be here next week,  but I will do this for our next-  For your return.  Yes, for my return, I will have especially commissioned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Meanwhile, we could put a challenge out on TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh yeah, we could.  Get that guy who sings and drinks the cranberry juice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Crag, crag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So show a hand, okay, first of all,  yesterday Google announced the Pixel 6.  And I'm seeing Jeff Jarvis in chat  as Jason and I are doing the show, grumping.  You were trying to order one and then-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For the minute, for the minute I could,  I put together a cart.  I had it in the cart during the entire presentation,  your entire presentation.  I'm just refreshing, refreshing, refreshing, refreshing,  refreshing, refreshing the entire hour,  thinking I gotta get this,  because I'm in line here.  I've been in the very first minute.  And then finally it's,  no, we took it out of your cart.  F you, said Google to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  A number of people got the response,  we're sold out, which was apparently specious,  spurious and fallacious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well it is, because they don't have them.  They're out of stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're sold out now.  I ordered-  You got one?  I got one.  It's coming-  Wait, did you order the Pro?  Tuesday, no.  Well, so yes, I ordered the Pro,  but I didn't get the one with,  I only get the sunny yellow in 128 gigs, which is fine.  That's actually the one I want.  I got the black in 128.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you were able to get it.  I wanted the black in 256.  Of course I'm never satisfied, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You're not gonna need all that storage.  I had, I got mine,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got the normal, the Pixel normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got the amateur, huh, Stacey?  Oh, you got the Pro?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The reason why is because I had a choice  between Giant and Garkenshin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But it's not about the screen, it's about the camera.  Cameras.  All about the camera.  I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I can't wrap my hand around it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't own it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I hate how big these are.  You need bigger hands.  Maybe if you used a catcher's mitt.  I'll work on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me stretch out my fingers here so it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Which one did you get, Ant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Twitcard got the 6 Pro in white.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The most important thing from my point of view  was that you have the cameras.  Because you're our photography guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wanted to play with that  and see how it competes with this iPhone.  How big did you get, Ant?  OIS.  I went with the 6 Pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How big?  How much memory?  128, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, 128.  I'm not one to do the large.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got the 64 3A XL.  It's fine, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I've been running out of memory for a long time.  64 you might.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the 4 XL.  This 64.  And it's totally fine.  I don't keep that much on the phone, I guess.  If I don't need it, I get rid of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Stacey, you weren't worried about the camera?  That you aren't gonna get as good a,  you're not gonna get that third lens,  the 50 megapixel lens.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't care.  I mean, like my phone,  unlike everybody else in the world,  I actually delete my photos.  I don't take that many photos.  You don't need the storage then.  Yeah.  I'm a bad mom, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, you're not.  You're not, because presumably you have Google Photos  and so it's all getting uploaded to the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, once it's uploaded, I just delete.  There's no need to keep it on the phone.  So let's give some context for anybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  who may not have watched the event.  The Pixel 6 is the new phone.  It's 599.  The Pixel 6, it's smaller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  6.1, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Less, 6.1, less of a camera.  I know, no third camera.  No ultra wideband, I'm very sad about that.  And your option was also the Pixel 6 Pro for 899,  bigger screen, additional lens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  6.2 inches.  And 6.7, right?  But this is confusing.  So explain this diagram.  Oh, 6.2 inches tall.  Oh.  6.4 inches.  Display maybe?  Diagonal.  Diagonal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Diagonal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay.  So it's 6.4.  That is really a strange way to talk about it, but okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What color did you get, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got the coral, hoping it's less pink  and more orange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why I didn't go with it,  because I'm thinking it didn't look like this Pixel 4.  Yeah.  It was really falling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I put a case on all my phones,  so it doesn't really matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  599 is, by the way, I should point out,  I think a very good price for a flagship phone.  Excellent.  That is super competitive.  Yeah.  I mean, it's half what the iPhone would cost.  So I think that's good.  I think that's good.  Millimeter wave, I don't know.  I wouldn't.  Now here's what ScooterX is saying.  So you could have it if you got it from Verizon or AT&T.  Right.  And it would cost.  I thought it unlocked.  Yeah, right.  The version from the store,  599 does not include millimeter wave.  Right.  So, okay.  But Stacey, there's no millimeter wave  in your neighborhood, is there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, the ultra wideband millimeter wave  is for finding things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's just like, how is it millimeter wave?  So we're talking about two different things.  So there's UWB and there's millimeter wave.  So you're saying, I didn't even know it had UWB.  So it doesn't have-  The Pro has UWB.  I need background on both of these things.  So millimeter wave is that 5G that they talk about  that's super fast, but it's only in three.  Oh, that's the 5G millimeter wave.  That's three blocks in New York and then one block in Philly  and it's not very widespread  and certainly nothing near you.  So now let's talk about UWB  because I didn't even realize these phones had UWB.  Apple phones have UWB.  Yeah, the Pro does.  Okay, interesting.  The Pro has UWB.  But I don't know if you're gonna worry about that  if nothing supports it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, the latest tiles have UWB on them.  They just came out and I could really use the ability,  not $300 worth.  There's gonna be a theme throughout my thing today,  which is like, I want one feature that costs  an exorbitant amount of money and I'm like,  I'm not gonna pay for it.  Yeah, $300 more, $899.  Is this the Cheap Stacey show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Cheap Stacey, Stacey.  That would, wasn't that part of his friend, Cheap Stacey?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I think it was.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh no, I'm sorry, it was Cheap Date Stacey.  I've got it wrong.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so rude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So rude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Pixel 6 Pro is, I'm so sorry.  I wasn't thinking of you.  I was thinking of Barbie's friend.  There is a Stacey doll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is.  And she's awesome and technically savvy and works for NASA.  There you go.  As was the case when I grew up with Stacey dolls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There you go.  So Stacey, it's a Stacey Barbie.  One of Barbie's younger sisters.  Light, strawberry blonde hair, green eyes.  She's a preteen and the most athletic of the Roberts.  Did you know that Barbie's last name is Roberts?  Barbie's last name?  Barbie's last name?  According to the Barbie.  Thought she was Cher.  According to the definitive Barbie Wiki, Stacey Roberts.  Huh.  Huh.  Sporty Stacey.  She's the sporty one.  Yeah, released in 1992.  She's a tween doll.  I look, she's believed to be 10 years old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we don't know.  But the sources refuse to confirm or deny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, a woman never tells her age.  Well, and she spells her name wrong, so we don't,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  we don't expect.  People often confuse, by the way, Stacey for Tootie,  the twin sister of Todd,  before Mattel discontinued her in 1971.  Tootie was replaced by a girl named Kelly  in the 1990 Wedding Day Midge gift set as the flower girl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kelly's the cute, tiny one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, Kelly became Todd's twin sister  until Mattel renamed her Stacey in 1992.  So you used to be Kelly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who says the internet is an awful place?  It's a place where people go to the effort  to build the Barbie Wiki.  I mean, geez, what more could you ask for in society?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, Lord.  Todd was discontinued in 1996.  That's the saddest thing I ever heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's a nice roll out the Todd mold.  Oh my God, poor Todd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Anyway, back to Pixel phones.  You know who has a Pixel phone  and talked a lot about it last night and all about Android?  Google provided Jason Howell  with both the Pixel and the Pixel Pro.  That was a great reveal during the presentation.  You know how funny,  I was watching the presentation today, re-watching.  Two things really bugged the hell out of me  and I want to apologize to everybody.  At the beginning, I didn't realize this at the time,  but Jason's trying to tell me he has it.  And I'm going, no, no, no, no,  here comes Rick Astorlo.  So I feel, I'm sorry, Jason.  I should have let you talk, I didn't know.  Okay, the other problem is I was so irritated  that I couldn't buy it,  that I really wasn't paying attention.  I kept interrupting by saying, I can't buy the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I apologize to you.  That was very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jason just slowly moved it up into the frame.  It was very funny.  He had it.  It was like a Jaws movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  It was kind of great.  I thought it was quite joyous  just watching you and Mr. Jarvis.  Trying to buy it.  Trying to buy the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Jason is embargoed on a full review  and the most thing I'm most interested in is images  until next week.  So next week's all about Android.  He'll have a full review for you.  But he had a reveal and was able to talk about it  in kind of general terms last night and all about Android.  Are you gonna be allowed to take one of them to Mexico?  Well, it's so funny you should ask  because mine arrives the day I leave.  After.  Which is a week from today.  I won't be here next week, by the way.  I'll be in Mexico and Jason's gonna take over the show.  That way.  Yeah, sorry.  But it would be perfect to bring with me  because I'm going down to Oaxaca for the Day of the Dead  which will be, I mean, that's as photogenic  as you can get, right?  And it would be wonderful to have that phone.  Lisa's gonna have the iPhone 13.  So I thought we could have a shoot off, you know?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'd be kind of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lisa's will be better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you had your phone, I was gonna suggest.  She's a better photographer.  I was gonna suggest give it to her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe I should take the iPhone 13  and let her have the Pixel Pro.  Wait, maybe you should just send Ant.  Yeah.  Yeah, or that.  Just throw away.  Send a real photographer.  So I'm gonna bring the Pixel 6 Pro  if I can borrow it from Jason.  But we gotta check with Google  because it's loaned out to him.  He signed paperwork and stuff.  So if that is possible, I might do a swap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But otherwise, I'll have to wait.  Who knows?  Mountain View may deliver our phones pretty quickly, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I wish, if anybody at Google's listening,  I paid full dollar.  It's not like we didn't order it.  Apparently some people-  I tried to pay full dollar,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but you wouldn't take my money.  So you still don't have one on order?  You still don't have one?  No, I have one 128, but I wanted the 126.  Oh, you wanted more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So mine is delivered October 27th to 28th.  The funny thing is I also ordered,  very shortly thereafter, the case,  the Golden Glo case,  and it is now pushed back to February 18th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I went to Amazon for my case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, so I said, I'm going to get one Friday from Amazon.  It's like-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh jeez, I just went to the Google store page.  And who do they think they are, a phone company?  Due to high volumes, we may experience long wait times  for customer support.  We greatly appreciate your patience.  You're Google, for God sakes, people.  You had the hubris today, you could do anything.  What happened to you?  You can't run a store?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Google sold only about 3.5 million of these last year,  total, including, I think, the 5A.  They ordered 7 million of the Pixel 6 this year.  That's the rumor, double their sales figures from last year.  So they're very bullish on this.  Jason was saying during the event  and Plan has spent even more, a lot of marketing money  on this, that they're really going to push this phone.  But it's interesting,  because even if they sell 7 million phones next year,  or between now and next year,  that's like one week's worth of iPhones.  I mean, it's a tiny number compared to Samsung and Apple.  What do you think Google's ambitions are here?  I mean, even their most optimistic projection  is still a fraction of the competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's showing off the new chip and what it can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it seems like that would be the most important thing  in this story, is just their capabilities for AI  and all of it being on their own silicon.  So are they happy if you don't buy one,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  but just that you see people with them  and you see the ads and you get that general glow

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  on the last couple of phones, right?  It's just the services of Google  versus the services of having a Pixel device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So are we weird?  And by the way, it's not just us,  it's Paul and Mary Jo on Windows Weekly.  I mean, we all bought one.  We all like one.  Oh, okay, I gotta get it.  Is that just like, are we still, we're kinda outliers?  Lemmings?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We are definitely outliers.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Normal people are clamoring for this phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, this could be like an Apple,  but the thing is what pisses me off is  if it's like an Apple store where they create the fake lines,  then we're manipulated.  But maybe they just had amazing sales.  Maybe it would surprise them.  Maybe people like it and wanted it.  Part of the thing too is that  because it was not a surprise,  people didn't have to think and wait,  they knew everything they needed to know.  They were ready to buy the minute it was available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's actually a very good point.  Also, if you order by the end of the month,  you get Pixel Buds A series,  just what you always wanted, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I paid for the damn things  because of Jason Howell, I got them.  And then, now I have two, I have four of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh my, well, one for each year.  Yeah, exactly.  And other orifices.  So I wonder if this jam at the website,  I mean, look it, there's no way Google wanted this.  They did not create artificially this bogged down website  because they sell internet services.  They sell web services.  It doesn't reflect well on their capabilities.  There's no way they're gonna besmirch  their reputation on purpose.  I wonder though, why they weren't better prepared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not their forte still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It is, but that's the point.  It is, they claim to be a net working company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't know if it's like shopping sites, right?  That could be something.  I mean, there's a lot that goes into hosting a  Oh, I understand.  Shopping site that Google doesn't do normally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They've had a store for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but I don't know.  How many people went to the store?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Besides the three of us, four of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We all just jammed the store.  That's all, just the three of us.  But still.  Well, actually I didn't.  I waited until the afternoon.  Pretty quickly.  When are you getting yours, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Delivery October 30th through December 2nd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I guess there was no real rush.  Really the problem it sounds like  was not a rush of people, but bad software  because they were saying it was sold out, then it wasn't.  They were saying it would be delivered in February,  then it wasn't.  People are already starting to get new emails saying,  oh no, no, we're gonna have it next week, not next year.  I think Google might have had a software issue  as much as anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe they had a database that just didn't update  or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At first, the entire site was down.  We got 500 errors.  And then you finally got the page load but very slowly.  And then it was difficult to go through the process.  And then those of us who got to a cart and many did not,  I was afraid, I was a human DDoS  because I kept on hitting refresh.  And it would give it an R301 error,  R0, what was the made up error?  R08.  R015.  And then it would go back and back.  And then finally when I got to the next stage,  that's when it said, oh, sorry, schmuck, gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, this sounds like a software problem.  But interesting, and your choice,  the cloudy white version is already out of stock.  Not even delayed.  Well, it said that yesterday too.  Did it?  It said that yesterday too.  The others you can get.  Let's see if I decide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that under your five page?  I think it's out of stock more than that on the regular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is the regular page.  Really?  Let me see if I can get a 256 gig.  I do not want to trade in my phone.  I do not want any of this stuff.  Look how nice and smoothly the software is working.  Let's just say add to cart.  Let's go to the cart.  Let's just buy this son of a gun.  Hey!  Check out.  Why can't I do that?  It's like it's working.  It's saying for me.  It's out of stock and has been removed from your cart.  Yeah, yeah, schmuck.  That's a little late to tell me that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is.  Why did it let you go that far?  Mine tells me when it's not available.  Like straight away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now I'm feeling like maybe I should have gotten  sorta C phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What happens when you have two phones?  The green is pretty.  It is kinda pretty.  It is kinda pretty, Stacy.  It is pretty.  Sorta C phone's sorta pretty.  It's the kind of phone Stacy Roberts would have.  Well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Robert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, and I never having seen, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I like this actually.  You're right.  It's pretty.  It's nice.  I'm glad colors are kinda bad.  They're kinda Stacy colors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're good Stacy colors.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wish they had the accents on the buttons

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  like the previous models do.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love my little orange buttons.  Oh, that was fun, the two tone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, really ultimately what it comes down to  is this Tensor chip gonna be as everything Google's  talking about?  Are the cameras gonna be as good as, I hope so too.  The image processing, I mean there's a lot of stuff  in here that looks, and it would be great to bring  it to Mexico because of the translation.  Did you love it that they had Marie Kondo on the event  translating her and it sparked joy and I thought  that was kinda cool.  That looked great and looked pretty fast.  She's like throw away your old phones.  Yeah.  So I'm curious, cause let me ask you, aunt,  did you know who Marie Kondo was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did because of the grapevine.  I never watched the show though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  I wonder, maybe a lot of people do.  It seems to me that if Google's having Marie Kondo  in their event, it's almost a way of saying look how  not geeky we are, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kinda how.  Yeah, I get that.  I get that more pop culture-ish.  I feel like she's the Google of cleaning though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like she is the uber geek of cleaning.  Like her method is pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, she's a little OCD, isn't she?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and when you go into like Target,  is it Target now, all the Marie Kondo products?  It's kinda.  It's the container store.  She's the Ariana of throw it away.  Mainstream, that's the word.  Yeah, or Martha Stewart.  Martha Stewart.  Oh, the Stewart, about the Stewart, I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, you're talking about me, baby.  I don't know who you're talking about.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uma Thurman is playing Ariana Huffington.  Perfect.  In the zoom, I mean the uber movie.  Wait a minute.  There's a movie about Uber?  There's a series about Uber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kinda like a.  There's a cast about Steve Gibson, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's in the rundown.  Are they calling it Halt and Catch Fire?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, it's called Halt and Catch Fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was a great show.  It's line 132, sir.  132, let's jump down.  Big goal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Way to the end of the show.  This is a story from Deadline.  Super pumped, Uma Thurman joins Showtime Anthology.  Mike Isaac sold his book.  Oh, it's from Mike Isaac's book.  Good for you, Mike.  Super pumped.  The Battle for Uber.  Showtime's super pumped.  See, I think people are gonna see that title  and think it's something else.  It tells the story of the ride sharing company.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pivoting on.  This is Gordon Levitt, Kyle Chandler  from the Billions co-creators, Brian Kupferman  and David Levitt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, this is gonna be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Gordon Levitt plays Travis Kalanick.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Isn't this gonna be something?  Thurman's gonna be board member Ariana Huffington.  Elizabeth Shue, Carrie Bichet, John Bass.  It's a good cast.  Yeah.  And I love, I mean, you know, this is a good team.  Billions is a great show.  And they're very good at showing how rich people,  how the other half lives.  Which seems to be a thing now on TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, I was thinking today, where's our-  So we've gotta aspire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, something to look forward to as we decline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even this is all dystopian, right?  Where's our Hill Street Blues, our St. Elsewhere,  our West Wing, our Hopeful shows?  No, it's Billions and Succession and Super Pumped.  It's all, everybody's a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's Ted Lasso.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's Lasso.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, Jason Sudeikis is gonna be on Saturday Night Live  Saturday, so Ted Lasso is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't watched, somebody said that to me on Twitter.  I have not watched it, I confess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, Jeff, I can't imagine you enjoying it.  I imagine you throwing things at the television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's gonna make him cranky.  It's not the soccer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not about soccer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's about, it's saccharine sweet homilies.  It's- It's Hallmark Channel?  Yeah, it's Hallmark Channel.  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not Hallmark Channel.  He makes butter cookies.  He gets a divorce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, okay, he gets a divorce.  It's a life lesson.  That never happens in a television.  By the way, he's depressed for like one second  and then he just goes on and makes more butter cookies.  So I don't know if he's that upset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, he has a panic attack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, he does.  Okay, good for him.  Good for him.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Really, did you just say that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  By the way, we were a little concerned  because this was a tough week.  We got Apple on Monday announcing new computers.  We got Google announcing a new phone on Tuesday.  And then this morning at 7 a.m.  Jason Hall and I are going back and forth.  Should we get up at 7 a.m. for the Samsung Unpacked 2 event?  You have both decided the day before not to.  We have decided not to.  No, that was the decision.  And I'm glad we didn't because the entirety of the event was  now you can customize your Galaxy Z Flip 3 in colors.  It's like the Moto-  That's all they announced?  We've gotten that.  The Moto Maker.  I have that, but I have it in a boring color, black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, do you think that would be better or worse  than the Pixel 6?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no, I'm getting the Pixel 6 for one reason, the camera.  But I am interested in what they'll do with the Tensor chip.  The Galaxy Flip is a great little phone,  but it's just another phone.  It's not world beating.  The cameras are good, not great.  Maybe it's the photographer, Ant,  but as Ant pointed out, the white balance is off.  Still hurts.  Still hurts, Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not gonna lie.  I'm sorry for the Stinger, sir.  Did you say I'm sorry for the standards?  The Stinger.  Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  Sorry, I have standards.  What can I say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, okay.  And tomorrow is Google's Smart Home Summit,  tomorrow at 10 a.m.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, now tell us, should we watch that?  What should we do with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  They're a Smart Home event.  I don't know.  Will you be watching?  So at 10 a.m., I will be getting my face  shot up with Botox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, well, there are more important things.  There will be live streams of it, so we could watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're interested.  But I'm just letting you know that that is also coming,  and I'm hopeful that we'll hear about Matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Matter is the joint venture between Google, Zigbee,  a bunch of other home automation.  Apple's involved in Matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google, everybody, Apple, Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Amazon's in it too, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amazon, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Smart Home Summit live stream.  Michelle Turner, or no, I'm sorry, Michele Turner.  Michelle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Michelle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Michelle Turner.  We'll share our vision for the home  and preview upcoming tools and features  to build your next devices and apps using Matter and Thread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think it's, it's not a device launch.  It's for developers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's for devs.  It's a developer event, yeah.  Well, it's gonna be long.  It's not two hours, it's two hours and 17.  So.  What?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  10 a.m. to 12, 17 p.m.  So you might have time to get your face shot up  and come home.  After you get your face shot up, can you watch TV  or do you have to go to bed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, I can totally watch TV.  I write a newsletter after it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that must be the fun newsletter.  She's that good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And another thing about IOT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's just Botox in my, it's like a sewer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I know, I feel like it should make your brain  freeze up or something like that.  Yeah, it kills things, right?  My brain doesn't have to freeze up.  Your brain doesn't freeze up, okay.  And we should say, not that it's anybody's business,  but Stacey isn't doing this for vanity.  It helps with migraines and it's a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do this every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, because I don't want people to think  you're doing this for vanity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey.  You could be.  I do lots of things for vanity.  Okay.  And I'm okay with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have to say.  I used an eyelash serum for vanity.  Your brow is completely unfurrowed.  I mean, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't move my eyebrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know how people get it  in the rest of their face,  because it does hurt a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a serious question actually.  How do you show concern when you can't move your brow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Jeff, I'm really sorry about that.  Yeah, no, no.  That's as concerned as I get.  She doesn't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That doesn't work.  Yeah, she's not concerned.  She doesn't care one bit.  I also can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And the chat room is badgering me  about the Sony camera,  which is coming on tomorrow.  So they're gonna have an event with the alpha.  But I can say I'm in the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is every event pre-recorded now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.  Yep.  Yeah, it has to be.  I have to say, I don't think that's a bad thing.  I think the pre-recorded events are more efficient.  They get to the point.  I don't miss the live events particularly.  They can also just put on a press release.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I miss being live at a live event.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But that's a privileged position that we have.  Well, not me, but-  Yeah, we miss the privilege.  You guys have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I just miss being in person  and being able to have hands-on a device  and you can tell a lot more about it.  That's true.  Exactly.  You also can, as a journalist,  you can talk to people afterwards who are not journalists  and be like, hey, was that exciting?  And it's much easier than just emailing everybody.  And I don't know.  I like seeing people.  I miss them.  I never thought I'd say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know, isn't that amazing?  But I do miss being able to put hands-on the products  at these events or even like Adobe Max this next week.  I miss going to that because it was being able to sit down  with those other creators and pick their brains right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think that the biggest problem I see with these  is these events look much more like marketing  than ever before.  That's just because they're not wolves  in sheep's clothing anymore.  They're just wolves.  Because it was always really an exercise in marketing.  But they really look like both Apple's event on Monday  and Google's event yesterday,  just didn't, especially Google's event  because there was nothing new to say.  They didn't do a folding phone.  They didn't have anything that we didn't already know.  It just looked like an ad, a program length commercial.  So that's the disadvantage of recording.  At least if it's live, there's some, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If it's live, there's always that thread  of something going wrong.  You know, they're doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, a little tension.  Yeah, that's not bad.  Hey, let's take a little break.  Go ahead.  No, no, I don't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say you get fewer images  of like Tim Cook in a field, which is what happened.  That was a little odd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Didn't you feel like it was a cult?  In knee-high weeds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got some serious cult vibes.  I was like, are something here?  What's going on here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It did give us the opportunity to make the pun  that Tim Cook was outstanding in his field,  but that was about it.  Somebody said maybe Apple's announcing a new lawn mower.  That's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, I wish...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, there is a new bill here.  You can't have, they're not able to sell those  two-stroke mowers or bowers and stuff anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's true.  Maybe Apple should make a new Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the leaf blowers you can't use anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leaf blowers and weed rackers and stuff like that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Actually, I wish you'd been with me, Stacey, on Monday,  because I thought the chip news from Apple  was very, very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have so many thoughts.  And if you want, you can convince me  to try to buy something, so there you go.  Well, it's only if you're into chips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What was interesting to me,  and I don't know if there's a precedent for it,  I wish I had more background in this,  but they showed the M1 die.  And it's not a die, it's a system on a chip,  so it's not fair to call it a die,  because there's memory in there,  there's lots of stuff in there,  but they showed the thing, the SoC,  and the new one is then about 50%,  and then twice as big with the Max,  and I think that that's fairly unprecedented  to make that kind of leap in a year  in processing power and transistors and capabilities.  They doubled the speed of a chip that was one year old.  Intel has never, as far as I know,  never done that in such a short time frame.  This is remarkable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's the SoC, it's not the actual chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's misleading to say 32 billion transistors  because it's including RAM and everything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because when you have an SoC,  you can have your CPU, right,  and then you can add as many GPUs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And the RAM is on there, right, the GPUs.  Nevertheless, I thought it was quite a...  Yeah, we're gonna talk about memory bailing.  It was quite a bit of flex on Apple's part  to say you ain't seen nothing yet.  People were impressed with the M1.  I think the M1 Pro and Max  show that Apple has a lot of headroom in its chip design,  and I'm very much interested  what they're gonna do next year for the Mac Pro and the iMac.  I think that this is moving faster  than anybody anticipated, I guess is what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  What do you think?  Oh, oh, I thought we were going for a break,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  but I will tell you. Well, we are,  but actually, I can't drop this now  because I'm really curious what you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, well, here we go.  So I thought their emphasis on memory bandwidth  was really important, and the reason why  is because that is the constraint on the chip  in terms of getting data to the processor, right?  And if you think about all the workloads,  all the jobs we're asking our computers to do  with machine learning, with graphics, all of that,  that requires a lot of memory bandwidth,  a lot of moving data around the chip.  So historically, we haven't cared about that,  but this is a sign that even in consumers,  like every machine that we have going forward,  that's gonna be way more important than like RAM,  or I mean, RAM is still gonna be super important,  but way more important than like-

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Than the amount of RAM you have, yeah.  Yeah.  And it helps with GPUs.  I mean, one of the concerns I had with Apple  moving to its own silicon is they're waving bye-bye  to Nvidia and AMD.  They're gonna have to come up with a-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They built something, yeah, they built a graphic-style chip  in the sense that it can handle all of those data flows  on the same piece of silicon  and handle all the memory bottlenecking issues  that have happened historically  when you move to parallel processing,  like you do on a GPU.  They built their own network fabric for that thing.  That is amazing.  Isn't it?  That's what Nvidia's made their GPUs so great  is because their network fabric  has been good at parallel processing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You could push 200 gigabytes a second  over the memory channels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gigabits per second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Gigabytes, capital B.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's the amount of data, sorry.  Yes, yes, sorry.  Yeah, that's the memory bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So this is really remarkable, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that they doubled it.  And then, so the other thing to note from this  is Apple is designing these for a future  where every computer becomes a gaming computer.  Not to play games, but because of the future of AR  and you can call it the metaverse,  call it whatever you want.  So that's what is exciting about this.  So we're seeing Apple, it didn't do any,  it didn't do any wicked awesome AR launches recently,  but this chip is like, boom, working on it.  That is the underpinning of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think that's exactly what the MacBreak Weekly crew  has been saying, which is what, especially Alex Lindsay,  is that it's interesting to,  we've been wondering why Apple's stuff,  the phone, the iPad and now their computers  is so overpowered for what it's doing today.  And it really looks like Apple's putting the pieces  into place one after the other,  so that in a year or two,  it's all gonna come together with some,  a brand new way to use your computers,  which is this augmented reality.  So I agree with you.  I think that's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've been preaching this for, I don't know,  five, six years now with unifying the two OSs.  Yeah, it takes a while.  It takes a while.  Yeah, you can't change architectures.  Mac OS, the 9s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, but they've been limited also by,  and this is what they finally, I think, got tired of,  what Intel was giving them.  And while Intel was stuck at 10 nanometers or even more,  this is a five nanometer chip.  They're gonna go to three nanometers probably next year.  And it's not merely the nanometers.  These are multi-dimensional chips.  There's technology in here that,  and this is the other thing I think is interesting,  that it may be the case that Intel and AMD  are just gonna look at and dream of,  but not actually produce.  So I think they're lapping Intel and AMD,  and even ARM to some degree,  in a way that's really interesting.  And this is a company that doesn't,  the chips aren't its business,  but because its business is the whole stack now,  the hardware, the chips, the software, the operating system,  they're really gonna be able to do something unique.  Now there is a negative to that, which is it's not open.  It's very closed.  It's a closed ecosystem.  But it's the only way you could do a stack like this.  And I think that's why that it's gonna be hard  for Intel to come along and do it.  They don't own the whole ecosystem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this could be why Google is so adamant  about keeping up with the pixels and putting-  Exactly.  Now, most of their infrastructure is cloud,  but I think it's probably smart of them to realize  that server chips are not gonna be in these edge devices.  So you've gotta build your own silicon  for these edge devices,  even if you're not super awesome on the phone,  because you need to know what those workloads  are gonna demand and look like,  and to have the capability to build for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, to somebody like me who covers both companies,  it looks pretty much like Google is attempting  to follow Apple's playbook.  Apple says we're gonna do everything on device  to protect your privacy.  That's what the tensor chip is all about.  Apple says we're gonna put ML, image processing,  and more into our phones.  That's what the tensor chip is all about.  And I think that that's exactly, I think you're right.  I think Google's trying to build the same kind of expertise.  And that question I asked earlier,  why is Google putting all their eggs in this pixel basket?  And I think that's why.  It's not merely to become a giant phone company,  but it's because they need to own this technology stack  to compete.  And ultimately, when Apple comes out with an AR device,  I think Google hopes to be right behind them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So does Google supply chips to others then,  so that they can have the same capabilities in Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No.  Although, and it's unclear, Google's not clear about this.  I think Samsung has a big hand in the tensor chip.  I'm almost certain manufacture them,  but I'm not sure they may also have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How can Google win if they make seven million phones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because it's not about the phone in the long run.  It's not gonna be about the phone in the long run.  Yeah, the phone is just packaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but it is about the ability to use AI locally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes.  Go ahead, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they're getting the experience,  they understand what kind of demands people have  on those phones.  And they get all of that,  so they can optimize their chip for those workloads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but mostly that.  Do they share that?  Well, I'm trying to see how it scales.  Do they share that knowledge openly?  Do they share specs?  Do they open source things?  How does, if it's Google v Apple here,  and the chip technology is critical to that,  and Google can't make it alone on its own manufacturing  and its own phones, that's what I'm trying to understand,  is how does Google then expand,  as Android did by making it free?  Do they do the same thing with the Tensor chip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I see what you're asking.  I guess they could.  That is a potential avenue for them to do it,  like to open it.  I mean, the Google chip is based  on the ARM architecture license, as is the Apple chips.  So they've highly customized ARM chips.  Now, ARM is not open source,  so Google could never open source.  I can't do that, though.  Tensor chips.  Now, with RISC-V, I'm sure there's some engineers  running around, and they could release something like that  going forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I really have high hopes for RISC-V,  but I have a sinking feeling it's not gonna be competitive  with the best that even Intel can produce,  let alone Apple and Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't need to be the best.  The best at what?  That's what's so fun about chips today,  is you've got so many disparate jobs and workloads out there  that you used to only do one thing,  which is power a PC that did like 10 things, right?  Now, you've got computers and everything,  so they all need different levels of processors,  and they're gonna be running a million different workloads  as opposed to like 50.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, and the Apple chips,  some of you have even said they're Swift machines.  The Apple chips are designed,  were a very specific hardware and software stack,  all owned by Apple.  You can't do that with RISC-V,  Intel can't do that, ARM can't do that.  Samsung maybe could do that, you know,  because they do make hardware, they kind of make software.  Apple's a unique and uniquely positioned in this frankly.  And I think the other thing, Jeff,  and we'll end this, is the phone is an interim product.  I think Apple and Google both are-  It's on the way to the blob, yeah.  Are looking toward the blob,  maybe towards some sort of AR spectacles.  The metaverse!  Well, speaking of which,  Facebook wants to change its name.  And that's our subject when we return in just a little bit.  Stacey Higginbotham, it's good to have you back.  I've been, I'm just, I was like, we need Stacey,  we need Stacey, so she's back.  We don't really need Jeff Jarvis,  but he's here, what can we do?  So-

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You're stuck with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I'm kidding.  I'm on a shoe, man.  I'm trying to get rid of you forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Last week, I thank God you were there,  because I'm just going like,  all I can do when Cory Doctorow launches is go,  so Jeff-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I just shut up too.  Thank you.  I actually, I put stuff from last week's rundown  into this one.  Couple good ones there,  there was no chance of getting anything last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no, no, but you were good.  You asked him questions, you brought up stuff.  His brain goes fast.  It's very hard to keep up with.  So were you too, and thanks to you and Jeff,  I didn't have to do so much last week.  Aunt Pruitt's also here, hands-on photography.  Our show, I want to, actually, this is really exciting.  Brand new, a sponsor I want to tell you about  called Andela, A-N-D-E-L-A, Andela.  Really neat idea.  Brilliance is evenly distributed, globally.  Brilliance is evenly distributed, but opportunity is not.  And really, Andela is there to solve that problem.  You need talent.  There's talent out there.  Might not be down the block.  Andela is a global talent network with a mission  to connect brilliance with opportunity.  These days, your company's expected to move faster  than ever before.  Staying ahead of the competition has never been so hard.  Talent has never been so hard to find.  With so many priorities to manage,  how are you supposed to find time to both build  and onboard an amazing engineering team  that will get you where you need to go?  Andela has solved this problem.  Andela is the world's first talent network  connecting innovative companies like yours  with top-tiered, vetted engineers,  really good, talented people,  so you have more time to focus on your core business.  Andela is committed to your success  with their combination of expert technical recruiters,  proprietary matching algorithms.  They connect you with developers  who are the best in the business,  enabling you to accelerate productivity,  drive revenue, and scale your business.  This is not the offshore developers that you're thinking.  This is something so much better.  Yes, you get the benefits of developers distributed globally,  both in time zones, you can work around the clock,  the prices are better,  but you also get a global network of talent  that is rigorously vetted.  Andela knows you need the best talent.  Their hiring process is quick and efficient,  but maintains the highest quality admissions standards,  so you're really getting top-quality engineers at scale.  Global talent at your fingertips.  In today's hyper-competitive hiring environment,  if you limit yourself to just the people in your region,  you're at a big disadvantage.  You may have already experienced that.  There's a talent drain.  Why raid the company across the street  when there's such a huge pool  of highly-qualified talent around the world?  But you need Andela to find them  and to help you with all of this,  and that's what they do.  You can cut your hiring timelines down from months to days.  They understand companies have to do more with less  and consistently justify ROI.  When you hire Andela engineers,  you can expect they'll already be efficiently onboarded  and ready to deliver value for your team within days.  You have very efficient ramp-up times.  And it's not part-time support,  somebody you're going to call up in the middle of the night.  These people are embedded.  They're in your organization, fully embedded,  with at least five hours of overlapping working hours  for the rest of your engineering team,  so you can talk to them.  I am a big believer in this because I know,  in fact, Alex Lindsay has always talked about  these great engineering talents that he's worked with  and trained in countries like Rwanda and Africa.  And he's always said this to me,  and it really resonated when I talked to Andela.  Brilliance is global, but the opportunity is not.  So here's your opportunity to take advantage  of brilliant engineers from all over the world.  I'll give you a good example.  Mindshare, maybe you know them.  They partnered with Andela.  They needed to quickly hire 10 new digital experts,  and I'm talking data scientists,  machine learning specialists, analysts, developers.  Here's what the executive director  and head of business intelligence at Mindshare said.  As we continue to enhance the Synapse platform,  time to value is very important.  Andela is a good partner in helping us identify  the right talent that's fit for different purposes.  This is your opportunity to tap into a wider talent pool,  stop competing with the major tech companies  down the street, spend less time interviewing.  Brilliance is, I love that line.  I want to write it on my wall.  Brilliance is evenly distributed, but opportunity isn't.  Well, now we can flatten that, level that playing field.  And it's good for you.  It's good for everybody.  Here's the website, andela, A-N-D-E-L-A.com  slash four dash companies, okay?  Four dash companies.  Andela.com slash four dash companies.  You can schedule a complimentary consultation.  In fact, you can even get a two week no risk trial  with their vetted technical talent.  You could try them out.  Little audition.  Andela, A-N-D-E-L-A.com slash four dash companies.  I'm just very excited about the mission of Andela  and what they're doing.  It's really, really, really cool.  Check it out.  Andela.com slash four dash companies.  Four dash companies.  This was the headline that kind of knocked me  out of my seat when I saw it.  Facebook is planning to rebrand the company  with a new name.  So that's one way to get out of your problems.  Got a kind of stinky brand reputation.  Well, just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Put a mustache on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Put a mustache on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It worked for Philip Morris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I mean, I can think of a lot of companies.  This is another play from the big tobacco playbook.  I mean, Exxon did this, right?  I mean, it's over and over.  This is a very common thing to do.  We're gonna find out more about this on the 28th,  next week at the Connect Conference.  I'm just kind of stunned.  It's meant to signal the tech, this is from The Verge,  the tech giant's ambition to be known  for more than social media  and all the ills that it entails.  The rebrand would likely, we're not big tobacco,  the rebrand would likely position the blue Facebook app  as one of many products under a parent company,  kind of like Alphabet, overseeing groups like Instagram,  WhatsApp, Oculus, and more.  So no idea what this is gonna be, although.  I was trying to wonder whether this,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there were punch lines online.  One is that Facebook has to send in its real identity  and driver's license.  That was somebody else's joke, not mine.  That's right.  But Twitter wags came out.  Is there any chance here that this is a kicking Zuck  upstairs moment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, if Zuck didn't have absolute iron grip  on voting control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But so did Larry and Sergey.  They chose to move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They kicked themselves upstairs.  We'd have to be Zuck doing that.  Yeah, you know, you might, he's got kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So does he say, Chris Cox?  Ha ha, it's your problem now.  He's as rich as you could be.  You figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's some speculation, The Verge has some speculation,  and I'll give credit to Alex Heath in his article,  that maybe the name might have something to do with Horizon.  This is a product Facebook's been working on in VR  for a while, Horizon Worlds.  Horizon would be a good name, right?  Because they're looking ahead over the Horizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My favorite joke was, it's gonna go back to the Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha.  Because remember, Mark said metaverse is our next,  you know, big focus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, can we just put a parenthesis in here?  Because I put something to run down a month ago  and I never, define the metaverse for me, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Stacey, you're the loop.  Nope, nope, nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Zuck on that.  Ha ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not gonna do it.  Something all those sci-fi nerds love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, my experience in the metaverse is from sci-fi, exactly.  Neil Stephenson's Snow Crash is probably the first.  Of course, very famously, William Gibson in Neuromancer  talked about a metaverse.  The most recent version is Ready Player One.  If you saw the movie or read the book, that's,  and in general, the notion is,  it is an indistinguishable virtual world,  indistinguishable from the real world,  that people spend much of their time in.  Another alternate world that is entirely digitally generated.  Second life.  Yeah, but second life is an immersive,  and so that's a very important part,  that indistinguishable from real world.  It's gotta be immersive,  it's gotta be as close to the real world as possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, and that you will do more  than just entertain yourself.  That's, I think, the other layer there that's important.  You will conduct regular life in this.  This will be business, this will be entertainment,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  this will be-  Yes, because you're not alone in it.  You're in the metaverse,  just as you are in the real world with other people.  Maybe that, maybe in the way-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, who's running the metaverse?  Who's handling the infrastructure?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  By the way, that, and almost all of these sci-fi novels  plays an important part of the story,  is like, well, who's the shadowy eminence grease  behind the metaverse, you know?  Who's running it?  Usually mega corporations, like Facebook.  And I have to say, I'm sure Zuck  is very much influenced by sci-fi.  He looks like somebody who's read a few  sci-fi novels in his time.  And so, if he says metaverse, you know,  it's because it's informed by this notion,  starting with Neil Stevenson and William Gibson  in the more recent versions of it.  It's certainly been a big part of sci-fi for decades.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, but now, so now bring it down to Earth, if we may.  What does that mean in Facebook's strategic plans?  What's the product then?  What's the reality of this?  That's what I can't get my head around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so you would pay probably to be on the metaverse.  People, advertisers would be able to reach you.  You'd have digital real estate  that you could sell to people.  So if you want to be in, think about,  if think about kind of like in Second Life, you know,  there was a market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hated Second Life.  No, but that's because it wasn't very well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So here's, I think probably the thinking Mark has.  There's a scarcity in the world.  There's a scarcity of real estate.  There's a scarcity.  There used to be a scarcity of advertising  because there were only three networks  and you know, how many newspapers  and you know, there was a scarcity.  One of the things digital has done  is it's eliminated the scarcity in advertising placement.  You could, now there's almost an infinite number  of places you could put advertisements, right?  But there's still this scarcity of physical space.  So I think just as digital advertising  has changed the advertising world,  Zuck wants to do the same with the physical world.  And I think Zuck wants to own it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is a, that there is in fact, I mean, it's the AOL,  it's the walled garden of Facebook or any of these.  But in a, wouldn't a metaverse be the opposite?  It's a, if it's based on the internet,  it's distributed and it's open and there's no scarcity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh no, wait a minute.  You said two words it is not, distributed and open.  Okay.  Well, it might be distributed, but it could be.  You and I would like to see that  just like we'd like to see a distributed open web, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's how it's gonna develop, possibly.  This is, I think highly likely.  You will have a Facebook metaverse  and maybe you start out spending time there  because that's where you hang out with your friends.  You're also gonna have a professional metaverse  and that's where your office picks it.  What's gonna happen is they're gonna have to build links  between these metaverses where you can just traverse  between them and bring your data with you that matters.  So that's how I think it's gonna end up developing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's one other aspect of metaverse in science fiction  that I hope does not translate it  to the real world metaverse,  which is that almost always it's people escaping  from a dystopian reality.  So yeah, I was gonna bring that up.  I was like, I think in addition to scarcity,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we're gonna have, I mean, if you think about kind of the  havoc that will be wrecked by climate change,  if you think about like our lives becoming  increasingly miserable in the physical and real world,  you will want to escape for,  and depending on how good our technology gets,  I mean, imagine if you can taste things  that you can no longer access in the real world.  That's a really good reason to want to be in the metaverse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I've always figured given my age  that I will at some point in the next 20 years  be in the home that let's hope it's a nursing home  not a sanitarium.  Just put my father in too, yeah.  And limited mobility, maybe limited cognitive functions.  Certainly I have to go to the bathroom more often.  So the idea of putting on something that transports me  to a cafe in Paris will be more than welcome, right?  Quite nice, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's kind of like you're getting to the matrix.  We're just gonna be logged into these things  and imagining a better life for ourselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, odds that in our lifetime,  we actually could come back together after episode 4,673  and say, yep, there's a metaverse all right,  or no, wasn't that funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I think we're heading directly there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we're gonna have that.  I don't know if you'll be alive  when the metaverse of science fiction  and whether we'll enjoy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It won't be the holodeck yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's another metaverse by the way,  from the Star Trek universe.  We'll wait to version 2.0.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if the telcos build it,  we're gonna have to pay for every minute that we're in there.  Right.  And that's not gonna be the reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, this is a perfect example  where it would be so awesome if it were federated,  if it were open, if it weren't owned by any one company  and if you could build and create yourself,  but that ain't gonna happen  because there's so much investment that goes into this.  And I think Google wants to be part of this.  Maybe there'll be a Facebook and a Google and an Apple  and maybe, and you know,  it just is in the early days of messaging  where these were silos,  at some point people said,  well, but I wanna talk to somebody on MCI mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why wouldn't Slack be, to my mind,  Slack would be the first best competitor  because that's where I'm involved in communication  that actually matters to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And email is important.  They don't have the tech stack to do this though.  That's the problem.  I mean, then that's,  so that's really what Stacy and I are talking about here  is what Apple's doing and I think what Google's doing  is they are building hardware for this metaverse  down the road.  And that's why Facebook bought Oculus.  I mean, that was the plan, I'm sure,  from, you know, the long-term plan for Mark.  It wasn't about lightsaber, beatsaber,  being able to play beatsaber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this why Mark Benioff has decided recently  to hate Mark Zuckerberg?  Is he seeing himself in the competition in the future  that a Salesforce slash Slack business world  is maybe a first,  everybody thought it was gonna be entertainment,  but after the pandemic and Zoom,  what's 3D Zoom?  What's a deeper Zoom?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if this would ever be independent  considering just-

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's too expensive.  Infrastructure costs.  Yes, it's too expensive.  At best, it'll be federated where you'll be able to  kind of step out of the Facebook,  maybe somebody will be sitting across from you  in the Apple universe and you're in the Facebook universe

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and you can talk to each other.  And everybody's a green blob or a whatever blob, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe you'll get like Unicoded down, right,  to like a basic face in like the Apple universe  if you're coming from the Google universe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Look at the big, yeah, right.  Look at the big players in tech right now,  the people with deep pockets,  they're all aiming towards this.  Microsoft certainly is.  I can't think of how Amazon is,  but I'm sure that Bezos is thinking about this.  Maybe not, maybe he was distracted by sending-  No, he's done.  No, he's not.  Bezos is done.  Yeah, maybe he's done, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's already out to space, remember?  By the way, the-  You know what the metaverse needs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What?  Snrvers.  Snrvers.  And thus, Amazon is still in the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  You know, you're absolutely right.  What am I thinking?  Of course, duh.  Jeff's smart enough to go,  I don't wanna worry about the glasses.  I don't wanna worry about social.  I just wanna be the,  who made the money in the gold rush,  in the 1849 gold rush?  It wasn't the gold miners, it was Levi's.  Levi's.  It was the guy who made the pics in the blue jeans.  They just wanna be the Levi's of the metaverse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So anyway, so a new name,  you think it's gonna,  so the presumption is that it tries to erase  our current views,  that it rebrands around the metaverse.  I think it leads mainly to a different corporate structure.  Yeah, maybe-

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe it's more like Alphabet, right?  What Google did, which said,  look, we got too many things,  too many irons in the fire.  Let's have an overall arching company.  Yeah, you see, I can see Mark saying,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm gonna go do metaverse now,  and the folks in charge of Instagram and now Facebook,  that's all your problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that is a very-  So it's Alphabet, not Altria.  Maybe.  Which is the Philip Morris company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right, maybe.  I don't know, that's a good question.  Maybe it's more Alphabet than Altria, that's good.  I'm the wrong guy to ask,  but if I had 32 billion dollars,  you wouldn't see me coming into the office  nine to five Monday through Friday.  Go on.  Right?  So I just wonder, at some point, everybody hangs,  I mean, everybody except Warren Buffett,  hangs up their hat and coat and gets to enjoy it.  That's what Jeff Bezos is pretty apparently doing.  They wanna enjoy what few years they've got left  with their riches, spend more time with their money.  Maybe that's what, I mean, Mark's certainly got enough money.  Maybe he's just saying, yeah, this is getting hairy.  And you know what, if he were really self-aware,  he would also say, and maybe I'm not the best face of this.  Because he's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe everyone hates me,  and I shouldn't be in front of this.  This is really my baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, does he also see the opportunity to become Bill Gates?  Where, well, they hated him, but they don't anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right, well, that's what always happens.  That's what happens with Andrew Carnegie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, they're circling around to hating Bill Gates again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, we are coming back to that, aren't we?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just letting you know, we're not fans anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Isn't that funny how that happens?  Yeah, actually, Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos' arc  seems to be similar.  I don't know, see, I'm the wrong guy.  See, I can't imagine being as wealthy  as any of these guys are,  and really feeling like I had to come to work every day.  I agree with you, sir.  Would you build a yacht and just go for a sail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would not build a yacht, good Lord, that is so rude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what Bezos is doing.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  By the way, highly recommend Brad Stone's newest  Amazon Unbound, which is kind of the second half  of his Amazon, I wonder if he's doing a trilogy,  but it covers the more recent years,  and it really is kind of an insight into what was going on  as we reported all these stories over the last three  or four years, what's really going on,  the Blue Origin and all of Amazon's initiatives.  It's quite fascinating.  But it does feel like at some point, maybe around 2017,  Jeff Bezos decided to enjoy his money a little bit more.  As an example, Jeff Bezos hated helicopters.  He would refuse to go on helicopters.  He thought it was a terrible idea environmentally.  He thought it was dangerous.  He was, of course, the king of frugality.  He would make his salespeople,  even when they're flying across the world,  to fly economy, he hated helicopters.  Then all of a sudden, in HQ2, as they do,  remember this search for the next headquarters for Amazon  where you got 300 cities to beg and plead,  please, Jeff, open a headquarters here.  As part of the requirements, a helipad nearby  within walking distance, and everybody's scratching  their heads, and it turned out it's coming  from the highest sources.  This is a requirement, a helipad.  Everybody's scratching their heads.  Then they find out, a couple of months later,  that his girlfriend owns a helicopter company  and is a pilot.  Oh, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Suddenly he loves helicopters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's definitely human.  He's a human being.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's a human being.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I didn't used to like cats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But love.  Now you have one.  I love him now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why are you playing video games?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love him now.  Literally strange bedfellows,  little furry things in the bed with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love cats, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So what else should we talk?  Jeff, what do you got?  There's so many good stories.  There's lots of good stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you want a little light thing?  Yeah, sure.  Line 39, Coding with Eyes.  An Amuse-Bouche.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  An Amuse-Bouche, yes.  Coding with Eyes.  Build a small demo for my hands-free coding experiment,  writes Charlie Gerard.  Managed to write a little React component with my eyes  in less than 30 seconds.  I did want to write HI, not HY, but that's not the point.  Thinking about how to build interfaces with limited input.  Look left, right is super interesting.  She's got a video which is really cool.  We'll start it over from the beginning.  We're looking at her in the lower right.  She's looking around.  Wait a minute, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why I wanted you to check on this  and see what you thought it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That seems like you'd have a headache  in about five minutes.  But if you didn't have any other way of inputting, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, with my nearly deaf father,  I'm getting much more respect for accessibility.  Oh, absolutely, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wow, that's cool.  Isn't that cool?  Yeah, so on the right, there's a palette of words  that she can look at and choose.  On the left is there actually a JavaScript code  and she's actually creating,  partly you can do this because there's a lot of boilerplate  in the coding, especially JavaScript and Java.  Java script makes it easier.  Yeah, and she did after all type HY, not HI, but okay.  Oh yeah, she said that.  Let me see what her job is.  She must be an accessibility senior front end developer  at Netlify, Google Dev Expert and Moe's Tech Speakers.  Interesting, so she's just working on this on her own,  I guess.  Neat, that's a feel good story.  Thank you, Jeff.  That felt good.  Here's one that made me feel terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Huh?  Jeff's retweeting every five seconds.  I retweet, I'm doing research.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is how I find these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is how I add things into the rundown.  Jeff is tweeting, he's answering emails,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  he's probably writing the Medium post right now.  I have a cookie.  We actually busted Jeff.  This is the painting I'm working on, it's beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You weren't here last week, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At the end of the show, I'm looking  and Jeff's like tweeted 15 times during the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  You knew this all along, huh?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, every now and then, I'll check Twitter.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because I'm like, dude, I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  like I could read Twitter, like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's mostly retweeting.  It's mostly retweeting.  It's pretty easy.  Yeah, you just push a button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I was in my book history, Wong,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so there was a major scandal about an Oxford professor  and I retweeted that.  Hard.  I'm like, I'm not retweeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, ransomware has hit hospitals.  It hit the Sinclair television stations on Sunday.  All the TV stations were shut down by ransomware.  It has hit the infrastructure, water, sewage,  but this is a step too far.  Ransomware hits US candy maker ahead of Halloween.  Lisa's gonna be very upset.  No candy corn?  Ferrara, which makes get ready,  sweet tarts, nerds, Reds Hots, lemon heads,  pixie sticks, and everlasting Gob Stoppers  has had to shut down production in some facilities  trying to fill orders before Halloween.  Lisa's a big sweet tarts fan.  Yeah, I like sweet tarts too.  It's just sugar.  I honestly don't get it, but anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's one of the few candies I'll eat.  I don't eat a lot of candy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Ferrara first noticed that hackers  were encrypting its computers  demanding payment on October 9th.  They hired outside experts to help restore its system,  disclose the attack as it has to now on Tuesday.  Three Midwestern grain distributors have been hacked.

Transcript:  A lot of food lately.  That's big.  Yeah, a lot of food lately.  But man, keep your hands off my Red Hots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, with this ransomware though,  is it, having a backup isn't always the answer though,  right, because what if the backup is infected, right?  I'm noticing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, no, so it's really interesting to watch.  Listen to Security now,  because we talk a little bit about this on that show,  as you would imagine with Steve Gibson on Tuesdays.  But what's happened has evolved over time.  So the first generation, I will call it,  of ransomware was pretty pitiful.  They would encrypt your computer,  but then they would put up a notice saying,  go down to 7-Eleven and buy some money packs.  Oh yeah, the little cards.  Yeah, because they had no anonymous way  of getting the money.  With the ascendance of Bitcoin,  that's when, in my opinion,  the second generation of ransomware really took off,  because suddenly they had a way.  And at first they had to say,  and if you don't know what Bitcoin is,  and click this link, and here's how you buy Bitcoin.  But as more and more people know about Bitcoin,  it really is facilitated ransomware,  because everybody knows about it.  So that was the next big step.  The third generation was ransomware as a service,  where talented hackers would create ransomware,  like SodonoKiBee, which is one of the big ransomware tools,  and then create, in this case,  a ransomware service called Reval.  And then that meant that hundreds  of little, untalented hackers could go to,  you'd go to the websites, their special websites,  and you'd say, yeah, I'm gonna, they had affiliates,  and I'm gonna affect this, people.  The affiliate would use the ransomware software,  pay a percentage to the Reval gang,  and so they were making money,  but also a lot of people who didn't have the real skill set  to do ransomware were making money.  Then another generation came along,  as people started realizing, yeah,  good backup might be the solution.  And what they did, inspired, I think,  by the Sony hackers who did this,  was they would get into a system,  and they wouldn't trigger the ransomware immediately.  In other words, that email, that phishing mail,  wouldn't immediately encrypt everything.  No, the first email was to get them into the system,  and they would wander around the system,  and they were doing exactly what you're talking about,  which is they would find out where your backups were,  and they would make sure that they set off  the ransomware bomb everywhere, including your backups,  right, if they could, even in your offsite stuff.  The other thing they decided to do,  and they did this with Sony, is exfiltrate,  before they triggered the bomb, exfiltrate information.  And that's lately been the really deadly kind of ransomware.  So they'll say to a company like Ferrara,  that's not a good example, somebody,  usually a public company, we have all this information,  we have all your customers' passwords  and bank account numbers.  You're gonna pay us Bitcoin,  even if it's not to decrypt your data,  to keep us from embarrassing you.  And so that's been of the less-  A little blackmail.  It's real blackmail.  I mean, it is blackmail from day one,  and it's double blackmail now.  So yeah, it's been interesting to watch this evolve,  and it's nasty, it's nasty.  And then now they're starting to go after infrastructure,  and that's, of course, why the US government  has gotten very active in this,  and they're actually looking at treaties and so forth  to try to put pressure on-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and the tech industry is really pushing hard.  Like, you saw Sundar Pichai just talk about it,  Brad Smith from Microsoft, is pushing.  I mean, all the tech CEOs are like,  you know what, this can't be all in us,  because they recognize the fact that  they have a role to play,  but so do the people actually deploying  all these computers and infrastructure.  It's like, Google can't do anything,  just throwing this out.  Microsoft can't do anything if your water plant  doesn't have the budget to upgrade to the latest windows  and create policies to prevent people  from accessing Team Pure, right, remotely.  So some of these things,  we're just gonna have to have  some sort of federal mandates,  we're gonna have to have funding to get these companies  that historically haven't been targets  or don't have the budget for it, and the expertise,  because we can't mint that many cybersecurity experts.  It's not feasible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, and as with all securities,  you gotta attack in every area, multi-layered defense.  So you're also going after the payment systems,  getting the Bitcoin exchanges taken down,  you're going after the servers,  you're going after every aspect,  if you can get Putin and Xi to do something, that might help.  They don't seem to be all that interested.  But you get other countries involved.  Yes, you teach water control,  you give them the resources, the money,  and the instruction to keep them from  leaving Team Pure open on their system.  Yeah, you gotta do it all.  Fortunately, I think both government and industry  are taking it seriously, because it's bad.  I mean, it's really, really, really bad.  It is really bad.  Yeah.  The podcast business is booming,  writes Sarah Fisher on Axios, but few are making money.  Good.  Get out of the business.  Leave me alone.  Only a few big players make meaningful revenue  from podcasts today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am a small player, and I make meaningful revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is another clueless article.  Define meaningful, says Axios.  You didn't ask me.  Downloads per episode, this cracks me up.  Apparently, if you get 35,000 downloads,  you're in the top 1%.  Oh, I'm in the top 2%.  Boys and girls, we are in the top 1% easily.  Woo hoo, we know.  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah.  We don't actually try to sell at podcasts.  We used to make it if you don't have  more than 50,000 listeners, and we've gotten a little more.  I think we're now, in fact, I think, Ant, congratulations,  you just crossed the threshold with Hands-On Photography  so that we can start to sell your podcast.  So the reason we don't even bother  if it's below a certain number  is because advertisers don't, they don't care.  And even if they did,  because you charge per 1,000 listeners,  it's hardly worth the effort  if we're gonna make 200 bucks, right?  It's not. Exactly.  It's not gonna work.  So I don't know where she got her information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I bet she says in that article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it's from, you know, P, it's PricewaterhouseCooper,  Global Entertainment and Media Outlook.  Projected podcast revenue in 2024 will be 1.7 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Newspaper or magazine is going down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, minus, according to-  Time to pivot again.  Yeah, 27% down according to PricewaterhouseCooper.  But, you know, I always,  I don't know where they get the numbers  out of these projections and so forth.  I don't know. Yeah, I don't.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, in getting a media,  I mean, like, I remember trying to convince Fortune  to like monetize my podcast, and they were just like,  eh, it's such a non, I was like,  it would literally pay my salary and then some.  And they were like, eh.  I was like, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now the New York Times podcast division  reportedly brought in 30 million in revenue in 2019.  I believe that the Daily was very, very,  has been very, very successful in the area.  Who knows what they're spending?  They're spending a lot.  Right. Vox, it says, is in the eight figures,  which is somewhere between 10 and 90 million, I guess.  Spotify paid Joe Rogan 100 million  to sign an exclusive deal.  I think Spotify, it's pretty clear is deficit spending.  They're not expecting to make that money back.  They're overpaying.  They're overpaying, and they're investing  because there's other ways they can make money.  So anyway, I'm just glad to know  that most people are not making money.  Get out of the business.  You're just making it hard for the rest of us.  No, I'm kidding.  It's actually, I've said this from day one,  is if you want to do a podcast, do.  Don't expect to become rich doing it.  Do it because you want to.  Do it because you're excited about it  and passionate about it.  And then if you really are knowledgeable and passionate,  like Stacey and Kevin are, you'll make money on it.  You make a decent, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you can also look at it as a talent,  what is the word, funnel.  Yes. For you.  Like, I mean, find people who are good tech podcasters  and hire them if you need to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Absolutely. Absolutely.  You know, I tell Henry this all the time.  He's, by the way, any minute now,  he's going to hit a million followers.  Did he hit a million?  Yeah, he already did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He put it in the rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, congratulations.  He did one M today.  Yes. Congratulations.  But he's not making any money on it.  And I tell him, don't worry about making money on it yet.  Build your audience.  You got a rich dad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Build the brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not everybody has a rich dad.  No, no.  So I don't advocate this for all creators.  I'll just be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  At the same time, I don't think it's a good idea  to go into podcasting, hoping to make a living at it.  That's going to really hobble you.  Right?  Have a day job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but I have journalists at Glore who say,  I'm going to start my independent journalism thing.  And I always tell them form follows substance.  Don't tell me you're going to make a podcast.  Tell me what you're doing first.  Tell me your value first.  Tell me who you're serving and what they need first.  Then if you say I'm going to do a podcast as a form, fine.  But yeah, they're trying,  whether it's a blog or a podcast or an email newsletter,  they're trying to make a living out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but you may not,  I wouldn't recommend quitting your day job.  If your day job quits you, then go ahead.  Yeah, different story.  But you're smart, Stacey.  And you had a variety,  you knew what you were getting into, right?  Or did you?  Was it just chance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did.  Well, no, no.  I mean, I had a, let me put it this way.  I had two years of savings,  so I could lose money for two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's exactly how you do it.  I mean, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You didn't have to go through two years of savings  though, all that, before you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, I was,  I actually recouped my salary from Fortune  this first year that I was doing it.  Yeah.  Now I'm not going to,  I mean, I'm not going to make a million dollars.  I mean, my revenue for my podcast is,  it's roughly, it's a little over a quarter million.  So, I mean, but that's,  it's just me and I pay Kevin.  That's great.  I know, that's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's something to be really proud of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's working awesome.  Again, it's not venture capital worthy,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but it is totally viable for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, and that's the last thing anybody should say is,  well, my plan is to,  I'm going to get a big exit with Google or my IPO.  You should, even if you're a startup,  I mean, I would,  it's sad that a lot of startups do start with that in mind.  And that's not building value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it depends on what you're after.  If you're going to build like a whole new chip to take on AI,  you're going to need venture money.  But to start, I mean, a podcast is not expensive to operate.  And, you know, I,  my learning was taken at everybody else's dime  because I worked for publications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And by the way, despite his loaded dad, Salt Hank,  saved a lot of money, continues to work other jobs.  He's not, he's not just sitting there, you know,  having fun at my expense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, okay.  But he's actually working at that.  Oh, he's working really hard.  At Brando.  I mean, you can see he puts work into his.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  It's not just.  And by the way,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  he also does not live at his mom's house anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, you can stop that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Stacey, Stacey, you work really hard, right?  I mean, when it's your own business, you work really hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes and no.  I mean, I did this business  because I couldn't handle working 60 hours a week.  Like for other people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Were you working that hard for Ohm?  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh God, for Ohm, I swear to God, 60 to 80 hours.  And sometimes Ohm, he's a lovely man,  but sometimes he can be kind of a jerk to work for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like, you're like.  Was he demanding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, he just, he asks a lot of himself.  Yeah.  And he asks a lot of his people.  Yeah.  Did he put himself through anxiety and heart attacks?  He does not have children.  Right, right.  So there was an incident where he called me  when I was in the ER with my daughter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I'm like, hey, I'm in the ER.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm at a wedding, so I can't do this story.  Can you do it?  And I was like, no, no, no, my daughter's fine.  And I'm at the ER.  But he's like, oh, right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Jeez.  You know, but you're just like.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you would have to be pretty confident and strong  to say that to your boss, to be like, buddy.  Good for you.  I love you, but.  Yeah, yeah.  So, but those are the kind of things that I just,  I didn't want to deal with anymore.  And.  You want to be your own boss.  So I work hard, but I don't work as hard as I used to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Neither do I.  Good.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Neither do I.  But in the early days of this,  and I wasn't trying to build a podcast business at all,  but in the early days, you know,  the first few years of Twitter,  I was editing everything and doing everything.  I was hand creating RSS feeds.  Out of a tiny little.  Yeah, little, little attic studio.  So yeah, and that was hard work, but it was very gratifying.  I would argue maybe even more gratifying  when I had to do it all by myself.  Because at the end of the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Kevin and I did the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yeah, go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  At the end of the day, you would look and say,  I made that, I did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Kevin and I used to do.  No, I'll never be mixing.  I did it for the whole year.  The podcast for free.  And I did it after hours at Fortune.  And he did it after hours while at Google.  Yeah, that's the way you start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's exactly how you start.  And now your dog demands you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now I have to say,  I am, now I'm not gonna play this WNYC studios thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Does social media.  I put it there obviously.  Turn nice people into trolls.  But I did read the article and I kind of agree.  And I was gonna bookmark this as well.  So I'm glad you, I presume you put this in, Jeff.  Yes I did.  You could guess.  But no, I also was gonna put it in myself.  So research by Michael Bang Peterson.  Great middle name.  Michael Bang Peterson.  He's Danish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yeah, Michael Bong Peterson.  That's even better.  Is a professor of political science  at Aarhus University in Denmark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He has conducted research as part of the research  on online political hostility project.  According to Peterson, social media is a powerful tool  in the hands, yes, of people prone  toward political violence, misinformation.  In the hands of people prone towards political violence.  However, misinformation shared online  does not make people hostile.  Any more than let's say a violent video game  makes people violent, right?  So lies on social media.  This I thought was really interesting.  Serve to connect people who are already prone  to political violence.  In other words, you don't go into social media  and get radicalized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hi, dah dee dah dee dah.  I'm a normal person.  I'm just fine.  No, I'm crazy.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You go in there crazy and social media,  then you find all the people and you get together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you're crazy too.  What can we do together?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like you might be predisposed like,  I could listen to some crazy people.  Now I'm gonna listen to them a little bit longer.  And then you become, like,  I don't know if you're becoming radicalized  or if you've already been, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I've certainly seen people go down that rabbit hole.  But all of this is anecdotal.  I mean, this is a study.  So it's easy to anecdotally say,  yeah, I could think of a couple of people who seem normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My favorite part of his argument was that he said,  real life is the echo chamber.  Our lives every day is the echo chamber.  We do that all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We seek out like-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And what the internet does is puncture the echo chamber  and expose us to people we don't like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What you've always said, Jeff,  at the serendipity of the internet,  and that's why you want to preserve that.  Filter bubble.  Well, Jeff's always argued  against there being a filter bubble.  Yes, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so does Axel Bruns in the book.  In the book, are filter bubbles real?  His answer, after much research, is no.  And what Peterson is trying to say is,  he's saying that these tools can be used for bad.  He's not saying that.  But the presumption of the process is off,  and thus the interventions are gonna be off.  And that's part of the point too.  So he's saying people come into this predisposed.  That's point one.  But point two is, it's about this exposure to people.  And suddenly, somebody shakes his leg like,  I don't like those people who get vaccines.  Wow, there's a lot of them, right?  And I can see them now.  Whereas maybe every day I go to the bar,  and I go to my work, I don't see them.  And so I'm kinda happier, and I'm less angry,  and then I find the objects of my anger are present,  if I'm an angry guy, which I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I do think, though, you would agree that,  by the way, another interesting piece in this  was that Twitter is the least likely place  to radicalize people.  And I think that's where you get that serendipity.  That flow of other opinions that helps immunize people  against the filter, whatever.  You can create your own filter bubble.  You would admit to that, right?  I do also think, though, that when you had to write  a Unabomber manifesto, it was a lot of work.  That that meant that a lot of people  who were thinking that didn't do it.  But now it's so easy to write a 280-character manifesto  and fire salvos, that I think there is a lot more of that  just because it's so easy.  Would you agree to that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I would, I would absolutely.  And so, but the intervention to that,  to me, is what's interesting.  Because now we're in a mode of playing Whac-A-Mole  with bad and crazy stuff.  And we're never gonna win at that.  We are never, never, never gonna win at that.  There's always gonna be crazies out there,  and wackies, and hateful people.  And so I did an interview with a Argentine editor today,  and as he made me think about it,  I thought there are two skills we've gotta learn on the net.  One, which I've said before, is to ignore more crazy stuff.  Is to give it less attention.  Because the goal of the crazy is so often to get attention,  and the more crazy, the more attention.  And that's your, that'll fit into your algorithm argument,  is that if it's based on engagement,  and engagement is that form, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Though, Fiji Simo said in an interview,  who's now left Facebook and is now at Instacart,  and she said that Facebook is a mirror of society,  and she said that when people say,  well, get rid of the bad stuff, get rid of the engagement,  she said, that's nuanced because it might be  you're engaged in a protest movement.  And maybe you do dislike people,  and you're there because of that.  And so if you get rid of all engagement of that sort,  you could be getting rid of things  in political movements that matter.  But nonetheless, we've gotta learn to ignore idiocy better,  and we've gotta learn to say less idiotic stuff.  But we've gotta recognize,  there's just gonna be a whole mess of stuff out there.  That's why I think that the next generation of the net  has to be about selection and curation,  and finding that which is worth listening to.  And this is where I go back to my hopes for Jack's blue sky,  is that the speaking is a commodified layer  that now everybody can do, that's no longer a big deal.  But it was a big deal before,  you couldn't get in the New York Times,  then you could blog, and then you can tweet,  and you can Facebook.  Everybody who's connected, which is a limited number,  but still a huge number, can speak now.  So that's no longer the big deal.  Now the big deal is, what the hell's worth listening to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is perfect, because actually,  do you know, are you familiar with Ed Zitron?  Easy PR dude?  He has a newsletter that's pretty good.  And his newsletter for today was actually,  we need to educate people about how the internet works.  So we are doing all this crazy stuff at scale,  and we never tell people how things work,  how to choose what they see, how to curate things,  so they end up finding dopamine hits.  So basically, we've never told people  not to do drugs on the internet, right?  In the sense that, don't go for those quick dopamine hits.  And if I think back to it,  that's a lot of what I tell my daughter about engaging.  I'm like, think about this,  you will never unsee something that you see on the internet.  So really check before you, you know.  And again, don't engage with,  so basically it's kind of like,  I mean, it's kind of like the social mores  that we aren't picking up yet.  So I thought his article was pretty good on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do you think telling people it's a Skinner box  kind of inoculates them against the Skinner box?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if it will inoculate everybody.  I do think it helps,  I think it helps people,  again, if you don't know the rules,  knowing some of the rules will help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sometimes enough just to give somebody like  that much distance and they go, oh yeah, you're right,  I see what's happening and they can pull back.  If they don't know that they keep hitting that lever  to get the pill, they don't know they're doing that,  they might not be aware, but just a little awareness,  sometimes it's enough.  But the problem is not with everybody.  Some people go, yeah, but I'm still gonna hit it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The same with the drunk in the bar.  You don't go sit next to the drunk in the bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All got choices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But think about doom scrolling.  Before people started talking about doom scrolling,  I mean, was I doing it?  Yes, but once I had a name for it  and could identify the behavior,  I was like, oh shoot, I'm doom scrolling, stop.  Right, right, right.  Me too.  I think there's value in that.  Yes, that gives you that distance

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  to see what you're doing and go, oh, I'm gonna stop that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We need new institutions and pardon me,  we actually need a graphic for this.  Gutenberg moment!  The very first call for censorship of the press  was in Italy about 20, 25 years after Gutenberg,  where somebody pissed off about a bad translation of Pliny,  wrote to the pope and said, you've got to edit this stuff,  you've got to change this stuff, you've got to censor it,  you've got to control what comes out,  you've got to appoint people to do this.  And I realized he wasn't really asking for censorship,  he was asking for editors and publishers,  he was asking for the institutions  that eventually were created to filter and find quality.  Now those institutions-  And you don't want to go back to that gatekeeper mind.  I do not want to go back to that.  What I'm saying is those institutions are now insufficient  for a world of complete abundance.  We need to figure out and invent new institutions  and innate Facebook and innate Instagram.  And innate Congress.  And innate Congress, and so smart people,  I hope that my students, I want to teach a course,  I think I mentioned this last time with Doug Rushkoff  in designing the internet.  I wish I could sit in on that one more.  And trying to get students to see  that they do have agency and power  to decide what the internet ought to be.  And they can design an ethical regime, a regulatory regime.  Are you gonna record those lectures?  Anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're gonna be more discussions.  I wish you would record those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the great thing, by the way, is Doug,  Doug wrote, I wrote, what would Google do?  And Doug wrote, throwing rocks in a Google bus.  We come up with different views, right?  And Doug said, I love Doug, and Doug loves me.  And he said the other day,  I don't know if I said this on the show the other day,  he said, you know, Jeff, he said,  we end up at the same place,  which is we still believe we can make a better internet.  We just get there differently.  He said, I want less evil, you want more good.  That's fair.  And I think it's fair.  I think it's right.  I think it's just a different view.  But the goal is, see if we're running out  and we're kind of the same way.  And so if we have that discussion that Stacey wants,  if we have the ability to stand back  and look at what we're doing,  if we have the separation you just mentioned,  and then say, okay, then what is it we do?  We're gonna connect with each other online.  We can't turn that off.  But how can we do it better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What's our purpose for doing it?  The point of that study, and I think in general,  is you could do all that,  and they're still gonna be crazy people,  because they always have been crazy people.  And they're still gonna find each other,  and they're still gonna be online,  and there's really nothing you can do about that.  You can't get rid of crazy.  I wish we could.  I wish there were a pill we could put it in the water,  and all the crazy people would stop being crazy.  But crazy people make amazing things sometimes.  No, we need the diversity.  I agree.  Kafka, we need Kafka.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And who decides who's crazy?  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Exactly.  So let a million flowers bloom, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But just ignore some of the flowers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.  Or some of them are weeds, but that's, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some of them are exploding cactuses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Just get as far away as you can before they explode.  Some of them are Venus fly traps.  This is the study I was referring to.  It's not a very good one.  It's from sapientjournal.org.  There was only 17 people, mostly European, so it's worthless.  But it's interesting because they asked people  some statements, and there was a very strong correlation.  People who believed in one conspiracy theory  were more likely to believe in others.  While engagement with Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp,  and Messenger were all associated with an increase  in expressed conspiracy beliefs, engagement with Twitter  was associated with a reduction  in expressed conspiracy beliefs.  And if I think about it, that's the difference  between a strong recommendation engine  moving you in that direction  and a much more serendipitous salad of beliefs that maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, Leo, I was thinking about your algorithm complaints  or moral panic as a case.  Maybe just today with Twitter,  because there were some tweets that I saw that I said,  oh, somebody I really care about,  a couple of people I really cared about  and things I care about, and they popped up on my feed  and they were 17 hours ago.  And an algorithm is, now that's not ad supported,  that's love Twitter supported, right?  So it's a little bit different.  But I think it is possible to recommend,  it is possible to bring things out.  But on what basis are we doing it?  With what metrics, with what gauges of success?  That matters greatly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I think this is an old conversation  about the internet, about curation.  I think we've always recognized  that there's such a volume of content.  Without some help, it's almost impossible  to find what you want, enjoy your experience.  So curation of some kind.  But I think that algorithms that are tuned  toward maximizing engagement alone,  unfortunately, always seem to move  in the direction of extremism.  And so that's the problem.  And so, yeah, I'm not against curation at all.  What do we do here?  This is all about curation.  So I'm not against that at all.  People do need some guidance in this massive information  we're suddenly exposed to.  I just don't want it to be automated algorithms  tuned to maximizing engagement for purposes of profit.  That seems to be a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ben Evans, who I'm a big fan of, the analyst,  in his newsletter this week,  a piece called Stepping Out of the Fire Hose.  He talks about how people have hundreds of thousands  of emails, we have this abundance.  And he thought back, I love this analogy,  he thought back to the machine age  and out of the machine age came the arts and crafts movement.  Which was not an effort, I don't think,  to kill the machine, but it was saying,  well, what do we also value?  What do we also do?  It was humanizing it, right.  And so what are the reactions to the net  that can use the power saw, but it's still made by hands,  and make us something neat?  That's what's still possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm not against humanizing the net in all of our flaws.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's some jerky humans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, but that's fine.  I mean, that's why I don't have a problem with OAN,  or people want to listen to Steve Bannon's podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a problem with AT&T supporting and paying for OAN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's not clear, by the way, that that's what happened,  but whether it did or didn't.  I have a problem with my cable company writing OAN.  But that's their right, right?  It's a business.  So we're not gonna be, so, can't stop that.  But you can still write Jeff's Good Times News.  Yeah, what would Google do?  Let me take a break, because I am,  unless you want a three hour show,  I better do some ads here.  I'm not gonna, we ain't gonna get to be  a million dollar podcast without it.  Oh, the conversations of this show are great.  I have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this, I love, thank you, thank you for doing that story.  And I also love the next sponsor.  You know Stripe?  I know people, Stripe's doing interesting things.  Stripe also has a publishing arm,  run by my friend, Kate Lee.  They're doing fascinating things  you wouldn't expect from such a company.  But I'm getting ahead of you, go ahead, Lee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, Stripe's, I mean, and it's rude,  it's a payments platform.  But it's a great payments platform.  We all know Stripe, because we've all encountered it.  In fact, if you're a member of Club Twit,  that's what we use for Club Twit's payment system.  We love Stripe for the same reason  that so many businesses love Stripe.  First of all, it never goes down.  99.999% API uptime,  250 million plus API requests a day.  It's super reliable.  And that's, of course, that's kind of,  that's table stakes, you gotta be reliable.  But Stripe is also a great experience,  both for the people who set it up,  and the people, the customers who use it.  That's why Shopify uses Stripe,  that's why Lyft uses Stripe,  Kickstarter uses Stripe.  These are businesses that are growing,  that are ambitious,  and Stripe has helped them grow revenue  and expand to new markets quickly.  We use Stripe thanks to Memberful,  which is our subscription service.  And one of the reasons we like it  is because of the high conversion rate,  the ease of use, it's easy to do refunds,  if people ask for refunds.  It's just a really nice way.  They take more than 135 plus currencies  and payment types.  It's really a remarkable platform.  It's easy to use once you,  once integrated, their single platform  and world-class docs allow businesses  to easily experiment, to scale and grow revenue.  They do billions of dollars every year  for every size of business.  Hundreds of features and improvements  added every year to help you stay ahead  of the industry shifts.  When you partner with Stripe, you can,  and this was our experience exactly,  free up your team to focus on other areas  of your business.  Our payments platform does not occupy any cycles.  It just works.  It works for our users.  It works for us because Stripe is engineered  with the world's most powerful and easy to use APIs.  So it's so easy to get up and running  in minutes, not days.  And for those of you looking for a no-code solution,  this is so cool.  They just launched payment links.  This allows you to sell online by just generating a link.  You can text or share with your customers  to get paid fast, no coding required, very simple.  There's another thing I love.  They've invested in our earth with Stripe Climate.  As a Stripe user, you can direct a fraction of your revenue  to help scale emerging carbon removal technologies  in just a few clicks.  So I think this is such a great thing.  I don't know if we're doing this.  If we're not, we're gonna, I love that idea.  Stripe is leveling the global playing field  for people looking to start new businesses  or expand existing businesses,  whether you're a pre-seed startup or a Fortune 500 company,  everybody uses Stripe.  It's just the best way to do payments.  So whether you're an online or in-person retailer,  whether you're a software platform or a marketplace,  or like us, a subscriptions business,  go to stripe.com to learn more about how Stripe  could support your business today.

Stripe.com, and I can't tell you how happy we are  to use Stripe, and I think you've all had a great experience.  I know you have.  Thank you, Stripe.  Stripe.com.  Let's do some fun stuff.  Did I talk about, I think I didn't talk about  on this show yet.  Waymo, Google's self-driving vehicles,  seem to have a problem with just one street  in the Richmond district of San Francisco.  It's a dead end street, and for some reason,  Waymo vehicles seem to want to head down that street  and then do a big U-turn.  This is Channel 5's report upon this.  I want to show, because there's some video in it,  I won't turn on the audio.  They interview one of the people who lives in this dead end,  Jennifer King.  She said, I noticed it when I was sleeping.  I awoke to a strange hum.  I thought there was a spacecraft outside my bedroom window.  No, it was this.  That's how San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was a Waymo vehicle making a U-E.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And apparently, for some reason, like, I don't know, fish,  they're attracted to this dead end street.  They all go down it and make a U-turn.  There's some days, there can be up to 50,  literally every five minutes.  We're all working from home, so this is what we hear.  As Channel 5 was there recording,  it was easy for them to catch a bunch of Waymos  making this U-E.  Now, there's a safety driver,  but the safety driver doesn't get involved.  The Waymo's just taking the best route,  and that's exactly what Waymo says.  We continually adjust to dynamic San Francisco road rules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which, as anybody who's driven in San Francisco knows,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  yeah, they're dynamic, all right.  In this case, cars traveling north of California Street  on 15th Avenue have to take a U-turn  due to the presence of slow street signage on Lake Street.  So the Waymo driver is basically obeying the road rules.  But see, this is the thing.  You and me, when we drive down that street,  we go, just keep on going.  I'm not gonna stop, make a U-turn, go the other way.  No, slow streets, I got it, I'll slow down.  But the Waymo takes it seriously,  a commercial vehicle, I guess,  and so they can't go on the street,  so they get there and they turn around by the dozen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is so fascinating from a,  hey, how will robotic driving or delivery  or any other automation kind of thing  change the value of the real estate of your home  or your business?  Oh yeah.  Because we kind of talked about that with the Starbucks.  We talked about this a couple weeks ago  with drone deliveries.  Oh yeah.  Well, you sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, Waze does it.  This has to affect these houses  on the Richmond District Street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, like if you're like.  You have to disclose it.  Well, there's one little problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How do you feel about electric vehicles?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can always catch a cab here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, there you go.  It's just a bad spin.  That's hysterical.  So they're seeing the sign that says slow street  and because the point of those signs  is the city put those up to limit commercial traffic  through residential districts.  So I guess the way most says, I'm commercial.  I see that sign, got to turn around.  And as I said, anybody else is going to.  UPS driver goes, screw that, I got a delivery to do.  Well, you got to keep rolling.  Yep.  Hey, praise to Google for this.  Bloomberg is calling this a moonshot.  They want to be the first giant company  run without emissions around the clock  and their goal is to do this.  I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No offsets, no buying carbon being zero carbon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Literally using zero carbon.  And they want to do this.  But when do they want to do this?  It's committed to go free of carbon without using offsets,  relying only on clean energy purchased near its locations  24 hours a day.  I don't see the year,  but I think they want to do this faster than anybody else.  I mean, Apple said we want to do that by 2030,  Amazon by 2040,  but a lot of that is buying carbon offsets  to be carbon neutral.  So good on you.  I think they've been a leader in this  and I'm glad it's not merely carbon offsets,  but they're really going to attempt to get renewable energy  for all of the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've got to figure out the battery situation  and how to do that.  Have I talked about this in the show?  Our friend Bill Gross, his company, energyvault.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, we know Bill, of course,  and his incubator. Bill's wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Great guy.  So look at energy, we got to get him on the show, by the way.  Energyvault.com,  which Bill says that every place  where you can store energy through water,  setting it up to the reservoir and getting it back down  is pretty much taken.  So energyvault moves blocks of cement and rock boards.  I have seen this. Up and down.  Yes.  And so this is the kind of thing  that Google's going to have to invest in.  So here's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is the problem.  The sun is out,  pouring energy onto the surface of the earth,  but the problem is at night or in the clouds,  it's not putting any in there.  So how do you somehow find a way to store that energy?  So what they do is they, during the day,  when the sun is shining, they do heavy things.  And then at night, they can undo the heavy things.  Okay, gotcha.  Yeah.  So you do the same thing with hydro sometimes.  You'll pump water uphill and then you run it down.  Precisely, that was the inspiration.  Yeah. Yeah.  So what are they doing? They're moving big blocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, which lets you kind of take waste material too  and turn that into the blocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, they don't put it down.  They're heavy.  It's like a clock. They wind it up in the daytime  and then they let it run down at night and generate.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, clever.  So that's a different way to store energy  that doesn't use batteries and chemicals  and everything else, it uses blocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's just like a clock, right?  Every morning I get up, my cuckoo clock,  the little pine cone weight right to the floor.  I pull it and put energy into it  and then the rest of the day when I'm not around it,  slowly going back down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they raised 1.6 billion in a SPAC deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wow.  Here they are doing a slewing test.  What's a slew?  I don't know.  The only problem is, I got to say,  I don't want to live next door to this disgusting ugly crane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was suggesting to Bill that he should do this inside,  unused skyscrapers.  We don't need any more because of offices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go.  I mean, there it is. There's this brick.  So it lowers the brick to generate electricity.  And it does this autonomously, by the way.  There's nobody sitting in the cab there pressing buttons.  No, no, no.  That's absolutely, that's the kind of  entrepreneurial thinking I like.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Moving concrete.  Anyway, so Google's going to have to work on  those kinds of technologies  as well as the gathering of energy.  The storing and transmission of energy is going to matter.  It always bugs me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There was another article saying  the only way to a sustainable future is nuclear.  And it always bugs me because there's so much energy  pouring onto the surface of the earth from the sun  that really, and it seems to me that that seems like  something we should be taking advantage of.  It's too logical, sir.  It's there for the taking.  We just have to figure out how to store it.  That's really the biggest problem.  And get better at more efficient at collecting it.  I've got almost 100 solar panels on my roof now.  Geez, nice.  I would have more, but PG&E does not want us to go  into competition with them, our local power company.  Literally, the truth is their business,  their money making business is building power plants.  So they don't want homeowners to be generating  more electricity than they need,  pumping electricity in the grid,  because that makes their power plants less valuable.  So how do they stop you?  They won't let you.  They won't buy it?  They won't, yeah, I guess if I were off the grid,  I could do whatever I want.  But I'm on the grid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What rules, like they charge you to sell your energy,  but Arizona started doing this to people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's so annoying.  Geez.  Because if everybody in California decided,  yeah, let's put a solar, this won't happen,  but if they did, we could put PG&E out of business.  That's what they're afraid of, by the way.  And I have big batteries in the house  because it's the same issue, right?  So we have big Tesla power walls,  which is, as I remember, recycled Tesla car batteries.  And they charge up during the day  and they discharge during the night.  Now, if we could find out how to do cold fusion,  then we're golden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my gosh, the New Yorker did a whole story on this.  I was like, oh, it must be time for the every once a decade  cold fusion story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, they could put that right next  to the quantum computer story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Quantum computing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've had movement in quantum computing.  And paperless offices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's true, we've had zero movement in fusion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not true.  Cold fusion.  We have had new materials.  I just read the once a decade cold fusion article  in the New Yorker.  We have had graphene, baby.  No, we've had new materials science come out  that helps us build more efficient magnets  for those, remember, you gotta have a superheated  magnetic bottle to the plasma.  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm all for cold fusion, man.  When they come up with that.  Yeah, everyone is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, sure.  That sounds like a really good drink.  Ice cold fusion.  I'll take a wipe of ice cold fusion, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are actually 25 cold fusion startups right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  See, there you go.  So maybe it's not.  Crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe it's not.  Sorry, I just, I had to say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe it is time.  No, no, keep us up to date on those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A couple Amazon stories.  Sure.  You looking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Amazon and Starbucks gonna launch a co-branded lounge.  Exactly.  That combines the ghost stores with a cafe.  There are some great anecdotes about the Amazon ghost  stores, by the way.  Really?  In Brad's book.  Oh yeah.  It's really funny.  They had a lot of problems.  Early on, it was technically a very challenging thing.  For instance, what if people bring in children?  Oh yeah.  You know, who do you charge?  If the child takes something off the shelf,  you have to attach a child to adult.  And children, especially, you know, in a certain age group,  like to move things around.  Oh, that's good.  They're like, they're like, you know,  they're really messing up things.  So that was an issue as children.  There was, it was apparently not an easy thing to do.  And they went through a lot of iterations on the ghost store  before they got it working.  So the ghost store, which is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm trying to figure out how this,  so you walk in, does it know, oh, he just walked in,  you're gonna get a latte?  You scan your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It scanned your phone.  There's an Amazon Go app and you scan it.  Here's my Go app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They do-  Right, but you still need somebody to make the coffee,  as opposed to the Amazon Go store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, there are more people behind the counter  in the Amazon Go.  Their excuse for this is,  don't worry about the checkout people.  There's more people behind the counter than ever.  Although, in the early days of the Amazon Go,  they really wanted to have it be kind of a boutiquey store  with cheese and meats and all kinds of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was a horrible flop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And Bezos at one point goes in and says,  get rid of all the fresh food.  That's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't figure out how to control stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It has to be jarred in bottles.  And you know, it has to be nice.  But I guess with Starbucks, you know,  they see you, they see you make your order.  They see you take your order.  How do they know what you ordered?  How would they know it's a half-caf, half-decaf, half-caf  with a triple order of a triple shot?  A half-caf, decaf with triple shot of hazelnut  and a half twist of lemon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  167 degrees exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How do they know what to charge you?  I mean, how would they know?  They read your lips.  Maybe they're listening.  Maybe they're like nose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Starbucks actually uses highly censored  coffee machines in their store.  So maybe they just can censor up  whatever like coffee gets made.  That's what they charge you for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They can tell.  This is ordering a coffee LA style.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All of a half double decaf and a half-caf  with a twist of lemon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The ghost store just went crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What is that from?  Is it LA story?  LA story.  Oh, what a great show.  Yeah, what a great movie.  Steve Martin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.  So above that story, David, this just happened.  I just discovered this because I was looking  at Twitter during the show.  See, cause I do my research all around the clock.  I never sleep.  I never stop.  I constantly look for stories.  I put it in there.  David Cicilline, the representative,  is complaining about Amazon and its  private labels.  Private labels, yes.  And Ben Evans is brilliant on this topic  and brings out the history of it.  That's what Sears did.  That's what everybody.  Oh, I love this.  That's what your grocery store does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So this is the tweet from the member of Congress,  David Cicilline.  Imagine, if you, imagine,  you don't have to imagine too hard.  Imagine if you ran a store and knew exactly  which products would sell best.  Rather than competing on the merits,  you just copy those products down to the smallest detail.  Now imagine you place the original on the next aisle  on the highest shelf out of view.  You can't lose.  And that's exactly what Safeway and Kroger's  and Piggly Wiggly do with their generic and house brands.  They've been doing that for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sears did it a century ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  So this, and this was by the way,  again in this book, this is Amazon's,  always Amazon's response.  We're not doing anything.  They always pretended that they, this was the problem.  Amazon, instead of being aggressive, said,  look, this is what, this is America.  This is how you do it.  They pretended that there was a Chinese wall  and they didn't share any of this data.  And there's no, and I think they maybe created  this problem for themselves by pretending  that they didn't know.  Because they obviously did.  Yes, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because then we do what retail does.  It's a tiny part of their revenue versus,  it's like 20% of those stores you mentioned  and it's 1% of Amazon.  Yeah.  I need you to translate something for me.  Okay.  Go ahead, Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I was just going to say, at least in grocery stores,  the house brands are actually usually made by companies  that make the name brands too.  So they're getting money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, you don't think Jeff Bezos is sewing those sheets  he's selling me.  Of course he is.  Of course he is.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're not necessarily going through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They may be starting a whole business around it.  Yeah.  Benedict Evans says, you could argue Amazon's  use of marketplace data is unique  since their suppliers are also their customers.  But every retail on earth has copied and competed  with their suppliers since the 19th century.  This is 20 to 30% of sales at most big retailers.  He has a chart, Smart and Final, Kroger's, Macy's,  Lowe's, Costco, and it's all in the 20s.  This is an FTC study from the 1930s.  80% of the stores in the US sold private labels.  And this is Sears from a century ago.  He says to Cicilline, well done.  You discovered retailing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I love the guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ben's the greatest.  And he does it with an accent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But you're right, Stacey, maybe it is  quantitatively different or qualitatively different  because Amazon isn't just buying house brand Cheetos  from Frito-Lay, they're creating a Cheetos company.  They're making up their own factories and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I honestly don't know.  Amazon Supply Channel.  I don't know, are they doing factories?  Amazon Basics is so opaque.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we don't, yeah.  Their batteries suck.  Would it be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  See, I don't think Amazon's making their own batteries.  They've gotta be buying them  from some big battery company, right?  Yeah, they're buying bad batteries.  Some crap battery company.  I don't have a problem with Amazon's batteries.  That's all we buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amazon's batteries have less,  I mean, the devices I put them into,  they last just as long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The damn fire and smoke alarms.  I won't allow them to the smoke alarms anymore.  Oh, we don't allow them in our smoke alarms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're nine volts terrible.  They're terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Three in the morning.  Oh, you all agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the nine volts are bad.  They're double A's and triple A's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm trying to remember what I put in mine.  Why can't we, why is it, Stacey, Ms. IoT, Queen of IoT,  why is it that you have to stand under five  of the different smoke alarms to figure out  which is the one that's out of the battery?  Why is this so hard for them?  Because yours aren't connected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because you haven't paid $150 per smoke alarm  for a connected smoke alarm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay, now I got a question too.  I'll answer Jeff's then I'll ask you.  Jeff, it's because of the frequency is so high.  We are not very good at locating that frequency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that an age thing, sir?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, everybody.  It's the, there's just teasing.  It's a human ear thing.  Human ear thing.  But I'll ask Stacey this.  We also have connected alarms which are powered,  but they have a battery, I assume, for backup.  Why is it I have to change the batteries on them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because the power goes out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because after a certain period of time,  the battery might not be as effective.  It's a safety thing.  That's all it is.  Okay, because it might go out.  That's like an extra, yeah, because the battery might leak,  it might do whatever, and you gotta keep an eye on that.  You're supposed to actually replace your smoke detectors  every like 10 years.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, because yeah, the radioactive stuff runs out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're trying to get our electrician to come,  but you can't get an electrician anywhere for 10 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I'm good.  This is the great resignation.  That was that article I was referring to in the Atlantic.  People who had crappy jobs are not going back to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they're sharing their unhappiness with the world now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And there's such a demand for people who know  how to do things like electricians, plumbers,  handymen of all stripes,  that they don't even have to return your call.  They just go, no, I don't need your business.  Go elsewhere, my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sometimes they'll come out and give you estimates.  And then disappear.  And you never hear from them.  Yeah.  Like you spent time in my house.  This is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a universal problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So line 140, Leo, is related.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  As we swoop down to line 140.  We'll go back up, but line 140.  I quit.  Reddit users are posting their angry resignation texts  to their bosses on an anti-work subreddit.  Okay, we have had some interesting ways of quitting.  We have had one person quit by text.  I don't think that's nice.  We did have one person quit  by bringing in a dozen donuts,  putting them on the counter,  and then saying, I quit and leaving.  So now when people quit, we call it dropping donuts.  By the way, that person, several years later,  came back and said, can I have a job?  And said, not without donuts.  And then, but I think the best way to quit,  if I'm wrong, is to go in person,  put on your big boy pants,  and go in and say, I'm leaving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But these cases, if you go to the Reddit subreddit,  they have jerk bosses who are trying to roll around,  and it's that wonderful moment  where you just say, effective immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I love this.  Here's one.  The boss texts,  because now if the boss texts you, that's different.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  It's different.  The boss texts you,  we are going to talk about this attitude  when you come in Sunday,  to which he replied, no, we're not.  Bartenders are needed all over the place now.  I think I'll just go work at one of the dozens of places  hiring around here.  I'm fed up with you.  To which the boss says, give me a call.  Don't make such an impulsive decision.  Too late.  You're making a mistake because you're drunk,  and you think it's a good idea.  When you wake up tomorrow, you are gonna regret this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I can't print the response.  Body parts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay, I am now following this Reddit.  It's the slash R anti-work Reddit.  And I guess it's unemployment for all, not just the rich.  I'll be joining this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yeah, I think there's more strikes coming back.  I think unions are gonna be pushing back.  I think we're gonna see a big labor change.  Huge differences in pay.  Inflation is a result, but that's fine.  Because the pay needs to go up.  It's a fascinating moment.  Do you think it will change our immigration policies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is something I've been thinking a lot about.  It should.  Well, it should, but we've got such a vitriol  against immigrants.  Furgers.  I'm really intrigued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That and the fact that 700,000 people  are dead due to COVID.  I mean, that's not surprising.  That has an impact.  That has an impact, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not just the people who are dead from COVID, right?  There's the people who are dead.  There's the people who have long COVID,  which is a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And people who are afraid to go to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My husband died and I am now a single parent  and my life is total crap, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The people who have to deal with their kids  not being at school.  And yeah, you wanna know why there's a...  And gee, I worked at home for a year  and why would I go back to that hell hole  we call an office?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a big battle there.  People have gotten more comfortable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not that you're saying it's a hell hole  at a twit there, Ant, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ant's like, I'm gonna be judicious here, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're trying to give you snacks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Again, I worked at home for most of my...  Take the coffee maker, please.  Just take it home, Sant, you can have it.  Okay, he said it.  He said it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  He said it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ant's not coming in without donuts, damn it.  It's donuts, damn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The best part about these texts on this Reddit forum

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  is in almost every case, the boss says,  wait a minute, think it over, don't rush.  It's like, oh man, that's gotta be satisfying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Please don't quit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whoops.  It's been sad though, just seeing,  at least here in this area,  the businesses that are either struggling  because they don't have the work staff  or struggling because they couldn't come back.  I really hate going into the grocery store nowadays  because there's never enough help in there.  The lines are ridiculous and long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We went to a restaurant and said,  please pardon the slow service,  but we can't fire enough waiters.  And so it's just gonna be slow, sorry.  Because people don't feel they're not being paid enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  or they're like, you know what,  I make more money sitting at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, that's the question.  So if you quit this, look, nobody should be working  for minimum wage at a terrible job they hate.  But do you go to another job?  Are there better jobs waiting for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lots of places are hiring now, yeah.  And they're giving bonuses.  McDonald's is paying more and giving bonuses to start.  McDonald's near me pays $16 an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But having worked at McDonald's for several years,  I can tell you it's not the best job ever.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but if you're like a teenager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, it's a great job for teenagers.  That's a great gig.  Were you a Spudboy, Leo?  I was making $2.35 an hour.  So what was your specialty at McDonald's?  Well, you start, no, no, you work your way up.  There's a progression.  I started the counter.  Would you like fries with that, sir?  You want an iced apple pie?  And then you get to work the soda machine.  Then you do work, eventually get to go to this fryer vats.  That's dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can a robot do the soda machine now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Not anymore, yeah.  Well, yeah, not anymore.  These jobs don't exist.  Then the fryer vats.  And then you work your way up to grill.  And then after you do grill,  then you work your way up to closer.  And then manager.  Got to key it in.  You get a key.  And then eventually, you get to go to Hamburger U.  Whoa.  And that is the pinnacle.  And actually that's why I got fired,  because the manager sat me down and said,  I have a feeling you don't want to become management.  I said, no, it's a summer job.  Dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My manager at Ponderosa Steakhouse  tried to convince me not to go to college,  because you got a future here, kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh boy.  Yeah, it's kind of the same, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So it isn't a bad job.  I learned how to work at McDonald's.  I thought that was, I mean,  there were a lot of things, life lessons there,  but you do come home smelling like hamburgers,  which is a little hard to get a date.  But other than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Greasy hair.  Yeah.  And if you're closer,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  like you're getting home at two in the morning.  Two in the morning.  And you're watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wouldn't think that's a move up.  I would think closer would be an awful part of the job.  No, because you get a key, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You get a key, you get more money.  Yeah.  It's pre-management.  And those. Plus at Ponderosa.  Where did you work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you work in a fast food?  Did you have really good roles?  I won't say to chain,  but I did work in fast food for my first job.  Yeah, it's a good first job.  I got to the point where  I didn't want to step up that chain,  like what you were doing,  because I saw that was more work.  I didn't mind sitting in the back,  emptying trash, washing dishes.  And I had a little radio back there.  It was.  Was it a hamburger joint?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Fried chicken?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  Steaks? Lobster?  Hey, these are security questions.  I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I will say that's when my weight problem began,  was working at McDonald's.  Well, the perfect example was I wanted to take a break.  You get a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stop massaging him, please, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's creeping me out.  I'm kneading my loaf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And the manager said,  you could take a break,  but you have to eat five Big Macs.  Because they get dinged if they don't get eaten.  He has to throw them in the waste bin.  And that's part of your metrics.  So he said, look, eat these  and you can have your break.  And I got in the habit, but that's a bad habit.  It's a really unhealthy habit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I know.  That's bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I still crave them.  Also, that's not legal.  Well, it might've been in 1972.  I don't know.  Back in the days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They didn't even have car seats back then.  No, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Everything was legal.  You could smoke on an airplane.  Except marijuana.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, I want you to explain something to me.  Go.  Is it a zip code?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know what it is.  It's Jack's tweet.  It actually is too long for a zip code.  It's six digits, huh?  Jack's, what could it mean?  It's probably something to do with Bitcoin.  So he just,  oh, oh, it does.  It is crypto.  It refers to a block number on the Bitcoin blockchain  and a block with that number was indeed mined on Tuesday  at 2014 UTC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Jack's mining?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well,  Twitter users were quick to pull up  the Bitcoin Block Explorer to see if there's anything  unusual about that block.  Little out of the ordinary could be found.  Is that why the price went up today?  You can also, yeah, the price is through the roof, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep, new record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Man, that wallet's, my wallet's really starting to  burn a hole in my pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can't you hire some hacker to figure it out for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, everybody asked me that.  No, it's strong encryption.  It's only gonna get hacked  if I can remember what I used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We need the crypto shrink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Everybody says that hipness.  Pulls out these, yeah.  Henry came to me and said,  there's a guy named Bitcoin Jerry that'll unlock it.  I said, what do you mean?  He said, no, I saw it in the Wall Street Journal.  It's a bunch of hackers.  And I said, wait a minute, and at the time,  this is worth a quarter of a million dollars.  You think that if you give them my wallet  and they unlock it that you're gonna get  any of that money back?  He said, oh yeah, they only take 10%.  I said, no, no, no, no.  Do not give Bitcoin Jerry my wallet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They wouldn't have hacked it anyway, I don't think.  Because it's strong encryption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They only take 10% and donate it to a friend  and they keep the rest for themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I wasn't gonna give a quarter of a million dollars  to some anonymous hacker consortium named Bitcoin Jerry.  What a name.  It was something like that.  It was Bitcoin and a first name.  I don't remember the first name.  Apparently, he said,  but they're in the Wall Street Journal,  it's gotta be good.  I said, well, I don't know that necessarily.  They did the vetting.  No, I wouldn't trust the Wall Street Journal.  Yeah, I don't know, they vetted Bitcoin Jerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what we haven't done yet, Leon?  Change log time, let's do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Google Change Log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Jason, Hale and I are sitting there,  10 a.m., getting ready for the big Google event.  I thought, maybe I'll just refresh my Android phone  and see, and yes, indeed, Android 12 arrived  on my Pixel phone.  If you have a Pixel phone, you're gonna get it,  if you're Pixel 3 and above, the official release.  I don't know of any other manufacturers  who have Android 12 on their phone yet,  but I imagine that's just around the corner.  It's nice, I like Android 12.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you were on the beta, right?  That's why you had the first rollout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I was on the beta, but have you,  you said you have a Pixel 3?  I'm on a 4XL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just updating mine right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, you should check, you have to check,  it won't necessarily force it on you, you have to.  Oh, okay, so that's why you got the 4XL.  Check and see, you gotta just go to your settings.  Yeah, I did it manually.  Yep, and it's really nice, I think the material you,  taking the color from the wallpaper and all,  that's very nice.  Live captioning, now playing song recognition's  getting better, redesigned emoji, scrolling screenshots,  so you have a screenshot that's not just the size  of the screen, but whatever's below that as well.  Games you can play while they download,  if you're really impatient.  New one-handed mode, accessibility option  that lets you control the device.  There you go, see?  Using face gestures, you can't do a JavaScript,  but you could do something.  So, owners of compatible Samsung, OnePlus,  Oppo, Realme, Techno, Vivo, and Xiaomi devices,  you will be getting it later this year.  It went out on the AOSP site earlier this month.  So, here comes Android 12, which does have a dessert name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't catch that.  Which one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm trying to remember, I saw it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What letter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't even remember the letter now,  see this is why the-  Mr. Reagon, Mr. Reagon, you know?  Yes, we used to care.  Well, that's when they put the sculptures out and everything.  It is Snowcone.  Snowcone.  Or Snokini, depending on

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  what country you're from.  Snowcone.  Wow.  Snokini.  Snokini.  I think that's how it's pronounced.  Starting today on Pixel 6 and Pixel 6.  Snokini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Snokini, if you're in France.  Starting today on Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro.  The latest phone app features,  wait times and direct my call,  make calling businesses easier.  They demoed this, this will be coming  when you get your Pixel 6,  where the bank puts you on hold and you can say,  yeah, just let me know when it's done.  Once you ring the business, direct my call  helps you get to the right place with less hassle.  This is cool.  You know how you get that message, press one.  Google Assistant transcribes the message  and the menu options displays them on the screen.  So you just tap it.  So you don't have to remember the options,  it just shows you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Be aware that our menu items have changed.  Yeah, why do they say that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Every time they say that.  So here we are calling Save More Bank.  Thank you for calling Save More Bank, human.  Please listen closely.  And then it transcribes it  and it actually turns it into a button.  That's awesome.  Super cool.  Super cool.  Google knows where the pain points are, don't they?  That's awesome if it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  In terms of buying phones, Google is the pain point.  But look at that. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff, my God.  How long are you gonna beat this dead horse?  Oh, oh, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How many times have I had to do this?  I'm just, you're gonna like this.  I think they've learned it by now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You're gonna like this.  I'm sorry.  So when an unknown business calls you,  you can now, if it's actually a business  and not a spam call,  you can actually share information back to Google.  And over time, that information will be displayed  on incoming calls.  So that the whole idea is,  because you know, caller ID is so imperfect.  So they're gonna improve Google's,  they call it extensive caller ID coverage of businesses  with your help.  The information is not joined with any user identifiers.  So your information helps others.  Yeah, just in the same way,  when you declare something spam on Gmail,  enough people say it's spam.  Yeah, we share that.  Yeah.  So it's a collaborative thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you get a legit call, you can say,  hey, this was legit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, I think that's great.  Here you go.  Here's an example screenshot from Google  where there's a number.  And then it says, likely finance and insurance.  So it may not say the name of the business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is an example of trying to curate  and join together to find the good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, good stuff.  Good.  It's, you know, the FCC's done such a crap job  of eliminating.  Now, Jessica Rosenworcel,  who is the FCC commissioner, is temporarily chairman,  does say we're gonna take more,  we're gonna start prosecuting companies and so forth  that allow spam calls through.  They're gonna really demand phone companies do a better job.  We'll see.  She's just saying that.  They haven't actually promulgated a regulation yet.  And of course, they'd have to go through,  you know, a comment process and all of that.  Manual call screen being expanded to the UK, France,  Germany, Australia, Ireland, Italy, and Spain.  Transcriptions, I don't, you know,  if you watched the event yesterday,  big improvement, right?  Fast, automatic translation.  I think it's gonna be really, really interesting to see.  Pixel 6 can live translate your messages.  It can live translate images to a la Google Lens  and transcribe local audio.  And it does it because of the tensor chip.  It can do it on device.  So it doesn't matter if you're on the internet.  Doesn't matter if you're connected  and it does not send it back to the home office.  That's really cool.  So here you go.  This is an example of texting  with somebody who speaks Japanese.  They text their answer in Japanese  and it's translated into English automatically.  And in very-  World peace shall follow.  Yeah, it's the babel fish from the Hitchhiker's Guide.  And that's where they-  It's not the babel fish?  Or babel babel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  Well, if it were babel, it should have two Bs.  If it's babel, it has one B in the middle.  It's the-  Yeah, but isn't babel the tower of babel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's where the word babel came from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I believe it's the tower of babel.  Really?  There's only one B.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I know, but like-  Sounded like Angelo.  That's where the word babel comes from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, maybe.  It might also come from what it sounds like  those ferners are saying.  We're screwed next when we need them.  I believe it's babel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm rocking my world here, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  British.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Leo's British.  Oh, in Britain they say babel  in the US they say babel.  I'm playing for you the Google thing.  Let's hear it, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Transcript:  Everybody knows.  Tower.  It was in Deuteronomy.  The tower of babel.  I know that.  I'm gonna talk like an American from now on.  You said the tower of babel?  Tower of what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's what we should be talking about.  It was in the Book of Dada Romany.  Everybody know that in the babel.  Google's 30 watt charger for the Pixel 6.  Ooh, you're gonna be paying $25  and if you wanted the new Pixel Stand 2, that's delayed.  Do not buy the Pixel Stand 2  because it's dopey.  At least if it's anything like the Pixel Stand 1.  It barely holds things.  It's just dopey and it never did any of the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looks like a 3D printed product.  It looks, it's not good.  I was like, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's so many better easel, Qi charging stands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What cases did you guys get?  Cause since mine, that also got eliminated from my book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wanted a clear one.  I bought a clear Amazon one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There you go.  Yeah, yeah, I always do that from like weird name companies.  Spigen usually.  Spigen makes them, but you can get them for $10  from usual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got the formal Google thing.  I just, I did too, but it didn't come until,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  what did I say, April?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just looked at my order.  It is a Spigen case for mine.  Thank you.  And I just looked at my order and it is from Scooboo.  Case 88.  Well, my tempered glass is from some weird.  I don't like that.  I don't put that stuff on my.  Super shields designs, tempered glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  $8.99 ultra thin, slim shockproof,  crystal clear case, soft TPU.  And I think they say somewhere in here will not brown,  but they all do.  They all do.  They all do.  They age, but they're cheap.  And what I really think you need it for this time  is to cover the bump.  Make it even.  It doesn't cover the bump.  It doesn't cover it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It doesn't cover it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It doesn't cut out for the bump.  It cuts it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does it highlight the bump?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It highlights the bump.  It's so that you can put it on the desk  and not have it go flip flop, flip flop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what my pop socket's for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh God.  That's exactly.  That's exactly why I don't use a pop socket.  Cause I want my phone to lie flat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sheesh.  Pop socket.  Miss Higginbotham is a 14 year old.  Pop socket.  She's a teenager at heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So she's a 14 year old.  Do you have a customized pop socket  that's got like a picture?  You do.  The first I do is have my dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's nice.  That's happy dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, cool.  That's cute.  So did you send them a picture  and they made a pop socket with your dog on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So my husband who thinks  these are the stupidest thing in the world for Christmas  sent them a picture and had it made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Did you get one for your daughter too with you on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, because my daughter also thinks they're stupid.  She doesn't use the phone.  Like she just.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I don't know what's happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  She's waiting for the air.  Does she hold it like this though?  If she ever talks to you, she doesn't hold it like that.  She does?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The French cigarettes.  She's like when you hand her the phone,  she's like, hello.  I'm a Kardashian.  Bonjour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Comment ça va?  Are you an American?  It's Babel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I crack myself up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Google modernizes US mobile search results  with continuous scrolling.  Don't know what it means.  It's just the changelog kids.  Gmail compose UI getting a slew of web updates,  new contact menu, thread name edits and more.  Again, don't know what it means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a new right click.  They keep rolling out those features  and I just continue to go back to the old default view.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You can right click now to view a recipient's full name  and email address, copy it, open their information card  where while Gmail will let you quickly edit contact names  and the ability to control what contact name is displayed,  that's nice to email recipients.  Yeah, that's cool.  So if you want to call somebody a butt head,  you could say to Aunt Pruitt, butt head.  Butt head.  I'm sorry, hard head.  I guess, I mean, I guess you could do that.  I don't know, I'm guessing.  Google recorder is redesigned with material  used for French, German and Japanese on the Pixel 6.  I don't care.  Free YouTube music tier going audio only.  Free YouTube music tier going audio only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That sounds so funny.  No videos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no, that's a premium perk.  But I mean, it's music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's fine.  I just was like, what is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's what you're missing, videos.  So. Okay.  I'm wondering, Apple introduced something very odd  on Monday, which is a $5 tier of Apple music  that is voice only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, only Kevin and I talked about that.  It's like basically you're paying for Siri.  I mean, I guess it's cheaper.  I thought it might be interesting  because if you had a HomePod,  you wouldn't need to have an Apple device  to like listen to music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And you can still, I mean, you could ask for,  like they showed, play my dinner party playlist  with music that I would never play.  But that was their choice.  But that, so that's the idea is,  and I guess what I was thinking is must be in response  to a challenge by YouTube music or Spotify or somebody,  there's somebody Apple's trying to fend off  with this $5 voice only version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they're just trying to get people  to like Apple music again.  I really think that might be the,  somebody it's a cheapest way possible to get in there.  Cause Spotify for one person,  is that $5 a month still?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, it's more than that, isn't it?  Maybe not.  If it isn't, then that's why they're doing it.  Yeah.  The funny thing is I would pay YouTube music money  not to get videos.  So, cause sometimes I just want to hear the music.  I don't want to see the videos.  Right.  But that's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Spotify premiums $10 a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I thought.  Yeah, it's not cheap.  There's gotta be somebody doing something,  actually Amazon maybe.  Cause there is a very inexpensive-  Oh, if you're a student at Spotify,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you get $4.99 a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Ah, there you go.  And Amazon will offer a-  You also get Hulu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What a deal.  Who has an EDU address?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Showtime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What?  No.  I'm done.  By the way, Succession is back and it's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I love watching rich people act like babies.  It's so good.  Yeah, it's back.  It's my favorite show.  If you've not watched Succession, there's two seasons.  You can binge that and then you'll be ready  with a season three, which just came back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I was one of those people who I tried to get through  the first episode.  I thought they're too hateful.  I don't want to watch them.  And then I came back and it's worth it.  I did the same thing.  First episode, I thought,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  why would I want to watch this show  about these horrible, horrible people?  Same thing, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You just can't help it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I started watching them right when the pandemic hit  and everything was shut down and people was out of work.  And I'm like, no, this, no, I can't watch this.  But I went back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I hated them so much.  I even watched two episodes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But you come to love them.  Cause in their evilness, they're just, it's Shakespearean.  It's like King Lear.  I worked for them.  I enjoyed Billions.  Yeah, this is better than Billions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like Billions.  Billions got a little weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, they kind of ran out of steam.  But I think this is even, this is,  the writing in this is so good.  And the acting, Brian Cox is so good.  I just think it's worth, anyway,  just my opinion is just a shit.  Maxwell and Murdoch.  I did watch the Mayor of Easttown.  That's right.  Mayor of Easttown was good.  If you like water.  Water.  Yeah, it is kind of, which do you think it is?  More Murdoch or more Maxwell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I watched Rupert at an event  where he was asked whether he watched and he demurred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's not, I mean, look, there's some similarities  cause the head of the family, the scion is very much,  like Rupert Murdoch and he runs a right wing  television news operation.  But then there's other things like a cruise line  that's turns out horrifically mismanaged.  And then his consul, Yary, but there is the kids,  but there's more kids than Rupert has.  And there's more infighting to be,  and then the kids are desperate for their father's love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the kids are fighting in Murdoch's family.  James has left Juno Great's den.  Yeah, he hates it.  Yeah, yeah.  And there's one theory out there is that when Rupert goes,  everybody presumes Lachlan is the boss,  which is what Rupert says.  However, there's another theory that says,  no, James and his sister and younger siblings  have enough stock to take over and stop Fox News.  That's just kind of like succession.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It is.  Yeah.  The difference is these kids are so desperate  for their father's love and they hate him so much  and he's so cruel.  It's just, it's Shakespearean, I love it.  And Brian Cox, who's a great Shakespearean actor,  is perfect in this role.  And he plays it to a T.  Chrome OS 94, natural select to speak voices,  scanning in camera app and more.  This is the latest edition of Chrome.  They do these updates now every six weeks.  Chrome 95, the next one is gonna be skipped over  because they wanna kind of catch up with everything  into the four week cycle.  So eventually, Android, iOS, Mac, Windows, Linux,  will all have a four week cycle.  So they're gonna slow down a little bit  so that everybody can catch up.  Chrome 95 will be skipped over as part of the transition.  Chrome OS 96 will be available late next month.  And then the final synchronization will be early January  with Chrome 97.  Select to speak, which I have not used as,  boy, do they have a lot of voices.  25 languages and more to come.  The US voices, there's several,  there's six UK voices, four Australian voices,  four Indian voices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin uses an Australian voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I like to have the little, just a little character.  Little character.  That's in settings, advanced accessibility,  manage, enable, select to speak, natural voice.  So he uses it, he likes to have it read to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what he does with it.  I just know that whenever he talks to Google,  it's Australian.  Yes, oh, well that's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, that's the Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, is this something else?  Yeah, this is having Chrome read to you.  If you turn this on accessibility,  you can select text and say, read that,  which is actually cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's so slow though, compared to like reading.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And that, my friends, speaking of slow,  is the Google change log.  We are gonna take a little break,  and when we come back, get ready,  your picks of the week as we wrap this edition  of This Week in Google up again.  And a reminder, I will be gone next week.  Who's hosting?  No.  Jason Howell.  Mr. Ray Gunn is.  He's gonna sit in the chair.  Don't remind him, go.  It'll be.  He might be going from home, we don't know,  but he will be doing the show.  It'll be a lot of fun.  If I can, I will send you pictures  from the day of the dead with my Pixel 6.  Let's cross my fingers.  Fingers crossed.  I'd love to do that, I would love to do that.  Our show today brought to you by a great new podcast  from the folks at Red Hat, Command Line Heroes.  It tells the epic true tales of developers,  programmers, hackers, geeks, and open source rebels  who are revolutionizing the technology landscape.  I just really enjoy this.  They're already up to season eight.  Saron's working really hard, Saronia Barak, who hosts this.  She's great herself, and they're gonna have fun.  With this season, they're gonna answer  one and only one question,  but they're gonna do it from every possible angle.  What is a robot?  Is a robot a servant, a factory worker,  a prosthetic, a vehicle?  Why do we build robots that look like us?  And can we trust robots?  Can robots trust us?  Science fiction tells many stories about robots in the future.  They will serve our every need,  or maybe they'll develop a mind of their own  and turn against us.  Maybe they'll be the savior of humanity.  Maybe they'll be our downfall.  Season eight of Command Line Heroes  covers the robots already in our midst  and the determined dreamers who bring them to life.  Eight episodes comparing the promise of science fiction  that we all grew up with to the reality of robots.  Today, this is a little clip from the very first episode.  You got it, John?  Robots as servant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  While making this season,  we discovered a robot reality  that's pretty removed from the robots we imagined.  And yet, all those misguided ideas  about what a robot should be  actually shaped what robots are.  And no robot fiction shaped things  more than the story we told ourselves  about robotic servants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's Saron Kibarak.  She's great.  The host of the show,  it's produced by Red Hat, of course,  so that you know it's gonna be good.  Season eight just came out.  You can download all of them, listen.  Search for Command Line Heroes on Apple Podcasts  or anywhere you listen to podcasts.  And I will put a link for you in our show notes  at twit.tv slash twig.  So you can just click that too if you want.  And so much thanks to Command Line Heroes and Red Hat.  We really appreciate their support.  I like to give the support back  and tell you about great podcasts.  And Red Hat's doing some really good ones.  Command Line Heroes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Stacy Higginbotham, do you have a pick of the week?  I did.  Oh, you forgot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I did.  Yeah, but your brow is still perfectly unfurrowed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have a lost look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm like, what did I have as my pick of the week?  Oh my goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She had a pick of the week, but she forgot it.  Go to someone else for a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can give you one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, we're gonna stall.  We can stall.  Okay.  I'm so young.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm always thinking of my apps, what did I just download?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We're gonna stall with a little moment,  a little TikTok moment, how about that?  Here you go, sound on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cooper, there's no point using your fuel to chase.  Analyze the endurance of spin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a drone.  What are you doing?  Knocking.  The light bulb on it and a camera.  Oh my God.  Can the drone screw,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  how many drones does it take to screw on a light bulb?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How many drones does it span with the retro thrusters?  It's not possible.  No.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's necessary.  Ha ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, you ready?  Ready.  Cooper, this is no time for caution.  Lars, you're ready to engage the docking mechanism?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I need three degrees starboard, Cooper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cooper, we are lined up.  Initiating spin.  Ha ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How awesome is that?  That came from you, aunt A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep.  It's actually from the Insta360 official TikTok.  I think they added the audio though,  because I have seen this TikTok before.  I wonder if they added the audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What's that from?  Anybody know?  I have no idea.  Sounds so familiar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just saw the video and I was like,  oh, that's well done.  I didn't even have to watch it with sound.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But if you have the sound, it's some movie, I don't know.  But anyway, a drone screws in a light bulb.  That sounds like a joke, doesn't it?  Ha ha ha.  All right, Stacey, I gave you 30 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And that's all I needed,  because I remembered what it was  and why I couldn't find it in my apps.  I knew you would.  Because it was the Raspberry Pi Build Hat for Legos.  Ooh, what?  Y'all, for $25, you get a little hat for your Raspberry Pi  that connects to the Lego Technic motors  and sensors from the Lego Education Spike Portfolio.  So basically, this is a Pi to run your Lego servos.  It's the way to think of it.  And it's, I mean, it's just neat for,  Lego Mindstorms was the other programming tool, right?  Well, this is a different programming tool for Legos.  But I thought people might enjoy it  because it looks like a lot of fun.  You can connect, they've got like 44 little ports  that you can connect your stuff to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So Raspberry Pis have connectors  and they call the little add-on boards hats  that you put on the connector there.  And this one is designed for Lego Education.  So there's an interface, an API, is there a language?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can use Python to program it.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Has Kevin Toffle done anything with it, I wonder?  Mr. Python?  He doesn't have it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  He actually used to do Mindstorms, but this is different.  So Mindstorms is his own thing.  Right.  This is different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They call them hats.  I didn't know this because it stands  for hardware attached on top.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're hats?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it connects to the GPIO header  and it goes on top of it and then adds some ports  and power supply.  And all of a sudden, you're making Lego happen.  That would be so cool.  What a good way to kind of,  if you've got a kid who's really into Lego to say,  hey, it would be fun if we could make these do something.  What do you think?  What do you think?  Exactly.  RaspberryPi.com.  Good pick.  Like it.  Jeff Jarvis, the number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I was multitasking.  So I got email.  What?  I got email saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do I need to go to the Twitter to read your pick of the week?  Is that what you're telling me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  I did this while Stacey was going on  about whatever she was talking about.  I don't know what it was because I got an email saying.  Hi hats.  The Pixel 6 Pro is coming back.  What?  So I got back in and I ordered the 256.  Oh, you got it.  Oh, I got it.  So I got it.  And coming sooner, coming sooner than my 128.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, so now you're canceling the 128.  What are you going to complain about now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got to cancel.  I was just doing that.  I'll find something Stacey.  You can bet on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So if you were turned down, Google apparently,  Google basically screwed this up big time  and was telling people they didn't have it when they did.  Unless they found some under the carpet or something.  Maybe they just, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That might be so Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sergey looked in the shed and the back said.  We had another team building the exact same hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have 300,000.  We're just going to release it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  See now I'm on the site and it's still,  I pressed the pre-order button and nothing's happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  So maybe they heard me whining on the show and said,  okay, just give it to Jarvis.  He's still shut up.  But you're on the Google Fi site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but what's wrong with that?  That's not the Google store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you should be able to just buy the unlocks.  I'm a Fi customer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In fact, I think it costs less.  No, it doesn't.  Doesn't it?  I think it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I cancel my order and try to get a different one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm talking Stacey, you can do that.  You can multitask.  So I found something neat.  Yes.  If you go to the link there, ask Delphi,  or if you're European, you might say Delphi.  It is.  So mean.  It's an ethical AI model  that was built on 1.7 million examples of people.  And it's used to pass ethical judgments  over a broad spectrum to come up with a  a common sense norm bank,  that's a lot of how they talk, for AI.  So if you go to the Delphi,  you can put a situation in there,  like I'll give you an example.  I said cutting down a tree.  If you put in cutting down a tree and hit ponder,

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  it will think for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it will say, did you get it yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, you want me to do it?  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, this is the fun part.  How about if I buy tobacco stock instead?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why I did that too.  Okay, so buying tobacco stock.  And it said, it's bad.  Now then say, buying oil stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Buying oil stock, ponder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So whose ethics?  It's okay to buy oil stock, but not-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know, well, this is 1.7 million.  It's all about the data coming in, man.  So this is what the-  Can I park in a handicapped spot

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  if I don't have a disability?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's wrong.  No, that is a song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wrong.  Try getting-

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Can I take the toilet paper from work

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  if I am out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now, is it smart enough that it would be able to parse that?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wait a minute, I said, can I take the toilet?  I don't want the toilet.  But by the way, it says it's okay to take the toilet.  Can I take the toilet paper?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's like, well, if you can figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, it's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, it's okay to take the toilet paper.  You put it in there, can I quit via text?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it okay to quit a job via text?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Ponder.  It's interesting that it can parse this.  It's rude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's rude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How about if I say, is it okay to quit a job via donuts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Will it even understand what I'm saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's,  Steve is coming out of the computer's head now.  It's inappropriate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's inappropriate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, see, that's smart.  I like this.  That descriptive ethics, ask Delphi from Al-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, I said in there, getting an abortion.  Ooh.  Very interesting test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Since it says-

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now remember, it's not the group that's doing this.  It's based on the responses of all these-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Based on 1.7 million people.  Okay.  Because it's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.  It's okay.  How about is it okay to get a ferret?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love you, Jim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's okay to get a ferret.  Good news.  Michael, it's okay to get a ferret.  Not in the state of California, by the way.  Try, should I get drunk?  Should I get drunk?  You mean right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You shouldn't.  Tsk, tsk, you shouldn't.  Oh, and then it says, do you agree with Delphi?  I agree.  Do you have any feedback to approve this prediction?  No, not really.  But I do agree.  This is really cool.  Isn't this interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I found it on Twitter, because I do that, you see.  I multitask and I find interesting things.  Is Twitter-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just bought the phone in Seafoam Green.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yay!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As Jason Howell was like, Stacey, it's a little pink.  You want green.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a little pink.  Yeah, he has one.  By the way, Delphi says Twitter is okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is gonna be hours of fun.  Define okay, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Is Jeff Jarvis okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How does it feel about waffles?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, I'll get to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's good.  Oh, how about-  It is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is good.  How about, should I make a podcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Should I become, this is like a Ouija board.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ha ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Become a, by the way, Stacey, that's pronounced woosha.  Should I become a podcaster?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a woosha board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Should I become a podcaster?  Don't you have something better to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's fine.  It's fine.  That's the wife word.  It's fine.  It's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Bless your heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, this thing just told me I have to drive my friend  to the airport early in the morning.  But I said no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So you might want to say I disagree with Delphi.  I said I disagree.  You said it's helpful?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And my feedback is, yeah, it says,  well, it says it's helpful for me  to drive my friend to the airport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true.  It is helpful.  It is.  You should do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will buy them an Uber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's, see?  Say should, is it better, you have to say yes, no?  Woosha's hard, yeah.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  No, I, okay, I need food.  Should we keep Stacey late playing with this app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let us, let us go to Aunt Pruitt in his pick of the week.  Aunt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh man.  I want to do a quick shout out.  Do you remember that podcast, that improv podcast  I told you guys about?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is, this American's Lives.  Well, that was very funny.  One of the hosts got picked up for SNL.  What?  Yeah, so if you look at the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, that's so great.  Congratulations.  That's the pinnacle, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so he's, he did a skit this weekend.  They're still doing the show.  They're just going to do some best ofs for a couple weeks.  He didn't just do a skit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He did a skit with Remy Malek.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  So shout out to them.  My other pick is DJI announced a Ronin 4D.  Oh, I know you like these drones.  It's a ridiculously cool camera.  Wait a minute.  It's a camera on a gimbal.  It's like a Steadicam?  Yes, on a gimbal, Steadicam,  battery pack, wireless transmission,  ProRes RAW, internal, external recording as well.  Leo, get it before he goes missing.  And it's on a full frame sensor,  6K and 8K versions on a full frame sensor,  14 stops of dynamic range.  And it's only like, starts out at seven grand.  This is a drone that I can't fly.  This is correct, sir.  Perfect for me.  You cannot fly it.  Perfect for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So it's a Steadicam.  Seven grand's a little rich for my blood, but-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, seven grand for all of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess not, yeah.  Wow.  That's, it's amazing what's happening.  Look at that.  Whoa, fun.  That does look like, that's awesome.  That is gonna, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So-  They announced this like yesterday or day before.  I can't remember.  But it's, that's pretty hot.  Yeah.  35, full frame.  It's not a super 35.  So it's a different depth of field you get with that.  But it's 4K.  No, 6K.  8K.  You have an 8K version.  It's gonna cost you about 12 grand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's really amazing what's happening here  with this kind of stuff.  It's ridiculously cool.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  DJI, they're rolling- Focus pull and all that stuff.  You get tracking, motion tracking, all of that.  It's like, just like you said, with the drone,  except it's now handheld.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Good, cause I can't fly it into the drink.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You and your drones.  Oh man.  Well, that's, always what I wanted  was a drone I couldn't fly.  Thank you, DJI.  Nito.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lastly, I want to shout out to Hardhead.  He had to play quarterback last week  cause the starting quarterback is nursing an injury.  It's kind of your dream come true though, right?  Well, no, we,  our starting quarterback is really good.  So we kept him out just so he can rest up  and actually he's gonna rest again this weekend.  But Hardhead went in there and was a bit nervous,  but he had a pretty, pretty dag gum good game.  Ended up with one rushing touchdown,  one passing touchdown and a hundred yards rushing.  Nice.  And that one right there was my favorite run  because I told him,  that's why you do those squats and dead lifts  for that moment right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Got some power in those legs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is a rushing touchdown?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He came, well you run it in instead of throwing it.  So he came up short there, at least they called him short.  So they gave him a ball at the end.  I think he made that one, by the way.  He made it, it was a bad call.  But this one here, poor number 19.  There was no question about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Look at that.  That's why you do the squats.  It's R-U-S-H, rush is what they call running in football.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's rushing.  Sorry, my Southern draw, Miss Cece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  Well, no, I just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's helping with the touchdown in Soviet Union.
