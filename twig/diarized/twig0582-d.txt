This week  in Google, the show we cover the latest news from the Google verse, Facebook, Twitter, but this week  I think it's going to be all Google all the time. Stacy Eganbotham is here from Stacy on iot.com  and the iot podcast with Kevin Toffle. Hello Stacy. Hello everyone. Bravo, brava. Also with us  the Leonard Tau Professor for Journalistic Innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate  School of Journalism at the City University of New York, Mr. Jeffrey Jarvis. Professor Jarvis,  Jeffrey Jarvis. Yes. And Ann is taking the day off but it makes it's actually a wonderful thing  because it gives us a chance to have one of our favorite, I don't want to call them a blogger,  writers on. Mike Masnick is in the data. There's nothing wrong with the word blogger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a perfectly fine word. I think I'm the only one left. Yeah, the last blogger. Tech, Dirtz,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mike Masnick. And it's great to have you Mike. If you don't read Tech, Dirt every single day  you're missing some of the best. Favorite guest. Yeah, some of the best material. Not only is it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  smart y'all but it's snarky and entertaining and accurate and my buddy Karl Oud also writes over

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there. Love it. And should we go right into the Google thing because I'm really tempted to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Those people spend the whole damn show on it. Wait, did something happen? No, nothing happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's in the data center. He doesn't hear anything. They updated some things on the Google displays,  I think. Yeah, we'll get to that when the Google change. Actually, I want to do your story from  today. You just filed this right before we went on the air about Tubin and Zoom and the New Yorker.  But you actually say it's a perfect example of why we need section 230. Section 230 has been  under assault not just from the right but who unaccountably think that it's to blame for the  fact that the president keeps getting censored on Twitter and Facebook. But from the left as well,  Joe Biden even says we got to take a closer look. People I know are talking to him about that.  Yeah, I think he'll, I'm sure, I think he'll hear. I don't even protect companies. I mean people.  But you quote Shoshana Weissman who said that this is a perfect example of why we have section 230.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And why? I mean, do we need to go into what? No, no, no, no, no, no. Just say Jeffrey Tubin

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in a Zoom meeting did something reprehensible and has been suspended from the New Yorker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the idea is basically just that Jeffrey Tubin should be responsible for his own actions and  we wouldn't want to hold Zoom legally liable for what Jeffrey Tubin was doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not Zoom's fault. Or WNYC, which was the host of the Zoom call. In some worlds,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  they would also be liable for his. Exactly. Because they set up the forum in which he did  the thing for which he could potentially face some legal consequences. And the whole nature  of section 230 is that it's really just about putting the legal liability on whoever actually  did the thing. And in this case, that's Jeffrey and it's not WNYC and it's not Zoom. And therefore  section 230 is that's all that it does effectively. And most importantly is placing the legal

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  liability on who deserves it. I do have to say Shoshana's piece in the Washington Examiner does  have a sentence you don't normally hear in the Washington Examiner. She says this is known as  the moderator's dilemma in terms relevant to the Tubin news. Zoom would either have to allow  everybody to show their genitals on the platform or make sure no one did.  Yes, the hypotheticals. This regulatory burden would likely be crushing to new market entrants  who didn't even know this was a possibility. No, who lacked the resources for robust moderation.  So, you know, more to the point, she says conservatives who are concerned about  Facebook blocking conservative voices don't understand that if without 230,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  they'd have to be more aggressive, not less. And this is like, I think I want to write a piece  probably for later this week or next week that basically says like, you know, hey, Republicans,  if you actually got your wish and got rid of 230, everything that you think it would do,  the opposite is probably true because they're mad that certain content is being taken down.  And yet without 230, more of that content is likely to be taken down because you're increasing the  legal liability for the platforms and they don't want to risk it. So they're going to, you know,  be much quicker about taking stuff down. Or you create the scenario where it says,  you know, please hold five hours for this tweet while we wait for the next reviewer in the queue  to check out your tweet and make sure it's okay. Yeah. And Twitter and Facebook conceivably could

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  do that. Although it seems like it would be challenging. But for instance, I have a chat  room that's gone right now. If I'm responsible for every bit of content in that chat room,  it's going away. Goodbye chat room. I have forums. If I'm responsible for everything posted there,  I don't have the resources to moderate that. Goodbye. Goodbye. Live feed. Goodbye. Well,  now with the live feed, I'd guess I'd be responsible for you guys. Yes. If I say something

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  just awful and horrible right now, you'd be liable. Because if you went on MSNBC and said

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  something awful, couldn't MSNBC be, you know, say, let's say you said something libelous.  Couldn't MSNBC be sued for libel? Or no? Would they be protected by 230?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that that is one area where it is, where there is some some weirdness, right? In that scenario,  yes, MSNBC, if it's broadcasting over TV, could be found liable for libel. There are a bunch of  extenuating circumstances in which they might not be, but they wouldn't have section 230  protections. It was specifically for internet publishers. Right. They would have the protection  in some sense for the the online stream. And so this is the one area where 230 is  slightly and then I mean, we could go way deep into the legal weeds about why it's it's not really  that different. But there is there is a little area where the liability regimes are slightly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  different between online and offline. There's another difference, which is that MSNBC is  regulated. Well, I guess MSNBC maybe not because it's not regulated by the FCC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So let's just say NBC, not MSNBC. NBC is a different story because NBC is public airwaves  and therefore they're a regulated entity and clearly under the FCC, though, as of today,  the FCC has announced its new theory for why it gets to regulate the entire Internet also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was my segue. Yeah, that was my segue because traditionally it's been considered,  well, the FCC has no jurisdiction and Congress, which is the chief and sole  responsibility of Congress to tell the FCC what they can and cannot do, what their jurisdiction is,  has always said they'd have no jurisdiction over the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ron Wyden, co-author of 230 said to Ajit Pai on Twitter, back off, fella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But the FCC has been doing this for a while, not the 230, but they've been trying to kind of work  their way up the stack as it were. They started back. Net neutrality.  Yeah. Well, no, net neutrality is OK. Because they're regulating telecommunications companies.  Yeah, that's a legit thing. But they were talking about apps and people were getting a little  concerned if they were going to go further into apps, which would be a noticeable change for the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  FCC. So they didn't do that. Ajit Pai, October 15th, almost a week ago, said  that there is bipartisan support in Congress to reform Section 230 and that the U.S. Department  of Commerce, and actually that was the president's executive order, petitioned the commission to  clarify ambiguities in Section 230. They were acting and hit the president's behest.  Clarence Thomas, the justice of the Supreme Court, weighed in on this, saying that courts  have relied upon policy and purpose arguments to grant sweeping protections to the Internet platforms,  230, that appear, he says, to go far beyond the actual text of the provision.  So what is the justification that Ajit Pai proposes?  Sucking up to Trump.  Well, besides the fact that we know why, we know his motivations, but we know what he wants to do.  He's got to come up with a rationale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  His rationale is, oh, Mike, you go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, go ahead, Stacey. Stacey, you have an opinion on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no, I was just going to, I mean, because I read the general council's statement on why they  think they can do this. They talked about it coming from the communications. Okay, I can do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Communications Act of 1934.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Then they said, hey, they updated that back in 1996 with, I can't remember that act. And basically,  the idea is that somewhere in there, they want to, I'm looking for their, it's section 509.  Is that what it was? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I actually have the Thomas Johnson Jr.'s statement. He's the general counsel for the FCC.  He says, the chairman's decision was consistent with my advice that the FCC has the legal  authority to interpret section 230 due to the unique interest generated by this proceedings.  I have now written this memo so that you can understand it. He says, these issues are complex,  but our legal authority is straightforward. We have the authority to interpret all provisions  of the Communications Act, which includes section 230. It's in the Communications Act.  Is that general point of view supported by legal theoreticians, Mike?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's complicated is the unfortunate answer. They are correct that section 230 is part of the  Communications Act, which is almost an accident of history. And if you look at the legislative  history, you have both Chris Cox and Ron Wyden saying that they wrote what became section 230  deliberately to keep the FCC away from having any regulatory authority over the internet. However,  it is in the Communications Act, which the FCC has some authority over. Part of the issue, however,  is that the FCC has spent many, many years, now a couple of decades, trying to insist that it didn't  actually have that authority. And in fact, part of the net neutrality arguments are that it doesn't  have that authority over broadband access providers. And so they're flipping every argument  that they made. This particular FCC, including this particular general counsel, has made and  is still making in court about net neutrality. And they're flipping that on its head and saying,  of course we have regulatory authority over websites. And so I actually wonder if this is going to  show up. I would be surprised if it doesn't show up in the still ongoing legal fight over net  neutrality, because here they are saying the exact opposite of what they're saying in court.  Oh, interesting. Oh, yes. Very interesting. Yeah. So it's, I mean, it's a quite, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they're claiming they got this from several court rulings, correct? The court rulings around

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  towers. Yeah, he quotes a number of the DC circuit opinion in the Comcast versus the FCC.  Yeah, I quotes the Iowa utilities board in the city of Arlington. There's quite a few precedents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah, because it looks like his precedents are coming from court cases,  assertions like tied to the legislation itself. And it comes from the fact that they consider

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Section 230 ambiguous. And so for instance, the Supreme Court in the National Cable and Telecoms  Association versus Brand X Internet Services, the FCC may, this is the Supreme Court, may act as the  authoritative interpreter of ambiguous provisions in statutes that it administers. Of course, he  does in fact mention that Congressman Cox said we do not want to create a bureaucracy regulating  the internet. That's why we're doing this. But he says, doesn't matter, because we have the right to  do it. I think some of this is going to be up much like I wonder much like the DOJ lawsuit against  Google might be up in the air because we've got an election less than two weeks away. And there'll be  a new Congress in a month or two. There may or may not be a new president in January.  Some of this may be up in the air, right? I mean, Congress is the ultimate arbiter of what the FCC

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  can and cannot do. Right. But you're going to see that you're going to see regulators trying to try  normally in the Trump world, regulators will try to take away every bit of regulation they could  before January. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go ahead, Stacey. So in a normal time, like before Trump, let's call it. Yes,  an election would change things a little bit. Like you might see agencies deprioritize things,  but you rarely would see them like wholesale about face on something. The current Justice Department,  though, is very unique compared to others. So it is really like here the election actually has a  lot of big consequences for things like this, because I do think we'll see emphasis shifted,  although there are the attorneys generals of several states who are still trying to sue.  So we'll see where that that's totally different and might still be relevant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can I make one more point on the on the FCC jurisdiction arguments here over why they think  they have the authority over 230. You know, they we mentioned they named all those different legal  cases, which, you know, makes it look like they have some legal backing for what they're doing.  If you look at the details of every one of those, every single one involves a common  carrier situation that they're regulating. And the assumption among pretty much everyone that  I've ever spoken to on these things is that the FCC's authorities regarding communications  only applies to common carriers. So what they're really doing here in claiming Section 201 gives  them authority is to effectively claim the entire internet is a common carrier without going through  the process of actually proving that which is part of what had to happen in the net neutrality fight.  So they're, among other things, among going back on everything that they said before,  and completely revamping the way that everyone has kind of viewed the FCC's authority going back  effectively forever. They're also skipping a bunch of the normal procedures that they would go through  in order to define a regulated entity. So there's, it's a really bizarre move by the FCC. And I think  it's also one that they might actually regret if if the presidency changes, you know, in a couple  months and also have Congress changes, because they're making these statements now that they  would not be happy if there was a Democratic FCC who was making the same arguments about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  regulating websites. Well, that's kind of, you could, that sentence applies with the various  judges across the entire board. They would not be happy. So what are the areas of ambiguity on  Section 230? How could we make tech Section 230 better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By leaving it alone. What are the real areas of ambiguity? Or what are they claiming?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not worried about what they're claiming, because honestly, it's very clear what the  motivation here is. And we can just kind of ignore that. But let's say honorable, well-intentioned,  well-meaning people would like to improve Section 230. What would we do to improve it?  Is there anything that needs to be done? Is it ambiguous? It's worked. It's worked very well.  And Jeff has many times mentioned a book called what is it? The 23 words that created 26 words  created the internet, which if there are quite a number of people in the chat room who say,  oh, get rid of it. It needs to end right now. Should read that book before they open their

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  mouths. You should very much read the book because it, you know, Jeff is, I would say,  more skeptical of 230 than like I am or I should clear Jeff Kasoff, the author of the book,  is a little bit more skeptical. But he also comes to the conclusion that there's no good way to  modify the law that won't cause more problems. And, you know, there's a lot of discussion you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  can have. Like all laws, it's not perfect, but it's hard to imagine a way to make it better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And the only ways that I could think of making it better are exactly the kinds of things  that no one in Congress would ever agree to. You know, there is some, it's not ambiguity,  but there is like the two key sections to 230 are C1 and C2. And they're drafted in ways that are  not exactly parallel. And so if you could redraft them so that they effectively  clarified exactly what it is that they are applying to, that might be useful. But the courts  have basically read it that way anyway. So there's also a typo. They could fix the typo. Jeff  Kasoff is really big on trying to get them to fix the typo. They reference a wrong section at one  point. And even I think the Cornell, which hosts all the legal text, has a little note saying,  we think it means, you know, I forget which section they point to instead of the actual section,  but they could fix that. That would help. Leo, because it's 26 words, it's elegantly simple,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  right? It's sword and shield. So that we can have conversation online, you will not be liable for  things others do so that we can have that conversation. But so we can have a good  conversation, you have freedom to take stuff off without setting precedent. It's wonderful in its  simplicity. And I don't think it needs damn thing. And the problem is, if you open that door,  you slice the baloney again, it got sliced for FOSTA SESTA. And you slice it again for hate  speech and you splice it again for copyright. That's the issue. That's the issue. And then

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's a mess. If you want to insist on on moderation, then you then it has to be moderation  you agree with. Otherwise, well, then we don't want moderation. So it's like, it's really whose  ox is being gored. Is there any merit to the argument that this was created in the early  days of the internet and the internet's changed? And doesn't hold as well? Or maybe it's not as  up to date as it should be? No, no, no, no, no, it works. It's actually your hands actually like a  almost a Bill of Rights in its subtlety and clarity. It is the First Amendment of the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yes. Jeff is exactly right. It is the first amendment of the internet. It is very clear.  It is understood. Basically, every court has interpreted it the same. There are a couple of  cases on the edges where things have been weird. But for the most part, it's clear, it's concise,  it works. It you know, as someone I know says, it is set up the incentives to get the most good  stuff online and the least bad stuff. And there are exceptions in the case of you can't say

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there's criminality. There are exceptions. You can moderate. There are exceptions. It's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the laws that stood still stand. Yeah. Right. But it just holds that you're not not a publisher  this way. And the problem is that publishers still talk as if it didn't exist. Oh, no, if I  if I touch that forums, I'm going to be in trouble. That's BS. It's not true. Yeah, it's not true at  all. So if I were to publish could be in Europe, it could be elsewhere. Well, that's another

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  problem. But there's no First Amendment elsewhere either. I mean, there's, you know, we have some  very, very, very good provisions in the Constitution that we don't want to dismantle. And I think  maybe the solution is to make this a constitutional amendment, maybe add it to the  Bill of Rights, perhaps. Oh, boy. Well, I know that's not going to happen. Because what the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Republicans are doing now, you know, the whole cancel culture argument is they're trying to say  you have to earn your Section 230 by allowing my hate speech up. Right. And the problem here  is the other the third leg of the stool is compelled speech is not free speech. So if government  tells you you must put something back up, which is happening in Italy with Facebook, right, there  was we talked about this months ago, there was a fascist site that Facebook chose to took down and  the court told them to put it back up. That's not free speech either. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. So, you know, there are a number of assaults. There's actually a number of things  going on. assaulting technology there. The Five Eyes plus India and Japan have all come in favor,  this includes the US, Canada, Australia, England, have all come in favor of backdoors to encryption.  There's a really strong movement in that direction. There are a few things, few areas we really want  to kind of, as technologists stand up and say, No, no, these, these are risky. And if you understand  the issues, you will not make these modifications. And that's the problem with going, you know, this

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  is where I'm not defending Google, Facebook and Twitter, I'm defending the internet, because the  fight against them is going to set precedents, they're going to affect our speech on the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's what worries me. Yeah, Carl Bode had a very good piece on tech dirt. Along those lines,  we're going to get to that actually. Because really, I think that's going to be most of the show.  It's a tech dirt show. That's what it is now. Yeah. But I really think I mean, look, we actually have,  have not this DOJ action against Google was announced on Tuesday, we really haven't talked  about it much. Or Monday, I guess we haven't talked about it much on our shows. I've been  waiting till this show. This is the show where it belongs. I should I should have finished reading  the whole thing. Well, we had a warm up on Sunday with Cory Doctorow and Amy Webb. And instead of  being a normal tweet where we would talk about the latest iPhone release, we didn't talk about  that at all. We talked about if it's possible to regulate big tech, how you would do it and what,  you know, whether it can be done effectively, what the consequences would be. So we had it was kind  of a good preamble to the conversation we're about to have. Mike Masnick is here from tech dirt,  couldn't be a better time to have Mike on. He's one of the most astute observers of these particular  issues. It's almost like we planned it, Mike. Thank you for being the universe planet. Jeff  Jarvis, of course, from CUNY and the Craig Newmark, blah, blah, blah. Thank you, Craig Newmark for  blah, blah, blah. And right, is that fair? Should I say that? Okay, that's good. Okay, okay. Leave  your camera on. And, and I'm joking. I'm joking. It's a joke. And Stacy Higginbotham from Stacy on  iot.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it has gone on forever. Like quarantine. We have been in the pandemic. Can you say it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  another victim of COVID-19? No, this was overfunded and overproduced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This you could call stupid. Yeah. Five dollars a month. Classic Hollywood. It is, isn't it?  It's the arrogance of Hollywood. And it's exactly, you know, even, and I don't know  Schadenfreude here. Well, maybe a little. We produce three hour shows. We are very different.  We don't do short for it. And by the way, if you tilt this sideways, we stay sideways.  According to the journal, I actually did not know about this.  Quibi had been plagued with problems since its April launch, facing lower than expected  viewership. I knew that. And a lawsuit from a well-capitalized foe, Hedge Fund Elliott Management.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, because of the way their videos, you could turn, was it the turning of the videos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Turnstile. Yeah, that's this groundbreaking, I'm putting that in air quotes for those of  you listening, technology, which means you could watch it in portrait mode and you'd get one shot.  And then if you turned it into landscape mode, the perspective might change. It wouldn't merely  rotate the video. Content creators could actually use turnstile to give you different points of view  of the same action. Apparently, a company called Interlude US said, that's our technology. You have  to stop it or license it. Quibi said, no, no, no, we're not in, we're not infringing on their  patents. It's a meritless lawsuit. But this litigation, you know, it's funny because

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Jeffrey Katzenberg is notoriously litigious. So anyway. So Facebook refused to buy it, NBC  refused to buy it, whatever it was, take the content. It just goes away. I put up another  story just a minute ago, Variety talking about the hand-wringing at the broadcast partners,  because they were getting a big hunk of that 1.75 billion. It's just like the 2000 crash,  venture capital used to buy out of the people. It was a Ponzi scheme of sorts. And so 60 Minutes  had a Quibi version of 60 Minutes. They hired the brilliant Wesley Lowery to do it from the  Washington Post. And he was there up in the air and they're trying to find some, you know,  they have investments. It's like it's the pivot to video strikes again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They also, you know, the money, the investment came from Disney, Comcast, NBC, Universal,  AT&T's Warner Media. So I don't feel any sympathy. No, just let it go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Money goes back, goes back. Is there anything left?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what about poor Chrissy Teigen and Anna Kendrick and Liam Hemsworth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're going to be just fine. Seriously. I'm not, they're going to be fine. I worry about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Titus Burgess, he needs this work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, he does.  NBC news, some staffers who worked for the units now shuttered Peacock Productions were given work  on several Quibi series.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I feel bad for like non-famous people who got Quibi deals, but hopefully they'll be okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, there's lots of money being thrown around by YouTube and Twitch  and Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But this stuff, I didn't watch any of it because I didn't subscribe, but I've got to believe given  its paid parentage, it's crap. It's big old Hollywood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's well produced crap.  It's entertaining. I watched some of it, but it wasn't entertaining enough to pay five bucks a  month. Plus, by the way, even with five bucks a month, you got ads, you had to pay more to  get rid of the ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Who were the 500,000 schlubs who did this?  Was it?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They had it free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Three months free. And after the three months ran out, we reported on this. Apparently only  about 72,000 people remained.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I went through that with Entertainment Weekly where we had a risk-free offer, four weeks free,  and young people, kids, teenagers,  quote unquote, subscribed.  And then when the bill came, they said, I don't have any money. I'm not paying for this.  I got four free issues.  And so then that's when they went after me and say, they're all canceling.  I said they weren't canceling. They just didn't.  They never were subscribers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were never subscribers. You counted them. You shouldn't have.  I mean, I have to say I'm a little sad. As a content creator, I feel bad for anybody who  creates content and can't make it work. And there's a little Sean Freud because it is, after all,  Hollywood's idea. You got the sense that the kind of patronizing sense that, oh, you Silicon  Valley guys, you think you can do. This happens to podcasting right now. All the big media  companies are doing podcasts.  You think you could have podcasts, but do you have Will Ferrell?  No, I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I don't think I think when you create content, that is your job, right?  You have to be attuned to your audience.  This happens, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so they're used to it.  Katzenberg's had flops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't feel bad for them. I don't think. I mean, yes, there was a lot of hubris on  this will be well produced. This isn't like all Snapchat stories.  Exactly.  Or Instagram stories.  Yeah.  Whoever's stories.  Or TikTok.  Anyway, but they also didn't come at it from the Internet is all about your audience and  knowing them and talking to them. And by God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have to think, though, that Katzenberg's sitting in his office,  four martinis in going, some guy in a long board drinking crann apple juice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is doing.  Got an audience of what?  Doing better than my multi-million dollar.  Billion dollar.  Chrissy Teigen in court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's also the revenue model.  I mean, no one would pay five dollars to watch.  What was his name?  Jose Aguado?  Aguado?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No one would pay that much money for that, but it's free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's free.  This is.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's also the fact that TikTok is user generated where you have a million different attempts.  There's so many other things on there that and even the guy who did the cranberry juice  skateboarding video said he didn't think it was anything special.  It was just trying to get to work.  It wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Card broken down.  He had a long board in the trunk and he thought, well, I'll make a TikTok while I drink my  cranberry juice.  And by the way, Fleetwood Max Dreams is now in the top 10 charts again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A song that was made 43 years ago.  This is Stacy's point.  This is the audience doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  With mass.  I'm reading up again on mass theory and the idea was that, oh my God, we're going to give  them what they want.  No, we don't want to do that.  We want to tell them what we're going to give them and we just give it to them.  They have no choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I hope Hollywood has fun.  They never seem to learn this lesson, but they are constantly.  This is the two different models.  We've talked about this before.  The YouTube model, which is or the TikTok actually does it even better, which is make  it really easy for as many people as possible to create content and post it.  Give them music, give them all the pieces, give them all the parts.  You're going to get a million videos and then let the algorithm surface the ones people  like so that you make an incredibly compelling product for free.  All you had to do was create a product.  Versus Hollywood, which says, no, we're going to make 10 movies.  We know nine of them are going to flop at that number.  That big one is a tent pole.  It's going to make so much money.  We're going to be wealthy.  And that model is failing in the face of YouTube, TikTok, Blockbuster in a world of abundance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The Blockbuster model dies because there's not enough and music finally learned that.  Sorry, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  And let me let me bring this back around to the earlier conversation, multiple earlier  conversations.  All of this is possible.  The TikTok model, the YouTube model, all of that is possible because of Section 230.  I like it.  The fact that these sites can host this stuff.  And the Hollywood folks who are trying to get rid of Section 230 are because they're  trying to turn the internet into something that can only do the broadcast model, the  Hollywood model of well produced, but you only get 10 a year and we're going to decide  for you.  And that's the big difference.  It's also why I'll bring it back even further.  I'm all about making connections today.  The reason that Joe Biden has suggested that he wants to get rid of 230 as well is because  of a whole bunch of his advisors come from Hollywood and come from the movie studios  and they're of the view that we have to change the internet away from this mass communications  medium where everybody can participate and everyone can create to one in which the gatekeepers  in Hollywood are the ones who decide what is the good content on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Advisor was a nice word for what they are.  They're contributors.  Yeah, the money guys.  Sure.  But the other thing, Mike's quite right.  There's the opportunity for talent to rise that in no way could rise otherwise.  I'm reading a wonderful book right now called Distributed Blackness by Andre Brock Jr.  about black Twitter and black culture and how it exists.  And then there's other talents, right?  There's Sarah Cooper or have you heard of Blair Erskine?  No.  I put her in line 128.  Hmm.  She's one of my favorite lines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Brilliant.  A.  Oh, let's watch her.  She's on the Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, she says, can I play this or is it going to get us in trouble?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can play it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, let's turn the audio on.  This is she says, I am Jeffrey Tubin's daughter and I have something to say.  Oh, where's the audio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You didn't test your audio before and you always do.  Oh, it's working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's Blair Tubin Erskine here and I just have a couple of things I want to say about my dad,  Jeffrey Tubin.  We know no daughter ever wants to talk about her dad's dangling, but here we are again.  Look, I know what my dad did was inappropriate, but you have to understand he's very, very old  and he still thinks it's 2008 and in 2008 you could get away with stuff like that.  We know ladies, ladies, you know, we know they did.  And it's been really hurtful to me and my family and my dad to see that hashtag me Tubin  take it off on Twitter because I just feel like there's like a more clever thing you  could have come up with like Jeff and off.  Well, we whatever he does, like that was Jeff and off.  Hold on.  What?  Dad?  Yeah, I'm doing it.  I'm doing it.  It's going fine.  My question is as my dad's legal advisor, like why was everybody looking at him?  Because like on a zoom call, you can see everybody's using that.  Everybody was just looking at my dad with his little guy.  That's kind of weird.  I think that's kind of weird.  I was a work call and they were doing election stimulation, an election simulation.  And my job feels very passionately about the election.  Sue him.  All right.  Don't sue him.  Don't.  If you're masturbating during work calls in 2020, maybe you don't like your job.  Maybe you need a new job.  I'm just saying, you know, he's been temporarily  let go from his job.  Hey, CNN hasn't fired him though.  CNN hasn't fired him because CNN loves to jerk each other off.  That's something we say.  I know it's a joke.  We love CNN.  These don't fire my dad.  It's just crazy to me that this is what my dad is in the news for.  Like y'all already been talking about that time.  He knocked out that much younger woman he was having a fair with.  And when she came to him, like I'm pregnant, he was like, good luck.  And she had to force him into taking a paternity test and paying child support.  And I need to get off right now.  I'm so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  I had to point out.  There's no way that would have succeeded in any mainstream traditional form of media, right?  Just my point.  Yeah.  That is Twitter or baby TikTok.  It's a little long for TikTok, but that is a sui generis.  That is the medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what is enabled now is in the culture we've never had.  So as Mike's point about big old mass culture and it's competition.  That's what all this fight and regulation is about is the old guys going for protectionism  with the old powers in politics.  That's what happened in Europe with the get ready for it.  Leistung Schutzrecht.  That's what's happened across regulatory boundaries.  And that's what's happening with the discussion about 230.  And I'll bring it back home to you, Ren and the Google antitrust.  It's all about protectionism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wouldn't it be funny if we did all of these really fascinating, interesting, fun stories  and completely forgot about the Google?  And never got to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to continue to tease it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  In fact, as long as we keep dancing around it.  But to clean your brain, did you all see the second graders on Zoom?  Their teacher went away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is from Good Morning America.  Please don't sue us.  Second grade teachers gone.  I feel so sorry for second graders that have to go to class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I see that there's a little record sign at the top of the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So the teachers recording this, she can watch us and see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's the Stephanie Higginbotham of that class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the principal can see this.  Look at those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like that's creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Were you like that in school?  Stacey, I bet you were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Which one is Jeff?  I'm that kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am that kid right there.  No, no, no, not that one.  I'm the little boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We're in trouble.  I want toast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Our phone.  And whoever said, we'll be toast.  Whoever said that, I'll maybe have toast for breakfast tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I said that.  They're doing fine.  We're learning cooperation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  God, it's like Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, that was great.  Thank you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I liked 128, but 130, line 130 was even better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I had to do that to clear your palate and your mind from 128.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that this is a point well made.  I mean, I don't want Hollywood to go away.  I like feature films.  I like, you know, I like careful.  Well, for instance, Aaron Sorkin's The Trial of the Chicago Seven.  Have you seen that on Netflix?  He wrote it.  He directed it.  A lot of great actors.  That's a Hollywood production.  That's not going to be on TikTok.  Sorkin drives me berserk.  Yeah, but there's no Sorkinisms in it.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But really, where is it?  No, no.  It's on Netflix.  Oh, good point.  It's streaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Netflix is the new Hollywood, though.  Let's face that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It certainly is, but where did it come from?  It came up from a Silicon Valley perspective.  Yeah, that's a good point.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And if you look at how Netflix bifurcates their audience and does  different social media accounts for different groups of people and targets things there,  that's the true Silicon Valley.  That probably would have helped Quibi, Quibi, whatever, a little bit more.  I only saw ads for that service.  I mean, there's two things.  There's the business model and the way they tried to find their audience.  And then there's the content itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's kind of funny because, I mean, look, Katzenberg's created some great stuff.  There's nothing.  Jeffrey Katzenberg.  Name two.  Shrek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Shrek's pretty good.  That's one.  And Shrek 2 through 5.  Shrek 2 through 5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, he had one good idea.  No, he's good.  He's made some good stuff.  But I thought it was funny that his idea of reaching out to Silicon Valley and get  some technical expertise was hiring Meg Whitman.  That was the mistake.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Though apparently they didn't get along.  One of the articles was that each of them had a separate floor in the massive  Quibi building and they wouldn't go near each other.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was a lot of notice.  They don't mention Meg at all.  They said Jeffrey Katzenberg went around trying to sell the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you know what?  I think that's probably fine for her.  If I were Meg Whitman, I'd be like, yeah, yeah, you just backing slowly away from the Quibi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just slowly backing away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the story about Meg Whitman this week was that she might be considered for a  Joe Biden cabinet position.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're looking for Republicans who aren't tainted is what they're looking for.  Good luck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know if Meg Whitman's the right person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think George Will is going to slot right in.  Anyway, I'm still working around the Google thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was like, you're still not going there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm really trying to stay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you know that third party sellers made more than three and a half billion dollars  from Prime Day, 60 percent more than they made last year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Prime Day sucked this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It had nothing good, did it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've never bought anything in Prime Day.  Me neither.  Did you buy anything?  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I bought something.  I did.  I bought an Amazon Echo enabled faucet.  I'm like, as I'm realizing what I bought, I'm like, oh, I'm going to have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the type of thing we don't admit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, she admits it.  She not only admits it, she has more than one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I sold my, you know, it was in my other house, so I had to replace it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you can't take your faucet with you when you sell a house, can you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's where my Amazon enabled faucet was.  You can't have it.  Are these business expenses?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hell yeah.  That one was not, actually.  Some of my weirder purposes are, but that one was not because I've already reviewed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You should deduct some portion of that.  You're going to review it on the site and stuff, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I already reviewed the, I mean, it's not something I can't do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Totally for personal use, then you can't deduct it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is personal water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Do you drink it during work?  Yeah, just say I never use that faucet when I'm not at work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, now it's my office.  Right.  It's always been my office.  No, exactly.  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bought this, you probably know about this, Stacey, the MyQ.  Do you know about this garage door?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got one too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, because it's one of the best.  I give this as a gift to people.  So what is it?  And I do it because it's the MyQ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  30 bucks.  So Elisa, we have a 10-year-old, 15-year-old garage door opener and it has a clicker.  As my father used to say, it's a clicker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's got a clicker.  Oh my gosh, y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It remotely lets you know if your garage door is open or closed.  I'm getting there.  I'm getting there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Patience.  Give me some time.  I have a tell a story all around it.  He's doing the broadcasting, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's an old fashioned broadcast guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He still hasn't talked about antitrust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm getting older and older.  You're operating at internet speed.  He's operating at TV speed.  I'm at Katzenberg speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where was I?  The clicker.  I got some extra clickers for Lisa because we have two garage doors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We asked Stacey, did you ever use a remote control that actually clicked, Stacey?  No, she doesn't even know that one existed.  TV remote controls.  That's how they made sound and it was through the sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a piezo-based light clicker that every time I touch it,  it generates enough electricity so there's no battery inside and that is a clicker.  That's clever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is a clicker.  I wanted a better way to open it.  This is a Wi-Fi enabled garage door opener.  You can put the app on your phone and even from here I can open the garage door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's really not great for opening the garage door as you drive up.  I'm going to tell you this right now.  No, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because you have to take out your phone and everything, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, because you're not going to want to take out your phone.  What it's good for is you set up the notifications.  If your garage door is open for more than a certain number of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look, see this is my garage door.  Can you show over my shoulder?  Do you not have that anymore?  We may not have that camera anymore.  The studio, by the way, I just warning, slowly falling apart.  When all the cameras are gone, we're just going to shut down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're going to be in an audio podcast and then you're going to be hugely old.  We're going to go back to audio.  You're going to discover audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is it says my garage door has been closed for three hours.  Watch though, I'm pressing the button and the garage door now and people are getting scared  in my house because when the garage actually doesn't do this when it opens, but when it closes,  it has a bright light and a loud alarm.  See, it was just opened and it even says who opened it at what time it is now open.  Now, this is what's going to scare anybody's in the house because I'm going to close it now  and it makes a light goes flash flash and it goes beep beep beep like a backing up truck.  Because what they realized is that there's nobody there watching the garage door close.  And if a small child like a second grader looking for toast would put their head in there,  it would crush them to death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you don't have sensors that I mean,  Most garage doors still have sensors.  Because I just have one of those, you know, 20 year old garage door opener things.  Yeah, but you couldn't do that from here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could know, but why would I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Leo is telling this wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is why it makes a great I had a clicker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go ahead.  For people who care about security because a lot of people have garage doors that are garage doors  that open inside their house, right?  You can get to your home through the garage.  So if you leave your garage door open, not only is someone going to steal your tools,  maybe, but they can also get into your house.  A lot of people freak out about this.  This thing lets you set a notification.  So like if it's open for more than 10 minutes, it'll pop up on your phone.  It'll be like, hey, your garage door has been open for 10 minutes.  You want to close it?  And you'll be like, yeah, boom.  That's what this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or my wife, Jeff, you left the garage door open all night again.  Exactly.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can in my bed, I can see if it's open.  Right now it's closed.  Here's the thing you're not going to want to do.  See right here, this is why Amazon's selling it.  You can also give the keys to your garage door to an Amazon delivery person.  So they can open your garage door, put your package in there and close it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Does it only open a certain amount?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a camera associated with it so you can check that.  I do think for some people, no, you have to buy the camera with the key.  Like if you want to use key and have that feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And by the way, you pay 33 bucks so it's cheap.  It only covers one door so you have to buy a second sensor to the other door.  But if you want to use...  Mine was $16.  You probably got a prime deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I did.  That's why I bought it on Prime.  I know.  Okay, sorry.  I was like, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So well, that's why I mentioned this because this would be a good prime one.  But you have to pay a subscription fee if you want to work with Echo or to do the key thing.  That's Chamberlain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the reason they did that is because Chamberlain built their own cloud for MyQ  because they were like...  They took the hubris like we were talking about with Hollywood.  They took it for like an old school manufacturing company that was like,  we're not going to trust Amazon's cloud or anybody else's cloud.  We're building our own.  That's expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're paying for it.  So that's why they're charging.  And it was hard to get working.  It took me a while.  I had to turn off 5 GHz on my Wi-Fi access point.  How do you hook it into the actual garage door?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a pro tip for anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, sorry.  Because you mentioned 5 GHz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You do your pro tip, then I'll do my amateur question.  Go ahead, pro tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, pro tip.  If you have the Eros, I didn't know this.  On your Ero router, and I bet Google adds it soon, you can actually go in and say,  hey, there's a section in there that says, hey, I'm having trouble connecting a device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, turn off 5G.  Yeah.  It turns it on?  You used to have to call them and they would do it.  But they do that to the interface, which is good.  I'm all ubiquity now.  And the ubiquity, you could do that.  Oh, that's right.  Okay, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Old man question.  Tell me how you hook it up to your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's very actually, it's really simple.  There's a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a peel and stick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You pull the battery out and there's a Bluetooth.  It's really tricky because everything has to be close enough to work.  There's a Bluetooth thing you put on the garage door.  And it has to be oriented a certain way.  That's how it knows the garage door is open because it says, I'm sideways.  Now I'm straight.  I'm sideways.  I'm straight.  So that's all that does.  That goes in the garage door.  And then this thing, which is the light and the siren, this thing has to get on your Wi-Fi.  And that was where that was a little tricky.  And then it uses Bluetooth to connect to the sensor on the door.  And then because this is on your Wi-Fi, now you can use the app to talk to it.  It just mimics the clicker.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You actually get up on...  You program.  You program it.  You have to press the learn button and it says, okay, I see it.  But Chamberlain makes...  I have a Liftmaster and it turns out there's only one company down that makes garage doors.  Chamberlain just bought everybody.  So it owns Liftmaster.  So it worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mike, did you get anything in Prime Day?  Were you lusting after anything in Prime Day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I did not.  I do not have Amazon Prime.  What?  Yes, I know I am the remaining person without Amazon Prime.  You're going to get deported.  So I looked at Amazon.  Amazon was offering for Prime Day.  You could get Prime for a week for $2.  And so my wife actually did.  So we, I think it probably ran out now.  It's been a week, right?  She did buy one thing off of Prime.  She bought the 23andMe.  Oh, that was on sale.  That was on sale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mike, let me ask you, how do you feel about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How do I feel about the 23andMe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, her spit is going to be in a database now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, I know.  I know.  We had a discussion about that.  I was wondering.  How comfortable she was with the privacy aspects of that.  And she's a free person.  She's able to make her own decisions.  I have not done 23andMe and I probably will not.  But she figured for her trade-offs,  the trade-offs were worth it for her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's not just for her.  This is what's really fascinating about 23andMe  is any of your family members start doing it.  My daughter is crushed that my husband's entire other side  of the family did it.  And she's like, there goes her spy credentials once again.  Yeah, you are kind of narking out your kids, aren't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I talked about this with Esther Dyson and I said,  well, now people will know that my son could be liable  to prostate cancer.  And she said, oh, Jeff, get over yourself.  Everybody gets it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true.  She's right.  And she very famously publicly gave her entire genome to science.  So I should mention, just out of fairness,  they have my spit.  And in fact, I've done several other companies.  They've all been sponsors.  What I did learn is, it's a little disappointing,  is the technology that these companies use  is not as specific as you'd hope.  When you get your ancestry report,  the way it works is it's almost statistical.  They compare your DNA to other people's  and then they think, well, you're probably mostly this.  Well, I have a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have.  Go ahead.  Then I'll tell a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was going to say, the thing that was weird was that  she was filling it out.  And she said, they asked her all these questions about...  And she's like, shouldn't I do this afterwards  to see if the spit actually told them all this?  Because if I give them all this, I feel like they're going to  just repeat back to me the same answers that I just told them in text.  No.  The technical difference is they're using something called

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  genotyping, not gene sequencing.  And the implication is, Esther Dyson got gene sequencing.  Her entire genome was mapped with gene sequencing,  but that's expensive.  They're using something that's a little more statistical.  It works.  In fact, I'm actually trying to decide because I did it so long ago.  They now have a new chip they use for this.  And there are new reports.  They say I am 7% Italian, 32% French and German, and 44% British Irish.  I did find a relative though, which was kind of cool.  Yeah, like a second cousin that I actually...  After I looked at it, I realized, oh yeah, that actually...  That she is my second cousin.  I did better than that.  Would you hear my story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  So my grandfather in West Virginia, up the holler,  was born to the woman that he thought was his sister,  but was actually his mother and his grandmother was  acted as his mother because his real mother got impregnated by a traveling coal mine worker.  Yes, these things happen.  And they happen.  And so we never knew details.  We never knew the name.  We had a few clues.  And apparently from Buffalo worked the gas mines, as did my grandfather.  That's what you do in the holler.  And we had no idea.  My grandmother threw away...  There were some love letters to my...  And they were thrown away.  My grandmother was ashamed of this.  We never knew anything.  We couldn't get it.  Well, guess what?  23andMe and my daughter's ability with ancestry and such,  if he had made her an honest woman, as they used to say,  my name would be Riley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting.  I'm going to call you Riley from now on.  Just to bug you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, the life of Riley.  That's a reference that Stacey will not understand because she's too young.  But I got that through 23andMe.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think there's anything wrong with it.  It is the case that they have your spit,  which they could do a full gene sequencing from at some point.  So your wife...  I'm sure yours is in a museum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Famous people's spit.  Really old spit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, what about antitrust?  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Should we do the change log first?  No, I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  We're going to do the antitrust,  but first we're going to take a break to hear a word from our sponsor, ESET.  And a lot of people know that I've been an ESET user and fan for a long time,  but maybe what you didn't know is that so is Twitter.  In fact, I didn't know that.  My daily question when I see our IT guy, he's only here,  he's a contractor, managed service provider.  So he's not our employee, but we see Russell, you know,  every few times a week, right, John?  And my question for him lately, every day, every time I see him is,  are we safe?  Are we safe?  Because I am terrified that we're going to get bit by ransomware.  You read these stories and these companies and the cost and the...  It's just a nightmare.  And he always says, we're safe.  Well, now I know why he says we're safe.  He does a lot to protect us, including, it's not just,  but I don't want to tell you the whole thing,  because it's, you know, we don't want to give the bad guys any information.  But I am willing to tell you one of the techniques he's been using is ESET.  For over 30 years, ESET, ESET has been a leader in cybersecurity.  This is what we use to protect all of our staff  and even our remote work from home staff from malware, ransomware.  As a small business, we need enterprise-grade security,  but it can't slow us down.  It can't interfere with the workflow.  In fact, one of the great things about ESET is, I didn't know, no one knows, it's running.  And what's really great about ESET is it is,  and this is something I really have always valued with ESET,  it is able to block even the newest threats.  New zero days are coming out all the time.  Antiviruses don't know about them because they're zero days, they're brand new.  But ESET does something super cool called dynamic threat defense.  If they see an attachment on an email or a suspicious blob,  they upload it to their cloud.  They have a cloud-based sandboxing technology.  They can actually run it in their cloud, watch its behavior,  and identify if it's suspicious.  They don't have to have the virus signature.  They can actually execute it to see what it's doing, analyze it,  and then if it is malicious, they block it even before it reaches your inbox,  before it reaches your network.  Dynamic threat defense.  This is brilliant.  ESET has multiple layers of protection.  It's very light on the footprint.  It does not use CPUs.  You don't even know it's there.  You can get it on-prem, you can get it in the cloud.  In fact, they're very flexible.  You can buy it directly from ESET, but you can do what we do,  which is get it through our managed service providers.  Most managed service providers offer it because it works so well.  There's also an ESET reseller program.  So whatever option is fine with me, any option that works for you.  There's a security management center that gives you, gives Russell,  a real-time overview of all the on- and off-prem endpoints.  Even the laptops that are at home with our staff,  full reporting, automated security management for all the operating systems we use.  You can access it wherever you have internet.  We have literally been using ESET for years.  Trusted by thousands of state and local governments,  top universities and enterprises worldwide.  And of course, if you are in an industry that has compliance requirements  like GLBA or PCI or HIPAA, it supports all the requirements.  If your employees are your first line of defense and when they work from home,  they are working without a net, that's why you need ESET.  They have a remote workforce bundle for advanced ransomware and business data protection.  That's part of all of their different bundles that they offer.  You can protect your employees no matter where they are.  Look at the reviews, independent testing labs.  Say ESET is number one for minimal system impact and extremely accurate detection.  And this new dynamic threat defense makes it even more important.  A great fit for small and medium businesses.  I hope you'll check them out.  ESET understands the security needs of our small business and yours too.  Trust ESET to future-proof your business.  Get an interactive demo right now at try.eset.com slash twit.

Is a ban to racist calls to 911.  CAREN, it's an acronym, the Caution Against Racial and Ex-  Isn't that a great name?  Caution Against Racial and Exploitative Non-Emergencies Act.  11 yes votes unanimously.  The Karen Act.

Transcript:  So I just switched over.  I'm sorry I didn't listen to the commercial, but Obama's speaking now in Philadelphia.  Yeah.  And it's a drive-in rally.  So instead of applause, they're honking.  I love these.  I love these drive-ins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're just the greatest.  John's favorite group, I'm Freeze McGee does drive-in concerts now.  Wow.  Who would have thought in 2019, you know, you know, what's going to be big in 2020?  Drive-ins.  What?  And they honk.  They honk at the Humphreys concert too.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  You should do a drive-in podcast recording.  We could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  We used to, we always had a studio audience.  We got all these chairs.  We could do it in the parking lot.  That's exciting.  Yeah, I'm not going to do it.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So.  You could talk about Zoom-topia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's Zoom-topia?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Zoom-topia was last week.  You know, I want to learn.  Does anybody play Among Us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to play Among Us.  Taylor Lawrence did a whole article last week.  You're torturing, Stacey.  You're torturing her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's got her head in her hands.  This week at what?  All right, Google.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's only the biggest story so far of the week.  And it also happens to be coming out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of the year, maybe of the decade.  No, barely the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I do want to point out  the United States Department of Justice in the last 11 years

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  has only filed one anti-trust lawsuit.  So this is a big deal.  They're not known for their aggressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This Justice Department is not known for justice either.  So it's a political act that's going to go away  and then get redone.  Well, and I should point out,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  nor was Obama's nor was George W. Bush's.  In the last 10 years, there's only been one.  It's just not, I don't know.  What was it?  We don't care about.  Oh, it was a politically motivated one as well.  Oh, what was it?  I can't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll find it.  Because there were a few.  I don't know the actual losses,  but there were two things that were politically motivated.  One being trying to block the AT&T time warning.  That was it because Donnie didn't like CNN,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  which is exactly that was the one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But there was also, I don't know if it was a lawsuit,  but there was action about the car companies  agreeing to emissions guidelines with California.  They said that was collusion.  That's a little political as well, right?  Also a politically motivated one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But when it comes to mergers between,  oh, I don't know, T-Mobile and Sprint,  or I mean, we can go on and on and on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This one was joined by 11 states,  all of the Republican energies.  This is clearly political.  Arkansas is in on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is not to say that there isn't some merit  in the notion that Google is perhaps acting  anti-competitively based on its size and dominance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But this lawsuit is not it.  This is not it.  I wrote something where I was just like,  if you really support antitrust against Google  and you really think that they need to be broken up  or there needs to be some sort of punishment for them,  this is not the vehicle.  It is so poorly done.  It is clearly rushed.  And it doesn't hit on any of the points  that most people think about  or most people talk about  when they're talking about antitrust in Google.  You say their case is weak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  You also point out, or maybe it was Carl,  one of you pointed out that in their actual brief,  they published things that one might say were good.  As proof that they were dirty monopolists,  were actually maybe not so bad.  I'm trying to find, it's a weaponized farce,  Carl Bode wrote yesterday.  Among other things, well, Neely actually said this.  This is Neely Patel tweeting of the verge.  In section 143, the DOJ writes,  Google was concerned that a major United States carrier  would ask manufacturers to install a search widget  powered by the carrier's in-house search engine.  You all love Verizon search, right?  Google's VP of partnerships wrote to a colleague,  Google needed to make clear to manufacturers  that these customization requests will not go far.  Replacing the Google search widget  with a different search box  would violate the pre-installation agreement.  So Neely Patel says,  Google harshly stopping carrier bloatware  is again not the best argument for the DOJ.  Yes, they did.  They prevented, was it,  do you know who the carrier was off the top of your head, Mike?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't actually in that one.  I don't remember.  Almost every argument in the filing reads like that.  There are all these things where like,  they're perfectly reasonable, you know,  consumer protective or consumer friendly explanations  for each of these decisions.  And the DOJ presents it in the most nefarious fashion  that anyone with any sense of how these things work should say,  no, like if they had gone the other way,  there would have been all these crazy accusations about Google,  enabling bloatware, for example,  or creating security problems.  Each one of these decisions was reasonable.  And like, there was another one that I wrote about earlier today  where they talk about the fact that  Google is paying 15 to 20% of Apple's revenue  to get, to be the preferred search engine on iOS.  They're paying billions of dollars.  That's not the action of a monopolist.  Monopolist would want to pay less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And here's $15 million.  Yeah, you want to see monopolists?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look at your ever escalating Comcast bill  and then you will see a monopoly.  Well, that's a really good point

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because the Department of Justice has done nothing  to slow down the aggregation of telecommunications companies.  And they are more and more-  No, they've actually-  They supported it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're trying to do anything and supporting it.  I wanted to tell you though,  the Department of Justice in the last few years  has been very active in the food industry.  Because when you were talking about them not doing cases,  I was like, no, that's not true  because I've been reading about some crazy ones on my podcast.  But they went after big chicken, big tuna, and big meat packing.  I'm just telling you, so different industries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What I'm quoting is the fact that it's an actual lawsuit.  So there have been investigations,  there have been administrative actions.  They've been inviting people and putting them in jail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, for criminal behavior, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And not for antitrust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, it's for collusion, it's the antitrust division.  Right, so it's collusion.  And it's easier to prove things like,  well, it's not easy to prove collusion,  but that's also, I mean, in the US,  our antitrust actions need to be,  you need to prove consumer harm.  And it's important, it's easy to say,  oh, chickens cost more or tunas price fixing.  When it comes to Google, literally nothing,  maybe not literally nothing, very few things like Mike was saying,  and we're talking about none of these are consumer harms.  And I would argue, and I'm just going to throw this out here  just to make our argument a little bit more fun,  that maybe when it comes to tech monopolies,  if we're going to look at this seriously,  we should look beyond just consumer harms,  because it can be hard to show that.  Although with Google, you could show it with, again,  the ads, the ad industry, we've talked about that.  And I'm also curious why they went after,  they didn't go after Amazon,  because it's not like the Trump administration loves Jeff Bezos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tom Cotton says winter is coming for big tech.  So who knows?  So we could get there.  Could get there.  Winter is coming.  Wasn't that part of the House Democrats report there,  that 450 page report was a suggestion  that antitrust laws should be probably amended  to show more than just consumer harm,  to show anti-competitive harm and stuff like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's been a big push for that,  generally more from the Democratic side,  that the consumer harm standard,  which was sort of, that was kind of a mainstay  of the Republican viewpoint of antitrust,  that it was like Robert Bork's big deal.  And so they've been arguing for what is sometimes referred to  as hipster antitrust, which is to get past this idea  of consumer harm being the issue.  And there are some interesting arguments there,  but this bylaw is not there yet.  Why do they call it hipster antitrust out of Curia?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's hipster about it?  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because it's changing.  We have this accepted way of doing things,  and this is the new hip way of looking at antitrust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The hip way. I got it.  So Google's response, which I guess I should mention,  I mean, you know, not...  Yes, you should.  Yeah, I mean, give them...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, you should, because it's actually a good response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is from Kent Walker,  who's Senior Vice President of Global Affairs  in the Keyword Blog.  Today's lawsuit is deeply, deeply flawed.  People use Google because they choose to,  not because they're forced to,  or because they can't find alternatives.  But it is true.  One of the accusations is the deals that Google makes  with carriers to make sure that other search engines  aren't on those phones.  Where you can change it in 14 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you can change it.  Yeah, so I guess that's not forced to.  And it's just like, you know,  the funny thing is they're going after their browser,  which is like going back 20 years.  But I'll let you get back to his answer in a second.  But the problem is, I think that it's always yesterday  is war when it comes to antitrust.  And to go after search, I think search is outmoded.  I think it's got cobwebs on it.  I think that we need far better services and systems  to get us to expertise and authority and relevance.  And Google's behind.  Somebody's going to come along and beat it.  And I think that this idea that it owns search  is the least of the problems.  Advertising, that's where the issues are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me finish the statement.  But I do have a question along those lines.  We talked a little bit about this on Sunday.  I'd like to pose to Mike along these lines.  So I'll get to that.  But anyway, today's lawsuit is deeply flawed.  The lawsuit would do nothing to help consumers.  To the contrary, it would artificially prop up  lower quality search alternatives,  raise phone prices, and make it harder for people  to get the search services they want.  Let's talk specifics.  The department's complaint relies on dubious arguments  to criticize our efforts.  Yes, like countless other businesses,  we pay to promote our services,  billions of dollars to companies like Apple.  Just like a cereal brand might pay a supermarket  to stock its products at the end of the row  or on a shelf at eye level.  For digital services, when you first buy a device,  it kind of has a home screen eye level shelf on mobile.  That shelf is controlled by Apple,  as well as companies like AT&T, Verizon, Samsung, and LG.  Our desktop computer is overwhelmingly controlled  by Microsoft, so we negotiated agreements  with many of those companies for eye level shelf space.  In other words, the default search engine is Google.  But let's be clear, our competitors are readily available  to if you want to use them.  It's true, every browser, you could change search,  and it often gives you, suggests alternatives  like DuckDuckGo and Bing and Yahoo and other search engines.  Our agreements with Apple and other device makers  and carriers, they go on to say,  are no different from the agreements  with many of the many other companies  that are traditionally used to distribute software.  I guess the thing I wanted to ask Mike,  and this was actually asserted by the Department of Justice,  there's such a thing as the network effect.  Jeff says, oh, somebody else could come along  and displace Google or Facebook.  But isn't it the case that at some point,  Google is so big, has so many, such a big database,  it's hard to displace it, isn't there a network effect?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, there is some argument to that.  The question is, what does that mean for antitrust purposes?  I think these things do change over time,  and there are reasons to think that Jeff might be correct,  that there are different ways to approach it.  It won't be, I think, by creating just like...  You won't make another Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It won't be the same.  No, it'll be something that...  Well, remember how worried Google was about social search,  and that became the number one effort of Google for a while  with Google+, because they were afraid that the knowledge graph  that Facebook was creating was actually more valuable than search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How does Google have a network effect?  Facebook, yes.  How does Google have a network effect outside of advertising?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think there's an argument that Google search  is improved by more people searching on it  and that they learn from that.  That's what the DOJ said, is because of this large market share,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  80% of the DOJ asserts, they are collecting more data.  Who can come along and compete with them?  They can't collect that data.  Yeah, maybe...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think there's also the fact that Google can pull in  so many other things into their other products.  So when they launch a new product,  it is much more competitive from the get-go.  So if you look at things like...  I'm trying to think of some of the services I use that...  Google Maps can now tell me exactly how many people...  Not exactly how many people, sorry.  It can tell me if a place I'm about to go is crowded or not.  Those are things it can only do because it has Android phones  and is pulling.  That's not exactly antitrust,  but it is a network effect brought about by the fact that  the more people use their stuff...  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's okay.  And this is actually Google's response to that particular point.  There's another area where the lawsuit is wrong.  This is again from the Keynote blog,  about how Americans use the internet.  It complains we compete only with other general search engines.  That's demonstrably wrong.  People find information in lots of ways.  They look for news on Twitter, flights on Kayak and Expedia.  Remember, Google owns IATA.  Which actually I think has put Hipmunk and some other  travel search engines out of business  because Google controls the database of flight information.  So, I am not saying Google is not a monopolist.  I think they are,  but I don't know if this is the right way to approach it.  Restaurants on OpenTable, recommendations on Instagram and Pinterest.  This is actually a very telling point.  When searching to buy something, around 60% of Americans start on Amazon.  That's a very credible argument.  Amazon is a big competitor to Google's search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And now in advertising, search and advertising.  And the argument they make that,  oh, the Amazon Fire Phone failed.  That's Google's fault.  No, it was a stupid product.  It was a crappy phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We all know why Fire Phone failed.  Such a weird argument.  And it also undermines their argument because that has to do with the non-forking agreements.  The DOJ is arguing that if you want to have Android and Google services together,  Google makes you require that you won't fork it and create your own version.  And screw it up like Amazon did.  Exactly.  And so then immediately they point to Amazon,  which did exactly what they're saying nobody will do because of Google's thing.  But the fact that Amazon did it shows that their entire argument is not accurate.  Google's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey's left the building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, then I'll jump in and keep talking.  I mean, the other argument that's weird about it is,  they talk about these agreements to get Google to be the default.  And yet, you look at things like the Chrome browser, which has a huge market share  and is not the default browser on nearly every computer.  Most Windows machines come with whatever Microsoft is calling their thing today, Edge.  And the Macs come with Safari.  And yet people choose to go to Chrome because they find it to work better for the most part.  And so this idea that having these default deals is preventing people from going elsewhere  doesn't actually seem to be supported by the way that people actually act when it comes to computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I use Chrome because my office is cold and I need my fans running all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, that's a good point.  I use Firefox.  I don't use Chrome.  It is true that the Chromium engine has become more and more dominant,  not just because of Google's Chrome, but Microsoft's Edge.  That doesn't gain Google data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a gift to the ecosystem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you can make the same case for Android.  Yes, same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can be Amazon and screw up Android, but it's a gift to you.  It's free.  Yeah, this is politically motivated as hell.  I think it starts with what Stacey's been saying.  Do we want to or do we not want to reconsider the definitions of antitrust?  It starts legislatively.  This is trying to bring into the DOJ based on current law.  No, there's no consumer harm.  There's some advertiser issues.  I'll be the first to grant that.  But even then, Amazon's growing, Facebook's grown, TikTok's growing.  So, you know, competition, lack of competition is harder to prove there.  But, you know, we can have that discussion.  But on current law?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, in which there was a congressional, it was the House, the Senate that did the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  four hundred and thirty something or sixty something page report because they did that  on anti, was it antitrust?  The House.  The House Judicial Committee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, Subcommittee on Antitrust.  No, it's the Antitrust Subcommittee.  Judiciary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that one.  You read that report.  They actually talk about things like network effects.  And I'm not saying it's the end all be all, but the discussion is beginning.  Now, given where we are in the way the world works right now, I have no optimism that we  will get a law passed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's it's I mean, it's important to note that like that the House report on antitrust  was that was done by Democrats and the Republicans put out their own sort of dissent.  And they had fought about it.  They tried to put together a sort of bipartisan report and nobody could agree.  Which is Congress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, some of the points they did agree on.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, yes, there are some areas of overlap.  It's the same thing with 230 and antitrust, right?  In both cases, like everybody is seeing certain things about the technology industry that  they don't like, but they're completely disagreeing on how and why and how to deal with it.  And so where they come down on all of these things is very, very different.  It would have very, very different impact.  And so, you know, there are some interesting things.  And certainly the House report at 400 pages is a lot more thorough.  But it also had some really weird things in there.  Some really sloppy things, some some some things that were so old and no longer relevant  that that were very strange.  It's like a bad high school paper in spots.  Yes.  Well, that's the argument that the DOJ lawsuit is like a bad law school student,  you know, attempt at writing a brief.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it I mean, the biggest problem is, well, what is the remedy?  And it's I think it's almost impossible to think of a remedy that would not have  tragic, unintended consequences.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they're going to have intended consequences and unintended consequences.  That's where your goal is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, our goal is to foster innovation, to increase competitive competition in the markets

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that Google and let's add Microsoft and Facebook and Amazon and Apple into that as well.  In those markets to create more.  You know, I thought the House's report was pretty damning on Apple.  The stuff, the smoking email, the smoking gun emails they got on Apple  doing side deals when they claim again and again that their their app store is fair to everybody.  I thought was pretty on the face of a pretty blatant evidence of collusion.  So I think it wouldn't it isn't I don't want to throw out the baby with the bathwater.  There is some merit to these.  The question is, there's probably merit.  Go ahead, Stacey.  And then go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stacey, there's merit in some places.  Like, I think an interesting spot to look for antitrust is to start looking at online  marketplaces, whether that's the app store, whether that's Amazon's, you know, Amazon  and how it does or Google's online ads.  I mean, so if you think about online marketplaces are really interesting place to start making rules.  I think you can't if you're going to approach antitrust for tech, you can't do it on a company  basis.  You have to do it on like, hey, let's talk about data interoperability.  Let's talk about how you treat marketplaces.  So that's how I think we should approach it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  If you think if you there's there's you've got to start with is there damage?  And is there damage that's not covered by the law now that you consider a new law around that  you start with evidence of the discussion.  You should we're not we're not there.  We're starting with emotion.  You should look at it back to your point.  Back to your point.  One point I you know, if you do have if we do knock wood, yes, I'm going to be political  right now.  Have a clean sweep of Democrats, then I think you could end up with new antitrust law.  You'll have Elizabeth Warren in there saying now's the time to pay up.  And here's what it's going to look like.  And I think that that could make a big difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  OK, that's my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  But it would be a very different kind of argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  But it would but it would go to what Stacey's trying to spin.  That's right.  Yes.  Is does says very well has been saying is that it's about starting with the discussions.  Rather than starting with this document.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly.  Yeah.  If the government goes entirely to the Democratic side and you have both houses of Congress and  the presidency, you would almost certainly see some sort of new antitrust regulations  introduced that would probably open things up and sort of take this hipster antitrust  approach to things.  Whether or not the courts would would would you know whether or not the courts would allow  that to happen.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  These courts particularly.  Right.  Yes.  So Stacey, where would you start if you had a clean slate clean whiteboard with a clean  slate of Democrats in and you wanted to have the discussion that you you ask for around  antitrust power size, whatever, where would you start?  Where would you start the research on damage to be mitigated?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I don't read antitrust papers in my spare time.  I want to make that really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You do a lot of dirty things, but not that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I read spectrum papers and I read encryption papers, but I do not read antitrust papers.  So I can say I think Mike might better be better answer.  I will say the things I worry about are the amalgamation of data and using that to improve  products and the way that companies can kind of create as Amazon, you know, their famous  flywheel.  I don't know if there's a way to stop that.  That's not that doesn't produce more harms, but that's like an area where I think there  is, you know, combined like there's a lot happening there that's really interesting.  And I think there are potential harms down the road for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And where would you start?  Well, sorry, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, Stacey, are you done?  I don't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was just going to say in marketplaces, but I already said that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, so my take on it is, you know, I go back also to the sort of data control issue.  And I think that, you know, if we were to move more of the control to the end users  and allow for the ability to take your data out and have it in a format that could actually  be shifted to other services, that would be powerful.  And so the easiest way to do that in my head and there are arguments against this too,  is that you would put in place something that effectively says you have, you know,  a way sort of get out of antitrust jail free card if you make your data available in that way.  And you have APIs that allow people to pull out their data and move it to other services.  And if you've done that and allowed people to get out and allowed other services to build  on the data that is in your silo, then you avoid antitrust.  And that would create incentives for those companies to free up that data,  to allow for competitors to come in, to allow for new entrants to build off of  the sort of network effects that are already built up around these companies and to create  a more competitive environment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I would add one more data point too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, go ahead, Jeff, then you, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which, and Mike, these poor folks have heard me say this a million times, I was on a transatlantic  high level working group on content moderation and freedom of expression, read regulation,  that came out with proposals that even I who sound like I'm all anti-regulation and not,  when they're reasonable.  And the argument is transparency to accountability, that you also say in an FTC kind of model,  if you're saying Facebook that you're going to have a friendly place that's safe for people,  then show us and give us give researchers the data, we're going to require you to give them  data so we can hold you accountable to that promise.  We're not going to tell you what to promise, but we're going to hold you accountable to that.  And so we need data that way too, and we need you to give it to us safely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Historically, these companies have been very reluctant to give that up, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's why the government has to, that's where the government has a role.  And I got kicked out of the table whenever I said this in this high level working group,  is if I use the phrase safe harbor, they say, no, I say it's basically a safe harbor.  It's basically saying if the government forces me to give you the data, then you really can't  get mad at me if somebody else Fs it up. So, you know, require me to give you the data.  And then that's well, how we'll give it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, the risk, the risk with that model, though, is then you're only held, you know,  it's the way the FTC works today with privacy stuff. You're only held to the promises that  you make. And that just creates incentives to make your promises broad so that you can't  have violated your own promises. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Europeans in this will require some negotiation of what those promises are. And that you have  civil society and you have government regulation and you have tech companies together. And so,  yes, there will be there'll be promises that would be unacceptable in that view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stacey, I was going to go back. Yep.  Sorry, I was going to go back to Mike's point about data interoperability, not interoperability  export. I think it's a smart idea. I think where we would start seeing the arguments kind of arise  there is around what that format looks like. Because right now I can take my data out of lots  of devices like it exported to like Excel. Completely freaking useless, right?  Worse than.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you could use JSON or something. You could have a standardized format that would be machine  readable. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So but then you have to think. So a couple things there. Right. One, some like GDPR would get in the  way of something like that. Because if I export my data, then I can't control what happens.  Like if there's an if Google makes my data available to other companies via an API,  even if it's not personally identifiable, something like GDPR comes in and says so.  So there's some I'm not saying it's a bad idea. It's wrong. I'm just trying to point up like if  we do something like this, here were some of the fault lines of fights are going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And you're exactly right. And that's actually why I've been really concerned about  all the privacy regulations, because I feel that they block off this path entirely.  And even though I'm supportive of privacy, I worry that we actually block off this kind of  situation, which would lead to more competition. There are ways to deal with all of that.  And I agree. Like right now you can export your data from various services,  but mostly in a useless format. But part of that is because you can't really do that much with it.  If the law were made clear that you would be protected from antitrust, if you had it in a way  that really enabled it to be useful in other scenarios, then there's an opportunity for  new companies to come in and say, we'll give you a different interface to your Facebook data.  And we're not going to bombard you with advertisements or things of that nature.  And you can have different models come about. And whereas today, thanks to things like CFAA,  Facebook can block a bunch of these things. If we were to fix that aspect of it also,  you could set up the framework and the ecosystem in which there would be competition. But you're  right that it would conflict with other laws and those need to be dealt with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I'm all for it. Let's do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. All right. We've solved it.  Okay. We can move on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We had a good discussion.  Wow. Fantastic. Good talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Good. Good. It was good. Now we can hear about Zoomtopia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How about if we do the Google change log?  So search day was the day after last week's episode and there was a lot of stuff, but the  only one that even sticks in my mind was the fact that you can hum to your Google Assistant now.  And they will be able to help you figure out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is it distributed? Have you tried it? Is it out there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't tried it. You want to try it? Let's see. Starting today, you can hum,  whistle or sing a melody to Google to solve your earworm on your mobile device. Open the  latest version of the Google app or find your Google search widget and type, should I try it?  I don't know if I'm the best. How can you not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Stacey says she's tone deaf, so she can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm tone deaf. I can't hum anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay. That seems like a good way to test it.  Exactly.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what if Stacey is talking to me for some reason and all I did was open it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Am I humming to the Assistant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm going to hum. Hold on. Then you can hum because I have a microphone.  Well, I guess you could do it too.  That's okay. There's no rush for me to hum anything.  What's the command you use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What is this song?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Okay. Wait a minute. I need a song.  I don't have that information.  What song? Which song should I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I know Stacey's Wedding Song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah. Yeah. What is this song?  What is this song?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Sorry, there was a problem. Please try again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. What is this? Wait a minute. Take two.  What is this song?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't have that information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It isn't even waiting. What is this song?  Okay. Your turn, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's pick up. Is it part of an update that we need to have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It says starting today, open the latest version of the Google app.  Or maybe that was the Assistant app. Maybe I needed to use the Google app.  This is part of the problem with Google.  That's part of the problem with Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have home. I have. I don't have a Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is this song?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Try a different song, man. Try Silent Night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got to go for 15 seconds.  It says it's either Noche De Paz, Hard Pill to Swallow, or Silent Night.  Oh, okay.  Pretty good. I wonder what Noche De Paz sounds like.  Let me just, maybe it's the same song.  Sounds exactly the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Your version at least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Here, I'll do one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You got to do one, Stacey.  15 seconds is that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got to go for 10 to 15 seconds.  What do I say? What is this song?  Hey Google, what's this song?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is this song?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I forgot the song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Now you have to hum something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is too long. I don't know anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. Of limited value.  It seemed like such a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This needs to be a clip that goes on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh God. Don't say that. It will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, did you, could you all recognize my song?  No.  Anyone?  No, it's the Michigan fight song.  It was all the single ladies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh, I did not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like put your hands up.  You are tone deaf.  I will actually grant you that now.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mike, do you have an Android phone?  I do, but I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mike's like, I am not doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've lost the thread.  I don't know how the rest of this goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's terrible.  All right, let me try it.  You do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, Google, what's this song?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like how the little hair bops.  It's like Amy's ears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You're getting really into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The problem is 15 seconds is a really long time to hum a song you don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is a lot.  I mean, that's significant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not going, there's not going to be video of me doing this anywhere on earth.  You're not, you're not tricking me into it.  You're not catching me.  Nope. Nope.  That's right.  I'm too smart for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I may not have much dignity, but I do have just that tiny shred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ours is long gone, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I will say ahead of the holidays are nice games you can play with people on Zoom.  This is actually quite nice.  You can challenge your friends to hum songs and see if Google gets it.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, God help me.  It's going to be the next icebreaker on a Zoom meeting.  No.  Everybody has to hum.  Icebreakers.  Did you?  Who has icebreakers on Zoom meetings?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It wasn't so long ago we had on a Google change log this new app that Google was  offering called Trusted Contacts.  Remember that would help you find a family member if they don't respond or  they could proactively broadcast their location.  Google's killing it already.  It's like less than a year.  It's going to discontinue Trusted Contacts.  It's yanked it from the Google Play Store.  And if you want to use a similar feature, they say just use it in Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you want to hear Google's also killing or rather discontinuing its Nest Secure hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there is a big one.  Now, they only offered that they never had a follow up.  That was about what, four years, three years ago?  But they're just saying it's not going to work anymore.  That's it.  Boom.  Done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no, no.  They're saying if you have it, it will continue to work.  It will continue to work.  But they're no longer selling.  Right.  Well, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, that's the question.  How long are they going to run the server?  This is the it had a little keypad.  It had sensors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the loss of those sensors is sad, but I'm hoping that with the connected home over IP  we'll get sensors that actually will work with everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We should have a Google changelog and a Google kill log.  You now have a heart button on Google discover.  I don't even know what Google discover.  What's Google discover?  No idea.  For adjusting feed preferences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, that's the swipe right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that our newspaper thing in the in the like on your phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, I turn that off right away.  You use that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I turn it off immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I do too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's fun.  So if you heart these before it had a more or less slider.  Remember that?  Now you can heart it.  It doesn't open a menu.  Just says I like it.  I like it.  Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I see a more or less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Chromebook.  More.  It's not replacing that more or less.  See, that's the little slider.  They're replacing that with a heart.  Oh, so you can't say less, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, you tell it.  You tell it to you can know you can say hide the story.  I'm not interested in this topic.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's under the three dot menu still.  OK, yeah.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait, so what I'm I'm I'm lost.  What is this even?  What are we talking about?  Google discover.  What is this product?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like discover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the Google news product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So yeah, if you I have Google news, but I don't I don't have that.  If you go, if you go to a story on news,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  basically goes to Google news equivalent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It goes to Google news.  And it's just for fun.  So you can see that I like IOT devices, modern architecture, advice columns.  And Boston Dynamics will start selling arms for its RoboDog sport spot next year,  which scared the bejesus arms.  Oh, you mean I was thinking guns, but it's just arms.  OK, but yeah, so I like this tool because it'll sometimes surface some really weird  stuff that I would never have found otherwise.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I I get that with Google news, but this is different than Google news.  I'm seeing like I don't see any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're in the middle of a different, you have the pixel launcher and you swipe  to the right, right?  There's there's a whole screen of stuff on the left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is this only on the pixel then?  Only if you use a pixel launcher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  You can use a picture launcher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm using the I have the one plus, which yeah, you don't have to have their own thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some actually Jeff, you'll like this.  Some new features in Chrome OS.  Google is adding screen recording.  There are third party tools, but now they'll be.  Oh, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My daughter, when she was playing Star Stable, she could have been recording her games and  broadcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you can't.  So then how would you become a spy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just your screen, though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a screen shot and it's not live.  It's just recorded and then you could then upload it if you wanted to.  Yeah.  And I know this actually isn't the change because it's not a Google thing, but Parallels  has just announced that they are going to add Windows virtualization to Chromebooks.  So you'll be able to run Windows apps in your Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why would I ever want to do that?  Well, I know we have to for work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's interesting how Chrome OS is becoming more like a general purpose operating system.  Initially, it's only for enterprise Chromebooks.  So you have to have a managed Chromebook and it does require a lot of hardware.  You have to have a 16 gigs of RAM and I five or better and 128 gigs.  I know it's not a lot of Chromebooks can run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Speaking about Chromebooks, Kevin has just got the Acer Chromebooks, Ben 513 with the  Qualcomm 7C.  Is that a big deal?  That's only three hundred ninety nine dollars.  Yeah, it's that Qualcomm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not so happy about.  Is that the problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  So Kevin has it.  You should ask him offline because I think he can't talk about some of it, but he's  able to talk about others.  Cool.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google Parallels does say and I think it's in conjunction with Google's that this will  come to all Chromebooks with sufficient horsepower in the next few months.  So, yeah, you know what?  It's really it's for one.  There's that one Windows app is the only thing keeping you from using a Chromebook.  And now you'll be able to run it.  And I think that's actually a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And if you need, you know, you need to you could put in Kevin would tell you to put in  Linux and do videos that way.  But if you're chicken, you put in Windows and you do something that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's a little friend you can run around with your spot dog with arms.  It's a little crop watching.  I'll jump ahead here.  This is less water to use.  This is let me see if I turn off the sound.  I see if I can find a video of it.  It's a robot that rolls around in your fields and watches your crops.  Oh, I need that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Merrill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you need that, Jeff, for your crop back 40.  There it is.  There it is.  Project mineral.  It's a plant buggy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Didn't we talk about this?  It looks like the things from Tron.  I feel like we did.  Yeah, maybe you talked about it last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, never mind.  Google chat will go free next year.  Hangouts will lose chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They can never get this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jesus Christ.  So, yeah, it's basically they're going to continue to dismember  Hangouts to provide features to other programs.  And I'm totally reliant on Hangouts.  I don't know what this means for Kevin and I.  Yeah.  Well, if you're a FI customer, Hangouts is your messaging platform.  Yeah.  So I don't know.  I think they have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  None of this makes sense.  There's been no clear explanation of any of this for the past decade.  Right.  I mean, it's just like the app suddenly changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I imagine teams of engineers at Google who work on each different part of something  and maybe once a month they get together and they do a BattleBot style thing.  And if you win, your feature takes over the other features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dance off.  Dance off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That'd be way better.  If you are.  There's a really good story that I think Jeff would like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK.  Fire away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In the display section.  And I'm wondering if this is indicative of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remember, we're in the changelog right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a Google display.  Does that not go in the change?  That goes in there.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  OK.  I just was warning you.  It was just a warning.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are several features coming.  But the one I thought you'd care about is if you have personal  and separate personal and work accounts, you can set up multiple accounts on Google  assistant devices to see and interact with all of your upcoming events.  Now, does that mean G Suite?  Maybe.  It works with Google Workspaces, which I think is Workspace is going to be G Suite.  Yes.  I thought it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  G Suite's been renamed.  Yeah.  It's been renamed.  OK.  So it is.  So this is your.  So you can get your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll just call it G Suite because that's what I think of it as.  Your G Suite account now will you can sign up to test the beta.  So your calendar and stuff will appear on your Google displays.  So it's the beginning of possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  A step.  A little baby baby toe moved closer to the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dude, don't complain, man.  This is going to make you.  I'm working on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is going to make you happy, Jeff, because you still have a Pixel 4.  You may remember they talk the talk about Google Pixel 5's portrait light feature.  I actually have a three.  They're going to roll it out to the tooth, the three and the four.  And the four a.  So the and I think this is one of the things Google does well because a lot of the features  of their cameras really are software, not hardware.  And so portrait light, which allows you to dynamically tweak and edit lightning,  lighting, brightness around the faces and the lighting angle.  That was the one where you could have the light come from different.  Positions on the portrait.  That's pretty cool.  That's all software based.  So older phones should be able to do it and it will be available soon.  If not already.  To your Pixel 3.  Finally, you now can ask Google to find voting locations and ballot boxes  where you can drop off your ballot.  I bet you, you have all voted already.  Stacey, did you vote yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did.  Yes, I sure did my ballot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you now you live in Texas where you had to go.  Oh, you don't live in Texas anymore.  Oh, so that made it a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If I lived in Texas, I would have early voted.  But Washington, like when I got here, I was like, oh my God, is this voting?  I don't think you can vote in person in Washington.  I don't know.  It's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  New Jersey, they, the governor decided to send mail balance to everybody in the state.  And if you vote in person on election day, you are a provisional ballot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.  So have you sent your ballot in, Jeff, or are you going to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I took it into the city hall and in the box and put it in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mailed, I trusted the US mail because I thought about it and I thought  I could drop it off in an unattended locked box right out in the parking lot of the veterans hall.  Or I could put it in a nicely marked secure US mailbox.  So I did that.  And what was nice is in California, we get a text message saying that post offices received  your ballot.  The post office is sending the ballot to us.  And I just got a text yesterday.  We have received your ballot and it will be counted.  So that was a nice feeling.  Mike, are you, are you voting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have sitting on my desk in front of me.  I have the ballot filled out.  I just have not brought it.  I'm going to bring it down to one of the election boxes.  We have, there's like six of them, you know, within a mile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's actually, you'll appreciate this feature.  You can now ask Google ballot box ballot drop boxes near me.  And it'll show you all the ones and show you the one the nearest.  There's early voting locations.  They will show you as well.  And Google says soon you'll be able to say, hey, you know who, where do I vote?  Where do I vote?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's, you know, it would be nice as if they showed you how many people were in line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you can go with like, that would be great.  Yeah, that'd be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Leo, I used the Dropbox over at the veteran center.  Yeah, it looks pretty safe.  It's locked down.  And in a couple of days later, I got this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, nice.  You got a button.  So I got the email confirming that my vote will be counted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How did you get that?  Did you get it?  You got an email picture that says of a button that says I voted.  Yeah.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do miss not having my I voted sticker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll probably get that too then, I guess.  Yeah.  No, I was joking.  I just thought, you know what, why not mail it?  I got the post office.  Why not?  And I know my, I just think we should support your local postal service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, mine came with, it came with the-  Yeah, I have a sticker.  Oh, but your sticker's bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yours is like John's.  Mine's just that little lozenge.  I didn't get a sticker with my ballot.  You didn't get a sticker?  Well, it came with mine.  I don't know.  It's county by county.  County by county.  If you are a Stadia gamer or you want to be, Google has launched free game demos  to entice people into cloud gaming.  They started yesterday, including Pac-Man Megatunnel Battle.  All you have to do is click a link, create a Stadia account, and start playing the game  streamed from the servers.  So this is a chance for you to just try Stadia, you know, right now.  Because nobody else is using it?  Apparently.  I was about to say, don't go try out Luna.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's no fun.  Try Stadia.  The other also ran gaming, cloud gaming platform.  So I'm going to choose my account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me see if we can play, use Google Chrome to play Stadia on computers.  Oh, you see, they are monopoly.  I can't play it in my Firefox.  That's of course I can play.  It would work fine in Firefox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Unlike Apple, where you can't watch their events unless you're using Safari.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they stopped doing that, by the way.  I think they've opened up.  And that, unless you have something else, is the Google change log.  I didn't know whether to put this in the change log or not.  I don't think it belongs in the change log.  I mentioned that AOC was playing this new game among us on Twitch.  400,000 people joined her and Ilan Omar playing.  It's a fun game.  It's like werewolf.  You're on a spaceship.  Everybody has a different role.  There are one or more imposters.  You have to find the imposters before they kill you off.  Sounds like you played it, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have not, but my son has.  And in fact, I think this very second and the next room over.  He's playing among us?  I think you're playing it.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this is what the Taylor Lawrence article is really interesting.  Because she said basically this is how kids your son's age are socializing in COVID-19.  Because it's not really the game isn't that engaging.  It's more like you're sitting talking.  It's like when guys get together play poker.  It's just the backbone for the actual socializing.  So I think that's kind of cool.  AOC.  I'll have to show my daughter.  She probably already knows about it, mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  Okay.  I should check in with her and see if that's something she's doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you know about Among Us?  I wonder.  Because these things, they spread kind of virally.  Right?  So it may be that they just hasn't hit the island yet.  Here's Taylor Lawrence's article.  Everyone's playing Among Us.  YouTubers, influencers, and streamers populized this.  Taylor was so happy.  She tweeted it.  And yeah, after I wrote the article, AOC used it.  Half a million people joined her.  You play these characters.  It's a multiplayer game.  Four to 10 players dropped onto an alien spaceship.  You're either a crewmate or an imposter.  You have to run around the ship trying to complete a set of tasks  while not getting killed by the imposters.  Very big in the early teen set.  This is actually kind of a funny one.  Here, I'll play this.  Did I mute my sound?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me start it over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the sound of running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sounds familiar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, can't play too much of that.  Okay, that's just a little something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And see whether or not Google knows what that tune is, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the Biden campaign is pretty savvy when it comes to another game called Animal Crossing.  I just started playing Animal Crossing.  It's a fun game on the Nintendo Switch.  You liberal you.  No, I love it.  They had Biden Harris yard signs that you could buy.  Now they have a whole island.  So the idea is you're on an island.  You're building up your island over time.  You're doing a lot of work.  But apparently, I don't know, somebody in the Biden campaign  really has a lot of free time because they've built a rather elaborate island featuring  Kamala Harris's upstairs, the Biden headquarters.  They say there are plenty of ice cream trains, aviators, chucks, swag and more.  And of course, a lot of information about how to vote as an election day checklist.  That's, you know, it's in 2016, one of the secrets people said to Trump's success was  masterful use of social media, particularly Facebook.  It's interesting that Democrats are.  I don't see Donald Trump playing Animal Crossing anytime soon.  That's pretty cool.  You can you can get a Biden Island themed shirt for your character.  The dream code.  Well, just search for it so you can join.  Join them on the island if you wish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Zoom topia.  Zoom topia.  What is Zoom topia?  Zoom topia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They had a few interesting things.  Is it their conference?  Their big conference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, it was their conference or online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They are now doing end to end encryption.  It is available as an option for both free and paid accounts.  And judging by the description, we talked about yesterday on Security Now,  it's being done right.  So if you want an encrypted meeting, which you probably don't need to do for your,  you know, your, I don't know, maybe you do.  Well, Jeffrey Toobin might have been good to do it.  Jeffrey Toobin maybe, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, let me push back on that and say why you would, even if you're not nervous about it,  which is that if you only do it when you're nervous about what you're doing,  you're kind of signaling to people that these are the times to check in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here I am doing something bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Burner phones is the guardian bird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's cool that they are offering that.  I think you lose some capabilities with encryption, but nevertheless it is available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It also supports the idea of encryption and makes people  say, don't take it away from us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right.  Right.  Which they're about to try to do, I believe.  They're going to keep trying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They will try forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's Zaps, which you can open apps in the room and share those apps as you do the,  which I think would be neat.  Like Dropbox and Slack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like, what is it?  Mm, mm bop.  Was that mm-hmm?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  So basically, I mean, Zoom is just saying, hey, we're going to be a platform so you can  put all sorts of weird stuff on us and open stuff from us.  So like, I don't know if that's good news or bad news for him.  I guess it depends on how they implement it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Then there's OnZoom, which is their online events platform with more functionality for  events because people are going to other platforms for large scale events.  Ah, smart.  I went to one.  Which one do you like, Stacey?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I use Hopin instead of Zoom because it allows you to do networking and chat and all sorts  of great things.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The one I use is called Remo, which I think is fantastic for online events.  Remo?  Yeah, Remo.co.  It's similar to Hopin.  Like, I was going back and forth between Hopin and Remo and Remo just had some features that  I really liked.  But yeah, it's interesting that like, you know, I spent a few weeks researching this  space and it was incredible.  There are so many different virtual events companies out there.  And like, I found, I think, three or four top 10 lists that had no overlap between all  four top 10.  Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So yeah, I have a spreadsheet that has like 45 different companies on them.  And yeah, and everyone still is doing Zoom or God forbid, Teams.  Did you see CES is going to be hosted on Teams?  Oh, really?  Let us all just cry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Must have been a deal with Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Have you guys tried WonderMeat?  Do you know that one?  I haven't seen that one.  So I was at a Google event.  It was the because the social things, they have avatars and I hate those.  But now your little videos and you come near someone and then you see the other person's  video and your video there and you can talk and three other people can come down.  You're all in videos and you can talk.  Right.  There's a few of those things.  I need things like students being able to mingle and meetings and things.  I desperately need that kind of thing.  So is there what other competitors are out there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, the one that's similar to that is called Gather Town.  It feels like a kind of 8-bit computer type thing.  But as you walk around, as you get closer to people, the videos of the people that you're  closer to expand and you can talk to them and you can wander around the room.  So yeah, check out Gather Town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder how much of the explosion of these technologies has to do with WebRTC,  which was I think a Google technology.  The ability for a browser to do all of these things that normally you'd write a standalone  application to do.  Zoom doesn't use it, but Google Meet I'm sure does.  And a lot of these technologies, we have a Jitsi server, which is an open source  solution that uses WebRTC.  It makes it much easier to implement this kind of conferencing.  I bet you that's why there's so many different platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the last thing from Zoom-Topia that I found interesting was a suite of  things for the hybrid office and hybrid workforce.  So a virtual receptionist.  So you fire the receptionist.  Zoom rooms, scheduling, display, people counting.  So if there's a limited to how many people you can have in a room, what we'll come to  is we'll start counting people.  Voice commands for Zoom rooms so you don't have to touch anything.  Native integration of Alexa for business on Zoom rooms.  I don't know what that means.  Control Zoom rooms from a mobile device or laptop.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Zoom rooms enhance dashboard reporting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's all this stuff for the new office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the receptionist, you come into an office and there's nobody there.  There's just a screen.  And the receptionist is at home and welcomes you and says, well, just sit down.  Somebody will zoom you in a minute.  I mean, I don't, it's like just lock the place up.  Some of this feels like Zoom and others are assuming this is not going to end.  And this is the future of work.  This is what workplaces are going to look like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yep.  That's exactly what's happening here.  I think it's, I mean, I think it's exactly what's happening.  So that's why I was interested in this because they're anticipating some return to work,  but they're basically anticipating we're going to add in more and more features because  we're going to be doing more and more virtually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, a lot of companies are going, are following the Twitter route.  Microsoft, Dropbox saying, you know, this may be the new normal.  This may be how we work from now on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I had to go into Manhattan for the first time.  I had to go pick up books, old fashioned, my office.  I went in for the first time since March 12th.  Wow.  And well, the city was crowded again.  I mean, there were people, it wasn't, the traffic wasn't bad,  but there were people around on the streets and stuff.  But I go into my school and I have to do the, you know, the fill in the form and say,  I have, I'm not sick and all that stuff.  I had to watch a video explaining what COVID was.  And then I go up to my office that we have two stories of this building and there's one guard  and he's happy to see a human being.  He's a wonderful social guy, Jermaine.  And, you know, he was just happy to see somebody and we chat for a few minutes,  make sure everybody's okay.  And then I go upstairs and there's a sticker on my door that basically was a holiday in toilet  sanitized for your protection.  Holy cow.  And the two tiniest little alcohol wipes I've ever seen in my life, they're available on my desk,  I guess to do the phone or whatever.  And I pick up my books and I go and I leave.  And that was that.  It was weird.  And so I used to commute, you know, every damn day to the city.  I didn't drive into the city.  I drove to Jersey City and through the PATH train, but it was an hour and 45 each way.  And I've gained all that life.  And I just kind of can't imagine doing that again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot of conferences going virtual.  You mentioned Teams will be used by CES in January.  VidCon is going to be virtual not only this year, but next year.  Jim Latterback, our good friend who's the director of VidCon, says this summer, 2021,  VidCon will be via Zoom.  And there'll be sessions all year round now.  As it can be.  Yeah, nearly one million people tuned into digital events held by VidCon over the last few months.  You're a big VidCon fan because it's a chance to see the up and coming YouTube stars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm a member of the industry advisory board.  Yeah.  Nothing to disclose there because I don't get anything for it, but I'm a member of the advisory board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  VidCon now, which includes speakers and experts from YouTube, Instagram, Twitch, TikTok and more,  will pick up again on October 27th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm going to all kinds of academic conferences I couldn't go to otherwise now.  Yeah, I don't think it's so bad.  No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As long as you remember that they're happening.  That's my big challenge.  They're in my calendar, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But there's one out there, Stacey, that is going to have someone in person and it's going to be  Australian time, so I'm not going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And according to the Journal of the American Planning Association,  all these people who don't have to work in the office anymore  are creating Zoom towns all over the West.  And it's kind of an interesting situation because so many people are working from home.  They're moving out of the big expensive communities.  I live in a Zoom town.  You live in a Zoom town?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, a hundred percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They tend to be small towns near major public lands and ski resorts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Olympic Peninsula, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sandpoint, Idaho, which is on a lake near a popular ski resort,  had already begun to see an increased migration over the last decade,  but even more people are starting to arrive.  And I can tell you here in Petaluma, all the houses have been snapped up  because we're kind of in an exurb and a lot of houses are coming on the market all of a sudden  because people who lived here for years are saying, finally, I can dump this place  and move back to New York City.  Same here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow.  So if each of you, if you could go to a different country  to install work because it's fine because we're all virtual, what country would you pick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, my heart loves Helsinki, but I am aware that so that is in Finland.  No, yes.  I was like, no, yes.  It's part of my, I went, when I went, I went to like all the Scandinavian countries,  so I'm a little confused from.  Love Scandinavia.  Love.  But it is really dark and cold in the winter, so I'm not 100% sure I could,  I could have that year bound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to buy, I'll go ahead, Mike.  I was going to say Portugal.  Portugal is very affordable.  Good deals there.  Very lovely place, lovely people.  Absolutely.  Your Portuguese is good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, but I could work on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to buy Trey Ratcliffe's house.  He's selling his house in Queenstown, New Zealand and it's gorgeous.  I'm sure I can't afford it.  I can't believe how gorgeous it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They don't let foreigners buy houses in New Zealand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bet not.  That's one of the reasons it's the best place to go.  They don't let you travel to New Zealand.  You can't even go there.  Well, can you go to Portugal?  Who knows?  No, you can't go anywhere.  Yeah, pretty soon I think.  Barbados is offering a year-long visa for people who want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a few of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, all of the Caribbean and Tigue.  A lot of places in Caribbean have special visas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it was a great video.  Iceland is going to open up for tourists and they're doing the testing, they're doing stuff.  So CBS had an interview with the Prime Minister who's wonderful.  Young, brilliant woman.  And the middle of the interview, or no, sorry, Washington Post was.  In the middle of the interview, the earthquake hits.  And she continues with aplomb.  She's like, oh my God, everything's fine in Iceland.  And we get those once in a while.  It's okay.  You should still come as a tourist.  It's fine.  Normally they would tell us to go under the desk, but it was not that big.  So I'm still here talking to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just a little shaker.  We're like that here.  I think we've done enough damage to the podcast sphere for the moment.  Let's get ready for our picks of the week coming up next.  Mike, did they tell you we do picks of the week at the end of the show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They had told me last time I was on, but they didn't warn me.  But I'll grab something off.  I'll give you a little time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Grab something off your desk while Stacey Higginbotham gives us her thing of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Today's thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's grabbing something off her desk.  Oh, I recognize that.  Oh, you got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Echo dot mid-clock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Move it to the right a little tiny bit there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, there we go.  I was like, what is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There you go.  Oh, that's pretty.  It looks like a sphere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is a sphere.  And it is, let's here, I'll put it.  This is a can of something for reference.  This is the dot.  This is 59.  Okay.  This is actually my local talking rain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, talking rain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The one thing I don't like, well, there's two things I don't like.  One, I was worried that these were going to be too bright.  They are not too bright, but they are also not very large.  And this sits across my room.  So I can't see it.  I can't read it.  Because I have, yeah.  So that's a bummer.  The other thing I don't like is I don't like the top here where this is.  It looks like blemishes.  It's ugly.  And it's a hard plastic.  It's not like the stuff.  Yeah.  I don't love this.  So here's my mic.  This is for 59.99.  How's the sound?  The, okay, this is the dot.  This is the tiny one.  I don't love the sound.  And I can't talk about any of the others.  I'm under embargo.  But next week, maybe I'll tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, because there are other better sounding speakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  The dot and the this are available now.  I also would tell everybody because it would be remiss of me not to.  There's a brand new June up and out.  Another one?  A brand new one.  And mine is about, it's not about to die, but it's kind of like suffering a little.  So I am excited.  You've had it for what?  A year?  I've had it for four and a half years.  I've used it two to three times a day, every single day.  So it's worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's worn out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that is available to you for preorder.  The fancy schmancy version comes with all the tools you need to do things like cook a pizza,  fire wood fired pizza, except not wood fired and other things.  That's 9.99.  And then there is a less fancy version that is 7.99.  And then the normal version, which is just the oven without all the fancy trays and stuff  that you need to use for things like air frying.  And that is, I believe, 5.99.  The fancier you go, the sooner it will ship.  And then the other thing to note is they have a new cooking  thing that I guess you have to have the right kind of tray in.  So it's kind of fancy.  Like you may have to do the fancy one.  I need to talk to June to figure this out.  But they're doing a rotisserie mode because they realize they can control the carbon heating  elements and just like, it's hot.  Now this was hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't rotate the chicken.  Rotate the heat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The heat.  Isn't that great?  I'm like, those are the kind of like mental things you're like, oh crap, it's software.  I can do this.  That's really cool.  So anyway, that's my two things.  I helped you out there, Mike.

Transcript:  Wow.  I really, I really like that.  Wow.  My thing is just a blatant plug for my son.  He's become a drone pilot.  Hank Laporte.  He's on Instagram.  Hank Laporte.  And there's a few of his videos up there.  I am just kind of blown away what he's doing.  This is a night harvest at Hudson Ranch in Napa.  And it's pretty cool what they're doing.  His goal now is to get something called a FPV drone, first person video drone,  which they fly very fast.  You wear a visor to fly them and they're being used to create extreme drone videos.  But you know, I don't know.  It's going to be wild.  Anyway, these are really beautiful videos.  Wow.  Those are wonderful.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So we have a leading drone and journalism expert at my school.  Do you really?  Yeah.  No.  So we're teaching this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This drone stuff, it's amazing.  It's really amazing.  And so he's becoming very adept.  He was flying his drone under the Golden Gate Bridge, I think, a couple of days ago.  Is that legal?  No.  No.  I said, son, I don't want to know about it.  But he's also, he loves getting the surfers.  It's pretty cool what you can do with the drone now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The other person who loves drone stuff is Richard Gingras at Google.  Really?  Oh, he loves it.  He flies, he takes his drone whenever he travels, when we used to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I just, I thought I'll give my boy a little plug.  He's HangledPort on Instagram.  Well, you should.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's doing some really neat stuff with the drones.  Jeff, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, let me see which one we got to pick out here.  Um, I think, so Pitney Bowes does a regular survey of packing parcel shipping index.  It reached 103 billion parcels shipped globally in 2019.  So this is pre-COVID.  Imagine what's going to happen then.  Total value of 351 billion.  Every second, 3,248 packages are shipped.  Jesus.  3,248 every second.  Second.  Holy cow.  China has 63.5 billion parcels.  The U.S. only 14.7 billion.  What does that tell you about the comparable economies?  Yes, one is bigger than the other, but that's, that says e-commerce has gone berserko in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they also have a lot more people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And a lot more people and a lot more land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  On the land.  Yeah.  So it grew 26% year on year.  Followed by Norway, which grew 24% year on year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is everything you ever want to know about parcel shipping.  It is.  And then some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  From 2013, there were 10 parcels per person to now 27.  Again, this is before COVID.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh my God.  I actually get like, I get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I get like 300 parcels a year.  I was just thinking like, how many packages do you get a year?  At least one a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's all work, Stacey.  It's all work for you.  We know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The TSA, speaking of numbers, is now talking about the number of travelers coming through  checkpoint travel.  This is one year ago.  It was 2.1 million.  One year ago, same weekday.  It's 662,000, but that is up a lot.  In fact, it got up to a million on October 18th.  So the numbers.  How low did it get this?  It got pretty low.  The numbers are going up.  People are getting back in the air.  If I go back to March or rather April, 114,000 was one of the low points.  Go back to April 6th, because that's when Quibi launched.  Yeah, it took people right out of the box.  Took people right out of the air.  So travel is going up.  In fact, it broke a million for the first time in a long time on October 18th.  That's less than half of the normal total from one year ago.  But still, it's coming back.  It's surprising even to think about it.  A million people traveling in one day by air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are you ready to fly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  No.  I'm not getting in that tube.  Not going anywhere.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The flight to nowhere, the Australian flight to nowhere, it's just insanity.  I'm going to risk and I'm not going to get anywhere.  Yeah.  What do you get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not so much fun to fly that I would like just do it as recreationally.  I don't get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do miss the cookies in the Alaskan Lounge.  The molasses cookies are really delicious.  Okay, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, Mike, we gave you some time.  You got anything for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got something.  This was something I got from Kickstarter just recently, which is...  Let me see if I can get it here so it doesn't fade away.  It's a little mini...  I got to move back.  Looks like it says mover erase.  Mover erase.  It's a little mini whiteboard that's magnetic.  And I can pop it onto my screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's better than a Post-it note.  Oh, that's fun.  It's a Post-it note size whiteboard and it's got a magnet in it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right?  It was just one of those things where I had opened up Kickstarter and I saw it and I said,  yeah, that is useful.  So I just got them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you weren't alone.  They raised $145,000.  I presume they're going to start selling them.  That's really cool.  So it has a backing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they have different colors.  I put them on my whiteboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, now that's a little bit Kohl's to Newcastle, but still.  Yeah.  So don't use sticky notes.  Use mover erases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How many did you buy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I forget.  You know, they have these different bundles.  So I think I ended up with like 12 of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  See, I have about...  Let me see here.  Yeah, you see that pile there?  That's about 12 big whiteboards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He has all these whiteboards.  It's so bizarre.  You don't ever want to erase them?  Is that the reason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, like I outlined the book on it and I want to go back and change it.  And then I do eventually.  But then the problem is you leave the ink on the whiteboard for too long and it's impossible  to clean up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, you use Windex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I know, but it's yucky.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I tracked my daughter's height because I'm an idiot on a whiteboard.  And so I had to go over it with the permanent marker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that is not commitment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So in the bottom, I had to write exactly how high it was up from the floor in our old house.  You didn't want to write on a wall or anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we move so often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I guess, yeah, too permanent.  All my kids' growth...  What do you call that?  The growth chart.  All my kids' growth charts are in a house that we don't own anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so I at least own the whiteboard and I know exactly how high up I need to keep it.  So her measurements stay accurate.  It works.  So clever.  It was unintentional.  It's a whiteboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Honey, you're not going to be around long, so let's just put it on this whiteboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not sure we want to keep you or not.  You weren't adopted, but you might be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We were just excited and she was there and I was like, oh, let's mark it.  And then we marked it another time and then because I never cleaned my whiteboard.  And now I have a record of my daughter's site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's actually really cool and you can bring it with you,  which is it's turned out it was the right thing to do.  We have come to the end of this fabulous show.  Mike Maznik, I am so glad you were here for our lengthy discussion of the Google  antitrust action.  We didn't need to really go into it.  I thought we did a good job.  But that was fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think the DOJ waited till I was on the show to do that.  They knew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They knew.  They kept saying it's going to be any day now.  Techdirt.com is the place to read Mike's great writing.  He also has a podcast there.  It's is it a daily podcast?  No, weekly.  Weekly.  Casey Newton's on your most recent one.  That's awesome.  I can't wait to hear that.  Techdirt.com.  Thank you, Mike.  We really appreciate it.  Sure.  Mr. Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have two things.  Two things.  Sorry.  One.  I just said that you should use Windex on your whiteboard.  I use it on mine because mine's glass.  But I forgot that normals don't.  You shouldn't do that.  So I'm sorry.  I don't want people to.  I know.  This was horrifying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For section 230, we'd be in deep trouble.  Oh my God.  I'd be responsible for many whiteboards being damaged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then just the other thing.  Next Tuesday, I'm doing an event on the smart home and I forgot to promote it.  I'm sorry.  Can I promote it really fast?
