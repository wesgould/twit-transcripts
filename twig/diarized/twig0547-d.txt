Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the studio, you're also very spiffy. I don't know about spiffy. I didn't iron, I didn't even iron

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  this shirt. I think the difference is your shirt doesn't have words on it. Oh, right. That's what  it is. That's what it is. It doesn't say dominate or where's the bar bill. I always know what your  intention is because I read your shirt and today I have nothing. I have no idea what to do now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't wear my no shirt today. That's true. That's true. Well, I'm happy you didn't do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and basically that means you're going to say yes to everything today. Right. Also joining us,  Jeff Jarvis, buzzmachine.com. Jeff, how are you, sir? I should have worn this shirt. Oh, look at

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that. We call that branding. So there, the Leonard Tao Professor for Journalistic Innovation at the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York and so much more.  That's the abridged version of that. Yes. Oh, there we are. Okay, you can read it on your screen if  you really must know. I love that. You have speed readers in the show. I love that that's a graphic  that's just on hand for this show. Great to see you, Jeff. Also joining us, Stacey Higginbotham,  of course, is out this week in her place, Kevin Toffle. How's it going, Kevin? It's going well. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  don't have much to say on my lower third. I'm not like Jeff, but I do have words in my shirt. You do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  have words in your shirt and they are appropriate to this show. They are applicable. It says,  is that go ogle? Go ogle? Google. Oh, okay. Now I see. Now I get it. And I have to say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm super jealous. I did not know until this morning that Stacey is in my favorite place in  the world right now. Where is she? She's on vacation. She's in Scottsdale, Arizona.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's right. You're an Arizona guy. You're a sun devil. That's right. That's right. Do you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  envision somewhere in your future moving to Arizona going to where the heat is? In about 30 years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  40 years? No, no. Well, it'll be oceanfront property by then. But we actually went out there  in 2014 to go buy a house and we had lots of options. We already put on some offers and we  had our house in the market in Pennsylvania. We couldn't get any takers for what we needed to make  the deal close. So we decided to wait until 2018, which came and went because now my daughter is  going to a state university here in Pennsylvania. So I'm not going to leave here now, but I go out  there to Arizona once every one to two years for some Cardinals games, May issue basketball and  whatnot. So I love it out there. Work on your sunburn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't spent much time in Arizona very briefly, but I'll have to go back. I do like the heat. I  don't know if I'm going to be the person that retires to a place like Arizona, but I do enjoy  being able to go to the heat and kind of roast in the sunshine. Some people don't like that. I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  understand you people. I mean, you can always layer up when it's cold, but you can't get no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  lower than buck. You know what? That doesn't work for me. I'd rather just be hot all the time.  I don't know. Everybody's different. What a weirdo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, take me as I am. I'll find a shirt that has some words to give you next time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have some choice words at that.  Well played.  So let's see here. Should we start with coronavirus, this chipper topic that's right  at the top of the dock? And I think here, I mean, there's a number of stories here in the dock,  but I think the overarching question that at least relates to this show is that the coronavirus,  the spread of the coronavirus seems to be having some pretty interesting and dramatic impacts on  the world of technology. Last week, I believe you spoke on the show, you talked on the show about  the cancellation of Mobile World Congress. It happened right before we went on air.  It happened right before, yeah. So that was big news last week. Still big news because I think  the reverberations of that are going to be interesting as we enter Mobile World Congress

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  week because some- So Jason, let me ask you, we asked this show last week. Does Mobile World

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Congress ever return, Mr. Android? I mean, okay, I should say I've never been to Mobile World Congress,  so I've not been there. I don't have any direct involvement- But does the industry need it?  From my outsider's perspective looking in, I think it returns. I don't think this is the end  of Mobile World Congress. I know a lot of people are talking right now about like, well, maybe this  is the kick in the pants companies needed to realize they don't need these events after all  and they're going to kind of go inward or do a different strategy. I don't see that happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That makes sense for the big budget folks, but not the small guy that's trying to find that  network of buyers and get their product out there. So yeah, we need to ask. Yeah, the Samsungs and the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wawaways of the world, they'll be fine. They can do their own events, but the smaller players,  I don't know, they don't have really their own platform. They have enough people to  come and see these events, whether they're online or not. And Mobile World Congress isn't just  phones. It's also telecom equipment, which is a pretty big deal. There's really no other big  show for that. So I don't see it going away. Lots of IoT stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe it's possible that GSMA decides to do Mobile World Congress in a different place. Maybe it's  not Barcelona, although even that I kind of find. That's not the issue. Barcelona wasn't the issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  at all. It was just that there were a lot of companies in Asia that had to come in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. But I think a lot of people are looking at this as like an opportunity to change things up,  like, oh, well, if it's not happening then then maybe it's resurgence if there is one at all,  maybe it ends up in a different location or whatever. GSMA will move that event if it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a benefit to their wallets. I mean, it's just like anybody else. Who's going to give us the break?  Who's going to help us make this thing more financially feasible for us? Scottsdale, Arizona.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Scottsdale. Just rolling the dice on that one. We'll see how far that gets us. I thought you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  were thinking more like Shreveport, Louisiana for Mobile World Congress. That would be a good fit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we'll see what happens there. I think now we're also, I had heard that Microsoft,  is it Microsoft was pulling out of RSA? Yeah, I think so. IBM. Or sorry, IBM. Yeah,  not Microsoft. IBM pulling out of RSA. Sony backing out of PAX East. So there's a lot of  these independent threads going on right now. Facebook has canceled its next conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, okay. That's the marketing conference. It hasn't canceled I.O. It's not F8, just a smaller

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  marketing. Okay, so not F8. That would be an even bigger... I know of another conference that hasn't  been announced yet. No, Facebook hasn't canceled Google I.O. either. Right, exactly. Facebook would

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like to cancel I.O. if they could. There's another conference that I had coming up that  it's not announced yet, so I won't say which one it was, but Singapore is being canceled, I'm told.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay. Yeah, the other thing is since so many things, so many electronics are made in China,  you have to wonder what's going to happen to the supply chain, obviously. Right. And I know this  is this week in Google, but I believe Apple just announced that it's not going to meet its  investor expectations because they're dealing with supply issues there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep, yep. Actually, it's in the rundown. Trendforce released a report, and they're  basically looking at the potential impact of the coronavirus on tech manufacturing.  And they had a number of different areas that they looked at. Smartphone production,  they expect will decline 12% year over year to this quarter. They'll see a major reduction  in fiber optic supplies, which could affect 5G rollout. DRAM and NAND flash markets, apparently  unaffected because of a lot of stockpiling going on there, so those should be unaffected as a result.  Although it's affecting current video game technology, the next generation, which is expected  to come out at the end of this year, they're saying as long as things with this outbreak  are mitigated by the end of the quarter, it shouldn't have a dramatic effect on these next  gen consoles. Part of me wonders, that seems really fast for this to be mitigated by. That's  rapidly approaching. So one could expect there to be a big impact there potentially. And the biggest  declines would be with smartwatches, laptops, smart speakers. Yeah, so exactly what you're talking

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  about, Kevin. Yeah, as far as the video game console as well, you always have Stadia. There's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  no console to buy. Well, that's true. Why do you need anything else? Google already gave you Stadia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All of this, you're saying all coronavirus is a Google conspiracy? Is that what you're saying?  It's the only way they're going to make Stadia succeed? Oh, yeah. Wow, they went a long way for

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that one. I didn't say that. Well, they are all powerful. Apparently so. Oh, boy. Yeah, so  long term, at least for this year and potentially beyond effects, this is going to make a big  mark in a lot of earnings reports that we're going to see over the coming months. I'm surprised we

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  haven't seen the stock market because Apple, I just checked Apple. It's up for the day. You know,  it's not really hit a big hit. I don't think anybody's taken a big equity hit yet. Yet. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  isn't it just the fact that a lot of those big companies are pretty dag gum resilient? They're  going to bounce back. The larger companies, yeah, they're definitely weather that storm better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We talked about this last week, I think that with the tariff fears made them  two years ago, some contingent made them diversify their supply chains a little more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That makes a lot of sense. CNET has a report that's that's related somewhat to all of this.  I had not seen this until right before the show. Apparently there's a company creating face masks  that are face ID compatible because it prints your face on the bottom portion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is pretty creepy. It's creepy, but that's how you capitalize. Apparently. I mean, look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's weird. That's the American way. On their site, they said, is it a joke? Yes and no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you're going to want to wear a face mask. So you might as well wear our face masks with your

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  face on. Wow. That one mask looks really similar to my face. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, this is this is also a way for us to try on other people's faces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wasn't there a movie that did that? Look at that. That looks really similar to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Face off. That was the movie. There it is. Apparently these are $40. So if you want to get one,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they're not making them yet. You can get on the mailing list to find out when they'll start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's right. No official launch. They don't want to use face masks people actually may need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's okay. Thank you. They just invented them like last week.  It's basically in the oh, that would be a cool thing. Cool idea. I'm surprised it's not Kickstarter,  but yes, totally. It will be, I'm sure. An Indiegogo or something along those lines.  All right. Any any final thoughts on on coronavirus,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  comfefe, whatever they call this? Well, Kevin, Kevin, Kevin, very important.  Coronavirus have any impact on Chromebook Galaxy deliveries?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is important. Well, you're jumping way down the notes now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just I'm just everything. I see everything. You're here. My Chromebook God is here.  Now in the light of Chromebooks, there's a lot you know how we call it in journalism. We have the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  local angle. This is the local angle of my head. I hear you. I hear you. So okay, so earlier today,  I noticed thanks to actually one of the about Chromebooks readers that Best Buy has a release  date for the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook that that release date is currently April the 6th.  I did reach out to Samsung to confirm that about eight hours ago. I have not heard back.  You know, Jeff, Samsung's based in South Korea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They do the manufacturing there. Predominantly. Do we know that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's actually a really good question. I mean, from a lot of their their memory chips and so on.  Yes. As far as their laptop slash Chromebook production, I'm going to go with probably  because I don't I don't see them outsourcing. I don't know. I really don't.  So I don't think there's going to be any impact there. But of course, things can change as we know  with the coronavirus on a daily basis. More interesting, probably to you and many other  people. I noticed on the official Galaxy Chromebook site today, they have network connectivity of LTE.  And I'm waiting to hear back from Samsung on that as well. And my thought is that at CES,  they announced the base model for nine hundred ninety nine dollars over the top machine as it is.  But you could always get more memory, more storage, etc. So I'm thinking that if you go  up from the base model, they may be offering an LTE option. They've said nothing officially about  any other models, only that you can specify after the base model up to 16 gig of RAM and one terabyte  of storage. So first time I've seen them mention LTE. So we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no price on the on the higher levels, right? Just the base price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just the base price right now. That's correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. So your choice of color. So apparently Jeff, I'm getting the spicy red.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Fiesta red. Yeah, it's I spent a half an hour with that device at CES and it's gorgeous.  It's bold. That's like now you got me saying it's spicy red. The Fiesta red is very bold.  You can get mineral gray. It's kind of boring. You know, it's the same old same old.  It's just such an incredibly thin device. I mean, you had the keyboard travel you're OK with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm OK with that. Yeah, you know, you New England guys that look more like orange to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you have your pixel on you? Yes. Yeah, because the pixel like I'm looking at the Samsung color  and then I'm looking at your pixel, which is a little washed out. There you go. There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's it's redder in person. Redder. It's kind of hard. Yeah, it's kind of hard to capture on  camera, especially at CES. A little terrible lighting. Totally. But yeah, I mean, it's it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  top of the line without a doubt. So shouldn't have to wait too much longer. OK, so we know Jeff's  going to get this, especially if there's an LTE option. We all know if there's an LTE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let me ask. Let me ask about that. OK, because I don't understand Jeff as a Chromebook user,  not as user Chromebooks. But Jeff, what's the obsession with having like the most expensive  Chromebook because this has almost a desktop class processor in it and you don't need that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for browsing and basic use. I'm just curious. Oh, geez. Are you my wife? I mean, he is.  I was going to say he's almost just sort of talking smack about you. Yeah, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a question I've always wanted to ask. I mean, don't get me wrong. He's basically saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you're not a power user. Why do you know that much power? What does a high end Mac cost now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ten thousand. Yeah, high. Depending on how high it is. Fifty thousand dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A top end, a good Mac book. What does it cost? I don't know. About $2 million. Yeah. Anywhere  from 25 to 40, 45. This is the device I use constantly all day. I live on it. I have lots  of tabs. I like the speed. I've worked with the earlier machines so I know how they can slow down.  So it is possible to slow down. So I live with that kind of fear. I'm old enough to remember  a fan on a Chromebook. So this machine, my Chromebook Pixelbook is still wonderful,  but as I've said, I bang it up a fair amount. I'm just afraid it's going to die. But that's  the excuse. I fully admit it. Anybody on the show wants the latest, biggest, bestest thing  because we're men and that's what we do. I don't have a Corvette. I have a Chromebook and that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  very sad. That's fair. I only raised the question because a couple years ago, Pixelbook was it.  That's all you had. But now there's a broad range of high end devices that some of them cost just  as much as this. Some of them you can get for $600, $700. I have one right now with a  Core i5, more of a desktop class type processor in it with 16 gig of RAM and it was like $820.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I know. Well, the other thing is the flip display, whatever you call it officially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Two in one. Yeah. Sure. What? The two in one display? Well, yeah, right. Whatever it's called

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  officially. The weird thing is- It's yours. That's what it's called. Somebody else did that. That was  a good one. Here's how I use that in takeoff and landing on planes. Oh no, it's not a laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a tablet. That works. Loophole. Yeah. No reason not to. I get it. Hey, I like that one.  Well, I've never seen that before. That's been hiding in the TriCaster. Do that again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was good. That was impressive. We just became a laptop. Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't believe my eyes. I was like, wow, Kevin, did you just make that up on the fly?  That's why he's pushing buttons instead of me. Got it. Okay. Now we know what we've been missing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why he deserves Kevin Cam. I want to see that mastery at work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, okay. So the Pixelbook, there are over, there have been, or actually, well, okay,  let me back up here. Let me actually talk English, speak English. I can't talk suddenly. Never mind,  I give up. What I'm trying to say is, are there many Chromebooks that are more than a thousand  dollars? It would be this one by Samsung and it would be the Pixelbook. There's not that many,  right? Like I'm doing a search online and there's like high three digits, but-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So there are two by Dell that are really enterprise focused. You can spend over two grand on those,  quite honestly. Oh, really? Yes. Yes. They came out probably two or three months ago.  It's not a consumer device. You're not going to buy them even though they don't,  there's nothing different about them physically or anything like that.  It's the latitudes. They took their, I think it was their 7130 and I forget which ones they are,  but I mean, I don't write about them that much because again, it's a niche kind of thing inside  of a niche. Yeah. Yeah. So, and then, well, don't forget at CES also the ASUS Chromebook  flip C436. Now that starts at 799, very similar to the Samsung. Also looks very nice. You can  spec that up as well. The pre-order page was up and then it came down, but while it was up,  I saw that the next model up is 999. So that's getting up there. Yeah. So that was from ASUS?  That was from ASUS. And then I have the ASUS and if you go hog wild on the ASUS  and configure it all the way to the top, it's $1,500. Okay. All right. So they're not really

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  alone. I'm just curious to know how many people are actually buying Chromebooks in that price range.  I would enjoy having a Chromebook that's capable of that, but I don't know how many people like  that's part of their use case. Is part of it just kind of like you're already all in on Chrome OS  and you don't mind spending a lot of money on a laptop in general. So you might as well spend a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  lot of money on a matched out Chromebook. I guess the question is how much is all in on Chrome OS  that ecosystem? You don't spend a lot there. That's the other thing. You're right. All this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  other money you've got to spend on all this virus protectors and all that junk. Yeah. That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. See, for me, it's a very specific use case. And that is the coding classes and the  applications that I'm writing on my own. Different IDs. Yeah, absolutely. Android Studio alone  is a hefty beast. And Google recommends that you have like a Core i5 U series processor,  which is one step up from what the Pixelbook had. That had a Y series. Yeah. I literally just wrote  a post last week about can you get through a computer science program in college with a  Chromebook? And I outlined all the apps that I use and the device that I bought, why I bought it with  16 gig of RAM and so on and so forth. But again, most people are not not buying those. No. Do people  still use Eclipse? Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Eclipse. I've had Eclipse online, IntelliJ, Visual Code,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Android Studio. Yeah. People still use Eclipse. The other key is going to be I saw a post this  week and I can't remember where it was. So I can't remember. But somebody was trying to find  good video editing. And so they finally found something free actually on Linux on the Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a couple of video editors on Linux. There's a lot of a couple of photo editors too. I  mean, you can do everything that you need to do if you if you edit video and photos, but you have  to be comfortable with the non name brand type, you know, open source applications. But that's also

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you're telling people to jump into the Linux OS, which is not everybody's cup of tea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree. But the trick is it's kind of hidden. And it's like you enable Linux,  Linux is installed when you enable it, you flip a switch on your Chromebook,  and then you have it. It's just there. Yeah, you may need to go into the command line and learn how

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to download and install an app. You start telling people pseudo app get and they look at you as if  you just talk outside of your neck, you know, right, you do that one time. And to be honest,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you can actually download a package manager, aka type app store, right? That's visual, it's got a  GUI, and you can just pick and choose. And to be honest, even if you don't want to go the command  line route, if the software you're looking for is available in a download, specifically for  Debian Linux, which is pretty popular distro of Linux, you can download the dot d e b file and  then in the files app of your Chromebook, the native files app, right click and one of the  options is installing Linux and it doesn't really know that. Oh, cool. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So you don't  have to use the command line if you can download a dot db package file, which you would just download  through Chrome OS. I mean, that's it. That's pretty cool. It's not as scary as you might think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Trust me. Well, I've seen some of the video editors and photo editors on the Linux side.  I used to play with one called shot well for photos and video was open shot. And open shot  was really nice and could compare to the likes of DaVinci or premiere. I would love to have you do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a story on you. There it is. Tricking out a Chromebook for photo and photo also video. But  you know, since you're high end photo, you have to really find the thing that could really work

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well on it. Yeah. And that's the thing I'd have to dive back in because I left that stuff behind  several years ago. Right. But I'm sure it's better now. Yeah. And that's the thing I'd like to see it  now. I remember open shot really being pretty comparable to, you know, some regular video  editors. But again, it was like trying to tell people, hey, you need to first install Ubuntu  or Linux Mint or whatever. And they go like, no, that's OK. That ends up being the roadblock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's definitely a big barrier. I totally get that. But you know,  the flip side is because people when I wrote that article about getting through college or the  Chromebook, they're like, but you're not using Chrome OS. I'm like, so? I'm using a native  built in feature of Chrome OS, which happens to be Linux Android is built in. So what does  it matter if it does what I need? Who cares? Yeah, exactly. All right. So I'm curious now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we're in macho geeked here. I'm eager to hear Dr. Android's experience with Android 11. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right. How about how about how about that's the tease. Let's thank the sponsor.  And then when we come back, we're going to dive into the new like fresh off the presses release  of the first developer preview of Android 11 or Android are if you want to call it that.  But Google really isn't even calling it that. But I did get it installed on a Pixel 3a. It  took me a while. We'll talk all about it before we do that. Let's thank the sponsor. This episode  of This Week in Google is brought to you by Mint Mobile. Mint Mobile is actually the provider that  I use in my Pixel 4 XL. I have a SIM, a mobile SIM to install to my phone. I have my what used  to be my Google. My why am I suddenly blanking my Google SIM card? Why am I blanking? Today is not  my day. Thank you. It's such a long name to remember. It's two letters like I can't remember two

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  letters because Mint has erased it from memory. It's true. No need for it now because you have

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  minutes. See, that's the beauty. Once you put mobile on your phone, you'll forget everything  else in your life. All that matters is Mint Mobile. Geez. All right. If you're still using one of the  big wireless providers this year, you should ask yourself what you're actually paying for. You're  probably paying for expensive retail stores. You know, they have some sort of a store that they  got to make the money to keep the lights on and those stores inflated prices, hidden fees,  all these things mean that you might actually be being taken advantage of because they know  you're going to pay. This is how most people, especially here in the US, is how most people  get their cellular coverage. Enter Mint Mobile because Mint Mobile does it completely differently.  They provide the same premium network coverage that you're used to but at a fraction of the cost  because everything is online. Mint Mobile saves on retail locations and overhead because they don't  have those things. They don't have a retail store that you can walk into that they need to pay for  everything that's included within that store. They pass that savings on to you and really keeps it  easy, right? Like we're used to living our lives on the internet. That's what Mint Mobile is all  about. It's providing you this coverage, making it easy for you to sign up online. It was super easy  for me to port my number from Google Fi over to Mint Mobile. It actually happened super quickly.  All my calls just started coming in, streaming into the Mint Mobile SIM and I haven't looked back.  Mint Mobile makes it easy to cut your wireless bill down to just $15 a month with their three-month  introductory plan. Every plan comes with unlimited nationwide talk and text. You'll also stop paying  for unlimited data that you'll never use when you're using Mint Mobile. You can choose between  plans with three, eight, or 12 gigs of 4G LTE data. I happen to have the 12 gig plan and I never come  even close to that but that's what I have. Use your own phone with any Mint Mobile plan and keep  your same phone number along with all of your existing contacts. Again, that's exactly what I  did. You can ditch your old wireless bill, your old wireless provider, whether you can remember the  name of it or not, ditch it and start saving with Mint Mobile. To get your new wireless plan  for just $15 a month with their three-month introductory plan and get the plan shipped to  your door for free, all you got to do is go to mintmobile.com slash twig. That's mintmobile.com  slash twig. Do that and you'll cut your wireless bill to $15 per month with their three-month  introductory plan. Mintmobile.com slash twig and we thank them for their support and for  understanding that sometimes I just have a brain fart that makes me forget things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it was all of those command line entries from Android 11.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, Ant. That's exactly what it was. That's exactly what it was. So I get into work this  morning. I'm like, all right, I've got three solid hours to get ready for this twig show.  And then I open up my news and I see that Android 11 has been released, the developer preview.  You were on all that. It was like, okay, well now I know what I'm doing for the next however long  it takes me to install this dang thing. I've done this so many times and yet for me, you know,  just like speaking, it never gets easier. Just like saying two-letter words, it never gets easier.  But I got there. So I spent some time installing it and I wish I had a whole lot to like show you  off with Android 11. This is Android 11. The fact that it works right there is pretty good.  Yeah. So here, let me scroll up so that I make sure I don't get a little Roboto font.  It's a good old Roboto font again. So the preview is out. The only way that you can get the Android  11 preview installed right now is by downloading the OTA or the factory image. There is no opting  in at this point for the automatic download via the beta channel, which will be an option eventually.  But right now, it's so early. This is actually a month earlier than last year's Android 10  first developer preview release. So we're even a month earlier, which makes me wonder if that's  going to change the release date at all or what's going to happen. It makes me wonder if your phone  is going to blow up right now. Could. Very well could. But you know what? It's a Pixel 3a that  I had hanging around and I was like, you know what? I'm not going to put this on my Pixel 4 XL. So  I've got it on here instead. Go the safe route. The SDK is also in Android Studio. And that's  really what this is all about. This is about developers playing around with some of the new  features, kind of understanding what they're all about, getting their apps prepared and ready and  all that stuff. The original Pixel and the original Pixel XL are not going to get Android 11.  So we know that at this point. I don't think so. But I think people should definitely have this.  Updates in December 2019, right? I believe so. I believe so. Yeah, they got updates longer than  I think they were supposed to anyways. But Android 11 is not coming to the Pixel. I'm sure there will  be some developers that do the magic work to bring it over anyways. We love devs. So anyways,  I mean, walking through Android 11, there's not a whole lot new to look at. Like you can see this  says all apps instead of a line there separating. That's pretty minimal. One of the new features is  in the quick settings. There is now an option to put in a screen record feature. So this is nice.  This is embedded into the OS, at least at this stage. And mind you, with developer previews,  anything can change. That could be for debugging, couldn't it? Could be. But I know that this has  been something that they've been working on. It's kind of bounced back and forth previously. And so  now it's surfacing as an option for the quick tile settings. So I could just tap it. It says,  are you sure you want to do that? Start now. And I am recording. That would be great to have.  Right out the box. Once I stop that, I believe it would appear in my notifications screen recording.  I could tap that to view the video that I just recorded. And there we go. Good that. So that's  kind of nice. I don't know if everybody has a use for screen recording, but yeah, I use that for

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  tutorials. If I'm trying to show someone how to do post-processing in Lightroom Mobile or just  whatever it is I'm doing creatively, I've done some screen recordings and put them up on YouTube  or on Instagram or something like that. And it's just a way to really allow people to be immersed

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  in the process. Yep. Yep. So, okay. So that's one thing I can show you. Another thing in the  settings, if I go to do a search for dark mode or dark theme, let's see here, we'll go to dark theme,  which I know is Jeff's favorite section of the US. Now you have the ability in the schedule to  turn it on at a custom time. So you can set that up also from sunset to sunrise. So if you want it  to automatically switch to dark mode as the sun starts to set, you can do that. So yes. Oh, yes.  So I wonder if it's going to happen. Mr. Kevin is awesome. It might be synced up not with the  light coming through the camera, as is the case right now, but probably more so with the time of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  day and your time zone and everything. But it'd be cool to have that as well as the blue filter  feature that you can set up. Yep. You can set that too within digital well-being settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can put a schedule on that so it would happen at the same time. So you can automate the dark  theme on the system, which is kind of nice. What else can I show you? Oh, okay. So there's a lot  of permissions work that is apparently happening, continuing to happen with Android 11. Some of  those permission changes, one, it's going to prohibit apps from repeatedly asking for a single  permission. So there have been times in the past where it will keep popping up this request and  you deny it and it's still like, it's almost like it requires you to do it because it keeps asking.  Now it'll kind of give up. It's like forces the apps to give up. So that's nice. One thing I can  show you, so I have Yelp installed here. Yelp says, okay, we're going to need your location.  If I say, okay, understand, I get this thing, which we've seen before, this message, allow Yelp  to access this device's location. You get a new setting in here only this time. So it's a temporary  setting now. That's like, you know what? On just this open, I want Yelp to have access to my  location. But the next time that I launch the app, I want that to be reneged and ask me again then.  Nice.  They made some really great changes last version around that, but they're adding more features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I believe it was like right now, like allow it always, or just when this app is open  was the phrase that it used in the past. But I like this being literally temporary,  this time only period. That's pretty slick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, totally. It gives you a little bit more control. I've turned down the brightness so  things aren't so blindingly light for you. As far as things that I can really show you,  I think the rest of the stuff is really kind of hidden. I mean, there's one more thing.  If I had received a message through like a messenger, one of my notifications  that would appear from there, it is labeled as conversation. So I think this, I don't know  exactly why that is, but I think they're going to bundle, that means that they're going to be  bundling messaging apps under like a single notification tree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll have the 87th Google messaging app.  Oh boy.  Finding all 86 that came before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Embedded in the OS this time.  Yeah, I don't think it's a new type of messaging app, but it's just a way of organizing messaging  app notifications into a conversations tier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do they have a setting in the notification settings that currently they will let you  bundle or unbundle those things, I wonder?  Let's see here.  If you've got a chance to look there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know that the notification feature is called conversations. I'm doing a search in settings  for conversations or starting to, and these are assistant or apps and notifications assistant.  So these are both tied to assistant. So I don't think that's what we're looking for.  If we do bundles, because I do remember that notification bundling,  but I'm not finding anything for that.  There is a way to get into settings for that though.  Apps and notifications. Let's see here.  So notifications, system UI.  I feel like I'm probably not looking in the right zone, but there might be some way to bundle  notifications. I know that was part of the previous version. I didn't really use it that much though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I swipe away so many notifications.  Yeah.  Looking nowadays.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Outside of that, I think all the changes, at least at this point,  this early point are not changes that are easy to show off. One of them is that project mainline  has added another 12 updatable modules to the OS. Now, if you guys remember mainline, this is  kind of an extension of a project treble. It allows certain parts of the Android OS to be  updatable without a full system-wide update, without downloading a system image and updating  it. So it's componentizing the OS. That was a really big deal for last version of Android.  There were eight before. Now there's a total of 20 modules that can be updated this way.  So more and more, Google is kind of pulling out the aspects of Android that couldn't only be  updated through an OS upgrade of which manufacturers and carriers could get in the way of that  happening and users wouldn't end up getting those updates. Mainline allows for there to be  kind of like a direct pipeline into updating certain aspects of the OS so that it doesn't  rely on them, on the carriers or the manufacturers making changes or allowing it to happen.  So I feel like any changes they make related to mainline are a big deal.  That's pretty slick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Also, it looks like you're going to get one of these every month for the next five or six months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the timeline. Yes, exactly. So I don't know that I have that article in here. Does it give  the timeline as far as when the final version is supposed to release? I'm guessing Q3?  It's all it is. It's Q3 right now.  Okay. All right. So obviously we're going to hear so much more about this as we head into  Google IOT season and stuff. But there are other features. Support for electronic IDs.  So in the way that we use our smartphones for mobile payments, there's going to be  stuff built into Android 11 that allow for digital driver's license.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a public record, right?  Yeah. So I wonder if that's just what they're doing is grabbing the public data in some kind of way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I feel like they have to secure it. There has to be some sort of security around that.  And I think that's part of what they're baking in here is kind of the official.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They don't have to. It would be nice if they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true. Very fair. That's true. I would like to think that Google wants to protect us.  But what do I know? Other permissions changes. Scoped storage, which was how apps would have  isolated storage from other apps. This is something that they tried to put into Android 10.  And then developers got really upset because it kind of broke certain  aspects of how their apps were reaching into storage data.  And it really requires developers to rethink and reprogram their apps to support this new kind of  paradigm. So Google went back on that, but they said, but warning you, Android 11, this is going  to happen and everybody's going to be forced to do it. And sure enough, that's the plan for Android 11.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I still worry, not worry, but I still have questions about the permission side of it.  And I guess it's more in the consumer's control instead of Google's control. When you mentioned  the apps giving you the constant notification for specific permission after you denied it  several times when you opened it up previously. And a lot of those apps will allege that, okay,  our app just won't work until you activate this permission. Google really can't do much about that  other than what you were mentioning is they'll make that notification go away. Is that the only  control they have or is it more on the consumer's own as to just say, you know what, I'm just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  uninstalling this app? I mean, yeah, I don't know how that's going to play out. If a consumer decides,  I really don't want this app to have this permission and that permission is critical to the app

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  functioning. See, now that's the difference. Critical to the app functioning makes sense.  If I'm looking for a restaurant app or whatever, so it's probably going to need my location.  Yeah, possibly. But if I'm using a paintbrush app, that doesn't need my microphone.  So if I keep denying that paintbrush app the microphone, eventually I'm going to just get  sick of it and uninstall it or is that something Google can say, hey, look, stop people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that in the new permissions, and I only got a chance to really gloss over the Google page  for the developer preview, if a consumer or user says after two times, deny, deny,  all future requests for the app would be considered deny. So they're trying to  stop having you get pestered by this. Like you've made your choice and that's that.  I'm almost positive I saw that in the new permission settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep. I think I saw a couple of times as well. And then at that point as a user,  this is where it gets a little complicated as a user because then once you've denied a couple of  times, at a certain point you might decide, oh, I want this to work or you might not remember that  you've denied it and then you go to use the thing and it's not working. You're like, wait a minute,  why isn't it working? Well, that's because you denied it a couple of times like two months ago  and you just forgot that you did that. Now you as a user have to remember to go into the settings,  the actual user settings for that particular app, go into the permissions for that app and allow it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why every time it asks me, every time it asks me, do you want to open this with this or this  and I make a choice and it says once or forever, I always say once. Yes, I know.  I know I'm going to have to do it every single time. I don't want to. Because you never know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's too much pressure. Yeah. Because you never know. I agree. Because sometimes I don't want to  default to something that I just installed, even though I may like it, but every now and then it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  just the creature of habit. Even though it's like open this with Twitter, I'm down. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just too much. I can't ever hit always. Someone please make a GIF of Mr. Jarvis trying  to make that decision. There we go. And GIF created, I'm sure. There's also a feature to,  or will be a feature to mute notifications while you're recording a video. So if you've ever had  that experience where you're recording a video with your phone and then a notification comes  through and then when you watch the video later, it's like you hear it. It's like the loudest buzz  in the world. So that's a small, but I think a good change. Better biometric security support  for developers. So I think, I don't know much details about this, but I'm assuming more kind of  working in more stuff around different types of biometrics. So not just fingerprint, they've had  a long time to perfect how Android relates with fingerprint security. But now of course with the  Pixel 4, we've got this face unlock that's much more developed than the face unlocks that have  come before it on Android. So I'm guessing this is kind of more support in that vein.  And I think that's about it. That's all I was able to kind of pull together shortly before the  show time to kind of see. But- That's quite a bit.  Yeah. I mean quite a bit at the same time, pretty light. And I know that probably over the course  of the next couple of days, we'll get the people who are really diving deep into this, who will  find a lot more hidden. Things commented out in the code.  Yeah. Yeah, exactly.  Little placeholders. And Google's really good at keeping a lot of this stuff close to the vest  for the right time. So this is light, might feel light, but it's going to open up as we  continue on down this developer preview cycle. Next month there'll be another one, the month after.  And each time you're going to get a little bit more insight into what's there. And they are  definitely going to save something to be announced at Google I.O. They always do.  They have to. Yeah. They've got to make a big splash.  And yeah, so a lot of the big marquee features of Android 11 we probably don't even know about  yet and won't for at least a couple of months. That's my guess anyways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I appreciate you going through and installing that on this burner phone, if you will.  My burner. I was kind of hoping you'd lock yourself

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  out of your main phone. Someday I might do that again just for just for giggles, but not today.  Alas, I enjoy having my Google. For those of you who don't know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've got being cruel. Oh, no, I didn't. The man locked himself out of his stuff once

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  on the show. We'll put a link to the to the to the episode in the show notes.  Worth watching. I'll never live that one down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's great. What not to do when you're turning on to your own dog food and choke on it.  Yes. And you know what? And now like I'm two factored everywhere. So I figured it out. It was  it was the pain point that I had to go through in order to protect myself.  I wasn't a man who helped you out of that. Yeah. Mr. Cutts. Yep. Yep. Mr. Cutts helped me out.  So I really appreciated that. And every once in a while I hear from people like,  oh, it happened to me. What do I do? I try my best to walk them through it.  That's gone from Google. Yeah, that's not going to work. But I think everybody's able to figure  it out eventually. So that's good. I miss Matt Cutts. Yeah, I do too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have him on Twitter whenever he's in town. He is unable to be on Twig anymore because it's  a conflict with his current gig at the government. Yeah. But he stands for government. Yeah, I guess  so this week in government. But yeah, whenever he's in town, we have him on on Twig. Yeah,  he was on not too long ago. I'll put a link to his most recent appearance as well. Man,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you're you're link crazy today. He is on it as a producer. I have a baby. Have you guys ever

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  looked into the stuff that his team is doing, by the way, like actually gone to the websites  that they've redesigned and the processes that they've updated? It's amazing. That's.org is just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  really cool. Yeah, I'm happy that's working out so well for him. He deserves it.  Let's see here. So what else can we talk about? We're the pixel phone. Okay, there was a link in  here for the pixel five. But man, looking at the photo of the supposed concept pixel five phone,  and I just don't buy it. There's a supposedly a leak of the pixel five that hits YouTube channel  I had never heard of, although there are a lot of YouTube channels. So don't, you know, maybe this  is a big channel front page tech. So that's so this first of all, this is pixel five actually  making an appearance in AOSP code, which basically just says, Yes, there is a pixel five that exists  in this world or it will exist. It's been removed. But basically, it was someone saying we tested  this on the pixel five. And of course, we all know there's going to be a pixel five year ago,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know what I'm saying? Just to comment and outline. Yeah, it's not it's not like a pixel

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  five isn't going to happen. I suppose there's the small possibility of that happening. This is the  leaked photo supposedly of the upcoming pixel five that we won't see until probably closer to the end  of the year. And I just don't buy it. I don't see Google going to the Yeah, yeah, totally anthropomorphic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I don't know. Yeah, that's pretty ugly. I like that is matte black. Yeah, no fingerprints.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like it just doesn't look real. I think this is just an emoji. Somebody's laughing at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't look like an emoji. With an emoji with war paint. That's pretty much it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, man, it's almost perfectly lined up. That is so weird. How did you do that?  Oh, Kevin, how are you? My goodness. You are a pixel five right now. I've never seen anything  so crazy. That is this week's thumbnail. Yeah, right. Might look like a mistake out of context,  but I can't decide. What do you guys think of the galaxy Z flip? Have you been have you been

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  wooed in the direction of Samsung's slipable phone? I want to hear you first, because we made  fun of Leo last week. What do you think if money were not an object? Dr. Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think, okay, I think that the foldables and the flippables and all that are interesting. I think  that smartphones have been pretty boring for quite a while. And I applaud any of the companies that  are willing to put their money into new form factors. And I don't think it's a bad idea. I  want to see it in person, though. I'm really sensitive to the touch that like the feel of a  display. Right. And I've had displays. People right. The creases is a potentially a problem.  I've definitely used phones that there was a there was a Motorola phone years ago that had a crack  proof display. And that's because it was a plastic. Was it the turbo? Yeah, the turbo.  For my shattered glass or whatever. Yes, this. Yes. Shatter proof glass or whatever. Right. And  I mean, I appreciated it for what it could do, but there's no way I could live with with the  feeling of that display. It was just like I could never get used to it. And so I worry that with  these foldables, the way they are right now, I'm just going to like going to be too sensitive to  the how it feels. And that might be a deal breaker for me. When do they go? Were they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was it this Friday? They go on? When did they go? They're out. They're out. They're

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  waiting for Valentine's Day. I thought he could get one at the store. Yeah, you could get one  at the store. You could get one of two of them at the store and Valentine. Did he get one? No,  he did not, because he didn't take my advice and send me into San Francisco to buy him one.  He was third in line. So he went and got silly. Leo. Yeah, he just ordered it online and and was

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  basically 30 seconds late. Well, hopefully he gets it soon. I'm really curious to see it in person.  I also think they're just expensive, right? $1500. I don't know. But why I have a problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  paying $1500 for why isn't why isn't people questioning the fact that Samsung put two to five  in a in a location like that, you know, it's what you say, 1500 bucks, the iPhone is how much?  Well, depending on which one. Yeah, you're getting so why is it? How much does Samsung believe in it?  If you know if this is such a scarce product to get, how many did they make? How many did they

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  produce? Good question. I mean, do we know for sure that they didn't throw a bunch of these into

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a carrier store and they just all sold out? Well, have you seen any out any out there other than  in the hands of the big time reviewers? No, I haven't. Daniel Rubino was able to walk into

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Best Buy. But he's still Daniel Rubino. Yeah. But he did just walk into a Best Buy and buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. I'm going to put some boots on the ground. You're gonna get yourself a Z Flip? No, I'm not  getting one. See how many are out there. I had some friends back home ask about it and say,  Hey, what do you think of this phone? I said, have at it if you can find one and no one could find one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See, a couple things aside from the price. I think that they're pushing the edge of the technology  and the products themselves, the materials, I don't think a plastic OLED display that can  ripple or be dented by fingernails the way to go for long term. And granted, this has the  what they call ultra thin glass, but we've already seen a couple reports of, hey, it's peeling  already off of the, you know, off the, oh, I'm sorry, that's the Motorola Razr, isn't it? I  forget which. Yeah, that's the Razr. The Razr is already peeling. Yeah. So there's that whole issue.  But for me, if I'm going to spend that much money, it has to be for... You buy a Chromebook.  No, no. I want it to be a two purpose device. And these small foldables are just smaller phones  that go into like a regular sized phone. That's why the Galaxy Fold is more interesting to me  because it's a phone that could replace a tablet. I still don't think it's the ideal form factor and  size and product material yet, but that's got to be something to take my $1,500. It's got to basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  be two devices for me. Well, Scooter X has found his Z Flip at a local Best Buy online. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's one in the wild. They're out there. Just didn't work for Leo. Yeah. I don't know how  many of these are actually going to sell. So, okay. The fold goes from a phone to a tablet.  The flip goes from a tiny little square into a phone. And then TCL, we talked about this last  night on All About Android, has a prototype that basically rolls from a phone out to a tablet.  So the display kind of falls off the edge of one of the sides. It's like an infinity display,  but it wraps around. And I don't know, it's like a moving mechanism to extend. Mr. Victor said

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's more like the old blinds that you had in the windows. Yeah. They pull and then you let go and  it goes, the shade. I think that was the best description of it. And that's a neat little  innovation and taking advantage of the tech that's out there with the malleable foldable screens. But  I don't know. I don't know long term yet. Yeah. So they're working. I mean, I think my

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  general opinion is I like seeing that there's some innovation happening, whether you want to  call this innovation or not. It's different from what we've been seeing. They also kind of need to  because there has been a pretty big stall in innovation in smartphones. They're all glass  sandwiches. They all look very much the same. Maybe a different number of cameras. It's quadraphonic,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  man. The phone that we would never be able to get the Huawei, is it the Mate that foldable device?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Mate X. That was the one. No, that was the fold out. Right. That one felt really nice at

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  CES. Okay. And the camera on it was pretty slick and the camera features was pretty daggum. That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the one that when it folds, the display is on the outside, right? And it wraps around. It was pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  nice. I'm thinking it looks really thick. Like we'll never get this phone here. It felt good. It  didn't. Okay. No, actually, no, you're right. You're right. I'm thinking I'm thinking of the Royale,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the FlexPai or whatever. Yeah, the old Royale was thick. No, no, this one actually looks really

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  good. This thing, that one, it felt good in the hands and all I, all I could think about is we'll

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  never see it here. Yeah. No, no, probably not. So there's an FBI file on you because you touched it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It captured your fingerprint. No, that's just one more file. They've already got a couple on me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Trust me. Could you see yourself wanting a phone that turns into a tablet? Like is that a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  transformation that you really want? Not really. I do enjoy using the Apple Pencil  for some apps, but I don't necessarily see myself using this even smaller form factor to do that  type of stuff. So no, my phone just needs to be a phone for the most part. You know what I want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what I miss? What do you want, Jeff? I miss my Nexus 7. Why did they give me that Nexus 7?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because it's the same size as a Pixel 4 XL. Word. I love that thing. Yeah. That was a great tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I enjoyed it. Great tablet. Yeah. It's a good size. In its own way, it was pocketable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was. And nobody's ever beat my trio. Wow, the trio, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Going way back. Apparently the Fold 2, the Samsung Galaxy Fold 2 could be launching as early as this  summer. And I think they're going to, it sounds like they're going to stick with the Galaxy Z  as their foldable lineup. So whereas it was the Galaxy Fold, now it would be something like  perhaps a Galaxy Z Fold, that sort of thing. Rebrand, baby. Unify them under the same umbrella.  But that would be this summer ahead maybe, or maybe timed with the Note announcement,  because it was timed with the Note announcement last year. I just assumed they'd be coupled  together again, but that might not happen. Couldn't hurt. But it really does seem like  we're going to see more and more of these. Google has baked in and continues to bake in support into  the Android OS for these dual screen environments. The Z Flip does that thing where you can prop it  up on the table and have your video call on the top and then the controls down the bottom.  Yep. Google said that's a feature that can and will come to other phones. So it's not just a  Samsung exclusive sort of thing that they've figured out with the OS. This is something that  the Android OS can do and will do for other phones as well. So it's a nice feature. I give them that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And that's nice to see because if you think back to when Samsung started pushing the boundaries  of the phone sizes, you know, the phablet era with the first Galaxy Note. So you had a five  inch screen and it was Samsung that was adding all this split screen feature and this feature  and that feature. It wasn't in Android and it took a while. Eventually all that came to Android.  But now it seems like Google is saying let's do this together and make it happen so that way it's  not just a Samsung thing. It's an Android thing and other manufacturers can decide to go foldable  or slide out or whatever they want and have all these features. I think it's great. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree. It'll make the experience a lot more seamless. Samsung happy about that though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't they lose a bit of a beat? I mean they still have their own services that they offer  and they have so many. To be honest, most of their phone sales, I mean they have that, you know,  among the tops in the world in terms of handsets sold, most of them are mid-range or even low-end  because they just the quantity of them. So I don't think they'll be too upset by this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they're actually selling their glass technology to other, their folding glass technology to other  manufacturers as well. Samsung's making bank. Yeah, they make more money selling stuff to  other people than they make making their own phones. Mr. Jarvis, I don't remember your

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  preference regarding the foldable phones. Oh, I made fun of Leo and I said that I'm going to make  fun of him within six months. That's right. That's right. She did. Quadraphonic. I remember now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Quadraphonic. Whatever happened to Quadraphonic?  You're talking about the quad speaker system, right? Is that what you're referring to? Yeah.  Okay. Yes. It evolved into 7.1. Yeah, I suppose so. The Quadraphonic was around a wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now we have one speaker. This little speaker on the table. I remember this guy in the next dorm  room and dorm rooms of course have paper thin walls. They're practically Japanese rooms.  And he had to show off to all the ladies, which there were not many coming into his dorm room.  So he had the four biggest honking huge speakers in this little tiny dorm room.  I had a sweet mate like that too. Oh God, I hated it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had a sweet mate like that too. Our suite was always the party suite apparently,  even though I'm not a party animal. But because he had those giant speakers,  it was always people in our suite. Just so annoying. All I wanted to do was fire up my  toaster oven and a nice pizza and watch TV. Have you watched your TV through those speakers? Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like you were really there. I'm an old enough young man. I went to college without television.  Oh man, how old are you? Old enough to miss my trio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right. All right. Foldables, flippables, rollables, whatever. We'll see what happens.  So how about this? Because I know Jeff, you wrote about this. Google is working on a new news  project where it's willing to pay publishers a licensing fee to take part in their project.  This is according to sources at the Wall Street Journal. It's early at this point. It would be  licensing content to appear in the article says some free Google product. Maybe it already exists,  maybe it doesn't, but that's where this stuff would appear. Publishers have of course wanted  Google to compensate them for Google's use of their news in the past. So this would be kind of,  I don't know if it's a watershed moment, but it's definitely a big shift in direction. Facebook also  made a similar move in this direction last year. But like I said, Jeff, you wrote about this on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Medium. What's your take? Yeah, and counterintuitive a-hole that I am. I regret this. I think there's  a problem with this. I think that Google will rue the day when it paid for any content.  It used to pay for the AP, it's true, but I think this sets a precedent that's going to be difficult.  I think they did it because they were blackmailed by publishers with politicians, especially in  Europe and now in the US around all the regulation and here in the US around 230 and antitrust and  stuff. And Facebook went and decided they were going to pay. And so at Facebook's announcement  of this, Robert Thompson, the head of News Corp under Rupert Murdoch, who's been a bet noir to  all the tech companies and criticizes them, well, he showed up because he had to collect his envelope  and he had to say nice things about Zuckerberg to get his money now. And that's where it is.  And I just worry that the publishers are going to think that this is the latest Messiah that's  going to save them and it's not. There's not enough money here to do that. I worry that they use their  political capital cashing in conflict of interest to get politicians to give them protectionist  regulation and legislation. I worry about who's going to get the money and who's not going to get  the money. So the big old guys will continue to get the money and new insurgent efforts coming in  probably won't. And it'll be hard to get a toehold here in a very competitive marketplace. And so I  think it just delays the inevitable of their burning up into ashes. And so I was very growly  about it. Nobody paid attention to it. Nobody noticed the post. That's fine. Probably would  get me in trouble. But I was actually not in favor. So you're saying I should share this now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that what you're saying? Facebook has done something similar, as I mentioned, like how

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  how has that taken shape? They haven't released it publicly yet. So they have the news tab  and they announced at an event in New York and big players are in on it. But Breitbart is also in it.  And that's right. That got a lot of heat, not only outside the company, but inside the company.  Friends tell me that there was people were not happy about that. And that's the issue is that the  platforms now have to make judgments and make decisions. Now, full disclosure is I raised money  for the school from Facebook for a project that in fact is involved in trying to help the platforms  decide what is quality news. So I'm trying to help with that. I think it's important because  they're going to send attention to it no matter what. I received no money personally from any of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the platforms and their disclosure. I don't know why, but I thought about us previously discussing  news.com K N E W Z.com. That's probably the most hideous site to try to read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's endearing in its own right. I feel like it's ugly, but it's also kind of, I don't know,  there's something that pulls me to it and it's in its ugliness. Turn it down, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, and all of it wasn't Breitbart involved with this as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if they're involved, but it's very Breitbartian. Breitbart was in there. Breitbart's  linked to from there. Yes. In that case, what basically happened is that they are linking to  the New York Times and the New Republic and the Washington Post and the Guardian and all these  commie rags and then they kind of hide behind that so they can also link to Breitbart at all  and then it makes them all seem kind of equal. Do they just curate that stuff, Jeff? Are they

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  paying or publishers getting paid through news.com or whatever? No, they're not. Axel Springer did

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a version of that in Germany where they did pay as far as I know trying to replace Google News,  but those efforts never really worked. Speaking of Europe, they came up with a big  digital plan and I was struck by it because you remind me, Kevin, one of the angles on it was  that now Europe will start its own Google and its own Facebook. How many years have we heard that?  Because they're trying to restrict how data flows outside of the EU but make it flow easier inside  the EU which made me say that they actually do want to collect data, they just don't want  Americans to collect it. On a lighter note, can I suggest something? Please. I just brought the  show down. Please do. I'm going to bring it back up again. Thank you. Down under other, the second  under other, my favorite thing of the week. Wendy is mean. Oh, Wendy. Why you got to be so mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wendy's burgers, of course, or the Wendy's restaurant. Last week we had New Jersey's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wendy is not mean. She is on fleek. Yes. I'm happy you said that, Karsten. Yeah, apparently

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wendy's Twitter feed is going nuts. You go to the Twitter feed and she's calling everybody out left,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right and center. There's a report that Burger King is going to have a, is testing a sandwich  with nothing but french fries inside to which Wendy said when literally anything would be better  on a bun than their beef. Oh, but you know there's probably some truth to that. Burger King posted a  picture of the Burger King, which is the creepiest thing to say. Saying roses, red violets or blue  patties are round trying to get at Wendy's. Wendy's did not miss a beat and came back and said,  look to drop by to see what spicy nuggets were supposed to taste like. Spicy. Hey, this is the  worst one. Picture from a woman on Twitter. Two guys with a dumpster outside of McDonald's with  face masks on. Wendy's, what do you think they're doing here? Wendy's replies, picking up their order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is great. I like this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But, but, but, and I don't want to get into like  political stuff because that's like something I don't really discuss in general. Neither do I.  But it's like this whole normalization of just being a Twitter troll now. I mean, it's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Brand Twitter has very much followed Wendy's examples and has become a very interesting place

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for a very interesting sub segment of Twitter. They realize they don't need to be polite anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They get more attention when they exactly Mr. Jarvis. Mr. Jarvis in your day when  you were being printed, you know, regularly, do you, do you remember seeing ads like this  where a company would call out, you know, Wendy's would call out a McDonald's, you know, buying an  ad space like that in our market. We would say they sub tweeted that was sub tweaking. Well,  where's the beef? Yeah. But what about just examples? They were calling out a specific

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right brand, which is what ants ask. They wouldn't say, Hey, McDonald's, where's the beef?  Right. Right. I don't think they would ever say it like that anyway.  I'm from Jersey. Was that Jeff or Joey talking to us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. I like picturing the Wendy's Wendy saying that, Hey, McDonald's, where's the beef?  Chomping on a cigar. Yeah. Where's the beef? Yeah. You.  It doesn't look mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We are these trolls, but you're right, Kevin. Exactly. What I was thinking too is that it has  normalized it for everybody. It's a really good point. And last week we did the story of the  New Jersey Twitter feed, the official NJ.gov Twitter feed, which since then the New York Times  did a big feature on them. I'm sure because they heard about it on on Twi. Of course. And  it's not as bad as Wendy's, but it still has SAS. Yeah. That one being the primary one. Someone says,  who let New Jersey have a Twitter? And New Jersey official account responded, your mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's it's funny though, but it is funny, but it's yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't like where all this is heading. Yeah. I had not considered the whole normalization

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of Twitter trolling. I mean, that's yeah, it's a really good point. It's a very, very fair point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. The NJ account is handled by two women, one in her 30s, one in her 20s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they just have fun with it. Yeah. At least somebody's having fun on social media. On Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So last week they had a stunning video from the Jersey Shore and the tweet read armpit what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People use Jersey to be an armpit. That's purely because of the shape of the state, though. Not  not any any other connotations. That's the only reason I think we're getting Karsten's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  psychological Rorschach test here. We just learned something about I don't see it, Karsten. How is  that? I see a mouth eating Staten Island. What I see. It's more of an elbow, actually. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you know, Jersey, the Perth Amboy there and Staten Island, that that's kind of armpitish the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  bay sort of looks more like a paramecia. Watch it fell off. I grew up in Jersey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My wife's from Jersey. Hey, you're not gonna be let back in from Jersey. You from for you.  No more wall for you. I missed I missed I missed the most I'm kicking myself because I wasn't fast  enough on my camera today. I missed a moment that could have gone viral. Oh, really? New York  subway. And there was bagel rat. Oh, really? Had a whole half a bagel and I missed it. I cried. I  got a blurry picture. I missed it. I'm just kicking myself. I could have been famous. This is this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  is where Google Glass had the advantage, man. Yeah, so true. So I'll always be recording. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't say that loudly. Hey, you know, that's actually a good transition into one of the stories  in here. Yeah, sort of tangentially. Sure. Google is apparently, according to the information,  they wrote an article about how Google is lagging behind Apple and Facebook in the augmented reality  race. Apparently, employees in Google's AR VR division are demoralized, according to a couple  of reports anyways, from inside the company in light of Google's cutting of the daydream  VR efforts. Of course, Google got rid of its daydream program. No more VR coming from Google.  Total about face there and haven't really been seeing a whole lot around AR either. Things have  kind of settled. Is it lagging behind when you don't care to compete? Well, and I think that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  kind of one of the questions, right? Is Microsoft lagging behind on the smartphone race? They just  didn't care. They had other things that they worried about. Maybe so. Yeah. I mean, Apple and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook both have big projects in this area, in the works. I think how this ties into Google Glass  when I was thinking about this, I was like, well, Google was there pretty darn early compared to  anyone. Google Glass was a product ahead of its time. I don't know if it's true augmented reality,  but I mean, it kind of is. It's the same kind of concept. So I don't know. I'm just curious  if they should be further along considering they had such a big jump over the competition.  Or should, yeah, maybe they don't care. Maybe they're just like, yeah, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Man, we're just trying to sell ads. That's it. Before we write them off,  before we write them off, on the Chromium blog, I don't have this link in here, but I remembered  that Chrome 81 was announced on the Chromium blog last week, the 13th. And Chrome 81 includes near  field communications and augmented reality, web-based augmented reality. They have a picture  there, a screenshot of it. So it's at blog.chromium.org if we can go over there.  Yeah, here I'll put it in the doc chat. So it seems like, okay, maybe they're not doing  wearable type products for ARVR right now. Maybe they're getting out of that market,  but they're expanding it to a much wider scope of devices if it's web-based.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true. Yeah, maybe they're not focused on the hardware specifically. They're focused more  on the software-based approach. B2B kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kevin tried to subtly cue you that Google Glass never actually went away.  That's true. Enterprise Edition 2 just came out about six months ago and is still being worked on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Developers can buy it now. It's about $1,000 or $1,100 a set. If you're a developer,  you can get Google Glass 2. Nope, not doing it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nope. You learned your lesson.  I learned my lesson. It is not for you.  You can fool me once. They say in the name Enterprise Edition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, right. It is for the enterprise.  The prescription lenses. It's not a consumer product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, Jeff, that Galaxy Chromebook is an Enterprise Edition device too, just so you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just kidding. I tried to save beef for myself, are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, you do you. It's all good. Yeah, it's all good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dang, you can't get it now, Jeff. It's enterprise. You can't get it anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not enterprise. I'm just me. Just little old me.  So on Twitter, I just put up Subway Wrap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you mean your blurry photo of Subway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not great. It's not great, but it is Subway Wrap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay. Logging in.  Bagel Wrap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought you drew it because you didn't get the picture you said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Holy cow. Bagel Wrap.  Okay.  Bagel Wrap.  Bagel Wrap. There's Bagel Wrap. That's a bagel.  Oh, oh, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And he's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you kind of got there.  A little bit of a...  It's cute how it prances away like that.  I appreciate your efforts.  We need AI to enhance that image and show us that it really is a bagel in its mouth  and that it really is a rat. It's kind of hard to see either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It might have a rat mask on from the virus thing.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's a thing. That's dad.  It's got to be a picture of mom, bagel, rat somewhere out there.  Let's see here. Google is killing, shutting down its...  Was it Station? I believe is what it's called.  Yeah, I think it's called that.  Station program. This is something that they've had in place since 2016.  It offered free Wi-Fi in 5,000 locations worldwide.  Brazil, South Africa, Nigeria, Thailand, Philippines, Mexico, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam.  Basically, the scale had become too difficult, less sustainable.  Google has decided to kill the project.  They also said that 4G proliferation is kind of making it a little bit less necessary.  Business is business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the carriers that are in those areas are actually going to take over some of those  Wi-Fi stations.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's win-win, sounds like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's good. Although I'm sure this will be added to kiltbygoogle.com sometime soon.  If it's not there already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We see something getting resurrected from the graveyard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, nice transition.  I tried.  Yes, thank you for the assist.  Bookbot was a Google project. It was a 20% project that apparently picked up,  I hadn't heard of this before today, had picked up library books from homes and returned them to  the Mountain View Library.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've seen images or renderings of this a couple of years ago or whatever,  but I didn't know this was a Google thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think there have been different delivery robots.  This was created, it began the pilot early 2019 and then ended in June with no real explanation  as to why. They were just testing it apparently.  It seems like a couple of Google engineers have now broken out and created a company called  Kartken, which is seemingly going to be bringing back a robot that does something very similar  to this. I don't know if it's the same engineers. They're like, hey, well, Google's not going to do  it. We're going to do it. You never know. You might use your robot to return your library books or  other things. I imagine the delivery is not just isolated to the library books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess this is just their side hustle while working at Google essentially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually don't know. Maybe they've left Google to form this company or I don't know if  they're still working at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Our kids have got to have a lot of library finds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, right. This is a really important problem to solve. I don't think it's isolated to library  books. They say low cost delivery through automation aiming at the last mile delivery.  So that sounds pretty broad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sure. Bagel deliveries to rats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rats got to get their bagels somehow. Might as well be robots.  Does anybody use the bookmobile anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not a rat.  Okay.  We stand corrected, Mr. Kevin. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Breaking news.  Bagel life.  I have breaking news. I just saw it come across my feed. I just put it in the rundown. I put it under  other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay. Let's see here. Breaking news. Oh, wow. This looks really important.  Mark Zuckerberg reportedly gets his armpits blow dried before speeches.  No! Stop the presses.  Doesn't everybody?  I blow dry my armpits before I do this week in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, wouldn't that make them sweat more because it gets hot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I guess I use the Dyson hand dryers in the bathrooms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you do that? The ones where you put your hands in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure.  Have you seen how tall Mr. Toffol is?  Yeah. I'm about three foot six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're talking about the ones like on the walls that's like the big you and you put your hands in  there, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, the Dyson Airblades. I mean, you get both pits at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was picturing the hand dryers from bathrooms. That's like a giant you.  And I just don't know how that works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, that I used to dry my feet after a shower.  Oh, that makes sense.  Put my feet in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  I sense something coming up for Kickstarter. I can see the airport dryer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The chat room's already on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There it is. Right where Staten Island is. I'm telling you. That's the armpit.  That's so funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, okay. So this is part of a book. Okay. So this is an actual like,  this is an actual fact from a book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is Levy's book. There's stuff getting leaked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The title is Facebook, the Inside Story. And so apparently it's really inside.  By Steven Levy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he's been he's been with he's been embedded with them for like a year and a half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So he's been watching as as Zuckerberg blow dries his armpits.  Hey, you do what you got to do when you're when you're a man of of Zuckerberg's stature.  And I'll fill up the pages for something.  Yeah.  Uh, okay. Should we do the change log?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I need to get out of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, let's do the change log.  Oh, there we go.  We got a lot in the change log this week.  Let's see here though. This could also be added to killed by Google.  Alphabet is killing McConney, which was founded in 2006.  It was spun out of X into its own unit.  This is the project that was designing kites that were made to capture wind energy  for renewable electricity.  Kind of cool looking like mechanical type kites that were capturing wind energy.  Anyways, Google says it's not commercially viable.  And so they will be killing the project.  I think if you scroll down, there might be a picture of one of those things in the air.  This was one of their number projects.  Yeah. Yeah.  Interesting project, but not commercially viable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was a Larry and Sergey.  I think we're going to see more of these things dying from the Larry and Sergey years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, probably so.  Pachycyn, get this crap out of here.  Is that what's happening right now?  You're doing what?  Get this crap out of here.  Wind kites? No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've got bigger fish to fry.  Search widget doodles are now coming to more phones than just pixels.  If you have a pixel phone, you may have noticed your search widget  has these little doodle animations that appear on certain days and stuff.  Now that's not just a pixel only feature.  In fact, it launched on Valentine's Day on a number of other phones outside of the pixel family.  So you'll see little animations in that Google search bar down at the bottom like that one,  although it'll be moving because it's an animation and not a picture.  So pretty interesting sort of kind of.  Stadia, a couple of pieces of news around Stadia.  First of all, if you bought the if you were an early adopter and you bought the Founders Edition,  you know that it came with it.  It included a three month membership with the Pro service,  which is the only service that Stadia offered at that launch at that early launch.  Those free those pro tiers are about to end.  So those three months were almost at the end of that.  When that happens, Google has announced that their free service tier will go into effect  for all those folks unless they choose to pay for the pro service.  And basically what that means is the pro tier offers, you know, higher quality streaming.  I you know, certain games that are added to the library.  So if you end up going to be down to the free tier,  those games that were included with pro will be removed from your library.  You'll be limited to 1080p streaming, which is the upper end of the free tier for Stadia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mine ended today and I unsubscribed last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, OK, good.  You got you got right in there.  So you got the Founders Edition.  Do you play it regularly or what do you think about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I did a lot over the break in between semesters.  But now that schools back in, it's been five weeks of school.  I barely had time to touch it.  Yeah, I did purchase about five games, all of them at a discount.  So those I still have access to and the free games.  It was nice to have, but that's OK.  I just don't have time to play.  So I'd rather not pay for it.  And it's OK.  They don't have 4K.  I'm not a big gamer.  I plan a switch sometimes.  You know, I play on a phone.  I'll play on a Chromebook.  I don't need 4K.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  1080p is great, especially for free.  And if you've already got the games in your library, that's awesome.  Maybe at a certain time you have more time on your hands or you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then I just re-up the $10 a month.  And I don't know if the pro games then come back.  That's what I'm curious about because I claimed them.  They're not in my library now, but would they reappear?  I don't know.  That's a good question.  Good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'd imagine if you claim them, then they would reappear.  I would hope so anyways.  All right.  Well, also if you don't have a Pixel phone, you won't be left out of the party, apparently.  Stadia is coming to more than just Pixel phones now.  They've added support for Galaxy S8 through current Galaxy S phones.  Razor phones, both versions of the Razor phone, both versions of the Asus ROG.  Republic of Gamers.  I could never get that right.  There's like four different ways I could say that and I get it wrong every single time.  So all those phones as well.  So Stadia is opening up and I'm sure soon we'll start seeing more news around other people being  allowed in because I think it's still kind of isolated to the founders, right?  Yep.  So I'm assuming very soon we'll see like Google opens it up for everyone and then we'll see if  people care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I still just want to see that succeed just because of the cost and giving  people more, giving more people the opportunity to play high-level, high-quality games.  I just don't see it working just yet because of all of the infrastructure issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  Has your kind of quality experience been okay, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's been quite good.  It was a little sketchy at first and it also depended on the game.  So it may depend on which game you're playing.  And I know some games recently like Red Dead Redemption 2 just got some type of  graphical upgrade from the publisher.  So the graphics actually look better as far as glitches or anything because of the bandwidth.  I haven't had really any issues very, very rarely.  So I've been happy with it.  There are times you cannot tell you're not playing on a console.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice.  And then latency is the other potential downfall.  I think that probably relates more to certain different types of games than others because  I tried playing Mortal Kombat, whatever the most recent version of Mortal Kombat is.  Thank you, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm old and I play video games.  The gamer knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, Kevin.  Mortal Kombat 11, I tried playing that on the stadia and it just kind of felt  felt almost detached, like there was just enough fast moving action that the buttons  didn't seem to line up very well.  So it's probably different types of games that work better for that sort of thing.  Google announced GameSnacks from its Area 120 Incubator.  These are HTML5 based browser games that Google's offering for older devices,  for budget devices, devices that have-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A little work on my trio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a good question.  You should bust out that trio and see.  I mean, it's HTML5.  I don't think the trio, I don't think HTML5 was a thing.  Is there WAP5?  Whoa.  Probably not, I'm thinking, Jeff.  But if you have an Android device that has minimal processing power, minimal memory-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not me, because Kevin knows I only buy the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They probably won't be playing these.  These are really designed to work in really poor network conditions on lower end devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does it work offline or is it just, that's what I wondered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it says on any network.  So I think you have to be online in order to download it, in order to load the page.  And then I imagine, I would guess that it would work at that point.  It would be all loaded up.  Self-contained.  Yeah, I would imagine so.  But you got to be connected to load it for the first time.  Let's see here.  Google launched a cloud region in Seoul.  It's its first in the South Korean market.  Customer base includes Samsung, LG Electronics, SK Telecom, and a few others.  It's competing with a cloud vendor space in the area along with Alibaba, Huawei, AWS.  So this is potentially a big move for Google and its cloud efforts.  And then finally-  The big one.  I'm happy with this one.  Ant was indifferent last night on all about Android.  I imagine either both of you or one of you will be pretty excited about this.  9to5 Google torn down the latest version of Gmail for Android.  And they are finding that inboxes bundles might actually be coming soon or around the corner.  Essentially, they're integrating this with labels in Gmail to the point to where Gmail  will be able to automatically decide that this email coming in belongs in the travel label.  Why don't they just damn keep inbox?  That ship has sailed.  I agree, but that ship has sailed.  I don't see that coming back anytime soon.  Coral reef growing on it.  Yeah, exactly.  But if they can integrate bundle-like features into Gmail well enough, then I'll be pretty happy  because that's my one big annoyance with Gmail is just all the manual maintenance I have to do  on setting up filters.  And it was just so nice to grab that email, drag it over into the bundle that I wanted to go.  That's manual?  Well, it is.  But when I did that in inbox, then it would give me a pop-up and it would say,  do you want all messages from this person or like this to go there?  And be like, yeah, that's what I want.  Okay, so you dragged-  And I don't have to think about it anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You dragged and dropped one time.  That was a manual effort.  You can create one filter for that same-  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So go up to the menu, pull down filter, open up the thing, do the little search term,  hit search, find all the things, make sure it's showing me the right things,  then click yes, apply to all and also apply this label and remove from my inbox and go.  That's like 10 different things I had to do versus dragging it over once and saying yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At least it's not Outlook.  I don't know, last time I used Outlook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's been a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Outlook on mobile is pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've heard that it's good.  I hated Outlook.  That was way back in the days, exchange days.  I hated Outlook.  It was so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We use it for school and I'm surprised at how really clean and good it is.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Microsoft's doing some pretty good apps for Android.  So I'm not surprised about that at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exchange server and Active Directory.  I, oh gosh, I couldn't stand it.  Never worked right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that is the Google Change Log.  All right.  Bombastic.  Any last bits before we get into tips, tricks and numbers and all that?  I mean, we already talked about Zuckerberg's armpits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're welcome.  I bring such a high tone to the show.  I appreciate that.  What would you do without the old guy?  I appreciate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm scanning through.  Oh, Jeff Bezos with his 130.  Billion dollar net worth is creating the Bezos Earth Fund.  Ten billion dollars to a global initiative.  His largest philanthropic effort so far.  And that's good news, right?  Some people are taking him to task saying, oh, he needs to get more money.  But I mean, it's not their money.  Like it's his money.  There's a lot of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You care to touch on the Susan Wojcicki story about YouTube paying three billion dollars  to the music industry?  You know, I didn't get a chance to read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they argue that they've done that with the news industry and the music industry.  Then people say, oh, all the money goes to Google.  Google keeps saying, no, no, no, we pay a lot back out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She had a blog.  I got a story.  It was.  What was that, Mr. Jarvis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I said I have a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mr. Jarvis with a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's an obnoxious item.  I put it up.  It's the UK High Court.  Let me explain the story.  So a former cop tweeted some unwoak things about the discussion now about about gender  fluidity.  It wasn't definitely woke, but it wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a discussion.  Oh, this is an official document.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, yes.  So then a police officer came to the tweeter and said, according in according to the tweeters  sworn statement that the police officer said, I need to check your thinking.  Oh, and the tweeter replied, so let me get this straight.  I've committed no crime.  You're a police officer and you need to check my thinking.  This officer had said, yes.  Oh, boy.  Tweeter said, have you any idea what that makes you?  1984 is a dystopian novel, not a police training manual.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this case went up through the courts and then the high court ruled in favor of the  tweeter and started off by quoting Animal Farm from George Orwell.  If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not  want to hear.  And at a time when the UK is debating how to deal with and I quote harmful content,  this is I'm sorry, but this becomes a preview of what we're going to see.  And I always emphasize these moments.  I'm a Kamala Harris Democrat in mourning.  I'm going to sound like a libertarian right now, but I stand for freedom of expression.  And this kind of stuff scares me when authorities take up their job and to check  people on their legal thoughts and to bring the force of law down upon them.  So I just wanted to raise this next time I scream moral panic on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  Sorry, I did not get a chance to read through this, but you can't read the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's why I knew I would have to summarize it for you, but it's pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no.  I mean, that's that's very worried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  His tweets were his tweets were not woke.  Let's be honest.  But, you know, it was a discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, that that reminds me of another article actually that's in here.  Let me see here scrolling up to Google.  Where is it?  The Australian Court.  So in Australia, an anonymous Google user left a bad review for a dental surgeon's business,  urged people to stay away, called the procedure extremely awkward and uncomfortable,  which I mean, I feel like that's a valid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This was Leo's addition to the doc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a valid view of someone's experience is that it was extremely awkward and uncomfortable.  Maybe it actually was.  The doctor got a judge in Australia to rule that he could pursue defamation  and insist Google hand over identifiable details as a result of that.  That's defamation.  Really?  Well, apparently, according to this judge in Australia, they'll argue that there's real harm.  I mean, yeah.  So, you know, is that suppression of important information as a result?  I mean, maybe his experience was bad.  Right.  And of course, the doctor would not want someone to know if the experience was bad,  or someone would not want others to know that.  Doesn't mean they shouldn't have the right to tell people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You leave a bad review.  The establishment normally gets back and says, hey, we're sorry.  What can we do to make this bad review better or right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A good establishment would, yes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are a lot of people that have come after Yelp and Google and various other reviewers  for similar things to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, I don't know.  But that's an Australian court.  Who knows how that reaches into other jurisdictions.  But kind of interesting.  And especially just reading the review, being like, all right, this feels kind of valid to me.  If I had a really bad experience with a dentist, I would probably be pretty emphatic about,  this happened, I didn't like it, I would recommend you don't see this person, whatever.  You have every right to share that.  I would imagine so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Until you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess the difference is because this is trackable and being on the internet versus just  telling your three or four neighbors in your neighborhood your experience in person, if you will.  Right.  Wow.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, our libel laws are different than UK and Australia.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  Well, I think we've done it.  All the news.  Every single piece of news from the last week, we've already talked about it.  So, if we didn't talk about it, it didn't happen.  It's just not worth talking about.  Yes.  It just isn't.  Let's do some picks.  Starting with you, Jeff, what's your number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, what should I do here?  Okay.  So, numbers regarding Twitch.  So, I didn't know that, you know, I saw something about Twitch having a  chief revenue officer coming to speak at an event in New York.  I thought, Twitch, revenue?  Oh, yeah.  It makes a lot of money.  So, as we talk about Facebook taking over the world, Google taking over the world,  of course, don't forget that Amazon is poised to take over the world.  They bought it in 2014 for $1.1 billion.  Its market share of streaming, however it's defined, these kinds of streaming things, is 61%.  A space including YouTube gaming, Facebook gaming, Microsoft Mixer,  with shares of 28, 9, and 3%, respectively.  3.4 million monthly broadcasters, 15 million daily users.  And so, the argument here is that it's poised to rake in, this is for motley fools,  so they're trying to look at, you know, what stocks to buy,  poised to rake in billions, I tell you, billions.  Billions of dollars.  Amazon does not disclose, of course, one report from the information estimates Twitch ad sales  estimated at $230 million in 2018, $300 million last year, but those fall short of the company's  target of $500-600 million in ad revenue for 2019.  We'll see.  So, I think Twitch is one of those things, because I'm too damn old,  because I still like my trio, and I'm not cool like Kevin and play games in all these new  fangled cloud game thing ways that I don't get.  So, I don't understand, I'm too old to understand Twitch, but I keep on ignoring it too much.  I think it's too much of a force out there, so this is just a good reminder.  How many people watch the podcasts of this dear enterprise on Twitch?  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know the answer to that question.  Do you have any ideas on that, Carson?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know the numbers for that, but it is definitely one of our biggest channels for live  streaming.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are there people who, it'd be interesting to have like a science,  Mystery Science Theater 3000, somebody narrating, watching Twitch.  Oh, boy.  Oh, Leo, you always say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're giving away a really good money-making opportunity to some  enterprising fan out there.  We need to set this up right now.  Yeah, it'll be our second channel.  It'll be like our MTV2 where we just have a staffer sit in front of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't do that.  That's when MTV went downhill.  Yes, it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, all right.  Don't do that.  We'll have live streams of Apple events and then live stream that to...  Yes.  Okay.  Right.  Yeah, so on Twitch TV1, we will actually do the live coverage of the Apple event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On Twitch TV2, we will do live coverage of the live coverage of the Apple event  in a Mystery Science Theater 3000 sort of way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't quite get his point that he was making there.  Doesn't look like Leo got it either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, it's not about what they're talking about.  Apple's talking about it all.  That's on Twitch 1.  Right.  Twitch 2 is entirely about how we're doing.  Got it.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I see Ant didn't iron his clothes today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What does the shirt say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, exactly.  See?  I think there's something to be to explore here.  Kevin, what's your thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So since I am taking a HTML, CSS, and JavaScript class,  I've been coming across some very interesting projects that use those technologies and sharing  them with my classmates.  And my pick is one that I'm going to share with you guys that I shared with them last week.  It's literally a game that was built by somebody who has only been studying  web design for three months.  And it's the most insanely addictive and difficult game.  I'm shocked that they put it together after just three months of learning how to program.  But you have to see this game because apparently it is kind of replicating the vision test in Spain  when you go for driver's license.  And I cannot confirm that because I'm not from Spain.  I've never been.  But I'm like, oh, this doesn't sound too hard.  Guide a little dot around a zigzagging road.  But there's two dots and two rows and you control them independently.  That's awesome.  And it makes this annoying honking sound when you get out of your lane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, God, this is really hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's hard to do with two different dots, two fingers and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I hear you.  I hear you.  But I thought that it's amazing that somebody with just three months of experience learning  out of code for the web was able to do that.  That's really impressive to me.  He didn't make Donkey Kong.  I thought the same thing when I saw that.  Rejected.  I learned how to make Donkey Kong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dang, I need better reflexes.  My coordination test failed.  Great.  Now I'm going to have to play that more.  Get 100 percent.  Good luck.  Yeah, good luck, Ryan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can step away from your developer preview to play the game.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and it works on trios as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, good.  You're welcome, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, my God, I'm scared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And quick, what you got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a great resource from one of my friends at Adobe.  Mr. Jason Levine is the principal worldwide evangelist of Premiere Pro and audio at Adobe.  And I learned a lot from him as far as editing audio and just going through Adobe Audition  and Premiere Pro.  And he has a free playlist on his own personal YouTube channel, even though he's an Adobe guy.  But this is his own stuff.  So he speaks quite freely, I should say, from time to time in some of his videos about the  process and so forth.  But he does a really good job of breaking down the ins and outs of properly editing  audio for your videos or just mixing for your music if you're trying to put an album together.  And it's a really, really good course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's great.  So let's see here.  So it's a whole series of videos, a whole playlist all around.  And this is Adobe Audition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's all Adobe Audition, but he explains it in the fundamental values because you can still  put this in another.  Was it Pro Tools?  Yeah, yeah.  You can still apply it to Pro Tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right on.  Love it.  Yeah, some of those fundamentals are really hard to understand.  Like compression is one thing that people have a really hard time with.  So if you get someone who knows how to explain it and kind of show off the fundamentals of that,  it goes a long way.  Yeah, totally.  My tool is, well, it's an upcoming tool.  I figured I would just use this opportunity to promote my new show.  Because it kind of falls in line with tools and tips and all that stuff.  It launches tomorrow with episode one.  It's called Hands on Android.  And really, it's just meant to be tips, tricks, explainers, kind of deep dives into just the  different facets of Android.  And hopefully, it can kind of take you from Android novice to Android doer, Android pro,  whatever you want to call it.  And so tomorrow's episode is episode one.  It's a focus on digital well-being, kind of the tools and functions of digital well-being  and how you can use it to kind of craft your time with your smartphone.  If I was nimble enough, I would have episode one be about an Android 11 preview that just  announced this morning.  But there's no way to get it recorded and edited in time for tomorrow.  So that's not going to happen.  You know you accept that challenge.  A deeper analysis will occur.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But that's my hope also with this show.  My plan with it is to have it be the platform to do deep dives into things like a new OS update,  that sort of stuff, to be able to show those features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twitch.tv slash hoa.  Hoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  HOA for hands on Android.  It's going to be great, dude.  Yeah.  Starts tomorrow.  So I'm very excited about that.  OK, mazel.  Awesome.  Thank you.  But that is it for this week's show.  This week in Google is all is finito.  It's finished and could not have done it without you three gentlemen.  So thank you so much for hopping on.  Good job.  Kevin Toffle, thank you for taking some time to hang out with us about Chromebook.  Aboutchromebooks.com is the website that people can go to follow all of your musings about  Chromebooks, right?  That is correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And thanks for having me.  I appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Aboutchromebooks and about code that he finds.  You can't leave that out because he always posts about little snippets of code that he finds too.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Aboutchromebooks.com.  And then Jeff Jarvis, buzzmachine.com.  Anything else you want to throw out there before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't decide.  Pixel 5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Another GIF opportunity for anyone who's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I know Mr. Kevin has it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, Jeff.  Always so much fun doing the show with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pixel 5 imitation.  That's right.  Well done, Kevin.  Well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, Jeff.  And thank you, Ant.  Always fun doing the show next to you here.  Twitter.tv slash hop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Slash hop, baby.  Focus, not focus.  Handsome photography.  Handsome photography.  We tweet that.  TV slash hop.  Good old tips and tricks.  A little bit of tutorials going through Lightroom Photoshop and showing you how to use those tools.  And tomorrow's episode is going to be another fun one.  Building upon some of the stuff that we've talked about previously.  Because that's how you learn.  You build, you build, you build.  Practice and build.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Practice and build.  And you can kind of see there's a little bit of a theme with our shows recently, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh no, seems like something about hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Having hands on things, on technology.  Yeah, it's kind of a theme.  Seems like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to do the show, hands off the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In parentheses, techno panic.  Moral panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bring back my printing press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right on.  Thank you, Karsten.  Thank you, Kevin.  Thank you, Jeff.  Thank you, Chaz.  Yeah, thank you, Chatroom.  Thank you, everyone, for watching.  This has been a lot of fun.
