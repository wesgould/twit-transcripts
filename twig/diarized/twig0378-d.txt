Transcript:  I get home, and there is my one of my thank you Hillary Clinton magnets sitting there finally got here. Yeah, it's a little late  But you know that refrigerator wasn't gonna vote for her anyway that one night that could have made a difference man that one

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just to reassure you well, maybe I won't reassure you if you're tuning in and saying well  I hope they talk about Google we will but I think we have  We have to talk a little bit about the election  But I think what we're gonna do is talk about it and the lessons of the election and talk about it in context with Silicon  Valley actually  Starting with and I bet you this is what the PBS NewsHour wants you to talk about Jeff Jarvis  Silicon Valley's reaction. This is the Wall Street Journal's piece today  Silicon Valley braces for uncertainty after Trump's victory there are wins and losses for Silicon Valley on the one hand  Donald Trump called for a boycott of Apple because they didn't hand over the phone in the San Bernardino case  And wants Apple to bring all of its manufacturing back to the United States on the other hand  It's Amazon and Jeff Bezos doesn't like the Washington Post and as a result doesn't like Jeff or Amazon very much and has promised  Antitrust action against Amazon, but on the other hand says  But we do want their companies to repatriate all their money Apple would love to bring its billions back  So would Amazon Microsoft Google yeah, and one proposal  It's very hard the hardest thing is to figure out what Trump's proposals were for instance on the h1b visa  He went back and forth and back and forth, but it does seem that at least on his website  He proposed a 10% tax rate for repatriated money. Yeah, which I think Tim Cook would like to do  They want to get that money back in the US. It'd be good for our economy billions of dollars  It would be spent on R&D and acquisitions  hires  Now whether he wants to amend the tax code so that the rent so the new money doesn't go out of the United States  I don't know. I think  This is the I think this is the big problem. I don't know. Yeah is the answer to a lot of these questions

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm less concerned about  benefits or penalties for  multi-billion dollar corporations that I am about Silicon Valley's role in  in  providing these free speech  Trump has talked about the cyber a lot and he has said he wants to close the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Trump Trump does not really understand technology very well  He I guess he'll be looking to his son Baron for he doesn't use a computer doesn't use a computer uses  iPhone very well, however, he's a no an Android phone. No Android. That's right. He's certainly Twitter aware. Yeah  he though has  He said he's not in favor of net neutrality  He says he he says  He doesn't have an official position but he this is the journal writing he expressed displeasure with the FCC's open internet order by tweeting  I'm telling you we're reading the tweet leaves at this point Obama's attack on the internet is another top-down power grab net neutrality is the  Fairness doctrine will target  Conservative what media I know I know  That's why we don't really know what he thinks and I don't think he knows what he thinks  one thing though an interesting quote from  Aaron Levy the chief executive officer of box  Calm and we should say a Clinton supporter  You don't want innovation to happen in isolation  He says and have people just deal with that disruption without having a plan in a world where government and technology are sort of acting in  Isolation in other words if Trump doesn't do anything  Pro or con for Silicon Valley what we're gonna get is negative consequences from disruption in other words government  Should be levy thinks planning for the inevitable disruption that new technologies are gonna offer  Yeah, and and figure out ways to keep people in working and so forth

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, look it's very it's very instructive look at the stock market because there you know much time  Oh, it's gonna. It's gonna implode. It's gonna implode and last night the futures are down there  They were down because people had the wrong bets on the market and  They had to they had to deal with the shorts they had the long as they had and figure that out  And today the stock market was up to 56  Why because this is somebody who's going to reduce taxes on companies as much as possible companies gonna be happy if if it's for companies  Then that's you can presume. That's what he'll do. Yeah, I think unless it's a company

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He doesn't like well the h1b visa is an interesting one because of course he's campaigned on  an immigrant anti-immigrant  Platform the h1b visa is a visa that allows  foreign workers to come and work for tech companies tech companies want this expanded they want more foreign workers, right  When questioned on it, I'm not sure he even understood what the program was, but he said that he wanted to  Encourage he said the problem was you have people coming to universities in the United States getting skills and leaving  Yes, that is a problem and he wants to keep them in the United States  But he also said he wants to raise the wages of h1b workers to a point where it doesn't undermine  The American workers who could do the same job. They're not cheaper than American workers in other words, which is actually sounds  Sensible Silicon Valley says we can't get enough high-tech workers with the skills. We need we have to  Bring in overseas workers using h1b visa that has has been abused Disney used it for instance to bring in lots of workers  They had the American  IT professionals train these workers and then fired him

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, what kind of visa did his current wife get once she finally got it who we seen that reported?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now Jeff, you've got to stop fighting these old battles

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're not the elections over. No. No. No, I tweeted David Farron hold of the Washington Post last night  And I just said please don't stop  Oh  No, no, we have to we didn't get enough coverage of his character and his history  One way or the other by God, there's gonna be some wonderful Edward Snowden somewhere  Oh, we gotta bring that up to some wonderful Edward Snowden somewhere who?  Will reveal at peril his taxes, you know, we got it. We got to go for transparency for this lady is elected

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What does it matter what his taxes are the only thing?  For his because you'll be an all right, man, well, that's what that's where I'm headed  So I mean, I think at this point it would be a good thing to say he's the president  It will be the president January 20th. Let's give him the benefit of the doubt and let's  Hope that he does a great job when he stopped what if he doesn't then we can protest we can take to the streets  But until then he hasn't done anything. Yeah, we know his campaign rhetoric. That's campaign rhetoric. So so

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've been thinking about this for a couple months, you know  What if this could happen because I believe it could  For some time and and I've been trying to get my head around this notion of resistance right as we believe and he did not  We believe in an orderly transfer of power  Hillary Clinton did the right thing Barack Obama did the right thing in spades  They they they were elegant and and and graceful and they've done the absolute right thing and and that is right  And yes, we do have a transfer of power and I'm not going to question legitimacy  of the office  Fine. However, let's say this guy just for the sake of argument goes out and starts rounding up little children and sending them back to Mexico

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What does resistance look like in that kind of work we could cross that bridge when we come to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, well, but I think it's no I think it's something that we you want to start because because the lines are there  What what is still respectful of the office but respects the law so I I can't this is an off-the-rack session

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Being being a patriot means also protesting something you don't agree with  What took to the streets marched carried signs I I mean I that doesn't mean you have to agree with everything he does

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I he hasn't done anything yet. One of the great ironies of this election, which which is radically under under discussed  Which is the whole immigration issue?  Trump has hinted that he wants to deport  illegal immigrants and  Mexico has had things to say about that people say they're gonna move to Canada if he does that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Both Canada the Canada immigration website down all that's nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Both Canada and Mexico deport illegal immigrants as a matter of practice and policy  So do we and I think that the the perfect  The perfect immigration system for Trump to emulate is in fact Canada's  Because Canada what Canada does is they cherry-pick immigrants their h1b visa program is is their whole immigration policy, right?  they basically say we want the best and the brightest from all over the world to come in all of them and  Everybody else not so not so, you know, yes a few a few that by the way is a knee-jerk reaction

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe not knee-jerk. It's a reaction to Canada's open immigration policy of about 30 years ago  Yes, Canada is a very diverse as you know, Toronto. Yes is a very that's to China town  Yes, very diverse nation because they had open immigration and then there was they had what was called a green paper

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah, but but you know, it's it's on this Canada is a is a  exemplary democracy, however, it has to be said that the  immigration policy that Trump has been raked over the coals for is  Canada's immigration policy right the best and the brightest so best and brightest and deport the illegal immigrants  They do not also so I think we talked in Canada. I know we had this quiz. I think some months ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leo where I asked would you?  Harbor hide in your house a  Young Mexican immigrant who's gonna be sent back for no reason other than spike  Separated from his parents, you know, maybe you know get the hard springs going  Give me some sympathy here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you know, let's let's let's stack exactly and Frank but uh  Well, but facing deportation so churches churches have  Sanctuary right so that I also I was an off-the-record thing so I can't say who but a fairly important  I'll just say either intelligence or military official  At a very high level I heard in an event two weeks ago and was asked by the very good interviewer  okay, so Donald Trump goes in the office and chortle in the room and  He orders you to waterboard and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This when you say no and in fact, that's exactly that's the military is told to do that  You cannot you you have the right to refuse an illegal order  But what's every prosecuted the Germans who said I were just following orders  No, I think I I'm a little bit later  I think the military will say no to illegal orders

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But all I'm saying is I think that that if he does start doing some of the things that I find heinous that he's threatened  To do against the press as well changing libel laws suing the journalists for they say something he doesn't like  What kind of resistance?  Should I as an individual consider you know, what are the great things about having worked in the campaign and don't worry people  I'm not gonna go off. It's too late  But I thought this the other day I  Re-learned how to become a citizen as a journalist you separate yourself from the public you have this this view that you're apart  That's what all we don't have one of the problems apparently  Exactly. And so by being a partisan by being involved I felt my citizenship  Again, you know in my soul I cared about something I allowed myself to care about something and  And with that comes tremendous responsibility and I felt the responsibility not to being a journalist first  but to be the citizen as well and  So if you believe in the principles of this country and someone does start violating them, then I'm just saying hasn't happened yet  You're quite right Leo, but I'm starting to just get the wheel spinning about what would I do?  What would my response be? What does resistance mean? What what?  Protects the principles but doesn't destroy the office for future holders if that happens  I'm not saying this one's gonna do anything to do here, but I am asking the question

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well you you and you and I you write about journalism exactly then that's where I'm taking this  And we all write about social media

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Before you head to that I want you I know you wanted to do this  But I want one more point about Silicon Valley  There was at least one person in Silicon Valley who made a bet on Donald Trump, but that's Peter teal. Yes  and we talked about this there was a  move to oust him from the  Facebook Y Combinator board the Facebook board both companies defended his right to donate one and a quarter million to the Trump campaign  And I think it was my position at the time that that was his right. He was the Republican candidate. However, you feel about him  teal  Made it looks like a second good early bet. Remember he was the first to bet on Facebook  He might be made secretary of the cyber I wonder I wonder if he'll have a role  He was of course co-founder PayPal or early backer of Facebook. He's on the Facebook board. He is  and a libertarian and  So one of the things he said and he's not about a week ago at the National Press Club is  When I work in Silicon Valley people are doing just great. Most Americans have not been part of that prosperity  It shouldn't be surprising to see people vote for Bernie Sanders at Donald Trump was the only outsider left in the race  So I don't know if teal was angling for a position in the cabinet or just supporting the guy he liked  But yeah, he will be sitting in the catbird seat. He will be influential regardless and but but you know, is that a bad thing?  I don't I don't even know teals Paul not not politics, but but you know technical  Acumen  It's funny because Meg Whitman Republican Meg Whitman was a Clinton supporter, yeah  Teal had supported Carly Fiorina in the primaries

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the thing that I think is is a is a is a really great  Thing for this show particularly to focus on on an ongoing basis is the fact that Trump in fact  did promise to  He wasn't specific about it  But he basically said that the internet is one choke point where we can prevent Isis for example from it is understands  Obviously the technology, okay, but he misunderstands it but somebody you know, he's gonna he may drive that point  He's we have no reason to believe he won't so you think what do you think trouble do on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Surveillance mass surveillance encryption. He's gonna he's gonna try to get laws passed requiring backdoors into encryption  So we're gonna have to use encryption from outside this country

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He will have by the way the support probably of a Republican Congress, oh, yes, I would guess sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but when he goes to Facebook and says, okay  I want you to do XYZ and he goes to Twitter and say I want you to shut down all these

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These accounts that he was gonna call Bill Gates on that one. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well first he's calling he said this first. He's calling Putin  He wants to meet with Putin as soon as he gets an office we shall see what happens Teal on Tuesday night last night

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Issued a statement  Congratulating the president-elect says he has an awesomely difficult task since it's long past time for us to face up to our country's problems  We're going to need all hands on deck  They asked Max Levchin who was with Teal co-founding PayPal and this was interesting Max said Peter is very shrewd very smart. He bets  Contrarian as he did this time, but not when he knows he'll win  But when he knows that his odds of winning are much better than most people think so Teal was crazy like a fox. Yeah  Yeah  He knew what to do now Teal's also the guy who funded Hal Cogan's lawsuit against Gawker. Yeah won that one, too  And oh, yeah  Teals wrote in his book that his dream had once been to the Supreme Court clerk

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think this this raises another central issue which which you know Teal Trump  I think there's a movement afoot for billionaires to get involved in the media in a big way in the case of Teal  There's this idea that oh somebody criticized me. I will bankrupt that publication and Trump is as has gone after  Publications that criticize him of which there are many. I don't he his major endorsements were  the KKK newspaper and one other major newspaper  But most newspapers didn't support him  But you know, for example, he'd be criticized New York Times and then he would call the failed failing New York Times, etc  So there's there's a movement afoot for billionaires and people who are powerful to shut down the publications  Per Teal punish them punish them by ending them  With their money with their influence with their power with whatever resources they have at their disposal with the power of lawyers and lawsuits  And so this is something that I think it needs to be a concern

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm a little concerned because it's very clear that in the in the Trump supporters. There's a very strong anti-media  Yeah feeling right they were oh CNN sucks. They were chanting and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and I actually have I have I have I wrote a piece a few weeks ago  And that now more telling than ever which I argued that that that is indeed our fault in the world media  This is another post I wrote

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  post mortem of journalism

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I wrote this kind of refers back to this where what I argued was that we in liberal media and let's be honest  Media are liberal. I'm media. I'm liberal and and we're not honest about that really  That's what I'm going  We in liberal establishment media left a void in a vacuum that was filled readily by by  movements masquerading as media starting with Fox News bright art and  Drudge and many far worse and it's our fault  we left it there because we didn't respect that half of the country and and my second argument is that we didn't  We didn't empathize with we didn't listen to and understand the concerns in the worldview of that half of the country  And as a result that half of the country said you never reflect us you why should we trust you?  We don't trust you. You don't understand us. That's our fault. I take that fully on in  journalism and media, I actually believe that we should invest in  Responsible fact-based journalistic conservative media because the only outlets the conservative side had were Fox News and Breitbart and such  And so what do we expect they were gonna think about climate change and other things when that was the only real you don't have a  echo chamber  And and so we abandoned half of America and I take that fully on that was that was media's fault  And and and they don't trust media and they don't trust media for a reason. I don't think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Journalists abandoned half of America. I think that I mean they used to be that every tiny little small town  I started my career in small-time newspaper small small town newspaper journalism  Small town newspaper journalism and every small and one of the amazing things about the United States was that there were  Thousands of newspapers every little town had its own newspaper representing local views. I heard a Terry Gross interview with with the cartoonist  Gary Trudeau recently  And he was talking about how he never felt bitter when they when they censored or canceled  You know eliminated his cartoon because he said each of those small town newspapers has a response, but that's just called editing  That's not censorship. They all have a  Responsibility to reflect the values and concerns of their readership in the local communities and that's how it used to work  I don't think journalists walked away from I think journalists would love to have a million newspapers  I think what I don't think is that I don't think is that every every news organization available to every citizen and people  gravitated to the national and international  Publications, I think I think journalists love the old system of having a little local paper where they could begin and work their way

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean that that's how it used to work. What so what so you think that it's because I  Mean it's an I guess in many ways that the Trump movement is an anti-elite movement, right?  And so yeah, so journalists are media elites and so yes  Here's a t-shirt somebody cited at a Trump rally rope tree journalists some assembly required  you know  But I but I'll have to say and when I talk to friends and family members who are  or Trump voters  Pretty much to a person they reviled the New York Times. They reviled mainstream media as  reflecting  They say liberal. I think it what they're really saying is an elitist point of view. Yes, but the thing is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Phenomena  But it's phenomena beyond the control of  Individual journalists led to this for you know, this idea that journalists are inherently elitist is just provably false when I started  business I  Made far below the poverty level when I started. Oh, you can be an elite without making well  I mean, I had a I had a bachelor's degree and so on I guess that makes me yeah, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think like I think journal and listen  Every single journalist I've been with in the last week  With yesterday was at a big event with journalists yesterday and we were instructed firmly to have no  Emotional response whatsoever to any of the results because it would look bad. I couldn't take it anymore  I need to go have a primal scream somewhere. So I left it was it was interesting watching the news anchors

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and there was some palpable sighing. I kept it a sighing on MSNBC

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, see their temple throw temples throughout the truth is Mike. I think we  Virtually every journalist I know there's very few exceptions. There's the David froms out there  There's a few others other but every journalist I know is liberal  And when I say that I'm not saying that that we abandoned communities in the sense that we abandoned the the outlets sure  We'd love to have more jobs more outlets. So I agree with you there  But no, I am saying that that in big media  Whether that's the New York Times or NBC or you know, pick the outlet  There's very little understanding of that center of the country that voted all red. There's very little understanding their lives  the other example I gave is I wrote I  Read a piece of the New York Times a few weeks ago about evangelicals in  Indiana and I called one of the subjects of the story. Did I talk about this in the show? I don't think so  I'll make it very quick because it's not really tech, but I found it interesting  And the headlines said  Evangelicals in despair and the minister I called to find out what they thought of the story  Said because he's not the reporter did a very good job. The photographer did a good job, but the story itself  His personal came to him and said don't they understand we don't despair that's the definition of being evangelical and  And it was an editor put that in the head. That's actually a good point  Yeah, it is an excellent point right and it showed there because of the process we have the editorial separation  The editor puts in something puts a take in a spin in even though the reporter did an excellent job of really empathizing  Really listening and wrote a good story  It still separated them from the understanding because some editor in New York who didn't know any better and the minister had given the reporter  The scripture that says explains why we don't despair  That's what we what was what they go back to is that scripture and if you're gonna understand them and empathize with them  Then you've got to include that but we don't do that  We don't put the Bible as a Quran and quote that in media. So, you know, I'm  agreeing to the extent that  With with the conservative community that their mistrust is  Warranted and we've got to fix that and the way to fix that is by listening to the community  Yeah  And you're right Mike then one way to listen is to have more outlets that are closer to people's lives and the internet is what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Enables that funding back to technology. Let me hold on for a second because I do want to talk about that  I also want to talk about you know  Facebook and its role in this social media and its role in this some people say Trump is the first Twitter president  Twitter stock up by the way significant. Oh, yeah. Yes. Yes, and some people say we elected a meme  You know what? I think we did I don't think that's far off. I also want to talk about Michael Wolfe article in the Hollywood Reporter  He's talking about  lessons learned  from this and  He says Trump's win exposes media's smug  Failures, so we'll get to that and we have some Google News  But this is this is our beat right here media  The internet technology and this is a historic election. There's no getting around it and today's the day after I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder because I think probably I was looking the New York Times did a great thing a couple of days ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They had front pages from elections going back to the 1850s when they when they first started and every election was historic  Every election was a shock every  Election was a shock every  every election was a watershed not every but many elections were watershed moments and and surprises and  when you read those front pages you realize if you have historical context this may not be as  Historic as we want to think it but this this Leo is our first orange president

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Breaking the color barrier and for that reason  Jeff has no sense of humor

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's gonna be okay. We're this is a great  I don't know. This is a great country with great institutions

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let me ask Mike. Let me ask one more question here  So we have all this talk of you mentioned Kennedy. We all this talk of leaving. You're the one person Mike  You're the one person who's qualified to speak about what it takes to just get the hell out. Yeah  What does it take and?  If you were to get the hell out, where would you go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm good. Yeah, he knows where to go exactly. I would go to Spain  And no, it's it's a it's a big wonderful world  I actually wrote a medium piece about this Jeff a couple of months ago and because I started saying oh if Trump gets elected  I'm leaving the country. I'm moving out and I said no you really should do that. That's like a great idea  Just temporarily right well  Yes for as long as you want and see what happens is when you temporarily go somewhere you fall in love with other places  The world is a big beautiful place full of wonderful people despite the rhetoric of this election and  And what I found in all kinds of far-flung places. I've been to Jordan, Morocco, Kenya Turkey  Europe Mexico etc etc etc been all over the world and literally to a place  I would want to live in every single one  I did live in those places, but I would I wouldn't mind living permanently in any of those places  It's a wonderful country so what you do is you put your own house on Airbnb  You figure out how to work from home because if you can work from home you can work from Rome  And then you take off and you live abroad while you monetize your house  try to meet or exceed your mortgage or rent with the Airbnb income and and  There you go you can live anywhere you can live you can the most deliciously ironic place  You can move in my opinion to protest Trump is to move to Mexico climb that wall go live in Mexico  Mexico is a fantastic country and  And that would be my recommendation. It's never been easier. Thanks to the internet. Thanks to all these services  There are co-living places there are you can you can live and work on a boat you can yeah  I mean, there's so many different opportunities and options out there  And I just think if you're gonna talk the talk you should walk the walk and you're gonna find out that it's a great choice  to to live abroad I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Would if I could do podcasts if I could do what we do here  Where would you go? I love traveling, you know when we were on our last vacation we every see we go to Copenhagen saying  Hey, I wouldn't mind living here. This is cool. Look at all these bikes. We get to Amsterdam  Hey, I'd love to live here. Look at all these bikes and canals and I'd live in a houseboat  I mean, I know what you mean when you get to the places all over, you know  One thing that said you you you were in Cuba. You've been in Cuba several times  I really love Cuba Trump has said that he will reverse  Obama's policy of opening the doors to Cuba. Yeah, that's over. Yeah big mistake. That's a that's a big mistake

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  Michael wolf I actually now I know you're not a super fan of Michael wolf Jeff. I don't know. He's a columnist  Jeff's muted I  See his mouth moving, but I don't see anything that's what that's the way most people want me  I would give you such a hug and I wish I'd been with you last night. I know that your son  Was in the Javits Center, yeah, and he was and he deserved a hug too. I've never seen such sad people  Oh god, yeah, except maybe the Cleveland Indians at the after the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Seventh game. Yeah, just well, but even even then they kind of had to say, okay a hundred eight years  All right, all right, all right. We get it and in baseball. There's always next year

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think there's a next year for Hillary Clinton. Oh, no. No, no, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I think the foundation is gonna do great work now. She's got plenty she could do. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  anyway  Michael wolf I was asking I don't know if you have an opinion on him, but I think he made some very good  points the media turned itself into the opposition and accordingly was voted down as  The new political reality emerged typical of the media to say this was a vote on us, right? Mm-hmm  But he does make an excellent point when he says  What do we learn here?  Trump didn't buy ads ads don't work  Clinton spent the usual billions and by the way a number of people in my business in the radio business pointed out that  This is very bad news for broadcasters who frankly depend on those biannual  buys of political ads  That's a those are at top rates big big influx of money Trump bought hardly any ads we learned the polls are not reliable  That's what we learned at brexit you would think we'd have I mean this was another case of that  Yeah, and I don't know if that's because people don't tell the truth to pollsters pollsters are probably perceived as media, right?  So there you know, screw you I don't know who I'm gonna vote for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I also perceive that what the media did do was they conveyed a sense of if you openly support Trump  You will be ostracized. Yeah, you're a jerk  And so people kept it to themselves and quietly voted  So but but I disagree with this thesis that ads don't work and the reason I say that is that  Trump had something better  Than ads for example, one of the best trolling that he did in this entire thing was he said I'm gonna I'm gonna go  Open my Trump Tower my new Trump building and on Pennsylvania Avenue  and and the press went there and he was deliberately late by like an hour and  CNN and all the cable news networks just had this camera on his over and over on his hotel doing his brand  And he said I'm gonna make a major announcement  I don't remember what it was exactly about the birther issue about I'm gonna announce what what I've concluded about Obama's citizenship  And then and then he went there as I got there's nothing really say he's he's he's an American citizen and he left  It was a one-hour ad that he got for free. So that's better than advertising. He's a master

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, there's no question. He's a master of media and he's learned that in reality television Michael Mark Burnett taught him a lot  Yeah, right  Celebrity endorsements don't work, you know  You'd watch these Clinton rallies with Beyonce and Jay-Z and Trump would be standing there with you know, John Voight  They're just morally  And it didn't make a difference media endorsements don't work as you mentioned. He got two newspaper endorsements one from the KKK  Yeah, one from Sheldon Adelson's last night. That's right Las Vegas Review Journal  Didn't make a difference, right?  ground games everybody's saying oh  The Clinton ground game it's the best in the business  They got all the professionals on the ground didn't they got Jeff Jarvis canvassing in Pennsylvania. What did it do? What did it do?  Didn't do diddly  Well, it must have done diddly actually we don't really know it all of these things could have worked  It could be Clinton started, you know with a 50-point deficit. We don't know it just didn't work enough  I guess is is his point  so I  Think one of the things  That's kind of exciting about this is it's a new world and  the media and  Especially social media. Yeah is now has a very powerful role in all this Trump

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What did Trump master the social media, you know, one of the things that he did on social media  It's a very basic basic thing which is that 100% of his messaging on Twitter and elsewhere was  Was a pandering of sorts to his  Desired audience whereas  Hillary Clinton, I think she was so overconfident in victory that she felt that she had the luxury to take the high road  Now this is a cynical position. I'm taking I  Understand that but she would tweet things like we need to support  Muslim immigrants we need to support  The trans community the trans community does in my opinion need to be supported needs to be  Accepted needs to have legal rights needs to have everything that every other American has I personally believe that but that's such a tiny  percentage of the voting population that as a more shameless populate  politician one who is more in tune with how social media is more effective would ignore the  Tiny little groups now. I'm not saying it's ethically the right thing to do  But I'm saying that's the thing that gets you elected whereas Trump 100% of what he said  Appealed to the vast majority of his potential voters and he never went off and on principle supported anyone  Or did or said anything that didn't wasn't directly related to getting him into office

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, he had a fabulous feedback mechanism both on Twitter and at the rallies. In fact, I almost feel like the rallies  Were like a comic trying out material. He would try out stuff. Yes, and the stump speech was honed  Yeah, just by the response from the crowd and he honed that  Stump speech to the point where he didn't need to for instance prepare for the debates because he knew what the lines were  That he needed to say the lines that got the biggest change in interesting points  And the lines that he had learned initially  from Twitter  How about Facebook's role in all this does Facebook have we were talking before the show about what is does Facebook have a responsibility I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think they do and so there are two things going on for Facebook  So I tweeted out this morning a little crowd a crowd sourcing about these ideas and said, you know  What is YouTube's Facebook's and Twitter's role in this the outcome of this election?  And I got some pushback from people saying hey Facebook is just you know  People are just following who they want to follow  I'm like, you know, no not not exactly Facebook has a filtering algorithm something like 50% of Millenniums don't know the Facebook filters  The newsfeed. Yeah  So I think it is they're seeing a chronological right and you're seeing a  Minority of the things that the people you follow post right and and Facebook and they make it harder and harder to choose most recent

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, it's a top stories and right on mobile

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to dig deep to find that and Facebook's criteria is what gets the most engagement. Well emotional  Often fabricated stories get the most engagement the most sharing the most clicks the most argument the most comments  And so you end up with these dual filter bubbles  So so we elites in the media and all that cetera have live in a world that's partially Facebook constructed  And I've single out Facebook more than Twitter because it's so much bigger  it's 140 million Americans use Facebook and and then and then there's another group of people who who  You know Facebook's algorithms result in a different world that they live in a world of information  And and what Facebook one of the things Facebook did is they got accused early?  by the by Breitbart of  favoring the liberal elites and so what they did is they  Overcompensated they fired the human staff. They put it all in the hands of the algorithm and they were careful and avoided  eliminating patently false stories that that supported both sides, but predominantly  Pro Trump stories many of these fabricated by Macedonian teenagers for profit, right?  If you saw that yeah, we're a vast majority of the false stories  That favored that were anti-clinton or pro Trump  We're actually just generated by a small group of Macedonian teenagers just for money because they realize okay  This is a way to get a lot of eyeballs and so on BuzzFeed news got this great story  Yeah, how teens in the Balkans are duping Trump supporters with fake news. That was the headline and so it's nice work  If you can get it's nice work, you get it  But but what is Facebook's responsibility to not let that stuff go viral?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When it when you can identify if I I would argue zero, I mean what you don't want to do is start  I don't know. This is maybe why trending topics aren't a great thing, right?  I have but what you I'd hate you it's a slippery slope as soon as you start doing any editorial curation  Which they tried right? Yeah, I got and they got reamed for it. Yeah, what you what you can do though  I think is the ability suddenly. Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What I think that the the the journalism should be doing in this case and Facebook should be collaborating is in  entering facts and  Fact-checking and such into people's conversations and let them choose whether or not they want to act on it or not  but I told the story I think on the show like two months ago the picture of Justin Trudeau kissing a politician and  When I moused over it  Came the the the related content the related content was BuzzFeed saying people are passing around a fake picture of Justin Trudeau kissing a  politician's mail interesting and right next to it Snopes so you can see very easily as a system there that says hmm  Before I share that maybe Facebook could say ah some people some respected or outlets have looked into this already and  You may not want to share this you might want to share it because you want to laugh at it  You might want to share it because you don't believe those what's that's up to you  But we just thought you might want to know this before you might have to in ten minutes say oops, I got fooled  Now that's not gonna get rid of all fake news and all lies and all scummy things on the internet  No, nothing's gonna do that, but we can feed the conversations with more information  This is one of my huge complaints about my dear business is that we still think of ourselves as a destination  We tell you to come to us even on Facebook and instant articles  We tell you this dizzy and kaleidoscope of great activities going on now stop and read my thousand word articles now get back to the kaleidoscope  Right we're not at all appropriate to the platform and to what's going on there, which is conversation  So we should be feeding good memes smart memes memes with facts memes with with with responsibility  Into there and give people the opportunity to share good stuff  That's not what happens all the only smart people like pornography are the ones who take advantage of the meeting and put the crap in  There the crap gets passed around then we would decry all of Facebook and everybody on it because they're spreading idiocy when we didn't do  A damned thing to help yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In her concession speech this morning  Secretary Clinton also mentioned secret Facebook  Groups and I think she was what was the reference? Oh, you know I'm a member of the secret Facebook. Oh, are you secret?  Oh, that's like yes, okay. Yes, you remember because you went at pantsuit nation and so nation

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I will but there are also secret groups on the other side of which they have huge audiences  And this is this is one of the things that don't show up in our filter bubbles

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But right who show up in the filter bubble filter bubble because you Jeff have a long time Eli Paris  Of course wrote the book right describing filter bubbles saying that  Google Facebook and others are responsible for creating an environment which we can just hear what we want to hear not hear anything that we  Don't want to hear and that is just and boy you I don't know if there is a culprit  Can see that the country is kind of dividing into  Camps right that don't really listen to voices from the other side right there's no doubt about that  Is this evidence?  Of a filter bubble I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You've denied that there's a filter bubble Jeff. No, I'm not to fully deny it, but I think it's I think it's not the fact  Concentrates on the negative exposes also have more right exactly exactly. We're exposed to so much more  We have more opportunity to get facts and new opinions and some sense of other sides and we have all of that  But of course, you know the nattery nabobs of negativism here  concentrate just on the negative and the negative that that that  Justifies our existence by the way, there's no greater fill about just quoted Spiro Agnew with an idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, and and but but that reminds me Spiro Agnew did fall because his tax returns and his connections with nefarious  Revealed while he was in office. Yeah, so  There you go, there's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Helicopter yeah, but one thing I'm sorry. Go ahead. Finish it. I  Lost it. So go ahead. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  one difference that people need to understand whenever you talk about  Facebook and Google and filter bubbles and Google will be quick to point this out is that in fact Google's search doesn't filter  It's technically not a fickle filter  They give you all the results and they choose the order now that that may be splitting hairs  But Facebook on the one hand literally filters what they never deliver to your newsfeed  The majority of the things that people you follow have posted

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you wouldn't want that you can see that on the right of the page. You can see it all I understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly, but again again 50% of Millenniums don't even know it's happening  So they're not going to go in and tweak their settings, but by default they  Actually never deliver the majority  Let me rephrase that delivers all of it every time you know what Amazon never gives you every book

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Amazon only gives you books that Amazon thinks you're gonna like you're in a book filter bubble  No, I'm in a recommendation system that gives me greater relevance and saves me effort  And that's that's what Facebook is doing is say we we know from your behavior what you enjoy most  We'll give you more of that. I don't see any problem with that Amazon does give you every book  No, no not and not not the recommendations they give you not motions not everything  I could hey I can search for a friend and see everything you said Mike  I can see  The reason a filter search is worthless the real reason to feel well, that's another probably you're absolutely right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but that's another issue the real reason a filter bubble exists is because we  In want to filter we respond we like the filter bubble I  For instance followed every Republican candidate in the primary  the libertarian the green  Every Democratic candidate on Facebook. I wanted all of that feed and I keep seeing Ben Carson's feed in there by the way  That's how I know for instance that of all of his opponents in the primaries Ben Carson  Was the one that stayed the truest to Donald Trump and carried a lot of water on Facebook for Donald Trump almost every day  Carson posted Carson posted no surprise then that Carson's on stage during Trump's acceptance speech  Trump's team was very aware of the power of social media and used it masterfully and  Clinton's was clearly not oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not at all and that spreads not just to social media per se one of my criticisms of the Clinton campaign  Was there was no sense of a grassroots effort there? I was an old-style top-down campaign  They didn't even enable this is my pet peeve  But they didn't even enable people to get the damned yard signs  So the Trump won the yarnside battle and the perception that was there immensely it was hard to volunteer for the campaign  There was no sense of that whereas in Trump there was no organization so you could hey, I'm part of the Trump campaign  I can be whatever I want to be I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Love by the way  Garrison Keeler writing in the San Francisco Chronicle  We're we liberal elitists are now completely in the clear the government is in Republican hands. Let them deal with Trump  Democrats can spend four years raising heirloom tomatoes meditating reading Jane Austen traveling around the country tasting artisan beers  Let the Republicans build the wall and carry on the trade war with China and deport the undocumented and deal with opioids and we Democrats  Can go for a long brisk walk and smell I'm literally gonna do all of those things. Thank you. Thank you Garrison  Garrison Keeler  Let's take a break. I didn't want to get political, but you know, it's the day after an election

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You kept it pretty reeled in you kept it real then  Well, we didn't go too far. There may be dispute some that dispute that there will always are with me. That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When we come back, let's talk about Adam Bain. What a shocker  Yeah, that is and then you can all go smell the roses our show today brought to you by the ring video doorbell  I'm sorry Stacey's not here. She's  Had an event right some sort of Internet of Things event. She's become our Internet of Things  Guru and  Boy, there's a lot of Internet of Things news in the news these days, but there's one Internet of Things device  I don't even think of as an Internet of Things device because it's so darn useful  You don't need a hub to control it. It's secure  They do firmware updates and it serves a fantastic purpose  It's the ring video doorbell and you know, it doesn't unlock your door  In fact, I'm nervous  I don't have a door lock that unlocks my door when I walk up to it that makes me nervous especially a voice controlled one  Yeah, hey door open  No this all this does is you put these you replace your regular a ding-donger with this and you don't by the way have  To have a wired one because the ring video doorbell there's several models  But the model I have in my hands right now has a big old lithium-ion battery good for a year  You can recharge it so it can add a doorbell to any door  I use it on my wired doorbell though. It's very easy to install it has a complete kit everything you need to do  the only thing that really kind of makes it an Internet of Things device is then you pair it to your Wi-Fi and  Now when the doorbell rings, not only does the chime ring in your house  But it rings on your phone no matter where you are on your tablet on your windows or Mac  PC and you can answer it because there's a speaker in a microphone built in you can see who's there  There's a high-def camera built in so so it's like your home  Which is really great for security because if some bad guy comes up to your door thinking  I wonder if they're home rings your doorbell you could say we're home go go away  And by the way almost every week  I just saw another story about a ring video doorbell capturing a thief on camera and getting the guy arrested  So it really does work that way, but I you know what we live in a safe neighborhood  Never happened to me, but I like knowing when the kids come up to ring the doorbell and run away  I like seeing when the UPS or FedEx guy comes and I can say hey leave the package on the porch  And I can even keep an eye on it  It's got you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's never happened to you because you have evidence that it's never happened to you because if it had  Happened you you would have I would be a video of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So isn't that I mean I love that now if you know something Leo for I knocked on a lot of doors the last four  Months in Pennsylvania and even though I didn't see you know rings on every doorbell Lord knows  Changes it changes the but but but it's already had an impact. I think on your behavior at someone's front door

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, cuz they're looking at you. You're not picking. Yeah  Yeah, and and I can see if it's one of them darn Clinton canvassers and yeah, that's exactly true

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When I tell them that I bring my ring video doorbell with me around the world and everywhere I stay at an Airbnb  I install it. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes sometimes with duct tape  Sometimes with us. Yes. I I would you're you're hooked never leave home without yeah, I  It's even better. It's even more important when you're living abroad because when I come I don't know what's going  I'm staying in Airbnb all the neighbors know that whoever's staying there is a foreigner probably has a lot of money  And that's a good when I come back from being out in the town  I can just check my phone before I even go in the house and know if anybody's inside  It's very it's very reassuring from a from a peace of mind point of view

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I completely agree. They have a variety of other products too  If you want to observe the sides of the back of your house  They have the stick-up cam, which is a ring video doorbell my us a doorbell  So it's got the camera the microphone the speaker you can go.

Right? I hope  Wow, that was out of control  Not so much in California where we were kind of giving up  Nobody nobody thought we were but there were a few I kept I was getting three or four calls a day

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I couldn't stop the Bernie Sanders spam. It just kept coming even after he dropped out even after he jumped  Dropped out and I kept on subscribing and it just nothing could stop it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did get a lot, you know, I gave money to the Clinton campaign  I did get a lot of calls once you give them money  I gave money to Obama last time and once you give money, they're gonna keep calling you  It was funny got a hook in your mouth because Lisa was getting all the Donald Trump mail  So we really had it covered

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so so can we can we talk a bit about mail mailing list because I think this is another tech tech angle one of the  terrifying things for Trump opponents out of this whole election and this is a  Minor detail that slipped the attention of lots of people but but for for a variety of reasons  Trump was the Trump campaign and Donald Trump personally was given full access  To the entire GOP mailing list in perpetuity which he can use in the future for any purpose he wants  He also had his own separate mailing list  That was that he did not give the Republican Party access to right  Donald Trump now has the world's largest political mailing list that he personally can control  Every year I'm sure no other the demo no, no, I believe that on the Democratic side that the candidate  Doesn't Hillary Clinton doesn't get to keep that and use it and email people  it was it's the result of a variety of things, but I was shocked to discover that and I  Back when I thought Trump would lose. I thought well, this is gonna be the foundation of his media empire  He's gonna he and and and Rod Roger Ailes are gonna launch a Fox competitor  And and they're gonna clobber them because they have that they have the GOP and the Donald Trump mailing list

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That rumor is another great example of the bubble that the media was in yeah  Well a Trump's gonna lose right and B when he does it he's gonna do what we do right? It was like  completely confabulated around  The media's sense of what's going on in the world, but there was some evidence

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Empire kind of started on Facebook live

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Arts editor on leave. Yeah, Steve Bannon would probably have liked to I think both  Bannon's role will he be press secretary in the oh, he's gonna have to shave  No, no Kelly and he's a suit. He's Kelly and Conway. You think she'll have a role in the administration. Oh, yeah, typically campaign

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Chairs, yeah, you're right. She can she can maybe make more money just going on to the next campaign

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Professional political consultant. Yeah. Yes. So typically people like James Carville don't take a position in the administration  They're hired guns that move on right although one wonders  Whether she David Axelrod became head of staff. He did that's that's absolutely right. He was an advisor though to Clinton  But left pretty quickly  Conway though will she get any credit for Trump's victory really? Yes, I think she will  She put up with a lot of crap. Well, she put up with okay. She has to defend a lot of apparently it seemed as if  Trump was running his own campaign single-handedly, right? Yeah  You know, Leroy Lewandowski was fired and Conway took over with it with and and Bannon with no  Seeming change in strategy. I wonder I guess we'll someday somebody will write the book. I look forward to reading it. Yeah, Jeff  Well, no, it's somebody who was somebody with insider access the whole time. I would hope  This is a surprise  Adam Bain is widely considered the most likable guy at Twitter  He ran sales right Jeff before he was moved to CEO over to Twitter in 2010 from Murdoch

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually used to work with the advanced many years ago. You know, it comes from media. Yeah, great guy really really wonderful  executive

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, when they were talking about who's gonna be the next CEO before they made Jack Dorsey the CEO  His name was most widely touted  He  Wrote in a statement  The past six years have been incredible. I'm inspired by what Twitter has become and what it will be in the future  Anthony and I have worked side-by-side since he joined Twitter in 2014 Anthony is his successor by the way Anthony not Oh  The CFO he's gonna take release temporary successor the COO  While Twitter searches for a new CFO, so I guess no to it not oh is gonna be the CEO and they're gonna replace him  Yeah, Anthony I've worked side-by-side since he joined Twitter in 2014. I have full faith in what he and the team will accomplish in the future  Why is Adam Bain leaving?  That's the question everybody's gonna be asking. Is this an ouster is Jack Dorsey trying to consolidate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Certainly nobody dislikes Adam Bain spend more time with family. They always say that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm looking in the New York Times story  People work with Bain requested anonymity  Said he would not join a major Twitter competitor like Facebook  Instead he'll more likely pursue something outside the advertising  Industry, but I don't think there's anything in here that says  Whether he's leaving on his own, I think he's been poached  Whether he's been poached or whether Twitter's  Forcing him out. He'll be working first. I just gonna have to read the comments  He'll be working first.

It's not hard give your customers the option of how to use their own  damn stuff and their own damn identity with the activities that you get and do not  Disadvantage your pain customers. So that just it just pissed me off all over again  There are things that I can't do because I'm in a sweets application that number one number two  It is wildly expensive to my view and yes others have pointed out to me and medium that it's overpriced like other phones are overpriced  But I think it's a rich person's pricing and number three  I do resent the idea that they limit assistant because it's BS that  Assistant is limited to the pixels absolute BS. There's no reason for it  So what they've done is they've they've forked their own Android and those who spend too much money on their phone  Get a function that the rest of Android users who've made Google huge  Shipping nine out of ten phones with Android won't let them use that's BS Google  So I'm grumpy about all those things around the phone. I'm and I got the RMA. I have 14 days to decide  From when I got it two days ago  And the other thing I've done so I've tried that three times now three times  I've tried to go ahead and say all right  Let me go ahead and put the two wires in and I'll move everything over hours  It's spent and this stuff never arrives.

You're not going three hours. No, no, no, it was like an hour and I and I had a lot of stuff  I don't I think there's something going on there. I don't know how to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because it's it's it's automatic. I can't figure out how to do that  so so, you know, you're spending a fortune on this thing and they're pissing me off and  They're playing a game with us. And so here I am. We're on this week in Google and I've been I'm the Google fanboy  I've been there all along but but Google you've made me grumpy. You really made me grumpy. I don't yeah

Transcript:  so there's another casualty of  Ruth Porat's  Belt tightening at alphabet  The drone project now remember we were talking about project in August. Yeah, that was that was the one that was delivering Chipotle  burritos to students of Virginia Tech  Remember we had posited that you'd have to have a burrito umbrella to keep from the burrito hitting you  Clombering you in the head as they dropped it off  It won approval for test flights in August as part of a White House effort to encourage unmanned vehicle delivery  They were considering and then nixed a partnership with Starbucks  This is according to Bloomberg Technology  The project leader left in October Dave Dave Vos and the unit froze hiring and began asking staff to seek jobs elsewhere  in the company, so  the drone project  Not exactly a moonshot more like a burrito shot, right but I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't care about the burrito one, but the latte one that was a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You'd you'd have heirloom tomatoes. Yes gently dropped from hell from parachutes to you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be nice. That would be nice  deep mind  the Google AI that won the go  Competition against one of the top go players in the world is now going to take on something even harder than chess or go  Starcraft 2. Yeah  Actually if it's playing those, you know, I stopped playing games like this online  Because there are kids in Korean cyber cafes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who have the reflexes of right and now those kids are gonna see what it's like when deep mind is out there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe they're but doesn't seem fair to have a computer play a computer game. No, it's like that's like having a  Point I had a lot of that. Yeah, it's like yeah  I  Always hated it when the when the French kids took the French classes right with you right in college  I took Chinese there were all these Chinese kids. Yeah, you know Chinese. That's not fair

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would that's what that happened to me in at UCLA  I took Japanese for three years and in the first year everything was great  But but as we got closer to the three-year period everyone else in the class was a Japanese American went to Japanese school  It's like that's not fair  But and it was also not fair when Watson was clobbering everybody on Jeopardy because  Well Watson didn't have to press the buzzer, you know, I mean there wasn't a reflex component to Watson's  Yeah, that's a big part of Jeopardy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah fact I remember Ken Jennings the Jeopardy champion saying really you should assume everybody knows the answer to every question  Yeah, it's not about the questions and answers on Jeopardy. It's about pressing the button fast. Yep at the right time. I  Never use this but this is another dying Google features

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google Showtimes did you ever use that never though only in search it would come up with Showtimes. I've used that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I never used I never used the separate service that yeah, so you can do it in search so they don't need a separate  Standalone movie site shut down on November 1st. Thanks for stopping by

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was discontinued. How do we feel about the Google's growing reputation as a company that you can't  Get trust you can't trust because they may or may not cancel anything, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it is this a an existential problem? I think it is I've said this for a while. It's yeah, there's an absolute  Feeling I think among normal people that well don't get too involved in anything with Google because it's gonna break up with you any

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Minute they came out with aloe and everybody was saying, you know, it's like they're gonna cancel right and like a year or so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Talking about aloe on Windows Weekly earlier and  Paul Theron, we're talking about the various the fact that on Android you could use third-party message  You could use like for instance, I use Facebook Messenger as my SMS  Messenger and I said but you can't use aloe Google's own messaging product cannot be used as its main messenger, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's so infuriating if Google imagine if Google had any kind of vision  What they would do is they would come out with a product and they would say it's called Google Messenger  We will never discontinue this product. No matter what we guarantee that for 20 years at least  We will support this product going forward and have no other messaging product and in that product you have third-party integration  Bots the assistant you could have SMS native support. Everyone would use it  But no, they have nobody even knows what their messaging strategy is or what their apps are still going and well  I had Google Voice but now now I have Google Fi and that what does that mean for voice and how do I delete?  it's like nobody knows what's going on and and it's like they're just they're just  They're just bumbling their way to not being involved in the messenger movement. It's too bad because this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As Apple has shown a big deal. Yes. Yeah  YouTube this is according to the the verge  YouTube red which is that yeah ad free version of YouTube as of late summer  Only has one and a half million paying subscribers

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm one of them, but I don't ever watch anything  I get you get you get the audio with red, right? You guess what with red, but I've got to cancel it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can like download the music. Yes, you get you get a subscription to their music service

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't you get that with music service?  Yeah  So I'm wondering if that's including people who subscribe that direction music service because that's what I do I subscribe to Google  I don't all access music or what they call it Google play music now and I get YouTube red  Are they counting me in that one and a half minute because if that's the case, that's terrible. I  think this number isn't meaningful because  There are more there must be more than one and a half million subscribers  Because I'm sure Google's play music has more than one and a half million subscribers  What does that mean for ad free YouTube people aren't willing to pay for ad free YouTube?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I can see you're not you're not watching anything that's you know wildly amazing they don't really care. Yes  Oh, yes, it's or an ad. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Coming in Thanksgiving a nine-episode virtual reality TV show from the NFL  on Google Daydream  No  It's my sense that daydream view is just like cardboard, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like it's I could watch somebody who used have you used it?  No, I talked to somebody who did and I don't know what's the difference  That's the main actually that's the main reason to hold on to the phone is so I can use daydream. Yeah  Right, cuz yeah, yeah, don't you have to have a pixel to use daydream?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's another question, I don't know you  But they start you didn't need a smartphone. I don't know if it works with others you have because you also have the remote

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The UI device on it  They thought it was amazing and different. Well, I didn't get a chance to really quiz them about their experience. Well other things

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look go to store Google because maybe I should just but they're not very expensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I just thought well if it's well if you know if you want a pixel you should get it for free  Really? Yeah, you're supposed to get a  So this frustrates sometime in November you're supposed to get a code get it for free  Well, I want to get it, you know, when everybody else gets it. I want to wait

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's another thing to be grumpy. They're gonna email me or something. Yeah  Let's see. Does good. Does the pixel?  Daydream require the pixel. I  Mean it's gonna say that on the site, right? I don't think so. Oh a daydream ready phone such as pixel  Yeah, but what other daydream ready phones are I don't know they're vague about that  So presumably other companies will do that and then right under it when they they say see more like this and it's the $15 Google  cardboard  So but there's there's okay  So there's some hardware improvements specific  To daydream Bluetooth le for to le  You have to have a display between 4.7 and 6 inches  Resolution  1080p at 60 Hertz so I could use it with my pixel my little I have the baby pixel

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does anybody else hate the fact that it's fabric?  Well, that makes  Is it real fabric or is it fake phony? It's just it's it's I just I'm repelled by the material it's really

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the problem is the problem with the cardboard of course is you got grease on it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, but with this you have grease that is like just sort of absorbed in the material. Hmm. Oh really?  I mean, it's like I just I just I don't like it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't like it. I  Can't remember if we talked about Facebook's results. I think not. I think they came in after the show. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, we did we did

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay  Just looking for other stories make sure we cover everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, so I had a brush with fame. I should tell you about a brush with fame a brush with fame

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Jeff you are famous. Oh, no, that would be so

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I  went when when the  politics, but when the Comey  Scandal was out  and and then six data analyze six hundred fifty thousand emails from  The perverts laptop as they said in the ads  Biggest how much time is it gonna take is how difficult and Flynn the military intelligence advisor to Trump said  Oh, they couldn't possibly do this in a week and Kelly Conway's done. So I just went on Twitter and I said hey Snowden  How long we're taking NSA to D dupe six hundred fifty thousand emails and boom he came back in an instant and  said well get rid of the  The unresponded to BBC BCC and so on fields  Hash them compare take out only the diffs old laptop minutes to hours. Yeah  No, that was no that got picked up was never a question. Yeah. No, but I was really happy  We don't try to make a point and Snowden responded. I was people were writing articles about it. Yeah, they did which is ridiculous  That's all it takes pretty cool 140 characters. You got an article right? Well, that's Trump's that that was the thing Trump discovered  You could turn it and the world would turn his tweets into articles. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So before we move on from the Google world, yes, I wanted to mention a little startup which  Inspired me a lot because it inspired a column and a podcast  these it's a new category of  Smart glasses that I call invisible smart glasses. The company I'm talking about is called view. They only have four employees  It's a totally tiny startup, but they make smart glasses that have that you can't tell her smart glasses  they're just regular prescription glasses and regular sunglasses and  The way they is a Kickstarter they they have a very successful Kickstarter. Yeah  No kidding. Yeah, and so they they said they're on if their official target was smart  Okay, their unofficial target was 500 K and they exceeded 500 K already

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With 30 days. So here's a dark wearing Google Glass. Yeah, and you're VR. Yep  And the pizza guy's going skeptical. Yeah, I'm not talking to you buddy. So these are the so that's a touchscreen on the side

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so they they have  Bone conduction audio and a patent pending bone conduction audio on both sides. So you have speakers you hear their speaker  So you can hear there's a blinking light and inside so the other people can't see the blinking light  But you can detect it meaning you have notification as a microphone didn't the pixel the Google thing use a bone conductance  Oh, yes, that's on one side. Yeah, and so they also had earbuds that came down awkwardly that you plugged in it  Optionally, but this is later  This has bone conduction on both sides and they also claim that their their patents prevent noise leakage  So other people can't hear you hear better other people hear less good. Where's the camera though?  They can't there is no camera. There's no screen. And so so my content my guess is my contention is that  everybody's gonna go gaga for  artificially intelligent virtual assistants the future versions of Google Assistant the future version of Siri  Etc but it's gonna be so compelling I believe is an interface that we're gonna want to have them all the time now people saying  Well, we're gonna have hearables, but you can't really have earbuds in your ear all day long  You're gonna wear your prescription glasses all day no matter what right and so I think this is the future of smart glasses  I think when you go to the optometrist office in three years or five years  You're gonna you want it's gonna be one of the options you want this frame that frame. Do you want smart dumb glasses?  What do you want? You want smart glasses? Okay, here's the and it's just gonna be a normal thing  I think how do you choose do you have to go through an audio menu?  They're gonna have a they're gonna have a website where you go. Oh, I'm sorry choose options choose an option right?  It is 20 functions  Yeah, they're gonna have a they're gonna have an API and stuff like that  But out of the box out of the box you answer phones by tapping the side and you can have the conversation through the glasses  You get you have your conversations with Siri or Google Assistant or whatever through the glasses  So that to a certain extent their earbuds that don't go in your ears  and and they have a microphone built in and  But I think these are just ideal for  virtual how much  They're gonna be 279 in the Kickstarter. They're 179. That's another benefit. They're super light  You know, they're just they're just  The the idea isn't view. I don't think honestly  I don't think view is going to be able to  Be back the enormous competition they should be getting from larger companies with well, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who's getting you know, who's really getting into this and in fact we talked about on a twit on Sunday snaps spectacles  Yeah, and this is this is an Instagram from Mike Murphy. Yes showing snaps  Filters if you're using the spectacles, so one of the things that's most popular on snapchat is  Those filters going the other way right right?  But he's showing me rainbow spewing clouds as he looks at the right  They're gonna be a hundred thirty dollars and snap is doing I should call it snapchat the company's called snap  Snapchat is doing something interesting  They are going to only offer these spectacles initially to people who are highest ranking. Yes, they're gonna try to create demand through envy  Which makes me want to start sharing everything I do on snapchat

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they look ridiculous and they'll never take off on the market because nobody wants to look around  Walk around like no no, they won't it's it's a it's a parlor trick and a novelty at this point  They'll never be mainstream and you were right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you were right, but these are hip and sweet

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Only until you actually have people are aware them and you can't wear them. See this is the thing  Doing snapchat and doing this stupid augmented reality Pokemon stuff is not a compelling application  Having an artificially intelligent AI all day guiding you informing you keeping you up to date  Giving you advice  Doing things for you. That is the interface  That is the way we're gonna interact primarily with computers in the future and we have to have a natural  Socially acceptable way to interact with our virtual assistants and it's not gonna be having Google Home in every bathroom and every car  Dashboard and no, we don't want microphones everywhere  We want to wear the microphone and glasses are the are a device that we're already wearing  Very you know, so I think I again I don't know the view will be the company but that category of which there are a couple  Of other companies as well working on it. I think this is the sleeper hit of the next two or three years  That's where smart glasses are gonna go mainstream. We're gonna be interested and how do you spell view?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Vue Vue it's on Kickstarter right now. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have not no too expensive for me and I wear contacts you wear glasses every day. Yeah  Adobe has demoed a new Photoshop for audio. This is kind of worrisome to me that lets you  Edit audio and it's speech as easily as text. In other words

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could put any words in anybody's mouth listens to you talk for a while and then after it  Masters how you speak and what your voice sounds like you can just type things and it will say in your voice

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Everything you type so oh my yeah. Oh my oh, I thought it was just an editing. Oh, this is huge because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It means soon. I'll be able to take a day off, right? You'll never know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you can sit there you can sit there in your Casper mattress just typing words and then we'll be saying yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Add that to AI and we have the Leo robot, right? You know, what's funny though. That's exactly right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw this technology demoed in micro at Microsoft Research Lab in the 90s  Oh, wow  They had this right they had Elvis and Marilyn Monroe talking and JFK and all this stuff and you could pick any celebrity voice  And they said oh, you know six months. We'll be able to do your voice never emerged from the lab

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So somebody in the chamber said kids are gonna use this that would get their mom's voice down and they'll have their mom  Yeah school and say yeah little Johnny sick today

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know when I'm working on columns what I do is I find stories like that and I think well  What is the bigger picture and I scroll it away in a folder?  Yeah, and and this falls into the category and I'm gonna be writing about this  Hopefully soon of new technologies that help distort reality  You know, there's another yeah technology being made available to the general public where you can lie convincingly  And confuse people and make them think something is true when it isn't true and that there's a whole  Category of these kinds of technologies. We're really gonna have to emphasize in education how to make kids skeptical and  How to be savvy consumers about what they're seeing and hearing and so on and this is just one small example amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  by the way, we didn't is it is it we were all set for the  disruptions of the elections hackers getting into the databases  Voter suppression see apparently I mean I haven't heard anything about it. Nothing happened, right?  We were we we said we're gonna hit back if Russia messes with our election Trump Trump said that the the election was rigged

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I expect now that he's gonna be president. He's gonna investigate and find out exactly how this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  poorly rigged  If Clinton rigged the election she didn't do a very good job  So I guess it none of that happened, but maybe it was  maybe the whole idea was  For that article that said will strike back was just a little warning

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't miss or a strike back has actually occurred  They they you know that the indication was and the wise policy was that you you do it behind the scenes  You don't do it as a public shaming you do it as a as a behind-the-scenes thing  That's nevertheless painful. And so I'm certain that the US has the capability to strike back  And I think it's important that we do in situations like this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, let's take a break and wrap up

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff has to get going. So I'm I don't know I don't but it's whatever you want. No, they haven't they don't love me  They don't care. They don't have them come back to me. Maybe yes was supposed to put him on but I don't know what happened

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what they do. I've had this happen to me. Oh, they overbook  They well, they also call you and they interview as if they're gonna put you on but really they're just getting background  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they're letting you do the work. Yep  Anyway good. Well, we  Will keep you around for a little bit longer anything  Have I I guess we can we can there's still a ton of stuff about the election and you know, yeah  but I think we probably  Cory Doctorow a madman has been given the keys to the surveillance state  You know, but it's so unknown  So unknown what's gonna happen here

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that one of the the interesting things about this election is that  It's raised the question exactly. What can a president do?  without any supervision and what can what in what ways are presidents constrained by  Other factors by Congress whatever, you know, it's a good question in the surveillance thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much access does a president have to people's question before the election of Ben Weisner who is Snowden's?  attorney and works at the ACLU  on  Issues like this and he said we we have an imperial presidency  He said particularly in foreign policy, which includes issues like surveillance. The president has very few checks  domestic  Congress will absolutely weigh in and you know may even have more power than the president  but there's very little to stop a president from launching a drone attack or  Surveilling you or incur or having the NSA surveil  and and especially since so much of this is done in secret and  Intelligence committees, of course are gonna be run by Republicans are presumably supporters of Trump. Yep. So I think  The question isn't whether he can do it  The question is whether he would want to do it and if he would start doing that and certainly there will be pressures  From the FBI the CIA and the NSA to do it. Yep  And my guess is that that's Trump's inclination would be to say yeah, go ahead. Mm-hmm, but I but I don't know  Yeah, what is his policy on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's gonna be what's allowed to me can you imagine Giuliani with that power?  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think Giuliani probably do it. Yeah, exactly. Here's it. Here's a here's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hypothetical so theoretically Obama has never has never held back. I mean, that's you know, that's what we felt. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean Obama  One of the campaign promises that Obama has failed to live up to is he promised to rein in  Surveillance mass surveillance and so on and he didn't really do that  But but there's a difference between a president using mass surveillance to do counterterrorism for example, which is a completely legitimate  Use of surveillance technology and again, we have to remind the public  again and again that the NSA exists to to spy on  Foreign communications. That's what it's for the CIA eggs are their spies. They they they exist in order to steal secrets  This is the correct. This is the correct use of something like the NSA and the CIA  So what we're talking about is the potential for Nixonian you abuse of those kinds of things  So let's say there's a reporter who's criticizing  Trump to to to good effect  What access does Trump have to go listen to that reporters calls now? He's done this at his hotels. He's installed  Surveillance equipment and listening on the phone calls really of people who've stayed at his hotels reportedly  And this is one of the many things that got lost in the in the endless barrage of accusations and so on  But there's something to look into  So that's actually great music for what I'm saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The music you know more and where websites are doing autoplay video. It's driving me  Yeah, it's really hurting these shows turn off the sound at least please

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so so so, you know, so the question is what can he go and listen to that?  Reporters private and look dig up dirt on that person to intimidate or to arrest or whatever  Is is that something he can do not I'm not saying he would do this  But can he do that? What would stop him from doing that? Well, and we know that already thanks to Omarosa

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The president Trump president-elect Trump has an enemies list  She she taught  She told she remember she was a contestant on the apprentice. She was the evil one  I didn't I met her I didn't either but I met only reason I know this is I met her  When I did it alive with Regis and Kelly, she was a guest at the around that time brush with fame  Yeah, my brush with fame nothing. I'm proud of I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't know anyway, it's complicated it's complicated  And I say that just not it's complicated but can a president pardon  I'm not as  Insinuating that there's anything to be pardoned for yeah  Our show today brought to you by those great people at a base camp  Who have made a fabulous tool you probably are well aware of millions have used it. I think a hundred thousand companies  I should say not millions  Millions is the new hundred thousand. Yes, a hundred thousand companies use base camp and the all-new base camp three is so  Sweet you're gonna love it. It'll make your life much easier more organized. It's a private secure  Online space  To help teams stay organized discuss everything they need to get a project done  No more searching through hundreds of emails or relying on chat to get the latest updates with base camp  Everyone's always in the loop no matter where I've mentioned this before, you know a company is easy to manage when there's three or four people  But as you get the bigger and I think around 15 to 20 employees  It's just hard to know who's working on what what the status is of that  We have a lot of meetings and things but until we found base camp  It was really a hard thing to do to keep up on all of this to organize all of this base camp is sweet and  Because unlike certain other tools from a company with two O's in its name  They don't charge by the seat, but they charge a flat fee. I'm always with with G suite  I've always have to make this decision. Well, should I add this person to our G suite?  It's gonna cost me another five dollars a month not with base camp base camp  It's a flat rate and you can include not only everybody on your team but clients and so forth and give them limited access  Are we use it on our live production team a live events production team to manage all the events?  We're up to things like CES. We're already in planning for that  Colleen who says it was our manager there says it's very intuitive provides a great visual overview of current projects  It's easy to assign tasks to team members to track  productivity through reports and daily updates  Kara likes the email reminders  Helps her get her job done stay on track and I like the fact that you can say what your work hours are and get  No reminders when you're off duty  Because you know what base camp is all about a more civilized work life. In fact, Jason Fried you see talking there  He's the founder of base camp wrote the book rework. They spend a lot of time thinking about work  David Hanna Meyer Hanson, we've had both of them on  Triangulation the guy who invented Ruby on rails and was right space camp. They are all about having a great  Work life being more effective more efficient and they've got a great tool to do it  base camp comm slash twit and you could try it free right now base camp  comm  Slash twit make sure you go there so that they know you heard it on  This week in Google. It's not slash twig though. It's slash twit  Basecamp comm slash  twit  Anything you want to mention? Yeah, I've been using lately

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a prepared statement about the use of inbox versus gmail, which is  I use both of them  I know every I think people are good  They think well, I should move to the new one, but I kind of like the old one  But should I use the new one? I'm gonna pick one. I don't think we have to pick  I personally like to use gmail the old-fashioned gmail, which is a new version by the way, it's faster

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I use it for searching because I search exactly everything. I just wish there's one feature

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wish I had which is to mark as unread  She don't have an inbox that you do have lunch. Right? I love that. You've come around to inbox Jeff  Cuz I know you oh, yeah, I'm using it. I know I resisted for a long time, but but I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Generally like it. I like the reminders that you could put in there and I like the canned responses

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I like the filters like that the auto filter the whole settings thing is just so many options

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's pretty old-school for inbox or gmail for gmail. I do it gmail, but then it's affected in inbox

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I see see if I see something in inbox. I want to add to a filter  I go to gmail to do the filter and then I come back to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Inbox so it's like gmail settings are like so yeah. Oh, so if you set up a filter on gmail it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Propagates yes, it functions in in inbox  Yes, and this is this is what like I  Anybody in tech journalism gets a gazillion?  Yes press releases or invitations or whatever every single day, and I just can't I can't even so I have I have  hundreds literally hundreds of  Filters in gmail that says okay take that take that and put it in that folder and then once a day  I address that folder well. I do that. You know five six times a day. I set up a new filter with a new  There must be thousands of PR companies out there  And I need that you know and I can't I love inbox  But I need that and there are a few other things in gmail that I need I need the all-mail  Folder sometimes to look through things and so I appreciate the fact that they're simplifying. I love the insanely high-tech  Nuts and bolts behind the auto-reply even though the auto-reply is so cool though. It's so cool. I love auto-reply  I love the I love the reminders. I love all that stuff  But I still need gmail, and I think we should all  Unapologetically use both both yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, I do you one better because I then I do mm-hmm  And then I forward all my gmail to another email provider, and I use a third client to access that hmm, so I  I don't know I guess I want all my mail in over by the way  And I was just on gmas  So I've been using gmail probably as you have for since it started was that ten years something like that  Yeah, so I was curious because they mentioned that Anthony winner had six hundred fifty thousand emails on his laptop  Hmm that seemed like a big number to me. Yeah seem like a large number

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think it was on his laptop. I'm betting that was me. I heard one reference  That was metadata is probably how much was in an account because I'm I'm looking at all the mail

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've ever received over more than ten year more than a decade  Yeah, I have I'm asked  If you could look at your all mail and tell us what it is, but I have  263,000 589 emails so if you go to your all mail folder, it's under more yeah  I got this is this is all know you're looking at all mail and it's a say on inbox you account no

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  293,000 293,000 no and gmail itself

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm saying how do you have six hundred and by the way you and I are no slouches right at receiving junk mail right right?  I never delete mail yeah  So where do you go Leo?  Just open your gmail account and got it under more on the left  You'll see one of the folders is all mail unless you've moved it up  All mail has all the mail including spam and everything else  263,000 is what I see up in the upper left corner  224,000 yeah, so we're all in the 200,000 range. Yeah, and we

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hold on hold on hold on how often do you use those Google things and tells you this how much you have?  And then when you get to you you have a hundred and you get to 100 and suddenly you have 200

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are you talking about what you sometimes? It's an approximation. It's an approximation number. I don't think this is approximate this says

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  263,000 I don't know I don't know but sometimes they they're like that this and I have I have a lot of storage

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have 420 gigabytes you probably have as much too because you we all have pixels right exactly we got a terabyte  And I've only used 75 gigabytes over 10 11 years yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Boy, I've also occasionally gone in and purged so I think this numbers a little low numbers low  Yeah, but but I would it's not that you know I probably have a total of 300,000 625,000 seem like a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  seem like a lot I  Don't know I'm just saying  When you're when you're tweeting teenagers you get you get more mail, right?  Jeff you got a number not six  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I found this interesting I found that get a sense of the other kind of  Associations these companies have WPP the giant advertising agency run by Sir Martin Azor  Will spend five billion dollars  with Google  for advertising  Five one company one agency of course bringing another company is in this a gigantic agency  But five billion dollars last year they spent four billion dollars  Facebook last year was one billion dollars, and he and he uses this as an opportunity to get some leverage  He says the relationship with Google is very good the relationship with Facebook not so much

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's been a bit well these are like ads  Yeah, they're just they're just ad spending how big is that agency? Oh?  It's gigantic. It's still what?  That's amazing and I get excited when we get a $50 by  I'm in the wrong business  I  Was gonna mention because I'm using the pixel and I'm president really crazy about and now this might be of interest to you Jeff  I wasn't crazy about the pixel launcher. It's okay, but it's Google doesn't want to hear it already has it yeah well for one thing  This is just a weird quirk of mine  I'm always accidentally dragging icons and widgets to other places on the screen  So I like to lock the screen so you can't move the widgets and pixel launcher doesn't offer that most other things  Offer that most other launchers. There's a lock button so that you can't drag  Icons around you kind of have a setup that you it stays that way  But the reason I stayed with pixel launcher is the long press and admittedly it's only a few apps most all Google apps that allow  You to long press and get a menu so you can long press on the camera and choose video or selfie and like that  Well, I found another launcher that is a great launcher  Thank you Florence ion for recommending it called action launcher that does in fact  Let you do that thing that long press thing I imagine all of them will eventually  But if you have a pixel and or you're using nougat 7 one somehow, maybe you  borrowed a ROM from somebody  You you might want to try  Action launcher and it has some really nice folder features  But it has it's not a long press it allows you to swipe down for instance on the camera icon and  Choose the menu from the camera icon just by swiping down  If you swipe down on hangouts you get or the actually the phones a good one because you get most recent contacts and so forth  So if you are using a pixel and by the way, I have to say  Jeff notwithstanding. I like my pixel a lot. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For weeks now, I'm trying to get you just give me an order and I'll follow it Jeff keep it Jeff get rid of it  Right Jeff. You're a fool if you don't blank, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's not biting I can't want for me Leo I can't I can't I can't I don't I don't want to be responsible

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For your friend. I'm gonna be whining at you for every everything that goes wrong. Yeah, is that it?  I it's a better phone than the 6p

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I  Like nougat and I like 7 one. I guess you got nougat in the seventh and the six p. No, yeah  The camera is really what blows me away now if that's not important to you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The 6p camera is a pain because it's slow to launch this is fast you can double click the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Start button the on off button and launch the camera right away. Oh  Yeah, that's some other by the way, once again, that's a software feature

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That could be on any Android phone most Android phones do have that but but it's nice to have that and it's fast

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So even if it's locked I can get right to the camera  The camera is superb. I'll show you you want to see a picture  I actually am using the little five-inch one. I took we had a weird night a couple of nights ago  portending strange things in the  Universe it was a very red sunset. So this is not you might think oh, there's a color cast from that camera  But no, this is actually perfect color. This is exactly what that's why I took this picture  But look at this picture will tell you red is very hard to do on a digital camera  I'm getting some nice depth of field on this  I think this is an example of a camera that's got great color rendition great detail  Excellent depth of field I'll zoom in a little bit so you can see that the the detail is very good  Let's zoom in a little bit even a little bit more  I think I it's a it's as good as the iPhone which is you know, the state-of-the-art  I think I it's a it's as good as the iPhone which is you know, the state-of-the-art  Digital camera that's probably  One to one or close to us one to one right there  So I would say keep the pixel Jeff  All right. I'm gonna take responsibility

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For your pixel. Why do you why just I mean just since you're you're the tech guy and you can help me with anything  Why do you think it's not it?  When I try to transfer the data it never gives me an estimated time well, how much data do you have I don't  Very little and I said don't move my videos. Don't move my photos because they're all stored elsewhere. Okay, and it but it takes like two three hours

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's hanging up. No, yeah, it's hanging up. Yeah, I would restart both phones and try again  I mean turn them off and turn them on again and try again

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what you say on the tech show all the time is exactly what I say

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Restart and try again take two aspirin and get off the phone. It's very fast. I like the 821 the snapdragon 821 that's in there  Feels good. It's you know, it's not the most pretty how does the size feel to you?  Well, I have a five inch you had that you had the I know you had to get a small one  Um, I like the xl the xl's got better battery life, uh, but this one's battery is quite quite good  1080p on a five inch phone is very nice screen. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like it was it looked rather dull and blue to me if you put these 6p  Next to the xl  Well, let me uh in a white screen the xl did not look as good

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The 6p was much brighter. Let me put this next to the iphone  Do you have it over the camera somewhere over the shoulder?  Okay, so there's the iphone  And there's this I think that's a better that's a better looking picture  Uh, frankly on the pixel than on the iphone  Um, I think it's really really quite beautiful  It looks actually a little blue on the iphone looks a little blue next to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it's funny. The the pixel looked very blue next to my 6p  Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I don't that I it could be that you have a screen. That's that way here  Let me put that picture up on it  This is lisa's showing there. We go  There we go. That's the that's that picture originally. It probably won't rotate because I turn off rotation  I think that's a pretty good actually have the same picture. Here we go a head-to-head comparison  Thanks to google photos. I should have the oh it hasn't copied it over yet same picture on the iphone that I don't  I like that screen. I think that's a pretty good screen  I like and I like the five inch i'm kind of liking a little phone  Coming back to the little phone. So you just put it right there.
