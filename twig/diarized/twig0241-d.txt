It's all coming up next on twig  That cast you love from people you trust  This is twig  Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by cashfly  Cache fly.com  This is twig this week in Google episode 241 recorded March 19th 2014 the birds  This week in Google is brought to you by  Personal capital with personal capital you'll finally have all your financial life in one place and get a clear view of everything you own  Best of all it's free to sign up go to personal capital comm slash twig  and by  Legal zoom visit legal zoom comm to save on your legal needs and gain access to a network of legal plan attorneys for guidance  Legal zoom is not a law firm or provide self-help services at your specific direction  Visit legal zoom comm and use the offer code twig to receive $10 off at checkout and by  Squarespace the all-in-one platform that makes it fast and easy to create your own professional website or online portfolio  For a free two-week trial and 10% off go to Squarespace comm and use the offer code twig  It's time for twig this week in Google the show that covers Google and the Google verse the cloudy  partly cloudy Google verse  joining us right now from  Mom's basement once again beautiful Brooklyn, New York Gina Trapani of smarterware.org  Hello think up comm nice to see you once again good to see you host of all about Android  We Jeff is Jeff horse is he lose his voice

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Lost his voice Wow or thing also and he and he's also on the road  So it was like bad internet connection and no voice he opted out today

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He could take a nap instead of doing Google this week interesting Larry Page is using his voice at Ted

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So maybe he stole it. Maybe he sucked the voice away from Jeff just for that one

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Larry Page has that evil power actually  That's Danny Sullivan search engine land calm marketing land comms great to see you once again Danny  one of the most astute observers of the search scene that's really gone beyond search to SEO and everything else too and  Of course Kevin Marx is also here who has worked at the Googleplex among many other places  Nice to have you Kevin I appreciate you  Jeff's in London, right?  That where he is. He is leave now. Maybe you can help him Kevin. Can you recommend somewhere that he should go?  What to get is a better voice?  Isn't there a guy there who helped the king? I think he is go to Jeffrey Rush. He'll fix it all  Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If he just checks Foursquare he will find the places that I've been but I'm my recommendations tend to be like 15 years old  They used to be a good  New bridges and extra tube stations. It's pretty just conserting. This is why it is no good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To to leave the homeland

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, now my son's at university there so I can ask him all kinds of student hipster recommendations

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It started in a Google blog post yesterday, but now we've seen video and more Android is coming to wearables  well, we knew that Google had some great interest in wearables both with a  Google Glass of course, but also Google Watch but now apparently they're going to use Android  Or they want you to use Android as an underlying operating system for wearables. They call it Android  Where and it is pretty much in fact, we can watch the video as we expected  Kind of a version of Google now for  Wearing and in this video, it's these are all prototypes. Nobody's making it including Google by the way  This is this is something that at least Motorola and LG have announced they'll make watches as you can see right there. It's a Google now  Cards that will pop up even on a round device. There's that's the Motorola device

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Know I have to say this is the first watch  I've seen that has a kind of a use case that gets me excited. I think that the ad addition of Google now cards is really  valuable

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Definitely Google now is the is the hook here, right?  Yeah, that's what makes me want this so bad and this this video is pretty cool  I mean they're showing some interesting use cases, you notice when he picks the watch up it automatically shows him contextual information  Oh, you're there's two stops away from your destination  Those women are dancing on the line and they kind of raise their wrist up and you know  The Google now tells them what song they're listening to  Voice search I mean and this is if this is an interface that we all know and love already on our Android phones  So seeing on the watch it's like oh, yeah, this makes complete sense. Yeah. Yeah exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can say what's the score you can actually text somebody via speech  You can they showed the QR code for an airplane ticket check-in, you know go through the check-in with your watch  This seems like a good idea and it kind of confirms what I'd been thinking which is that Google sees glass  More as a way to learn about what wearables can be than as a particularly important product  It makes more sense for them to do with wearables what they did with smartphones not necessarily make them  But but make the operating system underlying make them run on Google does that make sense for you Kevin

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I make I mean it makes a bit more sense. I haven't worn a watch in a few years  So I'm and the last thing I wore my wrist was the exercise band thing that stopped working. So right  I can see it makes a bit bit more sense, but it's it's  Does it end up being a peripheral in the same way that the Google Glass is do you still have a phone in your pocket?  This is just a little extra screen that things pop on and in the way that some things that have already built are  That that could make some sense  But I presume it doesn't replace your your your they're not assuming it's gonna replace the things you use the phone for entirely

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are they I would imagine it's like glass it ties to a phone. I would think

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Yep. Yes, it is  Yeah, okay. Yeah, I mean when you make your app Android wear ready  You're adding code in the app to talk to the Android wear device, but it's running on your phone  So when you dismiss the notification on your watch it dismisses on the phone as well. So this is an add-on to your phone  Okay, this isn't this isn't a standalone device

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's not like a chromecast is it's not it doesn't sit there and do stuff on it  You control it remotely, but it does stuff on its own. Oh, but imagine using with chromecast as a remote control

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be a nice feature. I you know to me this is essentially that you nailed it. This is glass  It's just not on your head. And by the way, it's called wearable. It's not called watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, it's glass  But I think it's better I think it's better described from all the videos is Google now on your wrist, right?  Because right glass has Google now that comes into it  But what glass typically does not do is pop up in my experience with all the same things I get  With Google now when I actually open it up on my phone and that's the difficulty with Google now is awesome  I mean, it's scary awesome how well it predicts stuff  The latest thing I saw recently was I was popping it up and it was reminding me, you know that a  Television show that I wanted to watch was going to be on. She's like, oh my god  Why don't you just watch it for me? Let me know how it went  You know if I have glass on it doesn't pop up as a reminder, you know, I mean it or I don't have it on enough  Whereas, you know, sometimes there's been cases where I haven't had my phone  But I would have and so when I do open up Google now, there's the reminder there  But you could see that this makes much a lot of sense to kind of give you those alerts on your wrist  That comes in so that's that's very very compelling and you know, I have I brought up my galaxy gear watch  Right, which has all these little notifications that come up and look I can even tell that my clash of clans was rated recently  It's very exciting. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Get that notification too

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the gear watch has really just been these sort of like  Notifications and what I find is, you know  Every few minutes. I'm just oh you have an email. It's like at some point  I don't need to know every email that's come in or every Twitter reply that I've got  It's it's such a stream that I'm not in the mood for but the the Google now stuff  Coming in more selectively and things like that. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looks like the moto and by the way, Motorola has already made a site for it moto 360 dot motorola.com. It's round  How do you Gina as a programmer? What do you do? Just square the circle? Do you you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the first thing that I noticed I was like, oh that's interesting because that changes the entire interface paradigm to centered  Right. I mean like when you you know that the Android design guidelines and principles  You'll often have the hamburger menu in the upper left and the overflow menu in the upper right  This is a totally different design paradigm right like for round screens like this  It's got to be more the Google now type card interface and the main  Content has to be the content that has to be absolutely legible and that the person has to be able to interact with  Must be in the center and the corners that get cut off, you know  That can only be sort of a background image or whatever. So so that's that's pretty interesting, but it looks like  From the little they can have a layout that changes that right? Yeah. I mean, this is this is the thing  The great thing about Android it's built to deal with lots of different screen sizes  it looks like these cards have a pretty standard design and  And from the example code that I saw it's not that difficult to extend your app to just interact  You know to have these sort of actions. They're very simple  actions  On on the watch so as a programmer you don't have to worry like oh is this round screen gonna cut off my corner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go the SDK does that for you? Well, I think it's also why the card interface makes sense because cards are centered  Yep, and so this is this is a different user interface and now we understand what Google was thinking and I imagine they were thinking this all along  I I really like this moto 360 because it looks like a watch. It's got a  programmable face obviously

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the big takeaway from glass  They had to make a watch that just looked like a regular watch right like glass just doesn't you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It looks like you got like kind of headset on a little bit, you know, even with the new frames  But but this watch looks like a regular watch  It doesn't look like you've got a nerdy Casio calculator watch doesn't look like you've got this giant screen on your wrist  It looks like a regular watch  It's even looks like it has you can wind it up on the side like that looks like a watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know my grandfather's watch I doubt that you can wind it up. Okay, I'm just saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It would be great if they had it would be great if they had figured out a way to  you know you have some of those the kinetic things that will charge themselves as you're walking because that would be  The big downside I heard from the moto watch that came out is that you know  They there's no you can't plug in USB to charge it directly from apparently what they've said  So people are like and they I guess the hangout they did today  They didn't exactly say how you can charge it  But the idea is that maybe there's wireless charging but you know  That's been the problem with the galaxy gear is that I go out on a trip and it's like, okay now  I got to take the little thing that I clip around it so that I can plug it in and charge it  That's a I don't want a proprietary thing  Well, you know, it's funny able so I just make that work. I just gave my

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My pebble watch to Chad. He's wearing I've been loving it  Well, how did you charge it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cuz I didn't couldn't find out so the moment you gave it to me without the charger  I went to Amazon and bought a charger and had it today shift and so I got it yesterday

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How much is the charger seven? Oh good like nothing. Yeah, but that's a good example is it it's a proprietary charger  There's no way you can charge it if you lose the charger  Good and so you love the pebble. I have I have been

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely loving it. Um, it just like as I was sitting down  Danny emailed me and was just like hey soon  We're running a little bit late and being able to do triage  Super fast look down at my watch notice that Danny emailed that could be important. That could be not important  I don't know and then you just kind of go down and it gives you the first few  Sentences of the email to figure out what it is and it was hey assume you're running late  I'm on Skype and it was just like oh wonderful. I don't have to pull out my phone  I don't have to pull it up anywhere else and I got it immediately  Instead of instead of checking it checking my phone 15 minutes later

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, of course, this is the pebble and one of the advantages of the pebble long battery life and cross-platform. It works with  Almost any device. I don't know if Android where I guess it's gonna require Android on the phone  I don't know but I would guess so in fact what it sounds like is if I'm looking at the developer site your apps  Notifications will already appear on Android wearables. That means your Android app

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't using the Google Cloud?  notification thing which is they already have a unified notification between browser and  Which so it works on Chrome OS and it works on Android if you use that API  Yeah, I think they're using that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It does do it does do that. It does this the notification dismissal across devices  So you dismiss the notification or your phone it gets or sorry watch and it gets dismissed on your phone  And I believe from what I saw the developer site existing apps notifications will work in a rudimentary way on  The watch out of the box  But if you add a little bit of code you can enable, you know voice reply for example  You got a text email, you know, you and it does look like of course, you know, the developers the developer marketing video  It looks like a pretty  Manageable bit of code that you have to add in there to make your app, you know work with

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And to Google's credit they've they've really made an effort to go cross-platform, you know Game Center or whatever  They call it now the Google Games play games is cross-platform now  All of a sudden Apple folks can use it as well, which was so peeve Apple off a little bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Gina so I'm clear  Does it sound like that it's possible that you could have one of these watches and it would still interact with apps on the iPhone as  well  Through the cloud notification. I mean or would it be this long as this can iPhone app support cloud notification?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I believe so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not sure I'm not sure well be I mean I bet you were headed that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would I guess it would be interesting. I think Google apps do but I'm not sure there's the third party API

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe that's maybe that's the if the watch is pulling because the watch is gonna probably depend on a data connection between  Your phone and if it's like Google Glass  You can use an iOS device to run Google Glass and in fact you have the glass app  And so it would be interesting and really clever and it makes sense with the whole Android wear name now  That if it turns out that there's an Android wear app that you can get for the iPhone that helps you set it up  Because what surprised me was you remember it used to be the Android market, right?  And then Google turned it into Google play which always to me was like, all right  We're kind of losing control of that whole Android thing. So we're gonna put our Google brand back on it  So when they called this Google where I was sort of like Android where I was sort of like, oh, I guess we're all  Embracing Android again rather than you know, Google this Google that  But it is clever if you do that then you can have people who want their Android watch or Android wear device that they use  With their iPhone which then starts thinking oh with an Android thing on my wrist is good  Maybe I should get one of those Android phones that maybe would work even better with it or something. It's  So in the question, it's a really good question

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The  Code that I saw was clearly like extending your Android app to work with Android wear  But you're right my glass there's a my glass out for the iPhone  Correct, and it connects to your glass. Is that true there? The iOS does interact with glass

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you can use there's an iOS app. There's a and I'm pretty sure that I have that on my iPhone  the glass out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is this is actually really exciting if it doesn't it's Apple preventing it. I think Google wants to do it  My glass for it. If you look at the developer site, you can receive voice replies  So you can so if you want to customize it beyond the the kind of simple notifications  It says your your apps will notifications are automatically go to the Android wearables  But you can then have something like say reply and people the system will deliver the text to your app on the phone for sending  On you can add notification  pages  Visible specifically for the wearable  You can stack notifications. That's kind of cool on the wearable and you can geo fence  So you could trigger notifications contextually and that's what was happening  I guess as people were yeah you arrive at the airport and

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pop up with QR code, but you can understand that happening now now. Yep. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  activity detection  Apis will let you know if the user is bicycling for instance. You can gather sensor data  Yeah, display it in real time on Android wearables this to me sounds this this is this is what a wearable should be and

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This sounds like an API to Google now. I mean, you know, we forget Google now is Google's proprietary  It's not part of a OSP  And this and this Android wear, you know this layer where you can get your app to talk to Google to what?  Seems a lot like Google now. I hope that that extends to the phone  I mean I would love to be it for my app to be able to go into you know to plug into Google now as well  I mean essentially Google now might just become like the super widget, you know on your phone like that  You know, we've got widgets, of course, but Google now is kind of becoming the stream of all the contextual things  So so it's interesting to me because I wonder you know is  Android where is there gonna be an open source version of Android wear or is Android where?  Google's proprietary extension that goes on top of you know Android that that apps can talk to you. It sounds like right now  It's it's an extension. It's a layer on top of a OSP

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the other and the other interesting thing too is that it kind of turns Google now potentially into  It kind of lets Google  Potentially centralize all the app notifications. So again, if I go back to the gear my you know  I have an app on my phone  That app talks to my phone and then talks to my watch  To whereas if you're an app developer it may be that you know  Your app is constantly doing things even if the phone's not even on right  So if the app developer is rather than trying to send the stuff wirelessly from the phone to your watch  It's sending it through  Google now or you know that the Google now API whatever and then it pops up as a Google now alert  Yeah, then then Google kind of gets you know  One of the things people have talked about is well Google's gonna lose control because everybody's moving to apps and it doesn't control all  The apps and so okay, we won't control the ass  We'll just control the cloud notification systems for the app so that you know  You have that synchronized notification and the apps can go beyond just being on one device as well  I mean you you could see it going further, right? You're watching TV  Why wouldn't you want an app that has something to tell you necessarily?  To you might want it to pop up on your Google TV or your Google Chromecast or you know, whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry. We missed the  moto 360  Hang out. Did you go to that Danny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I've read a couple of seen it and I think and gadget had a thing on it too and  That it was interesting. They talked a bit about the circular design why they went that way  They said it's because if you have a big watch  If you have a rectangular watch then and it's that large they felt like the circular actually makes it a bit softer  Great. They apparently said women want to have big watches on their wrists, too. So that'll be fine  It's it's not just it is big and watch. It's not just man-sized. Yeah  They talked about the wireless issue, you know that the wireless they talked about how the charge you might happen  It's water resistant not waterproof

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which look at the in the hangout apparently one of the hosts the woman on the right is wearing it  So it as big as it is, it doesn't it's clunky  It's yeah, you know, but but it's not I mean, I don't think it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a style of watch  I like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because the battery it needn't oh, yeah the screen I think it's the battery

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah battery and whatever else radios it might have in it  I mean, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh and they didn't put a camera in because they felt like it wasn't necessary and I have to say that's been  When you go back to the galaxy gear, it's like I mean, it's nice. You got the camera in there for the odd occasion  I want a novelty value, but it's this $300 watch that doesn't  You know that if you dropped all this stuff off would have done, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just as much as I probably needed to have I don't want a camera because I don't want to get beat up in bars

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In San Francisco. Okay, what she's kind of weird anyway, I mean you cut you can't really  Can only be used for selfies I'm assuming it's gonna be weird writing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I have used it and I actually have gotten it's usually we're at like a restaurant and I'm playing and the kids are  Doing something and I just snap a little thing and it's it there are odd cases where it has been  Kind of neat to have because I haven't had to fumble for my phone  I've been able to just do a quick little shot or whatever, but it's so rare, you know, it's kind of like yeah  When I have glass I could just take a picture this way too and there are times when that's useful  But for the most part, you know  My phone is gonna give me a much better picture and and if they had dropped the camera out of galaxy gear and the price  Had come down, you know, that would have been one of the bigger things to think that would have helped with it  What's gonna be interesting now? I think is I just don't I just don't know what  Samsung's gonna do because they're progressing with their galaxy gear thing using their own platform  And then I think Android wear and this is getting way ahead of stuff or whatever  But I think Android wear actually might come across as a much better sort of platform  Even for Samsung users because they can use it with a Samsung phone  So then it's like have they just consigned galaxy gear into to nothingness with this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you know, it's cool if you download the  SDK or the preview SDK it has emulators for square and round  So you can immediately see what what your display is gonna look like in the emulator  And and you'll know, you know, am I gonna get am I gonna, you know cut off the corners? So that's good  I mean, they're they're really preparing people for the idea that it might be on a variety of  Screens I love I am so excited. I  Am right and I think that it's well, it's it's by by gear  Samsung's gotta be gone. All right, and I think if you're Apple you're starting to think  by taking our time here, we're kind of  Getting letting these companies get ahead of us and it's gonna ruin our chance to sue them for copying us  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't know that that's apples going no, that's what they're saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but but they must they must start to feel a little pressure  Golly, you know, these these guys are already iterating and we haven't even hit the starting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Difference I think I think the you know  Everybody's been talking about and now Apple is gonna come along and show you how to do a watch right?  Yeah, maybe that will still happen  But I think Google now is really such the the key to what's going on with Android where Apple doesn't have  Google now they've got Siri stuff and they've got something they can predict and maybe they can come up with a Siri that's sitting on  Your wrist as well  But you know from what I have seen that the Google now data is so much more rich  especially in that it is coupled to  Google going through your email and your calendar and all the other stuff that you do if you've you know agreed for them to go  With that stuff. It just prevails these amazing predictions. And so, you know  Apple I think will feel even more pressure now to turn their watch into basically a Siri watch, you know  If this looks compelling  But then they also have to do much more to try to gather in some of this data and they don't have some of that data  Well, they don't agree. I think experience with some of that data of organizing the information  so then what do you what do you come up with a little bit of barrier of entry right now and

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google now is only good though if you are really hooked in to the Google. Yes, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What a surprise email I wonder why Google would would want you to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it was but it was interesting because we had I did this, you know  we had the the head of Google search and at Sao Gal and he was at our conference last week and I was saying to him so  You know like I was saying so are you gonna finally change the name of the Gmail field trial?  If you remember that was what they did to say you could hook up Gmail to  Let Google go through it and let you to search to power Google now and he says oh no  It's already been that way and I don't remember that happening  Okay, I if it happened to must have gotten past me  But I don't remember at some point where Google said now all your Gmail is being analyzed for Google now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I thought it was still the privacy change. I bet it was in that unified the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Privacy set. Yeah, right. Yeah, and so that's you know, that was a big change

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know seeing Google now's  Cards reminds me of like how much data I've given Google, right?  And that's why Google now is only as good as the data you give it like I've set you know  Where my home is where work is located you can you know, I use Gmail as my primary email. I use calendar  I add locations for calendars time. I add invitations to people who are attending things with me in calendar  You know if you're using, you know  I Cal and your own IMAP server and you know, you're not signed into you know  Google search very much like it Google now isn't as isn't as useful  So, you know, I think there are a lot of iOS users or you know  Who aren't hooked into that and if they you know fired up an Android device and signed in with a Google account that they  Only used to catch spam mail it Google now wouldn't look that compelling. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's it's crazy. I was when we were leaving when I was leaving my  the conference the other thing, you know, it was doing is this coming up and telling me like I  It came up and I was like, I know I need to go catch my flight and I open it up  And it's telling me like you're seven minutes late to leave to go to your flight  Yeah, I'm going that's oh my god. You've calculated where I'm at  You know when my flight is you've estimated how much time it's gonna take for me to get from where I'm at to the airport  and then you've assumed a certain amount of time for me to check in and  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And maybe we're just kind of weird because I know that some people say oh that's creepy  I don't want to give that much to Google  This is what this is what computers were invented to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or I'm looking at it now and it's like telling me, you know, it's like it's like hey, here's your Amazon shipping

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Has gone and that's just that's just from my email, right I searched for jeopardy and now it's telling me when jeopardy's on

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's the that's the challenge say and Apple faces is because in order to get that data  You have to read their email they don't and you know  And then you have to store their email and go through it  Of course  This is the thing that Microsoft puts up against it and this is the thing that involves the suit that Google's going with and just got  Dismissed as a class action, which is you know, even if you're not showing me ads  You're you're reading my email and doing all these things with it  And but you know if you're comfortable handing it over to them you get some pretty awesome stuff that comes back

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, I mean one thing that I find amusing about it is that in it gets confused about how I travel because I sometimes like  And I sometimes drive so it thinks I'm gonna cycle to San Francisco. It'll take me five hours

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I  Think it's great. It's gonna get better and the more data points it gets the better  It'll get and where is gonna take advantage of this all makes sense  Now when you look at what Android where it does this all makes sense. We knew we were at it this way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you seen this stuff?  It says new content available  So this is places I've looked at and the like blogs I read and it's starting to show me somebody's done a new blog

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Notifications, where is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Visited yeah, if it's like if it if it could tell or assume that you have been doing research on a particular area

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, okay  So it's showing me an article that says what might season two of true detective have in store because I did some searches on true detective  But that's not searches that it seems like it's keeping are those searches  This is this is sites you visited

Transcript:  History  Wow, I'll go to X KCD and see if there's a new cartoon and now it now it says oh  There's a you know, it's three days a week here you are. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Completely freaked out my wife I  You know we had talked about on the show how American Idol how you could vote for for the contestants in the Google search results  But it was only during a certain amount of time so we couldn't demo it during the show  So we're watching American Idol one night and I just grabbed my wife's phone  I just bought her Nexus 5 and search for American Idol and then the next night the results  Show was on and she picks up her phone and she switches over to Google now and she goes  Oh my god, Google knows that we're watching American Idol

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's like it's listening to the TV and it knows it's telling me I should vote and I was like no no

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I searched for American Idol on your phone yesterday  But I mean it does do that sometimes if you have the right TV, but it's not doing that now  But they're not using it  Right, it does do that for smart TVs, right doesn't it? It knows what channel you're watching

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does they have a pattern for actually listening to the sound of the TV and does but you have to do it  So what it'll say is I see it does this to me all the time. I see you have a Samsung TV turned on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are you listening? What are you watching? And then you press a button it listens  It has to be live TV if you're DVRing it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The black helicopter part the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Black helicopter part the Google NSA joint venture specs. Yeah

Transcript:  That could be really bad though you have to have a tough but Danny you have to have a TV on your network obviously for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It to see it on the network. No, I you have

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now Google now we'll do that yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll say I know you have a I see you have a Samsung TV on  Yeah, tell me what you're watching yes, so my master I will

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then I'll say hey do you want to vote for your favorite contestant American Idol if you're watching American Idol

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they're showing amazing restraint because in fact they probably do know what I'm watching

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or it says hey we voted for you because we pretty much right who you would have liked anyway, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, you'd like the voice better. I don't know why you're still watching American Idol

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we voted for them

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just put this watch on and we will vote for anybody who's inspiring you and I gotta admit I feel guilty I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Love this and I feel like am I Winston Smith just kind of walking into the brave new world or not mixed metaphors, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you go to something like her right I mean it's it was a great movie  There's all sorts of interesting things that you could talk, but you know you get this assistant  That's helping you do all this stuff and you're going hey, that's nice. You know I've organized. Oh, yeah, it's great  But and Google now does that so on the one hand if it was the science fiction thing you'd be like oh  Isn't that great? I've got this thing or whatever. I think the reason that we  feel  uncomfortable with it is because  In the back of our minds is getting paid for in some way and that's getting paid for with the ads  Which is the whole we are the product here that means I don't have to pay for it. That's great  And lots of people don't care they don't worry about it  But it's you know there is that sort of issue that they they know I mean I just came from a two-day like ad agency  Conference and they are you know here's our latest way to track down people who are watching a particular

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't first of all I gotta say something I would far prefer an ad that reflects my interest in one that doesn't  I don't want to see ads for Fritos coin chips. I don't mind seeing an ad for the hot new computer

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's better you say that but then you go back to that case where the father was trying to understand  Why target kept sending all this stuff for pregnant women to his house and it turned out that his wife was pregnant  That's an outlier. That's an outlier. I know but it's that's an outlier now  But when you start to understand or these sorts of things and you start to really intimately understand  What's going on with people then you can start getting some  Because I want it but it's not that easy because even if you aren't  If you email me then  Different things the profiles are being built up around you even outside of Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let me show you this from 1987 Apple thought this was a good idea. This was a  video they made under John Scully not under  Steve well, maybe Steve was I think this was a Scully production  It was they called it the knowledge navigator  And and this is but this is almost 20 years ago. No 20 so almost 30 years ago  And this is what they envisioned the future of computing looking like and I gotta say  Finally, it's here and I thought this was cool. I wanted this. Yeah  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He said for those of you listening these in your graduate research team in Guatemala just checking in  Robert Jordan a second semester junior requesting a second extension on his term paper. This is his little laptop  I'm reminding you about your father surprise birthday party next Sunday  Today you have a faculty lunch at 12 o'clock  You need to take Kathy to the airport by 2

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Minus the guy in the bowtie on the screen. This is Google now on deforestation in the Amazon rainforest

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I don't really want the guy with the bowtie  Let me see the lecture notes from last semester

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Computers are faster today

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Has visual effects on video effects on the screen which I remember at the time thinking was oh they never do that on

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is this is actually  Amazon and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's effects on rainfall. He's a professor. He's gonna compare

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Being a massive douche if you watch it because he's like oh he's a dick don't put my mom through dip  Oh, let me phone up my colleague who understands Amazon rainforests. So I don't have to do any work for my lecture

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah, he's kind of a dick but  And maybe that was kind of maybe what we thought is somebody who would be doing this can you know?  Obviously is wealthy to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Improve the life of middle-aged white men in the future

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this was apples this was Jeff Raskin stream. This was Apple's dream and I think they really did want to do  Something along these lines

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is the kind of thing douche guy or not that you think that would be really useful and the reason I think that some people  Don't get concerned about that happening is because you paid for it  You probably paid a lot of money for your Apple navigator device or whatever and Apple didn't man

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't know enough about you to make it useful, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so but I agree with you that the Google knows about it very powerful and I both  Give it all this stuff and want to give it even more because it has become incredibly useful and yet  There's still that part of you thinking  Boy, they sure know a lot about me. Yeah, and that's what that's why but that's an evolution  What's been going on with search from the very beginning this I?  Often talk to people about  Search engines they like people like always like well  Why are people just talking to start using Bing and why won't they just go off and you know?  Why can't they stop using something else?  I said well look a search engine is like your best friend that you turn to it every day and ask it things and in fact  Sometimes I ask it things you would not even ask your best friend, right?  And you have built up a relationship with your search engine through these dialogues over the year and your search engine  Predominantly is Google and it's come back with good advice and so when Bing comes along and wants to be your best friend  It literally is like some new person coming right saying hey, who are you?  No, I got a friend

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It already knows about my fungal infection. I don't want I don't want to share that with you being

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Medical problems  Watch where you're dancing somewhere yeah, and so and so Google now is really becoming even more this  Personalization of search I mean search has never been that you just put in keywords although again  That's predominantly been how it's done  But you know it is another extension of search and it is another extension of our relationship with Google  They've yet not given it a cutesy name  Which is odd right because Microsoft is going to have their Cortana and we have Siri and Google now  Google now continued to be this product where it's not an application  But it's something else, but it's a technology  And I feel like they haven't quite closed the loop on what that is and maybe we'll we'll get a name closed it in their

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Minds, but they haven't closed it  Yeah, it really does feel as if this has all been strategized that Larry's been Larry has this on a whiteboard somewhere from 10

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They talk about the Star Trek computer. They've talked about this in public  They did it at IO last year and their idea is the computers always there in the background  And it knows when you're talking to it, and then it gives you something helpful  Or it will write it will say you know Klingons off the Star Wars bow or something if there's something actually happening

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why I have a smart toilet because I want that kind of information we're gonna take a break and come back  Yeah, take a break. We got to take a break. This is really good conversation  Danny Sullivan's here Kevin Marx is here Gina Trippani more to come in just a bit  Including what could be bad news on Google Voice, and this is the other side to me  This is the only dark side  But I heard you talking about last night and we're gonna talk more about in just a second  But first a word from personal capital. Here's an example of how giving information to a site  Can be very very useful if you're trying to keep track of your financial life  And you've got it on 18 different sites with 18 different passwords the idea of making it one dashboard  Where you can see all the information in a single place and then act on it is just fantastic  And that's exactly what personal capital does  It's a wealth management tool you may say, but I'm not wealthy  Well, guess how you get wealthy by paying attention to where your money is what it's doing how much you're paying in fees  Get an investment check out find out what your fees are costing get great insights and great ideas for  Investments that you could make unbiased financial advice so that you can  Become at least well enough off to retire wouldn't we all like that now's the time  Personal capital comm if you visit personal capital comm slash twig you can sign up for this absolutely free  You it costs you nothing and I I promise you you will get some benefit. I started using this  It's been now it's almost two years ago when Bill Harris who created the company  Was on our show on triangulation, and I'm just a huge fan. I know you're gonna like this personal capital  comm slash twig it's free and  It you will thank me maybe not today. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe in 10 20 30 years, but you will thank me personal capital comm slash  twig  The only thing I don't see any negative to giving Google all my personal information. I  Love it. I love the benefit I get out of it the negative isn't  whatever targeted ads or  Finding out my wife is pregnant which when I didn't know it the benefit the the thing I worry about is Google killing this stuff  I'm dependent on it  That's what I'm worried about now. I hear that Google Voice may be on the block  I'm happily owned by Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that distinction really true I mean you can pay for a service and the company could decide it's just not good enough business

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, right. I mean that isn't really difference between yeah, but the benefit but what's the benefit I get from Google paid or not  It's not that I don't have to pay for it  That's not the benefit to Google because I gladly pay for it  The benefit is that by aggregating all the information they get from all these different sources they can make an amazing big data

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Discoveries that are valuable to me. So fact that that doesn't sorry good. No you go ahead  Well, I was gonna say and that doesn't go just to them being able to target you  But it also goes to why it is so incredibly difficult for someone to compete with them because aside from the best friend thing  You know you you had the whole  Anti-trust lawsuit thing that happened which I always found laughable because it was competitors complaining  They weren't getting enough traffic from Google itself  Which to me was like  NBC complaining that CVS wasn't airing enough of its shows, you know, it was absurd  The the real reality if you were gonna go after Google and anti-trust grounds to what anti-trust to my understanding  Originally came out of was you didn't want to have a manufacturer owning all the elements of production  You didn't want the railroads owning all the land alongside the railroads owning all the things that made the railroads which provide the energy  for the railroads and that you know  He didn't want to have them to have all this stuff because they can conduct a thing where somebody else can't compete and  And Google has so much data in so many ways  That is incredibly difficult for someone like a being to go through and compete when or I can harness all the stuff in his email  Or an Apple, right? But Apple's not trying to compete with them in terms of being Apple's taking the opposite tech

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to be the privacy company, but there's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Disadvantage making that your goal, but it's not I mean the Apple's taking the the view by and large that we're gonna produce  great devices  Google is producing great  So if you want applications, you wouldn't call it applications, but search is an application  Google now is an application information is an application and so  You and you can also argue that they could both survive this because even if Google's devices are terrible  The information application that they provide can show up on anybody else's stuff  And in fact does show up on all sorts of Apple devices and even if Apple's information is lacking  It as a beautiful hardware manufacturer could tap into if it wants to all the Google stuff that's out there as well  And they haven't really totally solidified, you know where they're just completely separate you can't do it  There's a lot of reasons why they can still work together  I think the challenge tends to be like if you're somebody who wants to compete on the information side  You know Google potentially has a weakness that they're not as good if you don't use their email, right?  So, you know what what what do they do in that case to kind of pull you in and get that sort of information?  Or what does somebody want to compete with them pull in the email and do some of that stuff as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the reason I'm worried is because for instance  Google Voice  Which I live by in fact, I just told somebody about and he was all excited  He moved all this stuff to Google Voice and now I see from nine to five Google  Mm-hmm that they're planning to move it to hangouts now you might say oh, well, that's not a problem  They just move it to hangouts except they also moved other things to hangouts and it didn't not all of it went with it  like Google Talk  So I'm concerned about features disappearing. I heard you talking about this yesterday and all about Android Gina

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, we did I mean look hang out the promise of hangouts was always that it was gonna be Google's unified messaging service  Right, so you can see in that screenshot a Chad's got up, you know  The icons keep disappearing Google Google Talk went away Google Messenger went away. It all got rolled into hangouts  But we still got Google Voice out there now  I mean look anybody's been paying attention anybody that uses the Google Voice app particular on Android can see that it is just old and  Creaky it has not been updated. The design is just old  They have not been putting work into updating Google Voice the app  So there so now they're saying good night if I Google's reporting that word on the street  Is that Google Voice is going to get rolled into hangouts and we're already starting to see some of that  Like I somebody just called me before and in my computer rang, you know, yeah, that's fine  That's fine. Don't mind that but if the Google Voice Android app goes away  That means hopefully it means that all the features of voice go into hangouts. That means voice mail with transcriptions  Call forwarding filters blacklist whitelist. I mean that Google Voice is such a great powerful application. I love it  It is my primary number  It has been since since it was Grand Central and yeah  I mean my worry here is that some of the features are gonna get lost in  Translation lost in the transfer over and we saw that happen with with Google Talk, right?  And we saw what happened to Jabber and XMPP said and  Yeah, I'm kind of I'm worried because this is this is not like we have my life has it's not like we haven't seen Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kill stuff that we love before Google reader Google Wave  They're capable of that. And so that's the other side by the way, let me show you the upside of  Google owning the world. I am on this article from nine to five Google and I go along and say hey, wow  That's a neat coincidence. There's the ad for the gentleman's Emporium  I just visited for the first time ten minutes ago to look for fake mustaches  well, of course, of course, it's a Google ad and  But that's fine I would rather see that than an ad for lawn furniture  That's stuff. I'm looking for that makes sense for everybody  All right human hair mustaches. Yeah cheap ten bucks  reusable  What are you laughing at it's time for the Google change law  Oh  Gina Trippani has the latest from the Googleverse

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well beside the big Android wear preview announcement this week a couple of other new things happened  First Google your search results on Google comm and your desktop are looking a little cleaner a little nicer Google rolled out the rare  Redesign with a few nice updates. I like the Burgess headline on this  Yes, the Burgess headline is Google remote removes underlined links says goodbye to 1996  So your links are no longer underlined unless you hover over them with your mouse

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It used to be that's how we would know it was a link is because it was underlined, right? That's right. That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's still that old-school default browser blue  Which I love and the following links are purple

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the things that the green links they put underneath are not actually clickable  Which is really what because I always try and oh that is annoying. They were never clickable that breaks

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That breaks the web that's wrong. If it has a dot or dot com app on it. It should be never clickable

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because they were never clickable  They were never clickable  Hasn't happened for 15 years  but the reason you know that the design is interesting because I  Asked the guy in charge of Google search about this. It's just an experiment and then the next day they're like, okay now it's official  It's a quick experiment. Seriously the next day you had to make it official. You just couldn't say it but  the  You would better ask the question of why do you have the URL listed when you also have a link and the answer is?  Because people  Yes people they they have found people look at that URL to help interpret whether or not they want to go to the search results  That's actually very useful the other thing aside from the thing  Can you generate the search results again and bring up an ad, you know, just search for mesothelioma or anything that will have lots of ads  The other really significant change is can you spot the ad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it says ad there's a big yellow

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And at first you'll think oh it says ads because it's got that big ad next to it but the ads previously had a  Delineation box around them. They had colored boxes, right? There's a still a little little thin line little hard little tiny  Well, yeah, but there's a delineation. So we're good. But  Initially my feeling was well, yeah  You how could you miss those big orange ads you go back and start searching now after about a week and I found myself  Struggling to understand was that an ad or not? I had to seek out to identify that so  Yeah, they made they may change it a bit more well, yeah because they like cards on Android, right?  right  Maybe the next thing that will happen is the ads will turn into cards at desktop as everything turns into mobile  So that eventually there won't be a mobile everything will just be  Same things again, but I think that that change that they made is significant and I think it is likely to  Confuse people too. Yeah, I think I think over time people will stop thinking about that stuff as ads  But then there's other things going on there where it's do a search for nest thermostats, by the way  You like this if it comes up? Oh  All right, you have to show me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nest no not nest but nest thermostats. Okay, I'm doing it. I'm doing it Chad

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There you go. Yeah, that's it. Now come over there. Oh, wow. It went right to nest  Hey click on the thermostat and spin it around see the icon. Oh  Yeah, so that is like a whole new ad unit that they have tossed in that wasn't there before but you probably don't  Anticipate that look like an ad unit because it looks a lot like the knowledge graph boxes that they have over there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does it says sponsored but it does

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't I don't love this  Feel like trickery

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a sponsored

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and if you go back to the mesothelioma  Example the right  Column has ad but it only has ad once and then oh shoot. I gotta type it in again  mesotheli  Why did you suggest such a really hard to type name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because as my joke goes all those auto driving cars and Google Glass get paid for these  You go  $100 per click this is right they make them expensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the ad there it does say ads at the top of the column once but then the rest of the column does not and so  If you scroll down a little bit you aren't seeing ads  On the left, but you are seeing ads on the right, but it's not clear. There's no distinction at all now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Technically they're labeled but I think that over time people will probably ignore  People already struggle anyways with the old system you would do surveys and people wouldn't necessarily care and to some degree you can argue

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't matter right if long as the information is relevant. It matters to me. I don't want to I don't want you don't want to intermix those  That's I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Be like a big hunk and green box. Yeah. Yeah, it was green that it was orange

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was purple and you know, they go through all sorts of things. Yeah, it's like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you think those could be blocked by ad blocks for a blocking program? So, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, unless you're using the ad blocking program that Google has a deal with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, right. So these are high quality ads. We're not blocking those by your way out of that. Yeah plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, continue on more in the Google change log. Yes. So so no Andrew line links and some other tweaks  bigger typography and better line spacing so cleaner results Google says  Next change so last week  We talked about this class action lawsuit by this mom who had handed her Android device tablet to her five-year-old who then  Purchased like $70 worth of in-app purchases from a game  Well the Google Play Store application on Android got an update or an update is rolling out. I should say  new version  4.6.1 six has a new setting the Play Store you can require a password for every purchase  You can or sorry the setting is called require packed password and you can say set it to every purchase  After 30 minutes or never require a password  So a little more control over how easy it is to spend money on these apps and hopefully, you know  Your five-year-old doesn't know how to change that setting  That's rolling. That's rolling out in the stages right now  Google Drive  Storage costs less now than it ever has the monthly prices have been reduced to two dollars per 100 gigabytes  Ten bucks for one terabyte and a hundred bucks for ten terabytes  This is these are down. This is down. This is a 199 400 gigabytes. That's down from the previous  499 new that new $10 plan is down from $50. I mean these are big reductions and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's huge is yeah one might almost say anti-competitive huge  Right at what point is it dumping?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, right. I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The price of hard drives, but yeah  Well, it becomes dumping when it's so undercuts the competition that everybody moves over and then they raise the price back up

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right Google says that they made some infrastructure changes  Which made it cost-effective for them to lower these prices and they're passing on savings to consumers and  It's a pretty amazing deal. I have to say yeah Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I can buy a terabyte drive for $120  So actually I'm by a terabyte driver $60  Yeah, so I could you know, I could buy a local drive for that and have it in six months

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So think about what Google's costs here's that here's how you know, whether it's dumping is it below Google's own cost?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right and the difference is is I think part of the difference is they used to store this stuff in Bigtable  Which made six copies of it and was  Complicated and was required to be more than one place  And they have done some new storage architecture so that it is actually cheaper  Okay at one point it was it wasn't it wasn't just raw storage on one server because Google is designed to be very many copies  Yeah, yeah  So I think the part of this is is what they said we've we've re-architected the bulk storage piece of this and this is behaving better

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That the challenge I find with it is that I have I mean I already have like a terabyte or two terabytes or whatever  That came with the the Chromebook  but my Mac book only has 500 gigs and  I'm I'm I'm getting to that point where I need and I have all you know  I've got terabytes out of my ears with all the external drives around me  but I don't regularly have them hooked up and you know, I I'm getting to that point where I want to have the  physical Google Drive like a that is  Constantly talking and keeping it in sync because I love having the remote backup  I would especially you know  But I kind of need the physical side on my other end as well because I don't trust Google  I wouldn't trust anybody would just I'll leave it all in the cloud  But I don't have that or you know, if you get on like a MacBook Air  I'm down to like 256 gigs  So I can't have all that with me and so, you know  I would like to have that that that terabyte drive that's talking and maybe I can set it up and it's you know  I just need to get around to doing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like it's it becomes a viable backup solution  Yeah at that cheap. It's less than Amazon s3, right? So it's I  Can move I'm now saying maybe I should I have about 500 gigabytes of images over the last 12 years  Maybe I should just put all my images on Google Drive instead of somewhere else

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well see and that's but that's one of the frustrating thing that's happened and I've talked with Google about this before I need to  Get back to but you know, you do have a lot of storage that they give to you through Google plus photos  but the difficulty is  I have got photos  I pulled off my camera and I had the photos that I've auto uploaded and I have them being basically stored in two different places  And when you ever try to go back through and use Google plus photos to sort through the stuff, it's a nightmare  You know, they've improved it but it's still one of these things where it's hard to scroll through all that stuff and I have a whole  I call it, you know trying to get to a better digital shoebox  I did a CNET article about this thing so I've explained like and this is where I put all my folders and they're by date  And I you know, I'm I can get to stuff with it but it's that remote backup that sort of a challenge and  it's I  Want the storage to follow up with a better way of locating things and when it comes to documents  It's not so much of an issue, right? I don't necessarily care because it's textual. I can find it with the photos. It's like, oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just back up though  That's all I I wish they hadn't killed Picasso web or weren't in the process of killing Picasso web because that was a nice

Transcript:  Ever picks didn't make it and ever picks died. Yeah, Google Google's presumably more stable than than ever picks. Yeah  Continuing on I'm sorry last item in the chainsaw  Last week we talked about a bug in Android KitKat that caused some apps that access your camera to just suck the life out of  Your battery the main app being Skype. Well, Google's working on an update to Android to fix that problem. But in the meantime  Microsoft released an update to Skype for Android which introduces aggressive battery savings  they say it includes a workaround for this KitKat bug and  In an order to save it to not kill your battery with Skype installed  It had to it had to basically disable instant notifications of messages and group chats  Which you can turn on in settings, but with the warning that it will it will affect your battery  So if you want to install Skype because you have that KitKat problem  You should be able to reinstall the new version which I believe is version  I don't know what version number it is. You'll see it in the Play Store and you won't have that camera battery drainage problem anymore  That's all I got and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's the  Google Chainsaw  Easily easily is thank you Gina  YouTube is apparently building a  Version of itself for ten-year-olds. I thought that's what YouTube was. Maybe I'm wrong  They want creators to create child-oriented  content, this is all from Jessica lessons the information a  Version of YouTube for those under 10 is actually a great idea  Because yeah, you don't want little kids to be browsing YouTube

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I believe that it's it's based off of  You know one how many times you flag how many times you flag correctly? Yeah, it'd be in it  I want to does get pulled you don't want a bad flagger. It kind of reminds me a lot about what  Matt cuts was saying with the content ID that we were explaining  You know humans are good at this right and we always get put back up with content ID  and so it should it should care more for people who  constantly get back up and it seems like that's what they're doing is if you flag then it does get pulled Google has given roughly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  200 people in organizations the ability to flag up to 20 videos at once and  Presumably when they're flagged by those organizations they get special care  By the way, this includes the UK Metropolitan Police's counterterrorism internet referral unit  It's it's getting rid of extremist videos apparently

We we got that point now  But yeah, just to completely it just shows you how much things have progressed in seven years where Hollywood has gone from  everything's infringing us we've got to shut it down to  You know what we've had now seven years is apparently enough time to get to the new reality  And I'm not taking away from the fact that Google's had to catch up and make changes to make that happen  But what a transformation from you just deal all our content to we probably ought to stop suing somebody that we actually partner with  All other stuff as well and I said no money changed hands

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I forgot to mention that Google and Viacom's lawyers bought a very nice country home on the proceeds  Yeah, but I love this by the way at the bottom of the recode article Peter Kafka apparently made a very nice  Recode article Peter Kafka apparently makes the note that the CEO of Viacom son Philippe Daumont  Works for Google and has since 2007 Kafka Twitter tweeted no more awkward chatter for Philippe and his son  To which Philippe's replied the son replied finally I can go home for Thanksgiving this year  Just kidding almost forgotten the suit was still on I guess they don't talk about that on a regular basis  He's Philippe is working on the wallet program  By the way, I I got a problem with my Google Wallet  Maybe you guys can help us  Oyster you've heard of oyster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is it is an odd thing to do it that we does there's no real-world analog for and it doesn't even make sense because  I didn't I don't own it, but I can have it on my device

Transcript:  Google Play as I mentioned has has got iOS multiplayer support now  I am amazed that Apple allowed that given that they have a directly competitive  product  But it's great for those of us who use Android devices and iPhone their iOS devices. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they they launched Chromecast in the UK

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Today today we got

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have BBC iPlayer support for it, which would be really cool if I'm so jealous

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  see my goal is to get get a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google Chromecast from the UK then just bring it back here, but then you still have to fake the IP address

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yeah, you still need a need to see a channel on the device  you're sending it from and on the Chromecast under the IP address the Chromecast gets so you need it on both which is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kind of annoying the only reason I want the iPlayer because it lets you see all the BBC stuff. Yeah. Yeah, I want to see  VPN use that I'll look it up for you. We have one pro XPN one of our sponsors has a London  Server so you just go through their London server in your local

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel guilty at the router level so that both the devices can see it. That's the problem, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just feel guilty doing that don't feel guilty. The British taxpayer is happy to foot that bill

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Happily pay a BBC license fee and cancel my my comcast subscription if they'd let me you know what you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the only oh, that's the that's the struggle  I mean don't going far afoot but that is the struggle is that  There are so many people who would happily pay the BBC directly and it's not even just the case where the BBC is like stupid  It's difficult when the BBC has cut a big deal to distribute its content through BBC America  Right, right. So then it's like they can't sell those sorts of things and you just like but they do but they sell them on iTunes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They sell individual shows

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Briefly briefly because we covered it on other shows  But I'd be nice since we've got of smart people here about this thing that the US is gonna give up control  Of the DNS root zone is gonna let I can float freely  Good or bad Vince Earth of  Google and one of the fathers of the internet said no, this is good. You don't want a government running the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  um, I think you know  You don't you don't necessarily want a coalition of international governments doing it either

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the problem is we're benign we least think we're benign

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but we no longer think we're benign is that is the other problem?  The NSA is ruined that forever NSA is completely ruined that so  Good thing in that respect. I think  Cuz given the fact given all the stuff they've been doing about zero days and so and you can imagine them  Finding a way to strong on that. So if we can find a way for them not to do it, that would be good, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  Then the and the Department of Commerce who's been running it up to now says we're not gonna let Russia or some you know  We're not gonna let some rogue nation do it  We're not gonna let the United Nations do it which is seems like a likely  Scenario we want it to be a you know cross-governmental  not non governmental body I  Don't know  Yes, it does I understand why that why people want that  All right, I think it's time to do to take a break and get our tool and tip and  number and Danny Sullivan's thingy  Our show today brought to you by legal zoom comm if you've got a plan to start a business and this would be a good  Time to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is I mean this this the Google voice thing reminded me of this  Because the challenge there is this sort of tricky problem of how do I contact people?  Because we have various different identifiers different systems  We also different apps for doing it and how we get in touch with them and the other ones are all trying to sort of  The the the you know Apple and Google and Facebook are all trying to take over your text messaging  Each of their apps will take it over if you let them  And one of the things we talked about at indie webcam last week  Was how to turn this inside out and make it people focused so I put a link here to something Tantech wrote up about this  And this is this is an interesting way of inverting it. So what what he says is  What you can do is you can go to someone's website and you can add them to your home page  And if so if you go to Kevin marks.com and do add to home page on Android or whatever you get a little face there  Is that that that's shot in the middle  Because I've set my fabric onto my face and a bunch of these people have done that too  But the next phase of that is how would we make this work for someone who wants to contact me?  Because at the moment, you know, you can do it on Android  You know you can do it on Android I can add I can pull someone out of my address book on Android and put them into  The on the desktop, but then it only gives me the ways of contacting them that I've already got in my address book  It's assuming that the Google mediated contacts is the correct answer. That's easy. You just use finger  Right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See that's why we need finger back

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Go ahead. No, but fingers email base. So that's that that's assuming email is addressing  And  It used like we've got these like public identifiers that have email and phone numbers  But if you have that you can you can pass to me one way or another you can make physical objects make noise at me  or

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can fill up my inbox with stuff like that bird, which seems a little upset right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's just like I think he's mating  Baby birds

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apologize Matt is everybody else who hates birdsong if you're driving in DC traffic right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So so what I came up with was the idea of okay if you click on my website  What if you get a set of icons?  For the apps that we both use that we can contact me and we put them in the order that I'd like to be contacted  so  And then it was he's was working through the ideas of how we can make this work because you can actually put a link  On a web page that launches these apps one way or another there are different URLs for this  So work so if you've got the app installed then  Kicking on the link will work if you haven't it won't work, but you won't click a link  You haven't got installed so it's okay to put the other ones and so naturally you'll match out the ones that you want  So it's a sort of quite a subtle idea of saying I will serve a little web page to you  That has the icons of the apps that I use and you'll recognize the ones that you click on them  That's a great idea  It's pulling it back from  Everyone has to have everything in there in their address books and everyone's got a copy for an else's details  To I'm managing this and sharing that with you  The downside is you're publishing your contact details on your website  but the answer would be to publish the only ones you care that you don't mind anyone clicking on and you can still reject the cool and  potentially later if they've you know it you can do a login based version of this so you can see different people can see different things but  It was it is an interesting different way of thinking about that that that problem and it's a problem  We have all the time is like how should I ping this person at the moment?  and that's  That I thought I thought that was interesting. So I find you know half the time even with my kids  I'm not sure the rest be using Facebook or hangouts. What would you use as the?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Canonical name though for these people  Would you use their email address?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you don't need to that's the point the point is you use their website so okay your website you use a URL

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, is Kevin Marks calm or tentative everybody has to have a canonical URL  But everyone has your but you could specify that in your Google profile for instance as I do. Yeah as you do, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well you I like that idea a lot. There's some other  There's a there's a bigger decision tree about how I contact someone then what's their preference and what I have access to you  I mean, do I want to tweet, you know 140 characters publicly to Leo? Do I want to send him a link?  I can't DM that I have to email. You know what I mean? Like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So but you could you could put all that in but you can if you see the set of icons that that that  Ten takes saying he supports and you can say well, I love what he used that one  And it'll stop using the one that he's not doesn't actually read. This is a missed opportunity for the sites like about dot me  Yes, well about me is a missed opportunity because it's it's  now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know somebody who bought them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Yahoo. I'll bought them then they bought it back. I think and then the another one was just sold

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it had a weird name that I can't remember so right but you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the you know, the deeper indie web thing is no have your own your old don't have something that can be sold  Because then it all goes away, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we should all have a canonical URL  Yes, is so is is Tantac gonna move forward in a way would these be done with?  Xf what is it Xf CN F?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well Xf n is part of this so you do yeah except if um  Let's keep getting into the into the techie weeds a bit  So Xf n is just a link between sites saying this is me or this is my friend or whatever  So you would use roll me links for these? Yes, because they're saying this is me elsewhere  And one of the ways you verify roll me is you make sure both of them point in mutual directions if I point to Twitter  And Twitter points back to my home page  Then I'm I'm verified the connection from both sides and so you can actually use that for all for one of the tricks  We use for the indie web is India or the way  I can use my home page to log in despite not having an auth server because I linked to Twitter and Twitter links back  So if I log in with Twitter, you can know it's me  So  It's a way of putting of using all the effort that these big companies put into maintaining all servers  But still being able to use your own domain  So there's there's that idea  But this this is a extension of that this is saying my domain is you know  The default place to find me and here's a set of links to ways to connect to me  so I think that's it was interesting in the light of the  the Google voice thing  Because they're that they're trying to coalesce the different icons down into one  you know that was there was that one of those posts was and taking the icons and then reducing them down to one and  The problem is that is removing the heuristic of how am I contacting this person which you do by clicking it?  Right, you know if I kick the hangouts like on there  I'm not sure if it's gonna make a video call or send an SMS or make a text message  And if it absorbs voice it could do voice as well. So that's that's potentially problematic  I'm  Facebook does the other way around they have a separate messenger and a separate Facebook app and now they have

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that seemed to be similar with the confusion that I still find people dealing with when it comes to  Apple messages. It's like did I send a text message or did I do this?  I message thing and I didn't know which way it happened to which way it went  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's it. I just messages. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now we're gonna take a break when we come back your picks your tips your numbers of the week  I love this idea. We definitely need this and I hope 10 tech who has  The the clout to do it does something and we will promote it like crazy if he does. Yeah, I  Think it's a great idea. We need some some way of it. That's what finger was by the way  protocol long lost in the annals of  Somebody email address it would give you that their plan. Yeah  Somebody email address it would give you that their plan. Yeah. Yeah, I had a plan. I used to have a plan. Oh  I don't remember what it was  Right now I just my plan is to have a nice meal  Go home put on my slippers that kind of thing  We're gonna get back with more with Kevin and Danny and Gina  But first I want to talk a little bit about square space comm a better web  For all starting at your website  Squarespace is the best hosting never goes down really high quality, but the best software as well  In fact, one of the things I love about square space sometimes, you know, we see companies that do web hosting  And offer some form of site builder and they all the sites look the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it's funny as we had a video when we interviewed on it's go again  They had the head of Google search  I mean I was interviewing on stage and they we started out with this little video of all the things that Google conversation search could do  And this was how the video ended and everybody laughed  But I don't think anybody thought it was real. So no one so it's been out there for at least a week  Nobody actually tried it until today. That's so funny. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's so funny, yeah down down left right left right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cheap mode unlocked unlimited free Google searches. I love that. If only it were true  Yeah, am I wrong isn't there a BA in there?  You're absolutely right. Yeah, I'm surprised. It's a short. It's the short code  It's a shortcut. I love it. So thanks Danny. Very nice  Kevin you you have said many things but you have not yet said a thingy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So my thingy is 2048. Have you guys seen this yet? No, what's happening then?  No, it's not a year. It's a game. So I go to the first link. So this is 2048. So you  You either hit arrows and you got to curl us the numbers together. Oh, it's like threes  It is like threes exactly except it's twos, which are much nicer than threes could have all that pink blue white crap  much more easily  so this is  The danger of this is that you will spend hours doing this now because I I have fallen victim to this  2048 this week you did yes. Holy moly. So you're doubling

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Every time but to get to 2048. It's a lot of doubling. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jiminy, you know, I clearly I have to have pressed it the key at least 2048 times to work  At least 2048 times is there a is there a trick to this like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it better to always go up for instance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I find it's better to try and keep things at the bottom always go left left left down right down  Like like like that you want to go down  Okay, and then care less them and then every now and then you have to move it up  But try not to but anyway, yeah, Gina this will eat your brains. It's a very program re game. So  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh my god, this is awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But then  This then then there are variations on a theme. So so the next link is  Doge 2048  So if you go to that one  It takes away the numbers. Yeah and replaces them with different doge graphics  So as you coalesce the doges you get different pictures of coalesce the doges  and this um  This is even more relaxing and also it's even more relaxing and it says little doge things to you as you as you mocha lesson  um  So I haven't actually won this one yet because I realized that I was gonna win it in a bad way  Well, you you win it by getting to 2048 which in the doge's case  Um, i'm not sure what the last dog is because I haven't got that far yet  But get to they get sunglasses and different things on them. Um, and then someone did the next one  Which is the doctor who edition?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because there are the right number of doctors because due to the 13 is 2048  So you start off with william hartnall and then you you keep coalescing doctors together until you get um, here's my

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's my favorite version  You also have this jenny peng's version

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So jenny pengs this one starts with 1024 in every square I win  Win

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't lose

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Add a few performance yo

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. All right. All right, then there's the next one. Yeah  Um, this was well if that's too easy for you. Oh, she's louise. Can you get to nine? No  Oh, so one nine two five four, which is a pair of two and it's a really big board  um  I can't even fit it on my screen  It doesn't fit on the mobile phone anymore. Um  so  This one is actually easier because there's too there's too much space, right?  So you just keep just you can just hit any arbitrary key and it'll basically work. It's easier, but it takes a long time  But obviously you're not going to get to that number because that would take you like 30 000 years. So  Don't play this version. No, I want to win

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, i'll see you in 30 000 years

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you imagine if you get all the way and then and then you it fills up and you can't get to the number

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a feeling it's going to crash and overflow actually fails by them by them filling up

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The number of tiles isn't that high anyway, so but so there's a couple things  One is this is a terrible brain virus that will that will lose hours of your time. This number by the way is nine quadrillion

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Seven trillion one hundred ninety nine billion two hundred fifty four million seven hundred forty thousand nine hundred and ninety two

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There we go. I'm not sure what's two to the power of what though. That's uh, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's your next challenge. Ladies and gentlemen chat room get to work  Is there flappy bird 2048? Yes, there is you ready to play?  Of course there is of course there is where's the link where's the link i'm in the wrong chat room

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it even made xkcd today. That's how famous this thing is now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, man, I guess I got I got booted out of my own chat room  So  So much for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  um, so but the the other fascinating thing for me is that um  This version, you know, there were versions of this before but this version actually works really well on mobile  Um because the swipe gestures work with it. Um, and it it runs, you know, whoever wrote wrote the the original one gapriel  serendly  Um did a good job of making integrating the swipe gestures and making it responsive responsive. So i've i've been i've been playing it on you know on  Phones and tablets and things as well as on the brown on the desktop  You can just use arrow keys on the phone  You just use swipe in the direction because it coalesces in the direction you swipe  um, but the other fascinating thing is um  It loads much faster than threes does so i'm not sure what three is doing while it's animating that little word at the bottom

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding because this is really not that complicated. Um, but it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's also a marker for a web app versus mobile app, which is one of those eternal debates  It's a marker that the web platform is  Is at a point where you can actually build a game that that takes over lots of people's brains  I've definitely seen this sort of gradually eating the geek community over the last week  I've done my bit to make that worse. So there we go. I love this xkcd

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The talk this is this will be a uh, a very joke for very smart people in in a few weeks  The talk is in room 8 2 2 4 what oh nice  Sorry, nothing  Great now spend the rest of my life life noticing numbers that would make good 2048 comp  8 2 2 4

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't you love xkcd squish the twos into the four and the four into the eight  Because that's the satisfying thing is when you get one you're poking them around and then suddenly you get like  This set of powers of two that you can collapse together. So you  You have two ways to go to a 16 it goes to the 16 and the 16 goes to 32 and 64 and it goes  Shh so it's it is a very um, it's two to the 63

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  9.22 quintillion, it's ever two to the 63 ladies and gentlemen

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, so someone else is are there cheats for it? Um, there is a long discussion on stack overflow about the best algorithm for um solving it  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, there's a long discussion on stack overflow

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I just got 1024 on the big one  On that one. Yeah, that one's easy. Yeah, you've got you still got to go to two to the 63  But I got two 500s, which I can't imagine how many left rights it took to get to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You might be able to get to nine quintillion pretty easily. Actually, I don't know if it takes 30 years  Jeff, I want you to work out a program for figuring out how long it will take

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to hit the key at least that many times or at least half that many times  So you have to hit the key two to the 62 times which is a lot of times. No, no, it's just 62 times

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, oh  If you were really lucky

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, because it only drops in it only drops in two floors. Okay, so it doesn't drop in anything bigger  Okay, so right I get two to the 61 times you could get away with if you got a lot of force

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh god

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I should have done jeff's thingy last. I apologize. This is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't  Pretty cool this freaking game  Totally, can I real quickly just throw throw in a pic of the week if you are on android?  This is really cool mark hansen who does twit pro for android?  Said it was too much to add  chromecast support for  the twit pro app  Um, because it blew it up by several quite a few megabytes. So he's made a standalone app twit cast for chromecast  That is very simple. You just put it on your android device  You need of course a chromecast device and those of you in the uk now can use this as well  And you can send the live video or the downloads directly  to your chromecast device  Thank you mark for doing that. That is really a nice thing to do  And we really appreciate it twit cast on the play store  And of course after you send it to your chromecast you can control it very nice and it's free  Although there are in-app purchases. I'm not sure what you get. Let's see. What do you get with the in-app purchase? I don't know  Be here somewhere. What's new?  Those birds are quite it is spring is in the air  Ladies and gentlemen, we just better wrap this thing up. Otherwise, it is like the thing in snow crash

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That just selects severe tax programmers, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes  It's a brain worm

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a brain worm. I have to load up this web page before I get on the subway tomorrow  I'll play this all the way to work. Well, i'm sure there's a version on android  Yeah, there's got to be right. I think there's an official that's in an app. Yeah, but but there's no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's no 24. It works as a web page because it just caches everything because it's a yeah  It doesn't need to download anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no 2048 on android. I find that hard to believe

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well then someone's made an app for it. Yeah, there's a record for it. Oh, yeah. Okay, so you can get the app

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a lot of them. Holy cow. You can just keep

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other thing I realized when using this was that um, Jesus

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what? It's happened. It has captured all the programming cycles of the world  They've now written three thousand twenty forty eight apps and more to come. These are all 2048 apps  Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow  Right. I've had to say oh, it's a web app. I can make a make an app for it  It's like why would you need to no, but the other thing I realized while playing it was that  The other reason that ios people hate web apps is that if you click a link on ios from facebook or twitter  You don't get to the browser you get a web view inside the app  And if twitter goes to sleep and wakes up again, you lose that web view  Which means if you start if you click the link into 2048 and twitter  And then you know the doorbell rings and you put your phone in your pocket you come back and you've lost the game in progress  And that was really annoying. So I suddenly realized oh  This is why ios people hate web apps because half the time they're not actually in the browser when they click on the link  Whereas android people always are in the browser  So that was that was one of those like subtle platform affordances things

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you for joining us for this insane edition  This was lots of fun kevin marks  Uh, where where could people find out more about this great initiative you're doing with the independent with the indie web?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, if you go to indiewebcamp.com, that's that's the best place to to look up that um  Indie web camp we run events every so often. We just have one in san francisco. There's one in new york in april  Um, there's some others planned for portland and possibly paris and definitely brighten  So there's there's more of them there and there's a good set of links there. There's also an irc channel  Um that's linked off that page to talk to people but there's that that's the best place to start definitely indiewebcamp.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're starting to gain momentum. Aren't you? This is great

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, well, there's a there's a nice page on there which we call generations and this has been a bunch of geeks doing geeky things  And you have basically had to write code to do any of it for a while  one of the nice things about  the last indie webcam is that um  Dan  Dan gilmore and scott rosenberg came along and were able to get themselves up and running on indie web just using off the shelf  Wordpress and some plugins and things and connecting up to this so  But our sense is that it's getting to the point where you don't actually have to have your own site to do this  You don't have to write your own code to do this  But that was definitely the you know the design center for it. It's it's very much community that was built around  Um, no, let's actually build things rather than talking about building things and that that's been  In its dna and that that means it took a while to ramp up but we've now got lots of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um people building things with it here here is the uh, the official most recent picture and look who's on the computer  That looks like a familiar face  Uh there on the computer. What?  It's bear it's bad. Yeah. Yeah, it's bad. Mike Taylor bare remote attended. Yeah, of course he did bear doesn't leave his cellar anymore  Nor does Gina trappani she doesn't leave her mom's cellar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I tweeted 33 times last week. That's 16 more tweets than the prior week

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just it just really is so clever that twitter should just buy it before you even open it and then just give it to everybody  It's just so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's wonderful. So great. I am I am just thrilled. These are my biggest admirers  But enough about me. That's the one you uh, you're talking about danny leo le point status updates contain the word  I mean mine or myself three times  Three times out of 33 is not bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not bad. It's not bad. In fact, I think we're gonna change that to percentage versus total because I think that that makes more sense. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  this is great stuff so the problem I have with it is that when I do the the um,  the the live tweeting thing that reduces my average number of retweets a lot so that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It says oh your average retweet was only I also like the one where it tells you that someone saw so much more because you retweet  Although I want the other people to know that  Send the middle screenshots look well, that's it. But that's what I yeah, it's it's  Anyway, it's it's cool and be like you're welcome. Yes, exactly president obama received 4 000 more  In a conference last week, they I retweeted them and they came out to me  He's introducing to somebody else and they said oh, yeah  This is danny, uh, you know like 300 000 more people just saw my thing because of and I was like  Are you using think up or is it just like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If uh, if someone retweets you who has like a significantly more followers than you do like think up will tell you that as well  Oh, that's nice. Yeah. Yeah, that's really nice. It has to be a multiple. I think of your followers  I forget what the rules are but I think it has to be multiple of your followers

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Congratulations  So leo retweet me more, okay, because then i'll get kevin marx got half a million more  Views thanks to you  Exactly. Yay, danny sullivans at search engine land.com.
