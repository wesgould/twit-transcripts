Look at that same cup. Mmm, only his is a lot larger. Oh, she did find my glasses  Sorry, oh which one's and can you get me the cup that Russell was using because I want I mean if you're all gonna have  White cups, I want I want my own also with us Jeff Jarvis  Professor have no cup you have no cup  Professor there you go.

Okay, and your cup next to my cup  Something wrong with this picture  One of these things is not like the other Wow Breville coffee. Oh gosh. Cheers. Cheers to me  I think if you have a cup like this you have to go  somebody needs an infrared  Don't know what that means and I'm not gonna ask all right Tucker Carlson Tucker Carlson reference  Oh, oh you're talking about the new all the rage  It's too early, you know what the only thing I'm like I say anything but the only thing it was funny about that whole  Thing is that it was it was a bridge too far even even for Kid Rock. That was a bridge too far  I'm just saying  Bad bad day bad good no good terrible day for Netflix yesterday  They had to announce for the first time ever a loss of subscribers  Not a huge number hundred thousand subscribers, but it sure killed the stock. You sure does a hundred thousand  Sorry, two hundred thousand. All right, we're still pittance compared to whatever millions they have right? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well  Wall Street saying they may lose up to two million by July. I don't know where that number came from but  That's apparently part of the reason behind the freakout. It's kind of it's that in the fact that  It's for the first time ever that they lost subscribers so right like oh my god

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a real measure though of how Wall Street just wants in if  You know internal growth, right? So here's the here's the graph from Axios. Actually, this is  Aaron Davis had axios did this chart of  percentage chain and glow change in global streaming customers ten percent, you know ten percent five percent  But always up always up until we got to this one little red slice right here was down point one percent  I mean, it's not the end of the world. All right, Netflix is saying we're gonna start looking at this is something Ben Thompson called  for a few weeks ago ads  Mm-hmm. I don't want ads in my Netflix. I think that could go the other way for them, right?  The stock which had already been down 40% so far this year. It was down another almost 30%  This I think competition from Disney right HBO

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  competition from Disney HBO they put a lot of money into building content and  They also have been raising prices. They've had two price hikes in the last

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Year and a half. That's what I was gonna get to what about  Inflation, you know people aren't making as much money nowadays and they're just trying to cut costs

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is what it is. We did think though that in kovat this was like heaven for streaming services, right? You're all stuck at home, right?  it's Netflix model is tough though because  All the catalogs being pulled back by the various other streaming services who want it for themselves  They lost the office to peacock and all of that. Mm-hmm  And so they have to do they have to yeah Marvel goes  So to Disney so they have to do original content, which is expensive  So they have to I think that's the reason the prices went up Netflix has 222 million  paying subscribers  There might have been a little hint about this because last week Netflix said and we're gonna get all you freeloaders  Who are borrowing your subscription from somebody else to pay they estimate that's a hundred million  Households 30 million in the US and Canada that don't pay for Netflix would borrow a password

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that is an astonishing number to me. I just can't believe I'm like

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow, I mean do you all have yeah, I pay for my own subscription and I do not share it  It's only shared in the house under last pass  nobody knows the password I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Think my kids might be using my Netflix. Mm-hmm, but that was originally  You know, they were in the household and then they went to college. Mm-hmm. So at that point I said well, yeah  You can take it with you  Probably shouldn't have though, right? I don't know by now. They're all living, you know living on their own  They probably shouldn't be using my Netflix. I guess yeah, I would assume

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Your own account if it were me it's expensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's expensive but it's also think about like cell phone plans like are your kids still on your cell phone? Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hard hit is not on my plan anymore hard hit is on his own  What happened yeah, he's in college now

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Job he works. Yeah, so he can't afford to my kids have jobs  But I but I still pay I pay I pay for everybody's cell phone. I pay for Lisa's ex-husband's  Will you adopt me  You bought this one yeah, you bought Stacy's I bought yeah, do you use that by the way these that flip phone  Are you like, okay good. Yeah, I like  No, how about the Kobo reader

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so I have to tell you now  I have a plethora of e-readers because for my birthday my husband got me the latest Kindle shoot because it's waterproof

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Andrew and I have got to start to coordinate

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because now I've got three e-readers Wow only need one and I don't know what to do with them

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, yeah, give it to your kid. Doesn't she want one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She will she refuses to read things on Kindle. She likes paper. She is she's in a book. Yeah  That's a little hipster hipster tween here teen

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  anyway, I  Get you know if Disney Plus is also looking at I feel like that's why we pay for Netflix and Disney Plus I  Had I Hulu had ads and I end up paying for the higher tier because I don't want to see ads  Especially in the early days of these networks where the ads are the same over and over and over

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, what's what's so important about this? I think is that it's  The dial goes one way or the other right everything was for by advertising everything is supported by subscription and now it's gonna go back  But are they gonna be able to get the ads?  The ad market is shrinking. I don't know  This is not actually I have a number this week. This is a king

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know if you put this in or Stacey did Carl Bodie who it's yeah  You used to work with him at a gig on of course. He's great. I enjoy this is Twitter  Thread it's good thread. I always enjoy watching one-time innovators aka Netflix now huge and successful  Pivot to turf protection. Mm-hmm. It always involves using all kinds of distorted logic to justify  Making their product worse to please investors in other words adding ads, I guess  Like here in the Netflix letter to investors where they claim the problem with password sharing  By the way, Carl points out streaming executives used to love and noted  It had no a material impact on subscriber totals and revenues that may still be true  By the way, cuz if somebody's sharing a password  Do you think they're gonna have once it's revoked go out and buy Netflix or just say well, no, no some but not all

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was always the argument into a business model where I could create my own club  Yeah, I'm gonna cut of convincing aunt to be on my group and that kind of stuff. Yeah. Yeah, I know people are doing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  To meet investor demand Bodi goes on is it Bodi or Bo day

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Carl Boad, so I'm like a little your way. Have you ever met him? No in person. No. No  So how would you know anybody she works? She actually lives in Seattle now, but I've never met him in person

Transcript:  Absolutely. I've been reading him for years. I love everything. He writes is great. Yeah, he's great. I mean investor demand

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The show right? Oh, yeah, he has and I asked him how to say his name, but I forgot

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Shocking I think it was Bodi. I think that's why I say Bodi to meet investor demand for improved. Just Carl to me  To meet investor demand for improved quality, I'm sorry quarterly returns at any cost under this lovely public model  We've developed the company starts to effectively self cannibalize and make its product crappier and more expensive  like newspapers price hikes worse customer service  Less features, it's it's fewer features. He needs your red pencil

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  grammarly

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Grammarly grammarly  Hashtag grammarly sponsor sponsor  Well that yeah, okay cable companies spent the last few years winning a whining about how streaming password sharing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was great reads today

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did that one up for you for a living  Cabal companies spent the last few years  whining about how stream if I do it in a  Pompous voice I never make mistakes do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Campbell companies spent the last few years whining about how streaming password sharing was piracy  Netflix has increasingly been shoved toward that position by the market as well. Despite the fact that it's well not true  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He made the point which is what happens once you become successful  Then it's all about covering your turf protecting your turf keeping your market share up

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I well guess and I mean you have to keep innovating at a certain point. That's hard  There's only so many times you can learn and relearn. Yes, that's all the cell phone means constant growth. Yeah  You know when this is why I don't have public money in my company I can just coast along  Delivering a consistent product and I don't have to they're not gonna the door to give you millions  No, no one has knocked  I don't even get stuffed ants in the mail  If they know I'd probably just sell out I'll be honest if someone wants to offer me a few million I feel like yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Take it. Oh, believe me, but it would be more than a few million. Come on. Hold out. I don't think so

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I wouldn't what's your what's your number? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait, no, no, wait a minute. You got to stick around for three years

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Three years, isn't that usually it's like usually the yeah, you gotta stick around. Yeah, so I know how much would you pay?  You just wouldn't do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wouldn't I just feel and you've got to make it grow in those three years to a certain so Elon Musk comes along and says

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Stacey I want to buy Stacey on IOT. I will give you  4.3 million dollars. It's worth a tenth of Twitter. I mean a thousandth of Twitter. I mean a hundred

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would say I mean if I had to stay on for three whole years, I would say no thing and grow it  No, thank you. No, you wouldn't do it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know couple years ago money retire after three years

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  right  Would you want to retire?  I mean  What would you do if you retired would you garden would you make yeah, I'm like, what would I do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I would probably go work for a policy

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would work for a thing like make the world be a better place kind of thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Probably the same thing I do but with resources to break. Yeah, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Would be absolutely screw the man. Yeah lazy and love it if Elon said you have to meet with me in person. Would you then?  Elon wants his final uns. I am never coming back to the table. This is it forty three billion dollars  Although a lot of people have said first of all, where's he gonna get that money? He's have to sell a huge amount of  He's looking for it now. I went to Goldman Sachs and others  Some people are saying well, you get some hedge funds involved. The problem is it ain't gonna stop at 43  It's gonna go closer to 50  I've seen a number of so-called experts like Jim Cramer say he's not gonna be able to get the money  No one else is gonna buy Twitter it's not in play who would want it  Well, hold on

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He wouldn't be able to get the money because he's trying to buy Twitter  But are they're assuming the risk is him not being able to give the money back because he's not  Off a test

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  His Tesla stock as the as collateral security against yeah, and that is highly volatile. Okay. Oh interesting  Highly volatile, okay. Oh interesting the risk is interesting  He's already borrowed a huge amount against the Tesla stock, right? Oh didn't know that. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I'm you know, I mean we've talked about this probably beyond the point where it's interesting  But I'm just do you think he was serious about doing it or no? No, why not?  What does he want with Twitter? I?  Mean this attention he's getting he's getting exactly what he wanted right? Yeah, he doesn't need the right attention and ego

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, yeah, you don't need to actually spend money on something if you just you know  Shout loud enough about it and you're Elon Musk. He doesn't need the source of Twitter. He just wants the attention

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean they were ready to put him on the board

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well as a way to stop them doing this but yeah  you know, I  Started filling things in on the run out this morning and I've put the beginnings of Twitter stuff down under Twitter thinking  Oh surely we're past this now

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Huge amount kept going now even Ben Thompson has weighed in  April 18th a couple of days ago back to the future of Twitter. This is of course we've been is one of our favorites  strategist at strata curry calm  Or check  Eccary we say this every time I leave it's bode  Spelled strata curry, but it's pronounced bode

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We need it like a style a pronunciation guide for this show

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We do but see this is what's so interesting Stacy and you're discovering this now as a podcasters  Well, most of the time all this stuff is just written. No one has to say it out loud  but as  Broadcasters slash broadcasters it we have to say it out loud and oftentimes for the first time it's ever been said out loud  except by the person's mother so we have to figure it out. That's why the  For us the jiff versus gift thing is so  fraught  We have to decide how it's pronounced and I'm gonna say strata curry. I believe that's correct. Fair enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually choose words  Sometimes I catch myself to say do I need to quote this person by name if I actually record the book? Oh interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, that's a that's an interesting question, so I actually haven't read Ben's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  post so he suggested breaking it up into a  Social graph company and an app company. I'm not sure that I really get what that means, but it's been so we paid we talk about  them

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I guess the the social graph is the thing that you sell to advertisers is the thing that people want to know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hmm, right and there's a per user value that you can then move out, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But but but but but the what what fills that social graph what informs that social graph is the app  So if you separate the two suddenly your social graph no longer has the value that it had

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that was that's that's the paradox of Twitter right when they when they killed the API  Goes into my friend Bill Gross in there when he tried to build  modernization strategies on top of Twitter and  That's what scared them and they shut it all down then

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you think now in hindsight so Bill Gross's plan he owned tweet deck actually own a number I know he was no he

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually got stopped by he bought others and then he was he was going to buy a tweet deck and they swooped in and said no  And bought it and that's where he knew that it was screwed. So he his plan which is a I thought quite clever

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's a smart fella friend of yours  Was to buy up all the clients and  thereby in effect making his holdings more important than Twitter itself and  Because everybody would use his stuff to get to Twitter in a way splitting the company along these same lines where you know Twitter  So loans the social graph, but he owns the apps and  It would be a way of in effect acquiring Twitter without actually acquiring Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they could have they could have said that there's a cost to the API  They could have done that they could have done a per user cost of the did they make a mistake  It could have done revshares just cut them off basically  Yeah, they just cut it off and and they cut off potentially the huge growth now blue sky starts to go that way  right blue sky says there's a there's a there's a  Commodity list of layer of speech which wouldn't be just Twitter  It could be any other social network  And then you build stuff on top of that if you start to open source it you could have had much more growth people make  Twitter oh, it's just tiny it just has 36 million people in the US and then that right  well  It could have grown, but then trying to control the content would have been much more difficult

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But as we can do on the Fediverse if you distribute the content that way it is controllable locally  So in some ways that it off it offloads the moderation problems in a way that at least in the Fediverse works quite well  Of course, it's not as well. It lets you choose your moderation model

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll take Leo's right boring Twitter versus ants fun Twitter right versus my Rouchie Twitter right versus Stacey's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice Twitter smart smart Twitter. Well, what was I good? I was like, oh god, it's gonna be like Pollyanna

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Called it Stacey's moral panic Twitter versus the Stacey's nerdy Pollyanna Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would submit that it is not in fact  That's not why Twitter is not growing it's not because there aren't a you know  Variety of clients and all sorts of ways interact with it. It's today. It's the nature of Twitter. It's the 280 characters  It's just it's it. It's the personality of Twitter is not  Mass appeal like Facebook is not anymore. I don't think it ever was  Was it ever I mean look we're the wrong people last cuz you all loved well, yeah, we're in the circle and yeah, you're inside

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah, we're all those I mean, I think there's there's actually a little bit of that because  To be on Twitter. You ultimately have to have something to say that's interesting to  Someone else on Twitter or a big enough group on people right people on Twitter  I think you're right. You just have to have something interesting to say to your friends, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or in your life or your report, you know, you're sharing something there. Yeah, or in tik-tok  You're making something but in Twitter you have to have an opinion  Well speaking

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Speaking of opinions Oh Malik had quite an opinion Musk or not Twitter CEO  Needs to go. Is that fair?  He does not like agro wall

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Been to CEO for like ten minutes. Yeah, you know Ohm writes

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This 37 year old is woefully out of place as a guy leading a company  Trying to fight for its independence or remain a functioning entity

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Musk versus agarwal is not a great line up or a poor guy, you know  sighted I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Feel like agarwal reminds me a little of Sundar Pichai somebody who was a good soldier  Operations guy deep within the company. Mm-hmm who kind of rose perhaps beyond his  skill set  Yeah, and I mean look Jack Dorsey couldn't solve it. Have Williams couldn't solve it Twitter is a tough nut to crack  I don't see any reason. Why do you think Dorsey?  Made agarwal or the board by the way, that's another thing that's coming under huge fire  Is the board itself Dorsey said the board is dysfunctional has always been dysfunctional  Dorsey after he left and has lambasted the board  Sounds like this is a very poorly run company all in all

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's not uncommon to have like a CIO a CTO come in well Tim Cook's an example of where it really worked

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, there's an operations guy. I hope to made Apple. I don't think they had a plan. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dorsey left, you know, I do think there's some he'd nobody knew he's yeah, he left abruptly this guy basically  I think they kind of like you want it. You are okay. Who wants this? He got the short straw potato  Then you know, I think there I mean it would be nice if Twitter had like somebody with a visionary plan for what to do  And who could communicate that clearly to both the employees the board and the masses. I don't think agarwal is it but I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mean Oh rights agarwal. What do you do with something? What do you do? No one's been able I mean you could argue Jack Dorsey is a competent  innovator  Av Williams very competent  Om rights agarwal has been part of the underperforming Twitter establishment for a decade  And I'm yet to hear any fresh ideas from him or the company  Tech media has lapped up a flurry of minor product tweaks and sees them as a season of change  I have read many articles about the Twitter CEO discussing censorship and freedom of speech  I was hoping that equal if not more energy was going to be spent by both the executives and the media  On the business of Twitter's business. It is after all a publicly traded company

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's just disappointed you think I'm not just clean house because this sounds like just like any other corporate  Shake up where they come in and take everybody out from the top and start over. Why not just do that? Is it?  Well, you gotta have someone with an idea who has an idea. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jack does with blue sky. That's the thing. I think blue why do you leave? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't know couldn't get his way  This guy is still alive. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Agarwal is still encouraging its  Yeah, oh  Men's if the board of directors at Twitter is serious about finding a way forward as a standalone company one that isn't being jerked around  By a billionaire or Wall Street hucksters who call themselves activist managers in making a bid for Twitter  Musk has given Twitter a chance to shake off its stupor tighten the belt run leaner faster and further and that starts with new  Leadership right at the top. I can't disagree with them. Let's give it to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter I'm like it's easy to point all that out, but it really is like  What is the an old man actually might have a I would not be surprised if I had opinions thoughts on what to do with  Twitter. Yeah, but  It's just so hard to say I mean like see to be like well this guy's not doing it  You like blue sky, but was there a revenue model

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Associated with it. No, it's very unproven. It's very it's very innovative and not thought through and once you're public

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't do that. That's that's why Dell went private. He was like, oh crap  Yeah, loud in edge computing and all this is gonna eat our lunch if we stay out in the public markets  Let's take it private. So so here's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  game  so Stacey  Let's say the muskets gets close and then a white knight arrives what technology company  Like should Google buy Twitter. What would Google do with Twitter if it had it?  Facebook knows someone should take it work

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They should take it private  Like Google's not there's no model for  We're saying you can get a make crazy crypto nerd

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mike am I reading this wrong where it seems like oh and others are  Speaking about Twitter as if it's just a failing mess yet at the same time  Any Twitter competitor that tries to pop up never even stands a chance. So so why are they getting so much grief?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're doing something who says it has to be this big I guess same as that because they're public that's what

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does that's kind of why you don't want to take their money right, okay, I mean that's what Netflix is going up against right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well good billionaire to take it private would be a nice thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But should Jeff Bezos turn on their money, maybe Jeff should buy I don't think he bought the post to make money  He bought the post to preserve a public forum. That was very important  If maybe he'd feel the same way  The problem is you still have so many problems with Twitter that no one knows how to solve

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacy's part of Stacy's point is that that's your problems based on the public market expectation  If you were private you could set your own expectations

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, what was Twitter's revenue? Let's go back to their last financial they had one profitable quarter

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think you  For 2021 and then I don't I think they didn't I don't think they made a profit last quarter. Oh my god  Yeah, it's not good

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank goodness for those 10,000 Twitter blue subscribers that we are  We're in the small the few the proud. Yeah, the Twitter blue what it's probably 10,000  It's not very many  Few the proud Twitter blue

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean they boosted their revenue by quite a bit year over year revenue

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you see a problem in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gross profit. Well, let's go down to their EBITDA profit it so

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  somebody saying in the IRC that  Elon wants to reinstate Trump. Is that true or that's just speculation said it but it's presumed. Yeah, it's presumed sort of

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Air as legal it goes up

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So he's he's the says let's get back to the free speech thing. Oh, yeah, plus plus the you know, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Made some joking tweets about it  And then I ended up on Fox News and Glenn Greenwald and Andrew Sullivan came after me

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What all the tweets all the you know, he had a nice busy way  Miss this one

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where should I go to find this what was it and the reason they're after me is because they want Trump to be back  Yeah, they want Debbie the funny thing is you're against free speech. No, I'm not you're just yelling at me all the time  You can yell at me. I'm not telling you not to yell at me. Go ahead and yell at me  I'm gonna how am I against free speech?  I don't like Elon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was liking it to I mean I even put up a clip from cabaret but they still didn't get  I'll get more now. I'll get emails and that kind of stuff now will come from this but if you all you're just idiotic

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that's interesting though. That means you have a huge amount of  People are very aware of you in the on the right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What it happens when Andrew Sullivan and Glenn Reinwald do it that draws that that's the that's the bat signal  Ah, yes, the boys and the bots. Yes, and and what and I've learned now

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the good news is for hours Taylor Lawrence ran right by waving a flag and they chased her instead  Letting you off the hook the hounds right exactly what hounds followed the other rabbit

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  Now that I'm doing this this will come back up for a while and somebody will send me some emails in calling me

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Whatever so fun Taylor on in the Washington Post who she's great. I mean, I think we all agree  She's a very astute observer of social media, but did she make a mistake in  Revealing the identity of the Lib tards of tick-tock Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, you cannot be an adult on the internet having creating an account that has real repercussions for people without  Experiencing setting yourself up for the same real repercussions. Yes, so it was an anonymous account

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it was absolutely  You know Glenn Greenwald  Retweeted at 1.8 million followers on Twitter Tucker Carlson would continually bring up clips from libs of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here on his show

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anonymous anonymously. I mean you see your face, right? She didn't she didn't have  Which would have been pretty funny in any event her identity wasn't super kept secret  But but she was anonymous and so but she was revealed  Through the reputorial work of Taylor Lawrence and two of her colleagues at the post  Although I guess that information might have been available in other places and that was seen as doxxing

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  But

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It says he just said you do something in public that has public repercussions you do it to other people and then you say  It can't be done to you. Yeah  As a reporter my admirer greatly as a journalist came in there was a discussion among some  Journalist II online and he just said this is journalism period, you know shush. Yeah, it's not doxxing. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Reporting it's reporting. So I'm just I'm trying to get the outline of this  It's okay to have an anonymous account on Twitter, right?  If I had an anonymous account on Twitter or so or somebody had an anonymous there's there's trolls who were attacking you Jeff and  They were tracking me anonymously if we found out who they were, would it be appropriate to doxx?  I want to use the word doxx because that's loaded. That's not feel their identity in public

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what they're doing. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, but so what so the thing that made this okay was that she was that the the person who owned this handle  Was  Making political speeches was she became a public figure  She became a public figure. I would yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would say she became a public figure and then by virtue of that her actions  Created direct harm for people so a teacher lost her job  Okay, so once you have  Like if you're just saying something nasty and it doesn't cause harm then  But in the American legal system, I mean libel slander all of those things and

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They are true. But she wasn't doing anything illegal

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. She was doing something in public and and to me that's sufficient that you there is not  A privacy in public was it I do defend anonymity  I do think it's important for the vulnerable, but she was violating that for others and then  Hypocritically saying that shouldn't come after me. So she was doxxing other people. She was causing people lose their jobs  She wasn't doxxing them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She was she was pulling them and this is why the internet is such a scary place and why people haven't really  they don't understand that everything you put on it is searchable and findable and

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Even weaponizable against them. So she was reposting tic-tacs mostly. I mean it's that's the implication lives

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was finding any yes, she would find people's tic-tacs  She would repost them under this thing and then other people would

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right then it be amplified by Glenn Greenwald was set loose the dogs and Tucker Carlson far-right. Okay  So it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no Taylor Lorenz is a reporter who

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Revealed her identity and was accused of what coffee yet, you know, maybe we should trade mugs  And I should give credit because Taylor didn't do this alone she had reporting help from had a teen Alison Kreitz and Rizan  Naklawi

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At the Washington Post but but it I don't want to leave this discussion before we Sean Wong's  Threat on moderation. I think is relevant here. All right, I'll pull that up  Because it's it's a miss back on the Twitter story what he's saying what he Sean used to run reddit and  So from the voice of experience he can say  Elon's in for a mess of pain right in a social network and he goes through this I think brilliantly and he makes a few points  Which I think are relevant to the two tick-tock as well as you know, where where are the rules? What are you enforcing?  And one point he makes and I think is wonderful. He said listen all you people  You think that your stuff's getting taken down because the substance of what you say  No, if you said everything you said civilly and nicely nobody would take anything you say down. It's because of your behavior  It's because you're being jerks and a holes and awful people right and that's what it is  And so we focus on this as left versus right  And we try to get all kinds of false balance going there  No  It's about awful behavior and where that comes from and guess what it comes from one place more than the other and that's why  That side is trying to say you can't take down our stuff because that's our freedom of speech  How dare you right because what the left they say take down the hate speech and then when the hate speech gets taken down the right  Says whoa, that was my hate speech. So you Sean I think does a good job of saying it's the Mike Maznik rule, right?  the impossibility of content moderation of scale and  And this is about a society trying to figure out what our standards and norms are and we ain't there yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's complicated  Is indeed I  I'll just say I don't think Elon is worried about this because I don't think he really wants Twitter  Does he really want Twitter? What we do with?  He knows how hard this would be. This is this is just a quagmire. He's got Tesla and SpaceX to run

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but he doesn't need this I could see him trying to put people in place as only because you think he's a goofball, right?  Oh  He's a smart enough man to put all of those other things in place with SpaceX and Tesla  He's not out there building those cars or launching the the the right he's doing two fairly important  People in place to make sure all that stuff gets done

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Honestly  It's very hard to tell with Elon no one could tell what his motivations are  But it feels to me like he's just having fun. He's kind of trolling around and  He likes to see likes the attention he likes to stir the ants nest with a stick  He's like a kid poking the ants nest  But I don't think he has any real ambition to run Twitter  That would be a very hard thing to do. Maybe he has enough ego think he could solve all these problems  I don't know. I think that's what it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And he's and he's troll. He's a troll. He's trolling. He's trolling. That's the joy he has and and and and  You know, I think and I want to be careful here. Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because by the way, somebody said who was really trolling is the SEC. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he goes right after the SEC, yeah, that's the whole thing  I think it's exactly what he's doing is saying you're going after me because what I said on Twitter will be I'll buy Twitter  Then what are you gonna do? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's not the way wouldn't change either. He doesn't understand securities law at all  right  Or he know this wouldn't change anything him owning the platform that he's pumping and dumping on does not change in any way the  Liability for pump and dump maybe makes him more responsible. Yeah, he bought it  He bought a platform just so he can pump up stock scams

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I want to be I started us road  I want to be a little I want to be careful here because I think neurodiversity is really important and we have a lot to learn  From neurodiverse, but he brought up Asperger's in his TED talk  Yeah, and I wonder if I wonder what how what it was like to be  Elon the child I  Wonder because he talks in that about the difficulty of understatement and having to learn and I would also caution fun of because he didn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would caution you way everybody else plays it. I would really caution you because everything Elon says is performative  Not even that is oh, absolutely  Really? Yeah, I  Mean we don't know that's the I mean it might not be he might be coming from the heart  But so much of what he says is performative that I would not necessarily

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was even claiming that yeah, who knows as a as a as a which is really insulting  Yeah, and if you're a fan of neurodiversity if you want to support it for somebody say, oh, yeah  Well, I'm on the spectrum. So I was headed toward the other path of trying to give us some empathy

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But okay, you pulled me back. Well, I just he may be maybe maybe but it would be the first time he's been  Forthright about anything I think this sounds a little bit like  More like I'm sleeping on the floor of the factory. In fact, he even brought that up at the TED talk. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was a boy that was that a was that a softball game. Yeah. Well, Chris Anderson is not a hard hitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it was exactly the audience boy, that's that's Elon's audience right there  Was lines. Yeah, I'm surprised he announced his NFTs  Perfect place to do it  All right, let's take a break now that we've offended pretty much anybody who's listening.

Kennedy should have used  for all humankind instead of for all mankind  and um well  Yeah, obviously, okay. I understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What makes a speech resonant often is when you I mean what makes good writing is when you know the rules you break the rules  And you come up with and a speech is also very different than a written. That's a good point

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So a motherboard fed a transcribed interview of neo-nazi and former clan leader david duke  Uh into uh the inclusive editor it got no recommendations even though he uses the n-word  And talks about hunting black people but radical feminist valerie solanus's scum manifesto  Was got many edits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How do we go? Well stacy what happened to insteon? Do we know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We don't know and it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We will never is this like the wink fiasco or worse?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, wink actually was purchased and people talked about what happened so wink still exists and if you pay money

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the problem is that you had to pay for it  But insteon  Tell me what insteon is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so on friday  Insteon is a smart home hub. It's been around since 2005 one of the first proprietary. Yeah  Proprietary mesh network technology works really well people love it. I cannot tell you how many times people  like  Send me emails about how stacy. Why are you wasting time with smart things or hub home assistant?  Get insteon. It just works. It's rock solid people love it  So what happened is on friday night? I started getting emails  People realized that their app wasn't working and their hub was down and they were like what the heck is happening  It's been pretty clear for the last couple months that insteon has been having some troubles  um  and financial apparently  Uh financial and they stopped supporting some of their stuff  They had some cloud outages, but they didn't really communicate and then they came back up  So people thought this might be just a big cloud outage  but  It turns out that it hasn't yet turned back on  and I went through  because I had gotten enough of these emails and started looking and  The people affiliated with insteon  Many of them are no longer with the company and those that used to own the company are now denying that they have any  Business with the company so I found rob lillin lilliness who is the ceo of smart labs, which is the company that in 2017  invest well  rob's  private investment fund richmond capital partners  Created smart labs and invested money into it to buy insteon the assets  And wrap that all up so they had this smart home website that sold insteon gear. They had the insteon stuff  um  And he has scrubbed all mention of insteon from his linkedin profile and as of now he no longer has a linkedin profile  Oh, he just took that sucker down but it's the same as death  of the five people  Yeah, of the five people i've got a book he can bite into that might help him revitalize

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sounds like the cleveland brown career baltimore. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Holy cow, so he did actually respond to me on tuesday and he said he's not affiliated with the company  But he didn't answer any of my questions and that was the only response he has but he was clearly used to be affiliated with the company  so  It's anyone's guess what has happened?  And people are pissed

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So if you bought an insteon hub and have been powering your smart home with insteon they had an app and everything, right?  Um, yeah, none of that's working anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so insteon has local control if your hub was programmed. Okay, this is why people love it so much if your hub was programmed  Your timers and anything on the hub will still work if you want to change anything though. You need the app  Now my thing of the week is actually a very comprehensive guide that we put together on what to do if your insteon thing has failed  Save that we'll talk about that then. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So there is hope

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, there's not hope for insteon but there's hope for your particular home

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, okay good  Was it was it the problem with insteon that it was proprietary and that zigbee and matter and all of these things have just kind of  Eclipsed it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think yes and no I  I think it was I mean  The fact that it was proprietary and it worked really well was great  I think the fact that you it was a pain to buy and you need a professional installation  All of that is hard and we've seen the smart home eclipse kind of the professional cdia type installers  Yeah, and then things like matter coming on didn't help it  Was insteon a member of the matter coalition  I don't believe so. No  The matter could theoretically help if you had a situation like this going forward because you would have local control right with matter  Right theoretically when it comes out was it the sonos of iot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The sonos of iot well sonos is still around so let's not well I know but no the sense that it worked well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But then other a lot of other things came they got it. Yeah expensive. It got clipped. That's what i'm saying. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  Yeah, that's probably and and sonos is expensive now sonos is still investing in things and

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Having lawsuits and yeah sonos is going to be around. I think I think they've decided to you know  but  It does in some respects it kind of does sound like the sonos of iot  In some respects. All right. Well, we'll find your worker. We'll get your workarounds later in the show while we're on iot

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I can I suggest one? Yeah, because I want to hear amy to amy stacey. What am I saying amy talk about this?  the puffs of air line 82  Have you gone into this yet stacey

Transcript:  At google we like to google rehearse the future  In collaboration with map project office, we have explored how technology can support us in the background of our day-to-day lives  A little irish. Oh, it's just scottish through the lens of amy computing  We're imagining new ways to interact with technology  Using less of our attention and allowing us to have moments of calm  Calm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Calm me next

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Little signals is a family of unassuming but charming objects that share notifications and information  By engaging with our senses in more nuanced ways. Wait a minute

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Little unassuming objects  That engage your attention  This is from the company. You're watching over class. So  What is this is this blue sky are they gonna are they doing it or well, let's listen no no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is this has been around for a while. This is the whole concept of ambient information delivery

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, but keep going. This is a lovely sound movement and visual cues we can subtly perceive  a soft shadow  A friendly tap what a reassuring sound  A subtle indicator

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Never hearing it is never see any of it a gentle motion

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They use familiar patterns to calmly convey information and keep us in the loop

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The giga live

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're only the giga live gentle nudges at the right time in the right way  Pimple

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, if you're just listening is not nearly as hysterical there are little objects tapping on things

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of how we can foster new behaviors and relationships with our technology. Look at that. I turned it upside down  Working in harmony with the objects we already love in a little way

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So is this google so there's a whole design philosophy is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is what I want to hear stacey on this. Okay. Yes. Yeah, and so we've had people so  This has been all the way back. So all the way back to like 2010 2008  We were seeing people develop connected objects  like so one of the first ones that I recall  Hearing about was like a an umbrella stand that would just light up softly if rain was expected  So as you walked out the door, your your umbrella stand would glow and you'd  Forget me take an umbrella  um  and that was one of the like  That and there were lots of ideas around products like this  And most of them have failed  um good night lamp was a wonderful one that is you can kind of  It's been developed into other things which is like just by turning on a light  It would share it would turn on a light somewhere else with like a connected other person  And they would just know that you were home or that it was like a way to connect with people from far away  And the idea here was that you wouldn't have a screen you would have some object or device in your home  that would give you some sort of indication that  You could pay attention to in a way that was not like a notification screaming at you  and these objects really fetishize things like  Light sound motion as a way to get your attention

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And a lot of them are nice but so look you can build them yourself  Using an arduino and they have 3d printer models  So these are the three things we saw which is the thing you push

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Down use it for my father to remember to take his pill and then plop down

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that was an interesting one. It has a little it's a little it looks like the hands of a clock  But instead of being the hands of a clock it taps on your medicine bottle, but okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It taps on the medicine bottle, but how yeah, how audible is that?  You know you tap it on the medicine around them is they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Come to your attention when you need them at home. So in that case probably  You were looking at something like light triggered the sensor to indicate that light and time for example  So opening your medicine cabinet gave you that notification, right? Yeah. Okay  I'm sorry. I'm trying to

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's it's it's there and there's launch experiment, but all it's doing is showing me that same video again  so I wanted to see what the  Experiment oh here your explanation helps me see them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you see these things getting built into like  people like tying their philips hue lights to various pieces of information and  Sorry  Lights changing colors to like tell you something has happened  and but  And that's just ambient information delivery and it's really popular and it's actually i've set up a bunch of them in my home  And it's actually quite nice. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I like that idea, but I feel like I would struggle with with

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Catching sure so here's a little here's a little air thing. It interacts with us pulses of air move nearby items  to attract attention  So it'll blow  wiggle or spin

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's so like something like this. You could use it for something. That's not imperative that you notice it right away  Okay, but like right a good example would be something like quitting time actually  so here's like  It could this way if it's five o'clock and usually you want to be like you want to have a reminder to yourself to get  Up and stop working right that could start blowing around five o'clock and you could be working and you'd notice it and be like  Oh, okay. Yeah, it's time to go but it's less intrusive than like a bell going off. I like this one

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, this is kind of interesting. This is this one's called movement  And seven pegs that graphically represent information  Like a calendar a timer through their height and motion the pegs work individually or as a group and are tapped  for simple input  That's really interesting. I mean, they're just yeah, these are very interesting  You know, these are super things don't have to shout at you  They they can just hint at as normal environmental things do  You

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And like this this this one with the haptic feedback is fun like i've seen things like that  I've seen projects like for bicyclists like little vests that people wear with haptic feedback where  The closer a car gets to you on a bicycle  the the more the haptic feedback  Happens like the harder or the faster the percussive motion would happen. So you'd feel the car coming up behind you  So you'd know it was there but it wouldn't it would build slowly  Presumably or if it built too fast, you'd figure it out and you'd be like I should swerve. Oops. Sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This one's really interesting. I should swerve tap makes use of surfaces  This is the one that was tapping on the medicine bottle to create sounds that act as notifications a stronger tap means more pressing news  So you can you could now you can download these as as little there's little zip files  Is this a script?  It's an s t. Oh, he's gonna make one now. I think we could  Experiment with little signals. Yeah, you come here and walk you through how to make the air object  This doesn't look so quite so you need a 12 volt computer fan an arduino  A transistor resistor. So these are these are do-it-yourself projects

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and like the air blowing might be fun. Like let's say you've got a sensor tied to your plant that is like when it needs water  What if you start seeing the leaves blow and you're like, oh that means it needs water. Hey

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So instead of having a boxing glove that hits me stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can have something that blows in my ear urgent tapping just blows in my ear tap on your forehead. Yeah  Boop, I thought we solved that with ant can have a booper. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Until i'm trying to find a replacement  Uh, yeah, I would like to build one of these this is cool. Maybe burke can build us some of these  Are because it's some soldering. It's yeah, it's super and there's code  So you can write your own code  Uh, it's neat

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, and I thought we'd we'd have this sort of thing in more places but until we have a truly open kind of  format for communicating information and then the end result like the the  What's it called?  the execution  of  A puff of air or whatever. There's no way to build something like that. That's really universal  So you get these like single use products that are real gimmicky feeling and it's kind of sad

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why is this like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Visual basic or something. This is javascript, but what it looks like you could do  Um for it's got an api you could query a weather service for a forecast. So that's what this code does  they uh  They get the forecast  And then they react to the forecast  By doing something  You know depending on which yeah thing you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Connected to I used to have a light in my closet that if it was below freezing it would turn blue  So when in the morning when I went into my closet, it would be blue. Oh, that's nice smart

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can it in turn do something else if I hit if I hit the red thing down  Yes, does it, you know send my doctor a notification. Yes. Yeah, sure. It's all programmable

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So in this case if you set it  uh  To something to whatever the trigger is it'll turn the fan on it'll blow on you  I might find that irritating  Well, this is the air object so there's there's code for all different kinds of objects  This is actually the one i'd be most interested in is this little  Tap object  That's the one I want to play with

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Plus it seems to operate on two axes

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go down and in no, this is the same one. This is the air

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The air one. Oh, well, i'm gonna have to I want maybe we should build one of these be kind of fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Build it program it. Yeah, and then give control of it to stacey. Yeah on the set we could then let me have it  Actually, all you need is it's on the table and when you start to say something bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She just taps like a like an insistent aunt. Yeah, and I could put a little finger on it like and it's like it's tapping

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you go to there's a site called calmtech.com  It'll talk about some of these sort of things  In other places that you see this developed. I've had a person on the podcast talk about this. So  Here's a calm tea kettle

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A calm office window  A laboratory sign a calm room  Yeah, I like this idea. I mean it I mean there's a reason why these alerts coming from your  Assistance and your phone are loud and annoying. I mean  Otherwise you might miss it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Well, this would be very permissioned. This is i'm going to pay attention to you at an agreed upon level  I'll what i'll when I see the plant  Um plants leaves going like that then that's fine. I've agreed to that and i'll do something and that's that it's nice and simple  It's easy. I like that  that idea  It's not intrusive. It's not loud. It's not in your face

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Very cool. Thank you stacey for explaining it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Should we build some stuff if you want to know more about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Amber case is the woman who you should follow and you have some like where did you get that blue light?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How did you did you build that yourself or oh, I programmed a philips hue using if oh, duh, of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was hard. No, i've done stuff like programmed it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry kevin kevin actually did something

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

I don't I don't like to wear things. I already own exactly  I'm telling you this is the from now on your your kind of go-to  style look at that, okay  Maybe it's because I I read puck news now all the time, but what's going on with cnn warner discovery?  What a mess and a half is going on over there. It's almost as bad as aol  It's very much like that. Isn't it? So warner is the jigs, obviously

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's been a mess after mess after mess so discover and warner discovery and warner

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Discover and warnery are meeting  Merging they're merging together  Warner is hbo and cnn. I mean warner is a big big property discovery  Doesn't feel that big but they own a lot of stuff too  And they're going to be running the show, right?  What zaslav will be running the show? Yeah, zaslavs are on the show. Yep. Yep. So apparently  CNN  Even though they were about they still haven't merger hasn't happened yet, but it's about to I think may 1st something like that  CNN started cnn plus even though  Discovery didn't want them to  discovery set wanted them  To be they wanted it like to all be hbo max like put everything hbo max cnn plus they were going to spend  A huge amount of money over the next three years  Now they're starting to fire people  Oh boy, this story from axios scoop sarah fischer cnn plus looks doomed  This is the streaming version  merely

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  150,000 subscribers so far this is like ant was talking about agrawal, you know  He's only been in the job 10 minutes. This thing's been on the air one minute

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because they put no news in it. I think that was part of the problem  Yeah, part of the problem warner brothers discovery wants to eventually build one giant service around hbo max  This  Zucker of course was fired at cnn. The new guy isn't in yet  CNN's original just started he just started. Okay, cnn's original plan was for cnn plus to become profitable in four years by investing a billion dollars  But in order to become profitable  They were expecting millions of subscribers

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me ask you this if if cnn is the news arm of everything and this is their  Premium platform, what else can they add to make this a?  Viable option what what's the carrot? This is you know, what's a really good question is for you want us for news now?  Pay us more for more news, you know and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Way way back when I helped start epicurious  Had gourmet and bon appetit recipes with a little stuff and and the pressure came  Around the year 2000 to say well, can we also do subscriptions?  Can we also get some money for consumers and jone feeney who was the brilliant person who started it?  Sat there and brainstormed for hours trying to think of what is it we can invent that'll on top of epicurious is already exists  People will pay for and we came up with a million ideas and finally she just said  The gold is the recipes. Yes, charge the recipes. Yeah, we don't charge and same for cnn  The msos  Will let you sell it separately these cable systems. Okay, so they've got nothing else  That's that's that's the crown jewels and they got nothing else to sell so they make it up  So so anderson cooper talking about parenting. Oh, okay. That's cute. But maybe it's a youtube video you watch it. Yeah here right

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  According to fisher cnn brought in a billion dollars in profit last year  most of that  Coming from distribution contracts with the cable operators  Mm-hmm. This is according to her two sources. That's where all the money is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's where the money is money. We think about trying to get ads off of fox doesn't matter. It's all in the carry fees

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This was on the heels of already problem  Troubled cnn after the firing of chris chris cuomo the firing of jeff zucker, which was probably related  uh zucker who was kind of beloved by the  On-air staff at cnn and uh took off he had  Turned cnn more and you'll remember this during uh the last few years  More political  And I I don't know if this has to do with his departure as you say, uh, the new guy chris licht isn't in  position yet, but  Basically all cnn does all day all night is ukraine war. Yeah, have you noticed that jeff? Is that driving you nuts?  Absolutely. Well, so so it has started off nothing else going on. Yeah, like there's no covid there's no nothing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dazlav has talked about about um, you know, like  Oh, i'm sorry, go ahead. Well, just the other thing to say is chris licht the new head  Who last was at cbs?  running um colbert show  Uh as an executive, uh, he he went on this week and he said well because i'm starting to cnn  I'm going to quit twitter, which of course drives me nutty. Okay, so you're going to stop talking to the public very good  Um, so it's going to be this whole haughty weird  Objective throwback kind of news  That's not going to work. Well, well right now it's war porn

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, uh, it's bizarre if you ask me. Yeah  um  I'm not that this isn't an important story. Of course it is but there are other important stories in the country going on  And the bottom line was the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  During see it during during covid  I mean it was a very important story people were dying a million people are going to have died from this  But yes, it was to the exclusion of all other that's all they did in the world. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  uh, so i'm not surprised cnn plus is having trouble because  There's no news  Right, um  It's really an interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Slow motion car wreck. Well, and can you imagine anything that you would pay for from cnn that isn't the cnn itself feed negative?  negative, I mean if

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The people watching cnn they could care less at least this is my assumption they could care less about behind the scenes stuff  They can care less about just sit downs with with anderson and or whomever  That's not news related. They go to cnn for news period

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the other problem. I I searched google for cnn plus sign  The thing is a joint results for cnn, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google say to wait, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's typo and I would say that well, this is a big opportunity for cbsn which is their streaming version except the  Viacom paramounts lose it having the same kind of  nutty  divisive  leaderless craziness and uh with a merger, of course and uh  What's it feels like something's is is this is this a representative of some sort of illness  in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Journalism and news. Well, it's interesting it fits into your first story leo, I think which is is  It's its media pivots to whatever the next messiah is so the next messiah of late has been streaming  Everybody's got to have a streaming channel, right?  And so they're all rushed into that and cnn, you know hires casey hunt and hires  What's his name? Um  The the news guy from from from fox the the only respectable one chris wallace. Thank you chris wallace  Um, and and and so they they spend a fortune on this. We ought to have a streaming channel  Everybody's gonna have a streaming channel. What's happening to streaming streaming saying? Oh hell it's oversold  Netflix is losing. Oh darn. So where is the audience going? Is it youtube? Is it tiktok? It's a limited  Well, it's it's it's it's people will spend only so much that was subscribed to only so many things

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's so many scarcity and there are so many sources of information and entertainment and so many opportunities to stream

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so so there's competitors netflix now and they're feeling it, right?  Yeah, they're also netflix is also feeling the the the the embers of the pandemic  There was a huge upswing during that. Uh, but yeah, there's plenty of things to stream people are going back to work  There's less time to stream  Uh, much of it isn't worth anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's the main thing is there's only 24 hours in a day and a lot of people are only going to give you  Uh, what's the analytic they're going to give you 15 seconds guaranteed of your of their attention  And and then they move on to the next thing watch a lot of tv

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just want to throw that out there because i'm always stunned because I I don't really hours a night four or five  But it's ambient. It's a lot a lot in the background. Yeah, because they  Exactly. So I was gonna say sometimes  Streaming because it feels like tv it it's still not the lean back experience  It's much more purposeful. So things like fox are a little different because you just turn it on and it just goes for hours  So it's a different

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We have the news on sometimes when we're when i'm making dinner  We're making dinner kind of getting together the news will be on for a little bit just to kind of catch up on the day  But then usually we'll watch episodic television. We'll watch  uh  Yeah, but there's there's you're at night you're well off

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  um  There's whole homes where tv's just on all the time all the time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  And it's it's a different product for them, right?  I just it's wallpaper like we're talking about tv like it's it's this monolithic thing  But tv viewing habits are actually very different across different demographics. Yeah, that's true in ages

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ages especially meanwhile dean basquette is about to exit the new york times and okay  Basquet basquet. I didn't know he was so french. Mr  Joey baskets is leaving  And joey con  Is coming in as executive over the new york times  I only bring this up just because I know jeff likes to go on and on about this stuff anything to say  Is he a good guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, he's very smart guy, uh very much an inside guy very quiet  Uh, I think that my friend jay rosen at new york university who's brilliant on this stuff was quoted by the washington post about this  And I think that it means more of the same ag salzberger who's now the publisher. Um,  Having taken over from his father is very quiet too. So they're they're they're peas of a pod  and and  Jay did a very good twitter thread today talking when he was asked about what were the positive things of bacquet's  Reign and there were many things he really brought it into digital. He brought the subscriptions up hugely. Um, he brought up investigations  He brought up the staff, but negatively they still have not grappled with their role in the 2006 election 16 election  um  They still they you know, he dismisses listening to the public through twitter through any means  James fallows just wrote a good piece. I just just saw  Where he said two things that that that con should do one bring back the public editor  Yes, that was a huge mistake said and said oh twitter is gonna be a public editor and then they've dismissed twitter now  So they don't care about listening to the public and two  Uh have an honest reckoning with your role with the 2016 election and don't do it again  But but they're that's not where they are now  Jay also has a theory which I I think is very intriguing about the times  Which is when they  They went full on board with subscriptions as the primary means of support  It changed the newsroom so the newsroom kind of has to prove it to the subscribers. Well, you don't own us  We're gonna piss you off here and there I think that's what has led to a lot of the problems with that's interesting  Yeah, it really is and and we're gonna we're gonna go talk to all those guys in the ohio dining room  Because we know you don't like that but that's going to prove how independent wonderful we are  and and I think it's  This idea that subscription markets are wonderful because we're finally in charge. Well, no, they're trying to they're trying to  Suck up to you on the one hand and then prove they're independent from you the other hand  And I think it's I think it's degraded the times in some ways  I start my day now with the washington post not with the new york times  Unfortunately, though I see the washington post go in the same way

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The only reason I bring this all up is I feel like that we are rapidly heading into a situation in this world where news  Is going to become very very?  Important it always has been but I think it a formed electorate is going to be vital  To solve some of the problems we are going to face in the next decade or so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've got to rethink the fundamental

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The actual the the vessel of news being the most important like where are people going to get the news from seem like that's the  The main thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, is it going to be well, it's hard to find reputable people in areas that you're not focused in  So you look for reputable outlets who can  Steer like the idea behind a newspaper is that they hire people who know what they're doing  and you can pick a place and  you know  Find those people and that actually extends all the way to their opinion pages and voice you  like people read the  wall street journal for a certain worldview and they read the new york times or the washington post for a slightly different worldview and  And  I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let us  Do it google. Wait, wait, I had a oh you had an epiphany. I heard it and I let it go I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's okay. I mean was it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it was an oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The atlantic had a great article and I thought about Jonathan hates heights. Oh, no. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought it was great. You didn't like it  Oh, I hate it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I brought it up that grumpy face

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  so  Jonathan height who i've interviewed we've had him on triangulation wrote. I thought a very important book called righteous minds. He's a  He's a social psychologist. Yeah  and uh righteous minds was why we can't agree and I think actually as time has gone by I think height has maybe changed his  tune a little bit but his most  Recent article which I think is what you're referring to stacey is why the past 10 years of american life have been  uniquely stupid  And it's not just a phase and he blames  Social media, of course he does of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, okay. Did you read the article jeff? Yes, I did. It was long. It was long  It yeah, it was really long, but there were lots of things in here. I actually show this morning  And they drove me nuts. So I thought I'm trying to pull up the article and for some reason I'm failing at the paywall

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have a do I I have it right here in front of me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, so there was actually a section in there that actually picked your favorite point which  Uh was all about how it has given voice  to the  Disenfranchised yes, and I  So I thought that was good because that is an important acknowledgement  I thought that many of the points he brought up were right on and I liked  I I was actually kind of pissed that he spent so much time like educating us about this and like so like five paragraphs on  Like what to do about it  But I thought the idea of adding friction is what I wanted to talk to you about jeff because I thought that was an interesting  way to ensure that people  Still had the ability to share their points of view  And reach people but also that it became that you had to try a little harder to work forward a little bit  Yeah, so I just I I wanted to ask you specifically about  Adding friction to social media. So the the one thing he mentioned was frances. How do you say is it huffton huff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hogan frances huffton her idea facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah on facebook basically saying look you can only cut and paste something  Or you can only hit share and then you have to cut and paste to help slow the spread and I was trying to think  Of things that might help  On twitter other than you know cutting down on bots. I don't think I just want to get your opinion on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think the solution is technology. I don't think it's it's ui  I don't think it's nudging  I think it's harder than that like it's much harder than that  And and if I go back to yushan wong's  Thread  When he said in there as I said, I think I quoted this already. That's right that that it doesn't matter what you say  It's it's the behavior  and the behavior is  That people right now come on and they want to blow off and they want to go after each other and and the only way  We're going to solve this  is by having norms and institutions  That we agree to as a society that say that that's unacceptable. That's the problem. That's harder get those agreements of not now  But I think in time we might think in time but but not now because it's people are trying to do this  So I I just don't think there's any I think it's that's a that's a techno determinist

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, well, he also offers that as one of his solutions one of his solutions was, you know helping educate kids

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, ah, but they're the kids are not the problem. It's the old fart  So the problem is research is right there in his own university  Josh tucker he should have looked up because josh tucker has good research on this that this presumption  There's a lot of presumptions in this piece. One of them is yeah the kids and the echo chambers and all that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think he's focusing on the kids because they're sharing the problems  I think he's focusing on the kids because you can actually change kids inoculate. We're not going to change my parents  Yeah, they're smarter than I love them, but he says prepare the next generation

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  his point if I could put it in a nutshell is that not that twitter and tweets and social media sharings  are  You know so dangerous in and of themselves, but they are  A million it's death by a thousand cuts. There are a million blows and what has happened  As a result is that people?  are so sensitive to what and you are too jeff, I mean  Look look at all the attention you got  Look how much you were beaten down for your tweet. I wasn't last week. Well, they attempted to they certainly they attempted to but  What happens it may not have affected you but what happens is no i'm i'm i'm in i'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a privileged white cis what he's saying is old male

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The country the country yes, and I think this has always been the conventional wisdom tends to be centrist  And then there's a left wing and a right wing  But what all of these little darts have done is pushed  the  basically empowered the extreme  And and shot down anybody in the middle. He's kind of always been saying this is also part of his earlier book  But so that the extremes have an outsized voice now both on the left and the right and outsize power  I think that's true. I can agree to that  This is where you're a centrist

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm always caught in the middle and I get yelled at all the time because I don't lean one particular way or another  Regarding whatever social activity or political precisely. Yeah, I totally agree with that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this morning he was on morning joe  And they had uh eddie glaude jr  Who I I think the world of who's the head of the african-american studies program at princeton?  On at the same time to act as a as a ballast they basically gave claude no time to talk at all  And I was enraged afterwards and I tweeted about it  Um, and it was it was a microcosm for what's happening what we had was in joe and height  There were two white men complaining about saying that oh, uh people in our classrooms  Don't feel like they can talk and and and we're being shut up when they wouldn't listen to the black man  Who was there trying to say to them and it said to them you talk height about extreme right extreme left  Who's the extreme left you're talking about in this balance here?  Are you trying to say people who are fighting for justice are this extreme left? Who is this extreme left?  and it ignored it was it was a microcosm of the world we have where  What's going on here? We've talked about this so plenty of times and i've quoted this this this tweet from regina rene a professor in canada  That says it's it's at the one hand  It's the people who want to change the rules because they can finally have a seat at the table to say i've had to live  By your rules all this time, but now i'm going to tell you this is how you should treat me as a trans person  For example, and no, I don't want you to say that about me  And then the people on the other side rene calls them the status quo warriors say well, don't criticize me. Don't tell me what to do  Because they still want to hold on to the power they had this is all a process of renegotiating norms as a society  The worst part about hate's piece is he acts as if this time is unique try the reformation bud in the 30 years war  You know, there's plenty of times before where technologies cause changes it is it is an exception a  Chronological exceptionalism to think that we're so special now. We're not it was it was historically

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So are you saying there's no there's no issue. There's no problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, not at all  I'm saying that there are plenty of problems and i'm saying the problems are a lot harder than he lets on and the problems are  us the problems are  That this is what what eddie glad was trying to say today to them is that we are deciding who we are as america  To speak as an american thing here. We're deciding who we are  And and and there are people who are resenting that there are more people having their voice and choice in that and that's the essence  Of what's going on here. That's the basis of january 6  That's the basis of charlottesville and don't cancel us and don't replace us  Let's admit that let's discuss that out loud instead of saying oh, it's social media's fault. They made us worse suddenly  No, we've been a racist country for 400 years and it's coming to roost and so on twitter today  I said what's really going on here is that what he's ignoring is as far as i'm concerned black lives matter  Is the reformation and media are in the counter-reformation?  And and and rebrock jr. Who wrote the book I so admire called?  Distributed blackness  Said oh, I like that construct back in twitter  And and what we're seeing is a point counterpoint that goes on at these moments of change in society  Yes, we're at a big moment of change, but we've got to grapple with our underlying problems and we're not doing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Um, I still I still you asked I wasn't going to go into this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of having some friction as miss stacy mentioned because I think that's that's that's a that's a social solutionism technological solutionism  That doesn't get to the core problem whatsoever

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, i'm just saying just in the simplest form having a little bit of friction to make you breathe a second before you hit send

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I think it's paternalistic. I think that's that's saying like today  I did want to tweet directly what was that while it was happening in the show?  Yeah, and and and know somebody decides that no, no, no, no, that's that's not good for you. You shouldn't do that  That's that's a paternalistic and techno solutionism way  Uh that I don't think solves the problem. However, I have to say jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  To me it feels a little bit like  You're the guy  You're in the middle of it  And you love it. You love the engagement the hurly burly  and uh somebody like ant  And probably because you're black you're not allowed you are not allowed to be centrist  You have you have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go to the point far left. I am the black man that's either not black enough or i'm too black. Yeah, exactly  Right. Yeah, I live right in the middle. Yeah, exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I think the vast majority of people  Are kind of in that middle in one in one way or the other  I think that's more the american state than anything else and yet we're so all of this so-called polarization  Is really this battle between these people on your side jeff jeff the extreme left and the extreme right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there is a I think it's not right there right there. You're making an equivalency

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, but wait wait  There is a vast majority of people like ant in the middle who are looking to the left looking to the right  And saying this doesn't reflect me. This is a battle  that uh  Is not reflective of my experience. That's right  I don't want to put words in your mouth. No, 100 100  So I can kind of understand that and um  I think it's I think that people like you jeff were in the hurly burly of it  Think that that's all that there is making presumptions here. I know no no no no no a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Believe me, there's tons of people on the left who think i'm way too conservative  Uh, I defend capitalism. I defend these so you get it too. I get it too. Absolutely. I got it this week. Absolutely  I get it all the time not from the left, but he got it and I don't want it  I want to have discussions. I'm trying to write an academic book. I what I love is having a discussion with so how could about this  How could I mean honest?  How can we get to the google change there's a nudge there's a little  For that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't mean to start this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is actually the sort of thing. I wasn't gonna go there stacy. I wouldn't go there. I appreciate you asking

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought it was I was trying to like engage you since normally I tune out all of this stuff  That was a mistake. Now you know why  I know  Like i'm done. I don't know what's wrong with me

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the google change law  Oh  Now we can't find the whole dead note there we go

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm gonna rip through this because I don't care one bit. There's not much here  There is google search on desktop tests redesign that puts images video and more  To the left jeff  To the left. It's your fault, sir. Yeah, I blame you  Uh google now is getting an upgrade to nearby share where you don't any this makes me very nervous  You don't ever you don't actually have to say  Okay, if you're in the shirt your own computer you share to your own computer, which I think is probably a good idea  But it does also make me a little nervous that there's no yeah, okay  Uh, you can actually with airdrop on apple turn that on I think so it happens automatically  So I guess that's just parody. Yeah, it's catching up. It's catching up nearby  Share it's called and I think it's moving google closer to something apple calls universal control where you can actually  Kind of control all the devices from any one of them  So interesting. We'll watch  There was another zero day in chrome. This is the third  emergency fix this year  Two vulnerabilities actually in the chrome web browser, but one of them's a zero day already  Exploited in the wild get your get your update  To your google chrome. It's a high severity zero day bug actively abused by attackers  Steve gibson talked about it yesterday on security now if you want more details, can I ask you a question about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so  When I go looking for the show and I look up google news  Every time these kinds of things happen a whole bunch of it used to be like just the new york post  And then it was you know  Your night reader paper and now it's even the technology publications the cnets, you know  You must not install this immediately emergency emergency. It's just going crazy. It's usually it's all it is right  There's no this is not I mean, yes, you should update but it's not a big deal, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you get updated  Automatically, so yeah, I wouldn't worry but there are a lot of security flaws  We seem to be finding a lot of microsoft patch 238 flaws a week ago  So there are a lot of security flaws

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Out there and really there's more attention. Yes on it and there's also more  um, you know more people a more people looking but also  We're recognizing and there's much more government paying attention and stockholders paying attention to oh crap. This is a big deal. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean we should pay attention to it. We should but it's not here on fire  It's not getting worse or anything or well it might be  I mean we also got to be aware that you know with the war in ukraine russia

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Started looking for things and that's right is kind of what I feel like and we've been talking about it for a while  And we've been building things that are going to be better  but until that actually starts happening  We're kind of hosed. Well the positives well and our friend craig newmark, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just last week we talked about he's giving 50 million dollars to worry about our cyber security

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the positive slant on this is we are finding and fixing them. Yeah, I think that's really the truth and that's there  As they should you could say we're going to do better, but we're not going to do better there  There's always going to be bugs software is it's just inherent in the process  So yes, we're getting better finding them and we're fixing them, which is good  So update your chrome if it's not updated already  Google is rolling out new badges for chrome extensions, which will help you avoid the bad  Extensions, why don't they just get rid of the bad? I was wondering

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, they're bad  Don't get it. I guess it's the ones they can really verify are good

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, if you so google is now using a manual process  To evaluate extensions for an enjoyable and intuitive experience. They're also making sure under the hood developers are using  The latest apis and they're looking at extension privacy practices and permissions  And then if you do it all well  You will get a prize ribbon  Identifying you as a featured extension  It says created by the owner of a listed website publisher has a good record. No history of violations  Uh, it meets a high standard of view user experience  and design

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They should end that with comma yet yet. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's actually not a joke because sometimes these extensions get sold. They're very popular  They're very safe and then the new owner does all sorts of nefarious things  So they're going to be two badges one with a check mark design  for verified identity  And another badge that looks like a prize ribbon  For best practices look for those in the extension  Store, are you ready for your free titan security key?

I see turtles and animals see animals  Die from plastics. I we now have plastics in our lungs in our bloods. We have micro plastics  And it and it uses oil it's a bad thing so i'm gonna you know  I don't carry plastic bags to the grocery store. We have shopping bags  We try to eliminate plastics everywhere. There is one place in our lives. It's hard to eliminate plastics  That's in the cleaning things we use the clean products we use but I have to tell you  An estimated five billion  Plastic hand soap and cleaning bottles are thrown away in america every year five billion  Thrown away, and if that weren't bad enough  Most of those bottles were filled with 90% water when they were delivered to the store in a big truck  They're shipping water around in these blue land has figured out a way to win for everybody  Stop wasting water stop throwing out more plastic get blue lands revolutionary  refill cleaning system instead  Blue land was founded on the belief that the cleaner planet starts by eliminating plastic waste  While creating powerful effective cleaners in your entire home, and I know what you're thinking  Oh, i've tried those eco-friendly cleaners. They don't work. No these work. These are great. This is an example  This is a blue land forever bottle. This is the for it says on it multi-surface. It's a beautiful bottle  It's about 10 bucks when you buy the the kit  You don't throw it away when you when you use it up you fill it up with warm water up to the line  And you drop in a tablet  And it dissolves and it makes a great cleaning solution they've got multi-surface cleaner they've got dishwashing soap they've got hand  Dishwashing soap they've got dishwashing machine soap. They've got a toilet cleaner. Those tablets are great  By the way, throw them in you don't need a bottle for that. You throw it in the toilet. It's incredible  Uh, I I have the hand soap everywhere in the house. We even have it at work now  Did you see that I put some in and it smells great?  And then when you run low they don't you don't throw this out you don't get a new bottle  You just get a tablet you they have a replenishment service if you want or you can just order them on  On demand as you need them. They have wonderful scents iris agave. That's what's in the bathroom the men's room right now parrion lemon  lavender eucalyptus  Uh, they have unscented products as well. If you don't want sense we wash all our laundry in it  We do our dishwashing in it. No more plastic bottles for us and it feels good and you're not sacrificing anything  They're effective  So just discard that outdated idea that eco-friendly products are more expensive and less effective. You're going to save money  These uh, these tablets money saving refill tablets start at just two dollars each  So this is an incredible  Money saver earth saver and you're gonna love it plastic free laundry and dishwasher tablets  The toilet tablet cleaner it sells out get it. It's back in stock. I am a huge fan  Just fill these beautiful instagramable bottles with warm water pop in  One of the hand soap or spray cleaner tablets and within minutes you have a powerful cleaning product that smells great works great  And there's earth friendly. I think in every respect  This is a win all around try blue land today, you're gonna love it your planet will thank you  Your kids will say wow, it smells good in here  And they'll wash their hands more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mr. Jarvis that amazon number about the drivers. What was that again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's 260 000 drivers around the world. It's in jesse's it's under the amazon section  It's in jesse's shareholder letter question for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you think that's enough because of the whole work conditions narrative that we hear from all of the drivers struggling to make the deliveries on time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a good it's a good question, man  I mean, I you know, I was I was just thinking about I mean I haven't  How long has it been since we've gotten an amazon delivery from uh ups or the mail? Yeah, it's been a while, right?  They've they've managed to take it over in a way that who thought it was possible  I mean there's these areas where I you know, I thought too small like nobody's going to be able to do map every street in the country

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's ridiculous. It's fine. They're taking over but at what cost though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think there is a cost not just to the humans but also to the roads  I will get sometimes three or four deliveries from three or four different trucks in one day. Oh, yeah  Yeah, and that means there's way too many trucks out in the back. That's you. That's me  My

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is suffering

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, right  We have a neighbor that gets so many amazon deliveries  They put a giant metal box outside with instructions and a number code and it says put the amazon packages in here  and even then  Many's the day where obviously the box is full and it's piled high with amazon packages

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so so and I think a couple things I think that the unionization at amazon like starbucks is gonna is gonna spread  No question about it  It's gonna need to even though they pay more than everybody else and they've raised the rates  They've raised the salaries of of people on hourly wages across industries  It's part of the reason that we have inflation right now  But it's a good thing because it's a redistribution of wealth and it should happen  So amazon has done that well, but yes, the work conditions are difficult. They also another story today is they're going to be hired  former attorney general  Oh  the lady  Yeah  The larena loretta lynch lorina bobbit, uh lynch  To do a race  Yes, we do we do that's what we're trying to talk over you not lorina bobbit loretta lynch, of course  Good lord, man  Stacey just stares at the camera. She says i'm so sorry i'm here

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So so sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, so anyway, they're gonna conduct a racial equity audit at amazon  So I think things are gonna I think they're gonna have to change at the company and and

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not a bad thing somebody the chat room is like many in the chat room pointing out I could if I weren't so greedy  Set my amazon deliveries to all come on a single day same day. Yeah. Yes, you could would that eliminate all those trucks?  That's uh, isn't it?  Same trucks in the same day. Isn't that part of the whole save the earth message? Yeah, i'll try it  That's you're absolutely right. I should do that. It is true

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sometimes I because we have our set to go in the same day  But sometimes we do get multiple amazon trucks at our house at the same time  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it can't help. Yeah, i'll turn that on. All right, let's think about it. We all drove to five different stores waffle time waffle time  Uh, stop waffle time. It is first though before waffle time ant pruett's turn for his picks of the week. All right
