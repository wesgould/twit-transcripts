Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hi, Gina. Hi. How are you? Great to see you. Welcome  We're gonna talk about it. We're gonna talk about the big phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because as usual we have to talk Jeff Jarvis down off the ledge  Jeff Jarvis professor of journalism at the City University of New York  There's his Osborne one over his right shoulder there or left shoulder. I'm still using that that's how far behind  What would Google do blogger at buzz machine calm  so  We were hoping we talked last week that for the first time ever  All three hosts of this week and Google would be using the same phone  And Jeff has ruined  No, he isn't because you so you got so we're talking about the one plus one which no one can get  It's still in very very short supply. You have to either get an invite by the way, don't ask me  I don't have any I didn't get any because the way I had either we both affect all three of us that they got  It from from friendly listeners  And so they have the invites not us  This one plus one is from one plus net  They call it the flagship killer and we've all Gina and I anyway have been very impressed with it  Especially because the 64 gig model which is the one we recommend is only 350 bucks  Unlocked yeah, yeah, that's great. So  And you know in every respect it is a top-of-the-line phone snapdragon 801 processor three gigs of ram very few phones have that  64 gigs of storage  13 megapixel camera we find quite good  A very nice 1080p display at five and a half inches. This is it they call it a flagship killer  I'd agree with it at a unbelievable price  But you have to get an invite or you have to play a game to get it or you have to have nice listeners  Which is thank you very much listeners. Yeah. Thank you listeners. You guys are awesome. Jeff who is currently using a Nexus 5 is reluctant  What what it from what stems your reluctance  Well a little bit was actually your talk last week I was feeling a little bit a little bit used here

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a marketing gimmick. It is not clearly that  It is and then I then I went on and my deflated my bubble because I I was  Going to my printer situation in a minute, but I had returned a printer this week and I returned something else  I was looking at it and I said hmm  I went on to their service area and they basically said oh we we were too busy to give much service. Good luck  I asked for an rma now, I think four days ago when I haven't heard a word back yet  So I thought you're not gonna get any service on this thing at all. I think that's the case  I think you shouldn't expect that if something breaks you can send it back to them

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And so I thought jr was gonna open hers and why not let Mikey eat it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd see what she thought  So if jr was happy and if jena knowing how neurotic I can be and what a pain I can't get out of it  And knowing that I now know where to find her and I can show up on her doorstep and say make this work for me  That she would have to give me good advice

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And say open it. Oh man putting this on me putting this on me, but you made a good point jeff. You're the real the real question is  In the in the kind of the context of coming from a nexus 5  Yes, I mean if you're if you were coming from a galaxy galaxy s i'd say yes  But nexus 5 that's a little bit more challenging. Oh, you're playing with me, right? Yeah, I'm messing with you. You know my neuroses don't you?  Well, the nexus 5 is a really great

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really great phone the top of it too is that I feel a little profligate saying I have a you know  How many people in the world would love to have this phone and here I am going to buy another phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What are you guys send it to the starving people in china? I mean this came from the starving people in china

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They didn't want it. Well, that's that's the other thing by the way  Maybe maybe it's subsidized by the chinese government because it's going to spy on all of us

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, this is the real the the thing. I I think I I was unfair last week when I I really  I said I called shenanigans  By the way, I just accidentally  Just by doing a v I think um

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me untorch you is it l or is it b? No, it's just a backwards me. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  um  I think that was unfair and we we talked about it again on twitter and and the consensus I think of the of the tech  Journalist community is the reason it's so hard to get this is they just can't they're they are a small company  And they just can't make them very fast  There there was a tear down from eye supply that said it probably costs around 200 bucks to make so  Maybe it is doable that you could make a 350 dollar flagship killer. Maybe that is maybe that's not  I was I was guessing that it was  That they were price dumping that they that this was below cost and they haven't done any marketing  Yeah, they said had some plan to somehow  Send you over to the opo phone now  Yeah, but but but you raise a really good point, which is  There it is to it's what thing that is clear is it's too small to offer any support of any kind  Yeah, so but I think when you buy a 350 dollar phone, that's kind of it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You you understand? I mean, I don't forget. I have a  350 dollar phone right here. That's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So before I let jean say i'm gonna say one more thing which  Is that that nexus 5 is a great phone except for two I think two things one doesn't have a removable battery  So, you know if the back is sealed to its camera is is okay at best  Now let's so you you would agree both of those things are negatives

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Size is good. So five-inch the battery in that is not wildly removable. It's not like I can carry around  This is a removable either. This is not removable

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it has really insanely good battery life. So that becomes very good. That's that's moving  That's important. What are you getting? Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, the battery life is great. I forgot to plug it in the other night  Normally, you know I got to the habit where I had, you know  Absolutely if I hadn't plugged my phone in overnight, I was basically so well the next day  Um, and and it was fine. It took me through to lunch the next day. So I i've been getting great battery life  I've been really impressed with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I use the g-sam battery monitor to kind of assess this because I think the only way to know it is to use it for  Like a week or so and g-sam keeps all the stats  And it's it's on so g-sam was telling me on my htc 1 ma that I was getting 16 hours  This says almost 19 hours  And I would say that's about right about almost 20 hours battery life

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, I'd say that's about right and I use it like crazy  Yeah, yeah  I mean we started to talk about this a little bit in the pre-show and my advice to jeff well first  The whole like I have a nexus 5 should I really have this other phone?  You got you got to get rid of that guilt because the way that I look at it is I feel the same way  I'm privileged i'm surrounded by amazing devices  But we're you know, we're doing a service to our listeners if we're doing our jobs, right?  And we and we cover android and we cover google so you kind of have to get over that you can always donate your nexus 5  um, if that happens

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no twitter friends no twitter friends don't line up  I'm gonna hold on to both of them. Don't line up. Stop asking me. All right, go ahead. Gina

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But okay, so the hardware is is awesome. The camera alone. I think is a great is a great reason  Uh to to switch to the one plus the harper is amazing. The screen is huge  The phone is so big that I can no longer put this in the front my front jeans pocket  Which if you don't do that not a big deal, but it just pops it just sticks out too much  So if if that if size matters to you too big it might be too big for you  But if you've got big hands and you put it in your front  Shirt pocket that should be fine. It's super thin  Um, the screen is beautiful and so the hardware alone I think is worth switching the software cyanogen is  Really great. Um, and I was saying to leo that at first I felt a little bit like a stranger in a strange land  I haven't used cyanogen in a long time  It's not hugely different  But there are a few extra settings which i've had to sort of play around with a little bit to get used to them  That might throw you off a little bit at first  So I think once you've got your launcher and your google apps  You'll feel right at home the same way you feel on your nexus 5 just to explain a little bit about that because

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  People may not be familiar with what's going on here  um  You know samsung has touch wiz htc has sense. Those are skins they put on top of  The standard google android interface the nexus 5 is the standard google nexus interface  Android interface, it's pure  so  Cyanogen did I mean one plus did something interesting and they uh went to a third-party  Android that has traditionally been used as a replacement  From people would root their phone and replace the firmware on their samsung or htc  With cyanogen mod and it's an enthusiast version of android so it had  It had traditionally a lot of kind of quirks and weird things  Also had problems with not being perfect because it was always an aftermarket something  Hackers had to get the phone and try to make it work and so forth  But it but it does have the advantage of having all the google apps at google services and being a hacker  response to ugly skins  Um, this version of cyanogen which is designed specifically for the one is much cleaner than the ones i've used in the past  And totally reliable gps works camera works all the things that sometimes can be finicky on cyanogen are  Are working fine  So this is merely what one plus did and i'm sure they funded it and i'm sure they gave them phones and they worked with  Them to make sure it all worked perfectly  So it is a even if you've had an experience with cyanogen. It's not like the one you put on your galaxy s3

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, right, right and you know in cyanogen while it offers themes and and and skins  Cyanogen itself is a build of android that that changes or exposes. I would say exposes some settings in android  That google's chosen to hide so it's it's it's it makes android a little bit more configurable  Um, so for example in cyanogen the auto rotate button you can say lock my rotation on my phone  This is built into android you'll see it on tablets, but it's disabled on phones google's decided that this doesn't really matter on phones  But cyanogen decided hey, let's expose this on phones  I happen to find that really useful. I like to be able to turn on youtube  You know lock my rotation and hand it to my daughter and and it won't you know switch around when she moves the phone  And so so those are the kind of customization. Those are the kinds of customizations. You'll see with cyanogen. It's not just a skin  It feels like a little bit more functionality

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do I lose anything or I keep google now and all that? Oh, yeah, all that's the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All that's the same all the google app ship with it. Um, I was running the now launcher on  On my on my m8 and on my nexus  Uh, you can run that on this as well. In fact, I would recommend that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's got the whole thing the stock launcher that ships with trebuchet is very bare bones  Um, it really lacks some things that i've but i've always used third-party launchers  So google now is now available for it  In fact, it's available for all phones besides not just the nexus. So it's going to be the same launcher you're using right now jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. I know where to find you jean or trupani

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm scared, but I think I think you're gonna like it  I just be prepared for that inevitable feeling of being a little bit jarred at the beginning of using something new  But keep but given keep it in open mind the first couple of days and I think you'll you'll really like it

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Am although he doesn't care what I think he  I do no, no, no, let's face it. He he assumes that I just just get new phones every month for the joy of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you do

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like leo's how at the end of the windows show you're saying, you know, I I should use this more that 1520 is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Nokia 1520 is a great phone to suck up to the windows audience. I am not no no no no no no no  That's that's sincere and I say it here too  It's a great phone and i'll say the same thing I said there the apps the app store is what keeps me from using it  Because like and in fact, I even said that I don't have google now. I don't have uh google search  I don't have uh, you know, I don't have google maps and that's what keeps me from using it  But it is in every respect a wonderful highly recommended phone the 1520  This is a good phone. I jeff opened the box for crying out loud  The only thing I think that jeff makes a very good point is there will be no support

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Some more guaranteed updates for two years. Yeah, they'll go to the l word as soon as possible

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's gonna be that what's one disadvantage. You're gonna wait 90 days past the nexus 5

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because they have yeah, you will wait because they do have to they have to rebuild re cyanogen it it's true that's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That is a little disadvantage  All right better, okay, so what does she what does he get that's better  better camera for sure  Bigger screen that could be a pro or a con actually. It's not that much bigger. It's half an inch bigger  Better battery better battery life. Oh the better battery is actually you know what? That's the reason what are you getting on your nexus 5?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I get through the whole day. Do you no problem? Okay, unless I unless I literally weighs on and that just sucks it down

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because that's to me the that would be the deciding factor for me  I did not get a full day on a nexus 5. I would have to charge it at seven or eight o'clock at night  I want to get 16. I have to get 16 hours  I want to get from the moment I get up to the moment I go back to bed. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah a little bit more functionality things like, you know tapping the home screen and it and it and it lights up  So you're not always searching for the power. That's good  Um things like the you know the torch  Right. I mean that's just you know, you can get rid of an app. It's sort of built in. Yeah, you could put that tesla has a

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Widget yeah, I have that on my I have that on my phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's it's built in and the things like that, you know that auto rotate that I talked about

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Jeff. What carrier are you on?  AT&T. Oh, okay, because this will not work on Verizon

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now you think I'm on Verizon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If the device you shipped is broken says effing done, what are you gonna do?  You can't wait too long because you won't be able to return it  Well, no, I already asked for the rma. Ah smart man, but I haven't gotten one. He's thinking well, but but yeah  Clock has started. Yeah  I think you're gonna like it. I love it. I like it much more than I thought I would

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  all right, good, so I was in return mode because I got I got a in my  Mac-less pc-less world. I got a brother printer that supposedly was going to work  on um  Google cloud print. Yeah  But not directly only basically if you had a machine and even the uh, wonderful  Lantronix machine is not on the list of approved ones and as yada yada yada yada

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, you have a Lantronix. You have the expert server. I have the one which should just work

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, did let's maybe i'm screwing it up. Gina come to new jersey. I think it should that should just work  Uh, well it works, but they have a list of approving but I also want to be pure so glad that's worked for lines  I want to be pure. I want to figure this out  um, so  uh, a nice person on on twitter, uh twig fan recommended a um,  uh  Not a cat absent  So I have an absent one which  Until just now I tried to print at home and it wasn't working. So it was off  So the Lantronix is on right now and it'll print through when it's available  But the absent should work but the other thing about the icing with the absent is the absent will scan to drive

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh very nice, that's a big deal. That's a big deal because um

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  scanning is a pain in the butt  so  Um, if that works if I can keep that working then that's why then i'm except for skype i'm done skype skype happens on this

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Also to be clear because the people in the chat room are asking this you can't get this from a carrier  You can only get it from one plus  It's a gsm phone. So it will work in the u.s on at and tnt mobile  I just put my tnt sim in and it just worked  Did you you just put your t-mobile sim in jeanette? It just worked

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had to switch to I had a nano for the m8. So I had to switch to a micro  So I went to the t-mobile store and the t-mobile guy nearly died when he saw it  When he saw the phone that's a nice feeling  Yeah, yeah, he's like what phone is that? And I said the one place he's like I thought so but I haven't seen  person  I enjoy I enjoy trolling the t-mobile folks and and yeah, and he just switched out my sim and I  Popped it in  That's awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I bought a sim even though it turns out I didn't need it I bought a sim conversion thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it'll work with a micro sim, which is still the most common kind. Although  Um, I have a number of nano sim phones apple started this thing and people resisted it  But they won so a lot of phones have nano sims, but you have a micro on your five. So you're good. Yeah  All right  By the way a number of people are talking about the lgg3 is the killer phone because it's ultra high  deaf screen  but a lot of people are reporting poor battery life and sluggish performance because it's an ultra high def screen and I don't think you  Gain anything from having uhd on your on your phone  so  While the g3 looks good in so many respects that might  It might not be a good choice if battery life are important to you. This is snappy

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And 20 hours come on. Well, you know what's gonna happen the day I open it up. They're gonna announce the nexus 6

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's what i'm concerned about that's a given that's a seriously that's that's that's what i'm worried about the nexus 6  Is going to get announced and you're going to hate me

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you and you don't care, uh if the moto x plus one comes out because you you you like you want a pure experience  I think so. See I probably will give this to somebody when the moto x plus one comes out because I love that always listening

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh that the stuff I want that I do want that's why I could have sworn that existed on this thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Only if you there's home screen, but all all google phones now do that where you can say, okay google on the home screen  I don't know if there's any way to wake it up other than that  That's special hard. That's special hardware on the m7 always on voice for the moto x plus one. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait a second one plus is apparently let them form users choose hold on darn it. I don't want your ad  Choose the voice-based hot word that will wake up the phone the available choices include. Okay one plus wake up one plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have not seen that in this  I don't know  That might be a march 12 story. Yeah, that was some early pre-release version that maybe they didn't leave that in

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The nice thing is you can see if there are any

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apps like special apps you get with cyanogen model you do get voice plus  And there's some privacy settings that i'm sure that jeff is not interested in

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, by the way, that is the chief advantage of this to people who don't want  Google to know what's going on is that cyanogen is is very much privacy focused. Of course, the chinese government may know everything you're doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yeah, you can basically you can block apps from getting access to the the personal data  Even if you granted them permission to access that that personal data in the play store, i'm not really sure how this works  Uh, but from what I can see  Yeah, so like so i've clicked on amazon and it just yeah it prevents the it prevents the app from from reading your contacts  Or looking at your photos or your location, which is really interesting or it may or and or or you can set it to ask you  Or just flat out deny it every time. It's extremely granular privacy controls

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, they try hey snapdragon. Hey snapdragon

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nothing

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And and you're saying with the phone off  I think you would disable that if it did have that because that's going to be a battery killer

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, i'm just gonna make fun now i'm gonna have you say hey i'm an idiot, you know, hey i'm an idiot

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it still doesn't wake up  Squirrel  I hate it when they put in a video  You gotta watch it forever  So while jeff watches a video let's say thank you to our friends at squarespace.com  Gina I presume that you talk all about this on all about android, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We did we we we did talk about we did talk about it quite a bit. Yeah, it's uh, that's you know, jason  Jason did the canonical review. I think he did it before I stole his this is his

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, okay, I feel really guilty about this and so here's my I did give him the google glass  He did in both cases. I paid for it. I paid for this and I paid for the google glass  So they technically are mine  They are yours, but it was somebody who contacted him to say hey, I got a one. Would you like it for review?  We let him review for voice wake up feature

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Voice wake up feature voice is a voice wake up feature turn that on  Then you can train

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'll let gina do that because I have to do an ad  Um, so I feel a little guilty but then but I but I asked I said jason you're going on vacation  You totally can take this with you. She said no, I got a nexus 5. It's okay  I said this can be I don't want to take it away. She said no, no, it's fine  But I think he was being nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it doesn't sound like jason, but it's okay leo, but it's okay here's okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So as soon as the moto x plus one comes out i'm giving this back. It's it's it's his

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I see. I see. Okay, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which is leo now saying he's not that crazy about this. No, I love this phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The only thing it's missing and maybe you've just solved that i want to try it is the is the fact that it's always I love  Be a seller for me. I I love the fact  There's a few things the moto x does that no other phone does it knows when you're driving it knows when you're awake  It knows when you're in a meeting it does a lot of now. I have this  Agent app that does much of the same thing but not exactly  I love the thing where the pulses and it shows you your text messages. There's just things it does  Oh, I hear google now launching  There are just things it does that I that I really like and it does it because it has dedicated hardware  That sips it power while it's waiting for all this stuff to happen  And I and it has an OLED screen that you can just light a little bit of it  So it does it without damage, you know hurting the battery life  So I just i'm excited about the next generation of moto x

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So i'm putting this video on the rundown under other

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay. Well, so we wait. I have to watch a video in order to figure out how to turn this voice thing  This is the thing about cyanogen mod is that you'll find yourself i'm putting it under genus tip  Okay  You do find yourself googling like how do I disable voice plus the chat room has put a thread

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  From the one plus forms, you know, that is probably where you're gonna you be worth bookmarking the one plus net forms  Because probably that's where a lot of this kind of information  Is going to uh end up  Not from one plus staff  It says initially we plan to release. Okay one plus at the end of june to early july  We've collected okay one plus recordings from our fans an attempt for the project to be a community effort  Cyanogen even set up a studio at their office had people come in to record the phrase blah blah blah  They haven't done it yet  I'm disappointed to say the release date for this feature has been pushed back  So this is something you'll get later in an update jeff  We've now started working with a recording company to redo the recordings professionally  There's no new set release date, but look for the okay one plus feature on future updates in a month or two  So that's the problem with a lot of the reviews of the one plus were with pre-release hardware  Uh-huh  Uh-huh  Our show today brought to you by our good friends at squarespace.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's jaja who says that  Big story we covered this a lot on all of our shows starting sunday. I think on twitter google  Tipped off authorities at the national center for missing and exploiting children  That they had found child porn  In somebody's gmail account that person was arrested as a child pornographer  But now of course, uh, while that's a good outcome, uh, everybody's wondering. Well, is google looking at all the images in my gmail?  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The answer is no. No, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think what we know in fact, I think we heard I'd only read this headline. Yeah, we said  Well, what happened is, uh a houston man was arrested on charges of having and promoting child pornography  After google told the national center for missing and exploited children. He had  Pornographic child porn images in his gmail account because the images are fingerprinted, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is the key bit of information that I think makes this okay, but let's let you be the judge  the national center for uh, which  Missing and exploited children, which is kind of quasi-governmental. There actually is a legal reporting requirement to report  Child porn to them and they'll facilitate the arrest if you don't man, you can go to jail because you have yeah  But if somebody sent you a child or sent me a child porn image  I would immediately report them to the national center for missing and exploited children, of course  That would be if you if you browse my one

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and  Don't in your cash  It's in your cash and you don't call you are liable. Yeah, okay, so you are legally compelled. This isn't a voluntary thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay to facilitate this  the national center for missing and exploited children, which I will now hear and after refer to  As the ncm ec  nick nick mick  Has taken a database of course, they're always adding to this database of images that are illegal  and hashing them  So as you all know because you're technically literate hashing means going through that image and creating a number that fingerprints it  It's accurately precisely with a fairly low depending on we don't know what technology they use but a fairly low chance of false positives  Uh, maybe one in fifty thousand one and a half a million

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We don't understand leo. It's not as if they put a fingerprint on the image  Is they have a they know what the image is a distillation of the image into a number

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, signature some yeah signature

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And we don't know though if they use an md5 hash which has many more chances of uh false positives or whatever  Um, they nobody's told us that but they have this database  And it it's my belief that every email provider has this database and routinely compares images  Now what they're not doing is looking at your image in the in in processing your email  A computer has to take the email scan it for things like  The address you're going to uh, it does scan it for that  It has to do that and if it's if you've got spam prevention has to scan for spam  Signatures some of which may be hashes some of which may be words  So the computer is always churning through your email in this process. Apparently google does make a hash of all images  If the resulting fingerprint matches the fingerprint of the database bingo now what we don't know is what happens next  Does somebody at google look at the image some human has to look at the image?  Because that's how you know if it was a false positive  Do they merely forward the mail automatically to the national center for missing and exploited children?  Who then do that some human at some point or maybe law enforcement has to look at the image and say yes bingo

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This isn't a pornographic image. So do we know for sure that every email provider?  Is required to do this does every email provider does hotmail do this and yahoo mail everybody who provides an email services  Does this match against this database of signatures for all attachments in every email?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm on the united states department of justice page  The child exploitation and obscenity section  Where it says how to report child pornography?  To report an incident involving the production possession distribution or receipt of child pornography file a report at the ncm ec's website  At cyber tip line.com or call an 800 number your report will be forwarded to law enforcement agency for investigation and action  That sounds to me like law enforcement ultimately gets the image and decides  You may also wish to report to federal state or local law enforcement personnel  But the the doj says call the ncm ec  I would bet you there is a legal reporting requirement  I would bet you  That every I don't know because we don't this is a reporting requirement, but is there a scanning requirement?  No, I guarantee you there's not a scanning requirement  But there is a reporting requirement. So  I would bet you every email provider who doesn't want to fight

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Child pornography right and if if every provider is doing this they're not advertising it, of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, no, uh, but but at the same time just like you and me  They don't want to be held responsible for forwarding child porn

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they don't want the story to come out and say all the the perv used, you know  Gmail for the last 10 years. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It would make perfect sense to me and I if I were microsoft you damn well better bet i'd be using this database  it doesn't it's it's a simple easy thing to do that I believe does not invade privacy because

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No one's looking at your email. I agree. However, it launched of course techno panic immediately. Oh my god  Google's reading all of our email and seeing all of our images and horrible things are happening

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I admit and I'm sure jeena too  Until you understand how they're doing it. There's some cause for concern. It's a question

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, I mean it's a question and I thought to myself, okay  Does this mean that google is scanning every image and doing facial or object?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Recognitions that I do not believe they are doing and that was the question we had  Because we know you can scan for instance for a certain percentage of flesh  And google has already said we can in in google plus we can distinguish between a child and an adult  So it's not so far-fetched to think that google could in in their technology  Scan for child porn they I don't believe they are doing that. I don't think that's something they'd want to do  no  Because of the chance of false positives what they could

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this is I mean, this is interesting. I mean, I felt like the techno panic was  Well, what else how else is gmail scanning my messages in a way that maybe I didn't know they were doing before

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google said we're not doing those. This is all we're doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  right, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's a related

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To my you know, my mother of the baby in a bathing suit or in her diaper  It gave me pause for a second like oh, I mean, obviously it's not and that's to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why google is not going to be scanned for flesh and child?  They're going to use this ncm ec database, which is known child porn images because the truth is  People who are trafficking child porn very almost always are you are trafficking in these known images  You know as soon as you as soon as they bust somebody and prosecute and successfully prosecute them  They've got the database of their images these people typically collect  Thousands of images this is whenever you hear somebody was arrested for this  They got stacks of stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and and and the way we used to work is you know  We've seen the stories you know, right where you have the innocent bathtub photo when the parents are hauled away  Because of the kid at the photo kiosk when your film came back made a bad judgment

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So here's a court case. Um  This is this is a court case going back a ways and thank you to the chat room  They've provided me with this link before  um in 2004 and 2005 aol's image detection and filtering program a routine scanning program aol used for security purposes  Recognize the digital this is 2004 10 years ago the digital fingerprint of certain files as child pornography  And pursuant to the mandatory reporting requirement usc  13032 b1  Aol reported the transmission of cyber tip line. This is 10 years ago  law enforcement traced the transmissions  And arrested somebody before trial  The suspect moved to suppress the evidence  Saying aol was acting as an agent of the government when it scanned the email attachments  Therefore the government had constituted had conducted an unconstitutional warrantless  Search of his email it violated his fourth amendment the court denied  Saying aol was not acting as a government's agency because the discovery of the pornography was the result of routine scanning  Conducted to recognize files that may be detrimental to aol  So the fourth circuit affirmed that by the way  So there is case law not going to the supreme court but going to the federal court the fourth circuit that that is not a  Unwarranted search and seizure

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay files that may be detrimental to aol. So google could be liable for hosting  Yes, pornographic known images. So this isn't about  You know trying to hunt down child pornographers, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is about a liability issue for them. Well, they may scan also for other things viruses in images  They certainly do they do. Yeah, they should you want them to?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, 13032 explicitly states nothing may in this section may be construed to require  A provider to of electronic communication services to engage in monitoring any user  But there is a mandatory reporting requirement. So to answer your question  They're not required to scan but they are required to report should they learn

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that goes see see your earlier discussion if you're if you're one of these companies  Do you really want to not scan? Yeah, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, the last thing you want is a newspaper story saying and the perpetrator used gmail to exchange  Pornographic images with thousands of others all over the country, but gmail caches copies these images too. So gmail is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Even images that even email that hotlinks images in other places gmail now caches so so so there is a liability where they are  You know, they're storing these images on their servers  So I see that of course, of course I buy the argument that you know  They may feel morally compelled to scan for this kind of thing  But I think but you know being compelled legally I think is you know makes a lot of sense as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Somebody the chairman's pointing out that both google and facebook scan faces in images to tag them  That's done automatically, right? Well not your email  No images put up in public. Okay, you're shivering and you're agreeing and you're agreeing by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do those terms of service when you yeah and you're agreeing and you opt into it and you can see that they're doing it  You know, which is which is different  I think a little different than i've sent this message and so I think google is  What scans like I'd love to have a list of all the things that all the processes that google runs on every message I send  And what they're looking for viruses spam  That'd be nice porn faces docs. I don't know you could assume all of the above right? I mean, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it's like what else it's kind of part of the intake right?  For instance if they're if they're caching files  Then they have to have a unique identifier for each file to prevent so the caching only works if you know, it's identical, right?  Yeah, so I mean this is all part of the intake jack schaefer jack schaefer and reuters raises a question

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's legitimate. All right, so let's say that in another country where homosexuality is forbidden  Um  They say that you have to find  homosexual images and report them to us  Is this a technological capability?  That could be misused and we will provide you with a hash of a thousand a million  homosexual photos

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And require you to both scan and report. I think you can pretty much count on google not to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you can but what's the basis? What's what's the what's the argument?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's the local law that's the big issue that we're seeing with the right to be forgotten right where  a country can  Compel google to act  Uh in odd ways. I mean you can't sell nazi memorabilia on ebay. That's a german requirement  right, um  I mean this is that's that's kind of a larger question for this global world

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know that where you have no business on the face of it. I have absolutely no problem with

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What google did google explicitly told insider business insider that it does not scan for evidence of other potential crimes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That it said explicitly that's the only crime it scans for we and they we and they have said this all along

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  in 2006  Google chief legal officer david drummond  Said google has a zero tolerance policy against child sexual abuse imagery  They've been very very active in that they say explicitly  That uh, they don't look for other crimes  However in the terms of service quote our automated systems analyze your content including emails  This analysis we've talked about this before analysis occurs as a content is sent received and when it's stored  So, you know they have kind of a blanket license to go through

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know the next step the next step here is that somebody looked at a site telling you how to make a shoe bomb  Somebody emailed a picture. Well, okay shoe box and this is and you know, by the way, Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, by the way jack is saying the dangers of deputizing google to bust channel pornographers. It's not they have not been deputized  They're not making a judgment here  so  You it's completely possible to come up with a million scenarios. That would be very very bad, right, but that's a foolish exercise

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I that's the essence of techno panic. I agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean I can I can think of all sorts of horrible scenarios, but  They're not doing that so right I agree the fact that they have the ability  you may not like but the thing I tell everybody is  I think you guys would agree with that  If you want to make the internet private, you're going to break the internet  That's what the right to be forgotten does it breaks the internet?  and so yes, I can see all sorts of horrific scenarios, but the fact is  Using the internet is not private any more than going to the mall is private and trying to mold the internet to make it private  Is going to break it just as if you said I have the right to be private at the mall  You don't so don't go all I can say is don't go to the mall  I don't think it's possible to make the internet private. Well, it's not possible to have

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A presumption of privacy in public because then we is what I wrote in my book  This is what we when we ruin the notion of of not just the internet but of public and it ruins things like journalism  Oh, no. No, no, you can't report on me the mayor being caught going into the opium den because I have a presumption of privacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What did you think of an eel's wonderful article in medium?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yes. I'm glad you asked lily. Oh, I was gonna ask what I didn't want to such a great article

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Uh, and I think so right on  About this whole issue of privacy. I'm sure you read it jeff, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I started to and there's we're not to go back to it  Tldr because because because there was also I think zanup did a response to him dana did a response on what is privacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, and now dana boide, of course  and by the way, she's had something to say about all of this stuff, but  I presume she would err on the side of privacy because she with all her work with young people  She understands how important privacy is to them

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but no dana also understands the value of public business sharing and and and sees a technopédic there dana's very  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Quite quite quite rational about these topics and okay in part of I just thought what an eel brought up was really right on  His article what is public? It's so simple, right?  He says uh, he points out that let's say an addiction recovery group decides to take advantage of the summer weather and meet in a park  Uh across the street legally you could take photos of the members  You could tag it with the names of their employers friends and family make sure no one missed it  conversations that take place in public parks are  Public we have this problem now with drones  Paparazzi are using drones and it isn't illegal unless it violates faa rules because you're in public  He says public is not simply defined  It's a fragile set of social conventions about what behaviors are acceptable and appropriate  He kind of berates  Media the news media that benefits from the gray area by for instance republishing tweets by saying well, hey, it's in the public eye

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think this is where he anil and jeff probably depart. Uh, you know because anil is arguing for consent in journalism  um, and uh  He and I have had this debate over lunch a few times and I wouldn't necessarily go that far

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He quotes  Hamilton nolan of gawker the things you write on twitter are public. They are published on the world wide web  They can be read almost instantly by anyone with an internet connection on the planet earth. This is not a bug in twitter  It's a feature  This is something it sounds like he's channeling jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a feature of society  You know if I if I all right, so so we're off the air and I tell you something leo  Uh, not not to be not on the off the air where we're not on the show, but we're in the pre or post show  No, no, no, I mean we're in your office. Okay, we're in my office  Can I tell you something the way I expressed it in public parts is that is that?  Privacy is a responsibility  It's an ethic of knowing someone else's information  And so once i've told you it is public to that extent. I no longer control that at all  however in the past

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  there has been  I think in journalism  A scale that you can weigh it on public good versus personal privacy  And if for instance you are the attorney general of the united states you have a lowered expectation  Because the public needs to know if you're up, you know, you're up to know good  Whereas if it's just some guy down the street there is a  There is kind of a burden on the journalist to say let's respect that guy's privacy, even though he's put it on twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Um, there's not a need to know this right and not privacy. It's privacy. It's more of  A a question of choosing not to use the power of media to give notoriety to something that doesn't deserve

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think that's all that anil is calling for is let's but there is but but but

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not just the internet. It's not just technology  Whatever i've told anyone through history, you know, we learned this at the third grade playground  You tell somebody something and you think they're not going to tell everybody you go to the lunchroom table and told everybody and it's uncool

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, or or it is or it isn't the point is well, that's my right because you said it in public i'm going to sock them

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the person who receives well, but but but  I tell you I have prostate cancer and a malfunctioning penis you think well i'm gonna keep that quiet  Then I go around on a broadcast. That's your choice. That is but that's right, but that's your choice  But the point is the point is you you have to judge the context which is which is a point that hella weber makes at nyu  It's very hard to do the reader you or the person whose privacy was violent in this case. I told you in your office this  and and I may be telling you because I  I i'm confiding in a male friend of mine  I may be telling you because I want to make sure you get tested  I may be telling you because I want you to spread the word in your powerful voice and get other people tested

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, there's a context to this. I understand but the issue that neil's raising is there is there is there are in some cases a  real journalistic response responsibility  To reveal this information and then there are in some cases it's exploitation that is good for business  But it is there's no public need to know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's irresponsibility. It's yeah notoriety all of it is technically public

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But that's an important consideration when revealing and what he's saying is the business models of some of the most powerful forces in society  Are increasingly the media are increasingly dependent on our complicity in making our conversations our creations our communities public  Whenever they can exploit public

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twitter is the difference is this if I go to facebook and I do a private message to you or I go to email to private  Message to you same as if I do on the street same issues. I just outlined  Twitter is different because I can go to twitter and I can search on  I understand no, of course all of this is factually true. He's just saying don't be a jerk

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. There's a difference between technically public, right? And of course factually it's public social conventions, but don't be an asshole

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Difference there's no but they're fine, but there's also a difference  It is a more public act being on twitter is a more public act than tell you that one

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I disagree. I think I think a lot of people use twitter knowing it's public but they're having a  Semi-private commerce they're at replying somebody else. They know that technically it's public what they don't expect  And you think it's completely wrong of them to expect that people will buy social more alone because of the functionality leo of search

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Two things can happen. One is somebody whoever I said this to can retweet it and they can go around the world  And then who's it who's at fault there, you know the first retreat or the 10th retweeter  second twitter search if I go searching for  You know small penis pictures  God knows what I'll find but I give up, you know  I'll find them and and it is that that's no if I put it up on a web  If I put up a web page and I only tell you the URL but Google finds it. Is that wrong?  No, it's on the net. What do you think jeena?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, uh, you know, I I agree with anil that it's like it's extremely complicated. Um, but I I mean  Does the reason why part of this came up is because uh, you know  Shanley cain was getting profiled by medium by elizabeth, uh spears  Respires and and she objected to the entire process because she felt like she did not give her consent  There was a point during the interview where she felt like the questions were invasive and she didn't want to participate  And liz basically said look i'm doing this profile. I'm going to talk to your friends and family  This is how journalism works and shanley was like this should you know, this is  This is harassment. You know, you should you should require my consent and then that that prompted jason calcana saying journalism doesn't require consent  And I I actually agree. I don't think that journalism does require consent  Uh, and anil was saying in that piece, you know that he that he thinks that it should I think that that would mean that  You know only the stories that people were okay with getting reported would get reported and and uh, and that that I think would do  A great disservice  So, um, so I agree with anil's larger point that it's complicated and it's nuanced and and dana's take on the privacy part of it  Was kind of the same thing  Um that it's nuanced and and complicated and it's not about whether or not something is technically public or private  It's it's about social convention amore and those things have to evolve especially with the new tools that we have  And they are new tools, but I don't think they're you know, they're they're sort of black and white lines here on this

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's what dana says and I I actually very much agree with dana boy. She says the very practice of privacy  Is all about control in a world in which we fully know  We never have control  Our friends might betray us our spaces might be surveilled our expectations might be shattered  But this is why achieving privacy is desirable people want to be in public  But that doesn't necessarily mean they want to be public and there's a huge difference  She says as anil points out our lives are shaped by all sorts of unspoken social agreements  Allowing and this is where I do agree with her. Although I don't know what you do about it allowing organizations or powerful actors  To undermine these social agreements for personal gain may not be illegal, but it does tear at the social fabric  You can't disagree with that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, it always has it always has that's why that's why the hacking case in the uk with murdoch's publications  It goes exactly to that because they tore into something that indeed was private. It was messages with your phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it tears at the social fabric. We would all agree that that's wrong and bad and they did get prosecuted and some of them got punished

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And going overboard, you know some some some  15 year old says something on twitter and the new york post puts it on page one and ridicules the person  Uh, that's bullying  Yeah, I I agree, but that's not about privacy. That's about the overuse of that power for  No good reason but economic gain. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But is that clear?  Is that clear though?  I mean when buzzfeed does a top 10 list and and just does a list of tweets by people who have 10 or 12 followers who are  Regular twitter users just talking to their friends and and kind of you know puts them in the public eye and then wraps it in ads  As an eel said, you know is that do do web content producers see that as as unethical? Is it unethical? Is it okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got one. I'll give you the same example. I just gave if I put up a web page  and I  Only give you the url  But it's searchable on google  And you can find it  Is that is that wrong? I know I put something up on the public net  Yeah, but i mean i'll give you a good example, let me give you a personal example because these are very abstract

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  so I post pictures of my family trips I  I I  inadvertently reveal text messages on the air  Uh a reporter at gawker ryan tate goes through all of this stuff really spends a long time  Obviously going through all this stuff to write a story about how i'm having an affair  And my family doesn't know a story that wasn't factually wrong except my family did know but and I wasn't having an affair  But he didn't have all the details because there was some private stuff about the fact that i'd already separated from my wife, etc  And it was a very hurtful article that came out on christmas eve  right nothing illegal done  completely uh  Amassed from public record  However, an extremely hurtful and I and I think wrong article. Am I wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I and and I threw down with ryan about that article  I was really pissed at him about that and and he and I went back and forth about it in private  Over email because I said to him and I thought that it was it was  Well, my problem with that piece is that he hadn't  He hadn't ever gotten in touch with you for for comment and he published it on christmas eve  Which just felt like such a hit well, whatever  I don't want to get into this whole thing  But I I had a serious problem with that and I talked to him and I talked to nick and we kind of agreed to disagree  In the end, but he really argued with me about it because I guess my opinion still holds sway because I used to work at gawker  Um, but yeah, no, I so like the but the line isn't clear. I guess this is this is what i'm saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But but I no, you know, there was no  Journalistically, there was no news value news judgment to what was done. It was done clearly just to exploit and to get well

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the kind of stuff we're talking about. That's where i'm saying the balance  There's a balance between the public's need to know and the legal right to do it versus the socially responsible

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that has existed since the penny press that has existed for a hundred years  That's always that's always been why people feared through the camera  And I think exactly what led but I think what anil's saying is that that that balance is no longer being observed

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We've in the past trusted institutions. It's never been observed. It's never been observed

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Media had there been yellower journalism was around for years and years and years. Yeah  And and schmucks are schmucks there's schmucks around and that was a schmuckish  Horrible thing to do it was it was no good reason for it and it was  um  Yeah, I mean his genius is well, there was a good reason for it. That is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  A very highly read article. They got lots of lots of revenue

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, there's an economic reason to but there was no there was no social reason to do it  There was no higher journalistic end to doing it. There was no need to well, that's what i'm saying is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And by the way, there's no law you're going to make about this, but I think it's appropriate to call out  Media institutions when they choose to exploit for economic  Benefit as opposed to do what they're supposed to do, which is represent the interests of the public

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So i've just finished my draft. You're never gonna read this. Believe me  You're never gonna read this but i've written a 55 000 word tome  on white paper  Yeah, now that the internet has screwed up everything jarvis. What now?  And I focus on new relationships and new forms and new models  And in trying to judge what journalism we should save if we're so worried about journalism  Well, we're not worried about helicopters showing you the fire five ten miles away, which isn't going to affect you  We're not worried about those stories. You just mentioned. We're not worried about the 40th  Um reporting of of the weather or or for that matter reporting on a football game or a celebrity  What's the essence of journalism that we really care about and I I end up giving a  I start with a very broad definition of journalism, which is helping communities organize their knowledge to better organize themselves  And then I narrowed it down in this analysis of saying what do we save what what do we risk of?  That's a very narrow part of journalism and that's journalism to me that is in fact advocacy  It is advocacy for improving society for improving your life  Yes for for and that includes things like getting the bad guys, but it includes other things I guess  Now to me that is journalism everything else is entertainment  Now if I say that i'm going to get in tons of trouble and economically  I have to broaden that back out again and include the football in it again and include the fires and the weather  I would agree with you 100 percent. I think you're right on  So in that case to make a journalistic analysis of this there was absolutely zero justification for what docker did to you  It was not journalistic at all. It was purely  salacious entertainment full stop  They should be ashamed of themselves. It wasn't journalism. It's now nick nick nick nick's argument is  I don't nobody I don't accuse myself of doing journalism. I do what I do

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, but but this is what neneal's saying is that these institutions say but it's all in public everything they used was in public

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This the argument was lee was a person of interest and this was this was a this screenshot was a matter

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It wasn't just a screenshot. It was images from my flicker feed. It was all public  They didn't delve into anything that was not public  The only thing they did is they focused it by taking it all putting it together

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not an issue of publicness or privacy. That's the wrong analysis  I would argue with anil and i'll take him out for drinks and we'll do this  I I would argue it's a public interest analysis

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  As the core of journalism, I agree. I agree with that. Yeah  But that's what i'm saying is that you have to weigh public interest versus people's right to be left alone. Let's not use privacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right to be left alone. So the guy I give you an example. So the guy who took the picture of the plane in the hudson  Yeah  He had I don't know how many let's say he had 10 followers. Well, that was public interest. Yeah  Right, so the issue is a problem with that. Oh, you can't you can't use that you can't  Posted it because he has 10 followers that analysis doesn't work. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  um  It's a good article read that read dana boyd's response. Both of them are medium  Uh anil dash and uh dana boyd. I think I think it's a really important argument and it  Points to a really good piece by john oliver this week  On native media and i'm sure native content which is another form by the way of this kind of  I think slipping standard in journalism  Yes, I agree  Oh, I didn't see this. Oh, it's good. It's pretty long. I don't know if we're gonna air it but uh,  I gotta air one little bit of it  um  The new york times the new york times saleswoman

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh that part. Yeah, but I also I also think the song um, what's her name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He sings a uh  It was so you know what at first I didn't watch uh john olivers this week  Last week tonight or whatever. It's called because I said it's just a ripoff of the daily show  Come on john, you know, you just you stole john stewart's format  And of course, he's a former daily show reporter  But I have to say he has done such great  Uh advocacy nailed a couple of segments. He's done such great advocacy journalism  And who knows anything about native content? This is not something that is talked about in mainstream media  We talk about it all the time. This is the the the advertisement hiding his editorial content  uh, very famously, uh, was it forbes that allowed the church of Scientology to write a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, that was the atlantic the atlantic even worse

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, because they just went off the the atlantic allowed the church of Scientology to write a puff piece about the church of Scientology  Posted on their website as if it were an article it says in fine print  You know, this is paid for but this this new idea of native content is everybody knows an attempt to trick  Viewers into thinking they're watching editorial content when they're really just watching advertising content

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, so so forms is the one that that allows advertisers to have what they call brand voice  And they have a little link next to it that says what's this as i've said to them  If you have to say what's this clearly the label ain't clear enough  So it's an effort to move now the new york times the other hand has started into this and they have and this is paid  Post and they change the color and they change the font. They do all kinds of stuff. So they did a feature about  um women in prison tied to orange is the new black  but  It troubles me because the readers they ask and say well, this is such a good story. Why didn't you assign this?  Why didn't you do this journalistically? And if it's an ad really for that  Then did you soften this, you know, what was the what was the influence of the advertiser?  Yeah fine. You said paid post but you're using your motif of telling me a journalistic story  Now for the sake of the advertiser, it's going to hurt the brand it hurt forbes brand  They were sold for less than they wanted because of this good

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know and it did hurt the atlantic's brand briefly  Let me see if I can find this  The new york times has engaged in this as well. You'd think the august new york times would be somewhat above this  And uh, he plays a little bit of a clip

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh from uh, you know what you want at four minutes started in four minutes because that's the jorda peretti part. It's funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well here here's meredith levy and she's executive vice president of advertising. Let's be fair at the new york times

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At let me start by vigorously refuting the notion that native advertising has to erode consumer trust or  Compromise the wall that exists between editorial and advertising good native advertising is just not meant to be trickery

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, obviously that's it wouldn't be good native advertising if it didn't trick the reader into thinking they were reading editorial meant to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Publishers sharing its its storytelling tools with a marketer. It's publishers sharing their storytelling tools

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow with marketers exactly exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not trickery it's sharing storytelling tools and that's not it's repurposed bovine waste

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you go to four minutes leo this stuff on jorda peretti i think it's pretty funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, let me find that and then we're gonna play the uh, the pepsi commercial because I think that's a really good example

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was that was beautiful. Yeah, it's messages that are often clear endorsements  And if you'll excuse me, i'll just take a break from making this point by enjoying the refreshing taste of mountain dew cold red  And then it's at this point that you usually realize. Oh, this isn't the thing that I was looking for  You're just advertising the most disgusting drink ever manufactured  Although I will say it does undeniably taste of red  Here's the pretty stuff native advertising though has been so lucrative for new media organizations  They basically built their entire business model around it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it would be a pretty big

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Misreporting misrepresentation would be I mean it says these posts are my own  They should not be because truth is anything but my opinion and views. Okay. Well, there you go  Wow, that's very cool facebook mentions versus facebook pages app  I want to talk and compare an app that most of you don't have access to facebook mentions compared to the pages app that  Anyone who has facebook page can download and use  I found out about mentions from a banner ad that was at the top of my facebook account earlier this week  And it was a customized with my icon on an iphone  So I downloaded it says william shatner  James tiberius kirk  He's just like a full-blown review like you would write for a magazine it's a life  screen screenshots

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah  Yeah, shatner took a turn at tech journalism

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So awesome opinion bill if you're watching, please  Get in touch with us. Let us know. Did you show did you write this? Come on the show?  He says i'm not quite sure why facebook released this app for quote celebrities  It seems to be ill conceived  I'll probably use it to post to my facebook when i'm on my phone  But it doesn't allow for mail or groups  I'll continue to use my regular facebook app as well as the pages app  Which means that shatner and zuckerberg lexus has three facebook apps on his phone  Gosh, that's amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, I can finish off the change log there isn't oh yes, sorry, sorry. No, no, that's okay. You really got sidetracked there  Sorry, I brought up the shatner review  And I actually think we talked about this a little bit earlier  But just to make sure that everyone knows the formerly nexus only google now launcher is now out for all android  4.1 and up devices. So this is the google now launcher that came out when kitkat was released on the nexus 5  Um, and it's in it's it's it's my default launcher. I leo. I know that it's not your default launcher  I really like it because you swipe over to the left and you get google now and it has some different interfaces for widgets and  Um, it you know, it has the the voice voice activated  google search really really nice  So if you didn't have a nexus or you had your phone hadn't got updated you can go to the play store now and try it out  Um, and uh, yeah, it's pretty nice launcher

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  you know what's great about that is it means that jeff can go from his nexus 5 to the one plus and um

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And have it right at home. It'll be the same. I've never changed the launcher. How do I change the launcher? I don't even know  Oh my god

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, it's automatic if you download the launcher the next time you press the home button it'll say oh  Would you like me to launch the launcher or google now?  and then you but my my um

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh nexus 5 is automatically on the google now launcher, right? It is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. So on the one plus one you'll download the google now launcher from the play store because that's going to default to uh,  trebuchet, which is the cyanogen one which I  I switched the google now launcher, but just download the google now launcher you press the home button  It'll say which launcher and just tap it and say always so there'll be a little bit of configuration

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you only have to do that once you tap on the ways. I know where you are. That's enough by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's enough. This just means we have to have lunch. That's all

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's another nice thing about cyanogen because unlike, uh the regular  uh  android, uh, do you have home  Personalization for home in the settings  So if you you can also just go to home in your settings and it'll show whatever launches you have installed and you could pick  Which one you want to use?  Okay, so it's now a setting that's something that is not part of the regular android. That's something many many different versions have  HTC's sense does that as well  Nice. Yeah, so that makes it very easy to choose but you get offered it right away as soon as you download it

Transcript:  Couple of quick gmail changes first gmail adds an easy unsubscribe button next to a sender's address in your email  So if you're subscribed to a mailing list  Um, they used to have some subscribe button  Yeah, they used to have this link but it was kind of buried in the headers  You had to expand the headers if I remember correctly. Well now it's like right next to the sender at the top of your email  Piss off some people, huh? Yeah  Yeah, if um  If the email if the sender includes an unsubscribe link and a promotion social or forms message gmail will include that unsubscribe link at the top

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and finally last gmail changes that gmail is uh,  Finally starting to recognize email addresses with non-latin characters in them. Um, so that's starting now gmail and shortly calendar  Will recognize addresses that can contain accent that are non-latin characters  So accents that are non-latin characters are supported officially in the email protocol, but not a whole lot of service providers support it  So it makes it essentially impossible to use that means I could now have an emoji

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I could be leo steaming pile of poo at gmail.com. There you go. Is that right? Because that's in the unicode

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the problem is you can't create an account with those  Characters yet on gmail  But it means that gmail users can send emails to accounts that do have access to characters non-latin characters and receive emails from  Um, and this is just kind of the first step and google says that in the future  They're going to make it possible for you to create gmail accounts with non-latin characters in them  So you can be leo steaming pile of poop just not right now this not right this second  So it's a nice first step and google saying hey somebody's got to do it  So we're going to support this and we're going to continue to build support into it  And if you know once hopefully once that domino falls others will follow suit

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My tip of the week is to check out the new four square app for android or ios. It just dropped today  I'm a big four square fan and I think you know for a long time four square was the check-in app  It is no longer the check-in app. It's now think of it like a smarter  Yelp, it's a discovery app  Uh for finding places around things that that you love  It's got a lot of data about people who you know on various networks or contacts. You can follow experts  So, uh, for example, it might suggest jeff to me as a tripotle expert  And I can follow him and I can see his tips and I can discover places  I think it was a last episode or episode before where I talked about google maps new explore feature, which is pretty good  I really like the way that four square has implemented this  Um that their this new app is a completely reimagined kind of reinvention of of their app  took the check-ins out and  Just did a really nice job of of discovery and helping you find places that you like based on based on what you like  So you go in and you say I really like tacos. I really like  You know crepes and I really like awesome playgrounds  For my daughter and the recommendations are fantastic and it really surfaces great tips and i'm really i'm really digging it  So if you haven't looked at four square in a mile and check it out

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They've got a potential problem because uh, you're in a big city  So you're gonna find stuff but i'm in petaluma and it's not very good at finding stuff and that's because  You know people have to use four square and check in and I guess people haven't  Um, and by the way, I added tastes and everything  um  So this and of course as they've moved checkouts out of four square and into swarm  The question is are they going to reduce the amount of data they're going to get from people  So there's the first recommendation after all of this is lagonitas brewing company for nightlife. Yeah, that's a bummer

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I certainly noticed that four square was way better in new york and san francisco and it wasn't san diego for example  Yeah, and it does have it does have to do with whether or not your friends are using the app. So i'll definitely  And there's actually a matter of like you're traveling to a big city, right?  You know and and you know, you want to follow your friend who lives in san francisco and see what their tips are  I mean, it's it's worth it just for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I I use it and I use swarm too to check in because I want to keep that database going

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah at this point. It's like it's a life log. I just want to remember where I was  It's really nice. You know that that plus time hop, you know is is pretty pretty awesome. Sort of remember

Oh great  Yeah, so they report out about about not only that but they have a report out about how google  Starbucks wi-fi is better than at and east starbucks wi-fi has been and other things but that's not my number leo  I want to have a number go ahead and show this so there's an app you can download

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  On android, this is actually not just wi-fi. You can see which carrier is best in your neighborhood  All kinds of this is about keeping these guys honest  So the horizon is 23 percent worse than u.s average in petaluma  Wow, that would be a bad network

I thought it was gonna be contrary that the cheaper the room the better the wi-fi. Yeah  Apparently not the more expensive the room the better the wi-fi. That's interesting. That's an interesting graph and what percentage of your room

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Like if the wi-fi is 23 dollars  a day  What percentage of your total hotel bill that is?  Yeah  My pick is wallpaper. I know boring silly, but I happen to like having good wallpaper  Not just on my computer  But on my smartphone when you have a phone with 5.5 inch screen wallpaper is actually a pretty important consideration  And a lot of times it's just some static image  but the guys who do  Chainfire the guys who do super su have done and by the way be careful with wallpaper apps  It's a very common way to get malware on your system.

The only difference is the in-app purchase caches the images for a week instead of one day  It's called 500 fire paper  And it's from chain fire who really does a great job and i'm very happy 500 px has such great images  If you use the editorial picks, you're just going to have stunning images.
