Transcript:  It's time for Twig. This week at Google, Jeff Jarvis is here.  So is Matt Cutts. We're gonna have a great conversation,  including a look at a couple of interesting patents from Google.  Plus, during the pro- during the actual show,  we are going to solve a pesky problem plaguing Jeff Jarvis.  More alliteration ahead. It's time for Twig!  Netcasts you love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  From people you trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is TWiT.  Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by Cashfly.  C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y dot com.  It's time for Twit's annual audience survey, and we want to hear from you.  Please visit twit.tv slash survey and let us know what you think.  It only takes a few minutes, and your anonymous feedback will help us make Twit even better.  We thank you so much for your continued support.  twit.tv slash survey.  Twitter and of course because of Jeff Jarvis journalism.  He's professor of journalism at the City University of New York.  Hey Jeff.  Hey.  Blogger at buzzmachine.com, author of many wonderful books.  Also joined today by and we love having him on Matt Cutts, Googler.  Best in the world.  Longtime Googler.  Good to see everybody. How are you?  Matt.  We should say Matt does not speak for Google when he's on this show,  but we love having him on. He gives us a lot of insight.  And I was really disheartened a couple of weeks ago to read that you had left Google.  You are on hiatus still, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am. I'm still on leave.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so this was why I was a little credible also because it was like three days before April Fool's.  Some SEO company announced they'd hired you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  And they also had a picture of me from some search conference a few years back.  So it looked relatively credible.  It was very credible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  With one for except for one thing.  I knew you I just thought that that can't be no.  Yeah, that would be like the most massive sellout ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and for the first, you know, five minutes, I thought it was really funny  and I was just going to let it ride for three or four days.  And even even though they didn't talk to me or ask me in advance, I was like,  you know, that's pretty well done.  But then I got an email from someone pretty high up at Google who was like,  Right.  And I was like, you know, why don't I go ahead and clarify that just so people don't go stressed out,  get a little crazy or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just it didn't seem possible.  Now, you know, we should explain that your job at Google is fighting web spam,  spam search results in the spam.  But you and you speak as as this company mentioned a lot at SEO conferences and so forth.  But the idea of you going to work.  And an SEO.  By the way, this is my next project auto SEO I loved.  We talked about that as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that was surprisingly enough, about four thousand people signed up  for this April Fool's joke that I did that said, I'm going to you know, it's a new product.  It does all your SEO for you.  It handles mobile and handle social.  And here it is over at SEO.Ninja, which I had thanks to a friend Avinash.  And and so people believed it.  And so a few of them signed up because they're like, oh, I want to hear about more about the joke.  But a lot of people signed up because they're like, yes, I would like all my SEO taking care of for me.  Thanks very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it was a subtle it actually was a it subtly fit in with your message at Webmaster Tools.  Those great videos you make, which is the best SEO is to make the best content.  You don't have to do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely. Our goal is that people never even have to think about this stuff.  So it was a little bit of a play on that SEO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody saying what is SEO? SEO stands for search engine optimization.  And there's while there is some stuff you can do to make your site more useful, more, you know,  things like having a site map.  Google says this is a good thing.  It helps them search it. But a lot of it's snake oil stuff.  If you get it, if you get somebody calling, cold calling you or emailing you saying I can put you number one  in search results, guaranteed snake oil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Seriously evil obfuscation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. Well, yeah, I feel like it's too bad because I think there are some serious SEO folks.  You've spoken at SEO conferences, as have I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. And there are there are plenty of great white hat SEOs.  It's just most of them have plenty of business.  So you're not going to get cold email by someone who is going to be, you know, guaranteed white hat.  So you got to check your references.  And the people who know their job usually have more than enough business already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they're not reaching out to you.  I want to also as long as you're on Matt's blog, which is Mattcuts.com, go watch the talk you did.  I think it's your alma mater, right? UNC Chapel Hill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I went to grad school there.  So got to go back and talk for about 45 minutes or so about lessons learned from the early days of Google.  And it's kind of fun. It's not super technical.  It's more like here's some stuff that, you know, I picked up along the way.  And we love that stuff. It's just good talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I didn't realize you were at that little back and forth.  And it was not a heated battle.  I had was so much in the early days of the Chromebook.  I didn't realize you were standing there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's great because Google often has a Christmas party and they'll invite journalists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so the last time I was invited, I just want to say, oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's their mistake because it was it was really good to have you there.  And and I think at that time only the CR 48 had come out.  And so it was kind of fair to say, look, what am I going to do with with this?  Because, you know, it was hard to see the potential at that time.  And and honestly, a lot of that potential hadn't been realized yet.  And so it was fun to watch the back and forth where I think Sundar could see what was coming.  And you were sort of like the state of the world is not good enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why would you spend that much money and carry around that big a thing to just use a browser?  And I think even then I said I could see the value in a company where they want to constrain  what their employees do online or on the computer or a school where you don't want kids playing  Minecraft during class. But I have to say, it's very generous of you to defend me.  But it is true. I have completely come around and I love the pixel.  You haven't gotten the new one yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't. And I'm really missing the USB-C where you can plug in the power on.  Oh, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Two USB ports.  Now I want everybody to put type C connectors in everything.  And I finally got my USB-C to HDMI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice. I need to order some from Google.  The other great thing is I don't know what Apple is going to charge for these things.  A lot.  I bet you Google is going to be less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apple has an adapter because Apple's MacBook comes out this Friday and will have a single  type C connector and they already are selling an $80 dongle.  But it has regular USB, HDMI and then a type C for power.  But $80. How much was the Google one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I forget it. It's on the site. If you go to the store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I should buy a few. And type C is type C. So that'll work with Apple just as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I bought an extra power adapter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's like half a Chromebook right there.  That's ridiculous. $79.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although, hey, we should point out the pixel.  The new pixel starts at a thousand.  And if you want to get the ludicrously speedy one, which I did, that Jeff has, that's $300 more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How many people, Matt, at Google, A, how many, what proportion of the people you work with use pixels?  And what do they really use them for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a good question.  So almost everybody uses either Macs or pixels or Chromebooks.  I'd say maybe I'm just taking a total guess from what I've seen.  Maybe about a third of the people use pixels.  And a lot of that is if you're a manager, you're just doing email.  You're not like doing hard core coding.  Although you can SSH.  You know, Leo, I loved where you were talking about doing coding in the web browser.  That was very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's coding I now use everywhere, K-O-D-I-N-G, because well, it's exactly what you want.  If you're working in any language for web apps, you want it to be somewhere where you can publish it immediately and try it.  And so it's really great.  And then you can also SSH to a server.  I was going to, I was starting to set up a server and somebody tweeted me, oh, you should look at coding.  And it's great.  So that was the last that in Photoshop with the last bastion of stuff I was doing on desktop computing.  And boy, I have to I have to feel like this is this is really changed.  So when I talked to Sundar five years ago, this was this was in the distant future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you had a very good point whenever you were talking to you were like, I don't quite see anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I wasn't angry. I was just saying, explain to me what's going on.  You know, he was great. I was I came away.  Very impressed with Sundar Pichai, his his thoughtful, his intelligence, his thoughtful demeanor and his calmness in the face of what he might well have perceived as an attack because that was his baby.  Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I love that Sundar, you know, coming from the Chrome world is, you know, really believes in open federated standards.  Yes. You know, Chrome is just a paragon of how things should work, in my opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I agree.  The adapter, Jeff, isn't cheap.  It's 40 bucks.  40 bucks.  Yeah.  But I'm going to get I should get a few because I have a feeling this will be in high demand.  Thing about apples is you can continue to charge while you're connected to HDMI.  So, Jeff, actually, let's do some Chromebook self-help here because, Jeff, you're seeing ad pop ups on your Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they're a little I tweeted it the other day.  I can't find it right now, but it's a little nice little box and it popped up on the lower right of my screen or just now on the on my on your Mac on the upper right of the screen.  I closed Chrome.  So I know it's Chrome.  A major brands like Gap.  They pop up.  They almost look like a now box, but they don't pop in the same way.  They pop from the right from the side right side.  And I can't figure out where it's coming from.  I figure it's got to be a rogue extension.  I don't have that many extensions.  Yeah, the most roguish thing I have there.  That yeah, that's it.  Very good.  Yes.  Thank you.  How boy, you do that Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's the tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, I did.  I did this Google search for Jeff Jarvis Twitter.  Yeah, that's amazing.  Then find a do on the Internet.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I found it.  Yeah him and 37 posts from Marc Andreessen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that came in from the right and you know, I clicked on it and went to the gap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the key is it's not just on your Chromebook.  It's not everywhere you when you use Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  So it's obviously something travels with Chrome.  So it's not like the Chromebook itself is is smirched in some way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the chat room has given me a tool that might be useful.  Okay, we said of course first look in your extensions and Matt said that, you know,  it's engineered so that if something's in an extension, it will show up in extensions.  But there's also a Chrome memory redirect about memory.  So chrome colon slash slash memory dash redirect will show you it's you know,  Chrome has a top browser built into it.  But this so this is just a just a web based version of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What the hell do I do with that?  That's what we look well, you'll see everything that's running in memory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, including all the extensions.  So you can say what is you know, you could see if there's a rogue extension running in the background or something.  Yeah, I got looking now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't see anything.  Of course that was on that machine.  So I it's weird and it's I just don't you know, it just one of those is now going to bug you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now if you if you were if you were using only the Chromebook, you could just do a power wash.  It would go away.  I think well, no, because it's going to install the same extensions

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it'll be sick.  Yeah, I mean what you could do is you could try turning off all your extensions and then turn them on one by one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know the problem is it's such an intermediate and intermittent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, intermittent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The ads are very intermittent.  I've gotten like three and six days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat room saying it's a chrome notification from Google Now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google Now is not sending me ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That seems strange.  But you're seeing this on Twitter Jeff.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He posted it on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I posted that as a screenshot on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's random web pages you're seeing it on right?  It's not any sense.  Like if you're on our Google Drive, you would see it sometimes right?  Unless you have a tab.  That just popped up on my tweet deck.  Oh, I can be tweet deck doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't have tweet deck.  I don't have tweet deck right on my on the Apple right now.  Huh.  That's a good point.  Could be but no, the thing is it appears off the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's saying check your Chrome notifications sources.  And see now Chrome has notifications.  I don't know where to do that though.  Wow.  Gina!  Where's Gina?  I don't know if Gina could help you here.  This is obscure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because on the on the on the Apple it didn't appear on the browser.  It appeared on the screen all the way over to the far right.  I've got a 27 inch Samsung monitor here.  So it was you know, two feet away to the right when I closed Chrome both went away.  So it was definitely Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You should look at your I guess your privacy settings.  You can make sure you don't you have pop-ups turned off and then look at manage exceptions in there and see if you have allowed pop-ups from a site.  But who would it be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All I have open on the Mac right now is Google stuff.  Yeah.  So I think it is a good idea to go to settings privacy, which is in the advanced settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Click on the settings.  I think it is a good idea to go to settings privacy, which is in the advanced settings.  Click content settings.  Google hides a lot of interesting stuff in the content settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's yeah, that was I did.  I did.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So then there's a notification set thing there and you can manage exceptions.  So those will be the sites you said yes to for notifications.  You could see who you've allowed.  No, I would what I would do is clear these clear these all out or just say do not allow any.  Try that.  Do not allow any site to show desktop notifications and see if it goes away.  And then you could look at your exceptions.  I've never seen that.  That's a weird thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that is strange.  I haven't seen that either.  Yeah on the bright side everybody at Google and everybody that watches this week in Google is going to be.  Well, that's why we do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jarvis is killing our new revenue stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Damn him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh it is.  You know what?  So the our chat room has given me a link.  Thank you, George to the rich notification page in the Google developer chrome.com and look down here.  That is a basic notification you're getting.  Isn't it?  That's what it looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Looks like it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So somebody you've installed something that is you selling it to gap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's somebody is somebody who can you know who can get an RFP with the agency for the gap one would think.  Unless I guess know you know what it could be.  It could be an affiliate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Could be an affiliate because if you take a look at it up to his one word, so it's gap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the big I'm telling you that doesn't look good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does not look good.  Hurry up.  The urgency is there.  Click on me.  Please.  Not want to see those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is nobody else is getting this.  Here's another one from our power charms.  Good super user.  Com how to find Chrome extensions that eject inject ads into any web page.  I browse.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If we could harness the power of the chat room and do like they're great.  I mean with it or something aren't they great.  They're so good.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is if you know JavaScript, it's you can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they pop up exceptions.  The first one is sound a bod Berlin.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wall Street Journal.  I would I would look at your extensions really closely and make sure you you want the ones you've got pretty much done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All of it in the chat room in the chat room.  I'm going to paste a link which is actually it shows you where you can manage the exceptions which sites are allowed to notification.  Nice and I just I just went through this process myself and so I can see I've allowed docs to Google Drive to Google Play Spotify, you know, and it's a pretty small list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yeah, you can you can go to that settings advanced privacy content, which is exactly what we're doing.  We said in the dialogue that appears you go down and notifications and you can manage exceptions.  Yes, exactly what we were talking about.  And yeah, that's that's a that's a good thing to know about.  Thank you, Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you.  All right.  I'll report back next week or you'll be power wash.  I power wash all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just power washing is the best thing.  They this guy said on Superuser said it was an extension called show hide passwords.  So there are dangerous.  Yeah, I know.  It's only a good extension.  That's one to stay away from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And we sometimes see behavior where a legit Chrome extension will sell out.  So people, you know, sign up for extension when it does something useful and then after a while, you know, the guy decides to monetize it and he sells it to write some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, so here's here's the weird one now.  So I go to I'm sorry, man.  I go to the content settings, right?  And I go to the notifications part.  I have clicked on do not allow any site to show desktop notifications.  I click on manage exceptions.  Okay.  So then it lists like eBay's there.  I can't turn them off.  In the other area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're just there.  They're just there.  Is that true?  No delete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.  Well, that's why I can't manage the exceptions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can see what you've accepted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Power wash.  One of them I can I can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Matt knows better than anyone how you know, what a constant battle this is.  You know, it's the they just overwhelm you I guess with constant lit.  Google in fact cut Android malware they say in half last year.  Which is interesting.  1% of Android devices had a harmful application installed in 2014.  Now most of those came from third-party stores or side loading when devices had that box unchecked  that said allow third-party sources.  It was point one five percent.  So the vast majority came from side loading.  But there is a long report which Google has put out a 44 page report talking about all the different kinds of abuse  that happens on Android.  But they announced last year that he disabled 200 harmful extensions in Chrome that affected about 14 million users.  So it's not impossible to get a Chrome extension that as you point out Matt may have started out fine and went rogue  because it got sold or just somebody missed it when they approved it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well as Matt said now, you know the three or four people at Google who watch this are going to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think there will be some very interested people doing some research.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was curious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What I have to I have to be aware of myself is last night.  I had a I subscribe to a New York Times email newsletter because I want to see it but I don't I hate email.  So I want to unsubscribe and so that I click the unsubscribe and it takes me to a page and says you can't do this.  You have to sign in but it says right up there on top.  I'm signed in.  It's me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's frustrating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I of course I'm I've had a little wine.  So I go on to on Twitter.  And of course I have to use the F word.  I can't I subscribe from these F in there.  So then of course the problem is today there's like five helpful at New York Times people try to fix it for you.  I'll file fix it for you.  You know and and I'm not trying to be mean and nasty.  I have nothing against the newsletter.  I just forget that people actually read these tweets.  So sorry Leo.  I've been interrupting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Harness the anger carefully.  That's for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes one does one needs to do that.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's so funny that I just got a text from my son who sent me a text thread.  He says is this a sketchy transaction?  I'm buying tickets for a concert from a Craigslist dude and he sent me the text exchange and yeah,  I think it is actually I'm saying maybe you will you you might arrive at the concert and the tickets were already used.  There's all sorts of ways you can get they're all out there aren't Matt.  You know, it's I I was talking to we had a police officer here the other day and I said must be hard seeing just the worst every day day in day out.  Does it get that way Matt?  Is that why you're on such a long hiatus?  Just seeing this constant stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's I gotta say it is weird that like you want to say why can't people just be nice?  Why can't you everybody just be cool and just you know, respect everybody else.  Let's just not scam you know, and yet somehow something about the Internet or maybe just reality brings that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know why but but you're not dejected depressed through what are you doing on this hiatus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, what do you yeah, come on fess up your cloning dinosaurs.  That's right.  And I you know, give us the hint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yes.  Here they come.  Yeah.  No last night.  I stayed up late watching a movie next to my wife and isn't that nice?  I cry.  Is that a nice feeling?  It's great.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who said you could live a life?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So do you have a plan to go back at some point or well the leaves?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can still go on for a little while longer.  So it's like a sabbatical in the next month or so.  Do they do have that policy like a sabbatical?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, okay.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They've had they've had policies like that before.  In fact, they talk about the in the rundown.  There's the how to get a job at Google and that's about a book called work rules by Laszlo Bach and I have to say Laszlo is one of the hidden gems at Google because he does such a great job in the  people operation side of things.  So they try things like well, let's give us a sabbatical.  Oh, everybody left after they took the sabbatical.  Okay, we'll try something different.  Let's subsidize a Prius see whether that helps retention and really good of experimenting with things.  So he's written all that up in a book called work rules and sort of says here's our interviewing habits and there's a lot of people that think we just use brain teasers and puzzles and and you know,  so he sort of sets that straight and talks about the sorts of interviews that do well and those sorts of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How often do you when you're working as opposed to lazing around watching movies late?  How often just would you say you end up interviewing people and how often are the people who end up working for you or you're part of a process interviewing people for elsewhere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's pretty wild because they try to take the attitude that hiring is the most important thing you can do at Google because if you can get somebody good really a plus level on board, then you've done a ton.  You know, you've enabled all this extra work that you can do.  So they actually have little badges on the internal system where you can say I've done 150 interviews or I've done 200 interviews or something like that.  And and so everybody is supposed to not everybody does, but everybody is supposed to chip in so that you get a wide spectrum of people a lot of different diversity and interviewing people to figure out what works and what doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who decides who interviews whom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They don't interview it like I'm the hiring manager and I want to fill a specific role for my specific job.  Usually rather everybody says look, we need this many people in search quality and this many people in Google X and then we hire the smartest people that we can and then we work with those people after they've gone through the hiring committee all the way up to Larry or whatever where you say, okay, now what are you interested in?  Yeah, and so people sort of bid on the candidates who are coming in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that was kind of interesting because I met somebody young woman graduating from Cal with honors had gotten a job at Google.  She said, I don't know yet.  She'll she'll find out later when she arrives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  And to be fair, I'm sort of a weird exception.  Most people don't stay in the same area for, you know, 10 or 15 years often after four or five years or depending on your role two or three years.  You might switch and try something new and different.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you does Larry really review every candidate?  Come on.  That's a lot of kids.  Six thousand people last year.  That's 500 a month.  That's 25 a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He used to in the early days.  These days, I'm guessing they send him the data and he does spot checks.  I don't know if you really you'd have to ask him but but he did in the early days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, that makes sense in the early days, especially when in the early days you're really forming the company culture.  And those first hundred or 200 hires, maybe first thousand hires even are really going to set a tone that's going to continue.  It's very hard to change once you've done that.  So I think that's the time to be very involved.  God, it's got to be unmatchable.  Google has fifty six thousand employees at this point.  But it's a lot easier when you think about Google is it's like you're running Yale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody wants to work at Google.  Right.  So they have the pick of brilliance.  They have to weed through a lot.  But you know, there have been jobs I've had to hire over the years where I have to go scraping to find somebody willing to do the job at the pay we have and so on and so forth.  It's Google's in a catbird seat in that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it changes all the time.  The other stories you hear are, you know, it depends on the stock value and also what the perception of incoming college graduates is as to what's going to be the cool place.  And I would bet it's getting harder to get engineers because the really best engineers are just start their own company at this point.  It's so easy to start a company that while I think it's a good idea to at least go to work for a company for a few years and learn some stuff, I think a lot of people coming out of school saying that's I got a startup.  I'm going to do it myself.  Do you wish that you had done that coming out of school?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's kind of what I did, right?  Because Google was 100 under 100 people back then.  You went to work for a startup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  And it's true.  Like on one.  Well, on OK.  On one hand, you learn so much in such a short period of time.  And on the other hand, you really burn the candle at both ends.  Yeah, late nights.  It's hard on your marriage.  Yeah, you know, you're working weekends.  And so you want to think hard about that trade off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's apparently still that way at Apple.  We just saw another Apple employee leave and leave a long post about 16 hour days  followed by meetings, meetings, meetings, weekends.  The lifestyle today, even though Apple's far from a startup, is just as brutal.  But people are willing to do it because they want to work at a company that's  making a difference, I'm sure.  But you're right, not great for family life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's the old Disney joke, too.  If you don't work on Saturday, don't bother coming in on Sunday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK.  I yeah, I remember coming in one weekend and I was like, wait, where did everybody  go? And I realized, oh, we were now at the point where people weren't always  working on weekends.  Wow.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google, let's see what else is going on.  It appears to be developing a teleconferencing tool.  I like this idea.  In fact, I don't know.  You know, it's really interesting when you see something like Meerkat.  The first thought I think many of us had is, gosh, Google could have done this  a year ago with Hangouts on Air and Hangouts and just didn't.  One of the hot areas and we have a big advertiser go to meeting that does  teleconferencing.  It's a hot area in business.  But this is such an obvious thing for Google to do, especially for those of us  who use Chromebooks.  We'd like Hangouts to be used this way.  So apparently G-Meet, this is a this is a post on Google Plus,  is a or Google Meetings will allow users to schedule and join teleconference  calls with one click.  You've got Google Voice.  You've got Hangouts on it.  You've got everything you all the technologies you need.  Hangouts would be the base for the functionality.  Uh, screenshots, though, also show an Android app  and a Chrome extension, which would be very, very good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what I want to get rid of?  Here's here's what I want to get rid of in conference calls.  Number one, Muzak.  Number two, 40 digit codes as if they have a gazillion calls every day.  Number three, the voice says, I'm we're checking to make sure that your  number is valid.  You know, it's a computer.  It doesn't do seconds.  Why is it taking that long to do it?  Yeah.  And then number four, idiots.  If we get rid of those things, conference calls are fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This makes sense, though.  I mean, if you want people to use Chromebooks, it's it's I understand  better now that I'm using the pixel a lot.  Some strategy, you know, one of the strategies is to make sure you can  do everything in HTML five and in browser.  Yeah.  And that's I mean, that's basically what what Hangouts are.  WebM and WebRTC and all of that makes sure that you can do a lot of this  stuff now in the browser on Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, what's the Matt's in on on Hangouts as I was for a long time as a  loyal user now, Matt, if I don't know if you know, but they sent me a Mac.  I feel dirty, but I'm using a Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We had to buy him a Mac because we wanted him to use Skype.  Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the technical difference between what's the technological base  in between Skype and Hangouts that that Skype does have good quality?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The big the biggest difference is Skype uses a proprietary codec.  And they that's been tuned over many years.  And I think in most cases, Skype's proprietary technology does a better  job than the open technologies.  Hangouts uses video, the IDYO, which is something that we tried.  You may remember we tried it.  Right.  And then many of the other tools use slit as is it silk slick and brick.  These are open source codecs and they're just in my opinion.  There's not as robust, not as good.  Skype is been so highly tweaked to handle adverse environments.  And yet when you throw enough bandwidth at it to give you amazing results,  all you have to do is look at Alex Lindsay on Skype.  And you'll see what Skype's capable of, which is essentially broadcast quality.  If we even the right camera and sufficient bandwidth, a computer that's  powerful enough is not bogged down doing other things.  But at the same time, Skype handles, I think adverse situations pretty well as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it still built on some version of a peer to peer structures?  No, they have been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Microsoft acquired them.  Well, not long ago, but a couple of years ago, Microsoft bought Skype and the  first thing they did was shut down the super peers and all of that stuff.  The super nodes that Skype was using.  So it's no longer peer to peer.  Yeah.  But Microsoft has servers galore, right?  Where we all are constantly looking at alternatives.  Because and I would love to use, I want WebRTC to take off.  Yeah.  Because that would be so much easier and I would bet that this Google  meetings thing would be very much like that.  You could, you know, with WebRTC, you can give somebody a URL and say,  click this, that's it.  You're in.  Right.  Right.  That's awesome.  No numbers.  No numbers.  And WebRTC allows you to skin it so you can write your own WebRTC.  We could have a Twit client.  I mean, it's just, it's just, there's so many reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Add chat to the side of it.  And all kinds of stuff.  Oh yeah.  You can do anything you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I, I, I'm sorry to force you to use a proprietary solution because I'm  in favor of open solutions.  I'm ashamed of myself every week.  But, but I have to say we have to prioritize quality.  I'm sorry.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and it sounds, it, you know, it sounds like a hangouts, you know,  some can, can work with it WebRTC, but you know, as you switch towards VP  eight and VP nine, you know, those, I think YouTube just announced that  they're starting to VP nine.  Yeah.  And over time, you know, we'll get hardware support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it'll get better.  Yeah.  There's no reason that's, I mean, I doubt that Skype's doing anything  that can't be done as well as if not better by others, including open  source, especially with Google's help.  VP nine gives you up to 4k quality using a lot, a lot less bandwidth.  And see part of the problem is there is good to technology like H.264  out there, but it's owned by companies.  And there are, there are limits as to what you can do.  We're even, you know, Skype has, you know, certain restrictions  that we, we worry about a lot.  Uh, you know, but, so I would very much like an open solution.  I think we're using Skype in ways we're not supposed to.  I don't want to talk about that.  There is a Skype TX for broadcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, just getting better and better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  But it seems like it's getting better and better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So here's a good, a good, this is from, um, uh, YouTube's engineering  team comparing H.264 and VP nine, uh, with a 600 kilobit connection, which  is a pretty low quality connection.  That's H.264.  This is a Janelle Monet video.  Um, VP nine is, is a lot better than H.264.  Uh, and if you look at that, the split, the one on the left is the high quality.  It's better for sure.  Um, it's a, I mean, it's still not perfect, but 600 kilobits is pretty low quality.  Percent of low definition watch time.  Low definition is two 40 P.  When's the last time you watched a two 40 P video on YouTube?  It looks so horrible.  So bad.  And then of course VP nine, I'll give you a 4k as I mentioned.  Uh, Chrome has it.  So part of the issue is, and this was a big debate still is, I guess,  a raging debate in HTML five.  HTML five doesn't really have a.  Matt correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think it has a standard codec yet.  So the debate is what should happen when you have a video tag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good question.  Yeah, I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, who would know is Kevin Marx.  He's probably foaming at the mouth right now.  I want to talk.  Um, we use FFM peg and FFM peg does support VP nine.  So we could do it if we wanted to.  Uh, I, we, we put out our stuff as MPEG four and I think that looks  the best right now still.  Uh, let's see.  Oh, we talked about it on security now.  Big story.  Uh, Google.  Uh, had a little run in with China.  Nick, the China internet network information center.  That's the, uh, certificate authority that does certificates, uh, out of China.  And, you know, so just a little background, if you're not a security now,  listening to this might be a little more complicated, but a little background,  uh, in order to preserve the chain of trust, when you use a secure website,  uh, the certificate issued by the secured website has to, uh, originate from.  A certificate authority that is recognized by the browser you're using.  So all internet browsers come with a collection of certificate authorities.  Um, internet's explore Safari, opera, uh, Google's Chrome all pretty much  use the same batch, I think it's not part of the operating system.  It's part of the browser, but short while ago, uh, Google, Google, which,  which, uh, has a lot of instrumentation on the internet, as you might imagine,  noted that somebody had issued a certificate for Google inappropriately.  They tracked it back to China.  Nick.  And, uh, what China Nick had done is issued a certificate that allowed  the holder to make other certificates.  The certificate was issued to a company that promised only to make  certificates for its own, you know, internal use, but apparently these  wildcard certificates were somehow released into the, into the world.  And, uh, this, this Egypt based MCS holdings, which is an intermediate  CA, uh, was, was basically allowing a man in the middle, uh, attacks.  So if Google X, uh, Adam Langley over at Google, who's the guy for all of  this stuff, uh, investigated, uh, and has, and Google has decided to  eliminate China Nick from its pool of trusted certificate authorities.  That's a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And, and Firefox is doing it too.  Yep.  Uh, and it, you know, it used to be the case.  I, I would really be paying a lot of attention to this and really stressed  out and now I can read it about it, uh, with enough distance to  find it kind of hilarious.  Um, but I love this, the quote from Mozilla where they basically said  the behavior in issuing an unconstrained intermediate certificate to a company  with no documented PKI practices and with no oversight of how the private key  was stored or controlled was an egregious practice.  So they're just like, okay, this qualifies as egregious practice.  We're going to drop CNNIC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, yeah, this is, this is absolutely the way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't normally read people saying stuff like that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  China Nick has responded.  Uh, the decision that Google has made is unacceptable and  unintelligible to CNNIC.  Meanwhile, CNNIC sincerely urged that Google would take users' rights and  interests into full consideration.  I think Google did.  For the users that CNNIC has already issued the certificates to, we  guarantee that your lawful rights and interests will not be affected.  Well, that's not exactly true because if you go to a site with a CA, uh, authority  that goes up to the chain to CNNIC, you will not be able to visit that site  in Firefox or Chrome once those are updated.  Microsoft says we're still investigating.  Uh, no word from the other browser, uh, manufacturers, Opera and Safari,  but I imagine they'll do the same.  That's a big problem.  Um, and Chrome is by the way, the number one browser in China.  Uh, 52% market share, 23% for an Internet Explorer.  So it's a big deal in China.  If all of a sudden the number one browser doesn't recognize any CNNIC authority.  Yeah.  It's a big deal.  I mean, I can, if you're a CNNIC certificate holder, that's a big deal for you.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What does CNNIC have to do to fix it?  You can do this thing called public.  It sounds like they'll need to put better controls in place, but, but I love that  Chrome uses something called public key pinning, which basically is able to spot  whenever somebody tries to do a man in the middle attack without, uh, without  the proper authorization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was, yeah.  And Steve explains all how that worked and all of that.  And it is great because Google does not know, it knows almost immediately when  this man, the middle stuff starts to happen.  It's a wait a minute.  This is not our certificate.  Uh, even though it says it is.  Google's in talk with mobile operators still.  We, where is this Google?  Um, this Google wireless that we keep hearing about this new wireless company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I can't wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know.  Well, I'll have to go back to the Nexus six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm, I'm, I'm, uh, fantasizing that we all get Sims at IO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you think they'll wait till June to, or when is it?  IO end of May, right?  End of May.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Um, you know, because the latest is, is that they'll, they're doing deals with foreign  international companies as well, which would just be wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you'll, you'll, you'll also get cheap international calls and be able to use your  phone abroad at no extra cost.  That would transform the industry.  Yep.  That's huge.  Um, so we're no word yet about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I popped my SIM card out.  Yeah.  I was terrified.  So something like this would be really neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, we use T-Mobile and so you get 2g free everywhere, but it's always, you  know, phone calls are still very expensive as well as nervousness going on.  Um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but you know, again, it's, it's a case where the business doesn't operate properly.  And as with Google fiber and as with phones and Android, they can just show  it away.  Just for once.  Think for the customer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Say goodbye to Google moderator shutting down, uh, July 31st.  Did you, do you know people that used it?  This was a kind of cool idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like that old, uh, I think I've said this in the show before.  It was that, that old, uh, Nick game show question is a dead or Canadian.  I had no idea moderator was still alive.  It must be a Canadian app.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, in, in the, during the election, uh, the trans or actually after the election,  the Obama transition team used moderator to get input.  Um, and I have some ad covering up this venture beat article.  Go away and wow.  That's good.  It's an ad for venture beat preventing me from reading venture beats.  This is worse than a paywall.  It is.  Uh, they had, uh, they had, they took questions, uh, from the public.  The first series ran for 48 hours, got a million votes from 20,000  people on 10,000 questions.  That's the power of Google moderator.  But I guess, you know, we should have used it for some things, but we never did.  It allowed, um, uh, users submitted questions, suggestions and ideas.  You could then rank, rank them, um, and, and take feedback from a large number of  people, uh, not only on their own questions, but on others questions is a good idea.  But I guess not enough people used it.  If you were using Google moderator, you can't get your data from Google take out.  Of course.  And you can continue to try using Google moderator right up to July 30th.  I'm June 30th.  Sorry.  And then they're going to have a month of read only, and then they're going to shut it down.  Does that, do people at Google sometimes go, you know, kind of cringe  when stuff shut down?  I think everybody understands stuff has to be shut down, but it's always,  it's always a little painful for some people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think there's a little bit of a cringe reaction because, uh, you know, sometimes  we, we actually use moderator for our weekly TJF kind of meetings so that  people can grill the founders.  Uh, and I've used it for, you know, webmaster videos.  People can vote up the questions that you want to hear.  Um, but yeah, you do have to kind of earn your pixels.  Yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  But, um, you know, it does make sense.  And I think it's been around long enough that people are like, okay,  nobody's like super crazy attached to it and they understand it's got to  earn its usage.  And so, you know, there's probably other tools that you can use, uh, at this point.  So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know I didn't see this post.  Um, but, uh, uh, according to QZ, uh, Eric Schmidt.  Posted in January, uh, on project syndicate, the story of how Google  image search was created.  He writes our founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, like all other successful  inventors kept interwiting.  They started with images.  After all people wanted more than just text.  This first became apparent after the 2000 Grammy awards.  When Jennifer Lopez JLo wore a green dress that well caught the world's  attention at the time, it was the most popular search query we'd ever seen.  But remember they don't have image search yet.  No surefire way of getting users exactly what they wanted, which was a picture of  JLo in the dress.  So Google image search was born, uh, at the time of its launch in 2001, the  site offered 250 million images by 2010, 10 billion images.  And of course, uh, QZ knowing the value of this has made sure that that picture  and many more of JLo are right there on its front page.  JLo knows how to get attention and Google knows how to help you find it.  Wow.  I think I'm, is that going to make this show not safe for work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you imagine that moment?  I mean, that's the kind of great Google moonshot.  Oh crap.  We don't search for images.  Let's go.  Let's go build it.  Right.  And you know, I have, sorry, Matt.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Matt's a little late.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, we want to help people find what they want to find.  Right.  Even if it's JLo's dress.  Yep.  Sorry about the lag.  That's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just sorry to be interrupting, but it's unintentional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have to learn to be patient.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's, I can't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google has a patent for a cow avoidance mechanism in their self-driving cars.  This is the patent.  It actually involves a diagram of bovines, both full grown and calves, and a car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The cow...  I have this vision that some Googlers get patents just for the jollies.  You think this is just for the lulls?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Cow avoidance patent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then the damn patent office could actually patent that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, when we were in Hawaii driving the Honda Highway, there was a bull  occupying the road and very leisurely paced walking down the road.  And as much as we beep or yell, he just, you know, he led us down  the road at about a mile an hour.  So cow avoidance can be an issue in some circumstances.  The trick is to develop a system that can tell when you're stuck behind  an immovable object or when you're just in bad traffic or in a parking lot.  So you needed to detect not only that there's an obstacle in the road,  but how long it's been there.  How long you've been there too.  This is from popular science.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe it gets a heartbeat from it or body temperature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you know, you could.  I don't know.  Do they have a UV sensor?  Probably do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You should.  You know, I read the story about the other car that made it all the way  across the country.  Yes.  You'll appreciate this.  I freaked out because I said, oh, we're going on to a bridge in Philadelphia.  It's all metal.  That confuses the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought that was funny.  I didn't think of you though.  But that was the only kind of scary moment in this self-driving car  that went all across the United States.  It was from a car company that does car accessories.  But they and of course they had as with most of the Google cars.  There it is.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Once we get past the takeover.  What's the name of it?  Delphi.  Delphi.  That's right.  And they did.  There were a few moments, but for the most part, the car went the whole  way on regular roads.  Cars.  These cars are getting so good.  I feel like we're close.  And as you say, the most difficult or most scary thing for the engineers  was this metal bridge because they knew that the metal would likely  throw the radar.  Didn't though.  They just hovered their hands over the wheel.  That's pretty cool.  How many miles?  It was an Audi Q5 that was modified.  What's cool is it looks pretty normal.  Most of the lidar and the radar and the self-driving sensors were  hidden behind plastic panels in the car.  Went 3,400 miles, 99% of the time in autonomous mode, nine days, 15 states.  The team collected three terabytes of data during the drive.  I think it's great that it's not just Google that's doing this.  I think you want, this is when you get critical mass.  And I'm sure people are sharing.  I hope people are sharing their information and so forth.  Of course, Audi did this.  They drove from San Francisco to CES.  Mercedes has done this as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now the thing I wondered was I didn't think that self-driving cars  were legal in all those states.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Increasingly legal for research purposes, but I bet you that's  why I took them nine days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They said they took the southern route because of snow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  It's pretty cool.  I think we're good.  I think we might see them in our lifetime, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, that'd be amazing.  I think Matt will be driving one home before you know it.  They're going to say, hey, cuts.  If we send you a self-driving car, will you come back to work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are you bored yet, Matt?  Any self-driving cars they have.  I'm not bored yet.  No, good.  Nice spending time with my wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what I played with the other day and we really enjoyed it.  We had the whole team doing it.  I should show you our Google Plus story.  We got Segways, which I know sound like an old hat.  They're still kind of mind-boggling technology and we had so much fun  doing them.  Let me see if I can find you the...  No, it was not an auto-awesome.  It was a story of our trip through San Francisco's streets on Segways.  There's Father Robert, Ryan.  Well, this is why Segways didn't take off.  Let's face it.  You look like a dork.  But it was so fun that I have to say I feel like...  By the way, this is completely automated, this Google story.  They did such a good job.  We had, I think, six Segways.  There's our producer, Karsten Bondi.  It was so much fun.  This was actually cool because I was able to get...  A Segway makes an excellent dolly for video shots.  Right.  Look how smooth the...  I was just holding a camera phone.  It's really kind of fun.  Wait a minute.  We detected your video can be enhanced.  So we're going to fix this video.  Thank you, Google.  Thank you.  They are really fun.  And then Robert, of course, is the quad father.  So he brought his drones and flew them probably illegally.  Illegally probably, but...  Near that thing you hate so much that I won't use the B word.  My palms are sweating.  No.  You look at the Golden Gate...  Oh, and there's birds singing.  Mine, mine.  I love that.  Google even made it black and white.  So that's cool.  I should share this.  But this was so much fun.  And you know what's interesting?  Once you ride these, you realize that...  It's hard not to personify these.  I bet this is the same thing with autonomous vehicles.  You start to feel like you're riding a horse or something.  And it kind of is really...  If you...  For after half an hour on a Segway,  you really feel like it's...  You just think where you want to go and you go there.  It completely becomes internalized.  I'm this close to buying one.  Talk me out of it, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, God, no, Leo.  No.  No.  You're going to...  So you're going to drive it back and forth from home to work,  which does sound practical,  but you're going to feel like such a...  Geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know who looks like a geek?  Mike Elgin.  Because he's wearing a suit on a Segway with Google Glass.  That's beyond...  That's the height.

Transcript:  Tourists were taking pictures of him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See? It's true.  They do do this in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He must work for Google.  He must be a Googler.  So I like the other patent there, Leo.  This is the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The first one.  Spoiler avoidance?  Yes.  We need to patent that because apparently it's the worst thing  we can do to spoil TV shows for our audience.  Spoilers on social media.  This is also from QZ.  This is an April Fool's joke.  Can't be real.  It's April 7th.  I hate April Fool's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the thing about it is there is some logic to it, right?  Viewing progress.  So if it knows where you are and watching a show,  it can then help you avoid spoilers,  which only gives Google yet more data about you.  Aha, Mr. Jarvis.  We know you are three seasons into The Good Wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A method comprising receiving activity data describing the activity  performed by a first user,  determining a first progress stage for subject associated with the  activity based at least a part on the activity data.  Right?  This must be torture.  They have people to do that.  I know.  This is long.  Holy cow.  Look at this.  This is the patent application.  Where's the figures?  I guess we got...  Oh, here's the images.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I want a little stick figure jumping up and down saying,  no, you spoiled it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does Google have a Pittsburgh office?  These two guys are in Pittsburgh.  It's so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think we do have a Pittsburgh office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Content may include...  So the idea would be the message comes up on Google Plus or whatever,  but is hidden or truncated.  And then there's a pop-up that says content may include a spoiler.  Do you want to read it now?  And then you can click to show the full message.  That's wild.  Can you do it to a podcast though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I could use that on...  I had a Google Now card.  I was watching the NCAA.  Yes.  And I'm a Kentucky fan, which it learned.  So it was...  It was hopefully showing me the scores live for the Kentucky game.  And I was trying...  I was like, don't look at my phone because it'll tell me who's winning.  And so I could use a spoiler, you know, avoidance just for my own phone.  So...  I'm so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm so sorry.  So we know what Andy Rubin is doing after his hiatus.  He's...  I guess he's left Google.  He left Android and then was working for the Google X folks, right?  We thought maybe doing robots.  Turns out he's become an investor.  He's launched an incubator called Playground Global.  It's to support...  To provide support advice to tech startups, particularly making hardware.  That is actually a great area because that's a...  It's well known how to do software startups.  But a hardware startup is an entirely different collection of challenges,  including having to go to China and all that.  Of course, Andy Rubin before he was at Google did Danger and the Sidekick  and has certainly a lot of experience being a hardware...  Working in hardware startups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So he gives advice for equity, which makes perfect sense to me.  The only thing I don't understand here is why he then needed to raise 48 million.  Yeah, that's a good question.  I mean, I understand why I'd love to invest in it.  I'd love to have a piece of Andy Rubin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It sounds like some of the investors were strategic.  So Foxconn, it sounds like, is one of the investors.  And that's also a company that does a lot of manufacturing.  So there might be some synergy going on.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  HP, Google, Hon-Hi Precision Industry, all investing.  And Redpoint, of course, which is a venture capital firm that has a past history of investing in Andy Rubin.  Tencent Holdings, Seagate.  Interesting.  I like the idea that he was going to go work on robots.  But maybe he'll still get to work on robots.  He says his quote is, I will have...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought the other interesting story about...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This lag is killing us.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The other...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just once you start talking, just keep going.  Just keep going.  Sorry about Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, I will do.  The other interesting story I thought about a Google alumnus, alumnae, alumna.  I'll just say them all and then we can...  Alumni is the correct...  Is Stephanie Hannon, who it sounds like...  Yes, so alumna because it's one female person.  So Stephanie Hannon is, sounds like, according to the Washington Post, going to leave Google.org,  work for Hillary Clinton as her CTO.  Kind of like Harper Reed did for Obama.  And I have to say, Stephanie is a fantastic Googler.  She'll be really missed.  Or I don't know if she's going to leave maybe.  But she's helped with everything from like helping you find your voting location to...  You know, Google.org does stuff like Ebola One Boxes and all these really useful interesting things.  And so I'm really excited to see what she does over at the Clinton campaign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Washington Post says,  Stephanie Hannon is Google's Director of Product Management for Civic Innovation and Social Impact.  She will serve on the senior staff for Clinton's campaign and oversee a team of engineers and developers,  which could include outside consultants to devise websites, apps, and other tools  for this former Secretary of State and her staff to engage with supporters and voters.  Harper Reed did so much good for President Obama in the campaign.  This is now something you cannot do without.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and I love that there's Googlers who are civic minded and are interested in government.  And so there's a well of people like Mikey D who went to help with healthcare.gov.  Right.  And so, you know, you can imagine going off from Google and doing, you know, startups or investing.  But I like that there's this new path opening up if you want to help with US Digital Service or 18F  or government service in general, because there's a lot of good things that could be done there.  Well, we need it.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We desperately need it.  Let's see.  Have we a couple of, we don't have a change log per se, but a couple of features.  Google Calendar 5.2, which isn't yet on the Google Store.  You can do a sideload.  Brings back the month view on phones.  Apparently people really missed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I missed it.  Did you?  Yeah.  Even though everything is so condensed.  So tiny.  Compact and everything.  Yeah.  It's still useful to be able to glance at and go, that's the layout.  I don't know.  I found myself wanting it many times.  I'm happy to have it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just pretty much always use the agenda, you know, the list.  Because anything else, I just can't see it on a small screen.  Anyway, the the angle here for the article, I'm sorry here from Android police has a an APK that you could download.  I would, I would wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He couldn't wait.  You know, no, I can't wait.  I saw month view and I was like sold.  Wow.  But yeah, so, you know, it's all jam packed in there, but it's still usable.  I mean, I totally find this useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I use it.  I use it to kind of look at the to find out what day April 23 is things like that.  I guess.  Well, you can get it if you want.  Android police has the link.  Although if I were you, I'd wait for the update and Google vault.  What are you laughing at?  What is I don't even know what Google app vault is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In general, it's a good rule of thumb to.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that might be the archiving.  Yeah.  For enterprise to like, you know, make sure that you save things for legal discovery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ah, they should call it your your sock vault.  Your socks vault.  To now covers hangouts for work chat.  So you can keep your organization's chat history in the vault.  And when the feds come calling, you'll have a copy of it.  That's something only only enterprise cares about.  Android wear now has more than 1000 different watch faces boy.  As the Apple watch comes out on Friday, there's of course a lot of attention on Apple.  But I got to say there Android wear has such an amazing ecosystem.  Um, that, you know, I just I really love my moto 360 and that's going to be tough for me to give up my Android phone and my moto 360 because I'm after starting on the 24th of this month.  Do a watch.  When can you order can order Friday at midnight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pacific.  Are there you really believe they'll get rid of the lines?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, that's one of the things we talked about this yesterday on Mac break weekly Angela errands, the new president of retail head of retail at  Apple has decided I think rightly so to encourage staff all the folks at the Apple Store to tell their customers don't try to buy it here.  Order online.  We'll get it to you.  The lines are great marketing for Apple, but they've and we talked about this yesterday.  They've really become kind of not a great experience.  Yeah, I've been fights in Apple stores.  The lines are filled with homeless people and and riff raff.  The roof raff the lines people being people who are not Apple fans, but are being paid to buy stuff or do we at least hold the place in line or to buy stuff to ship overseas?  And so it's just not the it's not the wonderful experience.  It used to be I think the employees loved it because it was exciting.  You applaud there's a countdown blah blah blah over time over time.  Yeah, they work all night, but the experience of buying the watch is going to be so very different.  I think you have to make 15 minute appointments.  They have a special table.  You cannot touch the watches.  They're under glass.  They're sealed.  And unless you have an appointment with an Apple employee who has then this card they can swipe the table and a magic drawer appears and they pull the watches out and they stand there watching you while you try them on and help advise you and urge you to upgrade your iPhone.  It's going to I think that this is a very different experience.  And so they're telling people Angela says this is a new mindset for us because remember wasn't so long ago maybe less than a year ago that Tim Cook said we want to get people back in the Apple stores buying their phones.  They didn't like it.  The phones are being sold by the cell phone companies and not in the Apple store.  But now I think they're backing off.  But look at this.  This is I love this is an Android mosaic with 1000 Android wear faces most of them horrible.  Let's face it.  What do you what's your face now?  I use a program called facer Android program.  It's in the store called facer and then there are big repositories of facer.  You can make your own of course, but then people have made their own and they've uploaded them to the facer repose.  And so there's some beautiful I think really nice watch faces you can now in your watches and Apple's going to do this of course much more elegantly.  Well Apple's going to do two typically Apple Lee things.  First of all only Apple can make watch faces for the Apple watch and to they have a very elegant way of adding what they call features to the watch.  They call them complications to the watch face.  So you pick a watch face and then you spin the knob and it adds different complications to different parts of the watch face and all that stuff.  So you will be able to create a custom watch face.  You won't have this variety of bands either bands are nice.  There's some nice new bands lots of nice new bands.  Of course you'll have to buy your band from Apple at least for the time being.  Well, that's you know, that's that's what Google's all about choice.  Android's all about choice.  Apple's all about a curated experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Matt, what do you wear?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh my goodness.  I wear for the most part a $30 Timex watch.  But I'm holding out hope for for Android wear.  So I'm not young enough that I don't wear a watch but but I'm holding out to see what's going to be the best watch for me.  So yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's look at I'm just going to I think we can go to the picks of the week here in just a second.  Turkish government blocking Twitter Facebook and Google over photos of an assassinated prosecutor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What I love about that story is that as soon as they block Twitter Twitter users in Turkey know how to get around now.  And so they make you know, something like blocked in Turkey the trending hashtag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google last Christmas or maybe it was two Christmases ago suffered a split in the past.  Google has teamed up with NORAD to do the Santa tracker every year.  Keep you know, because NORAD's got those early warning radar stations all over the world.  And so they can see as Santa approaches each region of the world NORAD started doing its own tracker.  Google has the Santa tracker, which actually is a fun website.  And in fact, there's a Santa tracker watch face.  So but they've decided to open source it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm waiting for porn to come on that.  I'm not so sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's on GitHub Google slash Santa tracker web and Google slash Santa tracker Android.  So I you know, if nothing else, this is a great opportunity to look at the source code and see how Google does an Android app and a web app.  I think that's super cool.  And of course you can customize it.  That's a that is nice when a company does something like that just says, you know, we're going to put the source out very rare.  I think partly because programmers realize how ugly their source code is and they don't want to clean it up.  But the Santa tracker on the web was built using a library from the Chrome team called Polymer.  You may remember that from Google IO.  I think they talked about last year.  So it's in a way, it's an ad for Google Development Technologies and the Santa tracker for.  For Android, I said using Polymer.  No, I don't know.  And they have all these cool components and stuff.  So it's actually really a good idea to open source this put it on GitHub and let people down, you know, download it and look at it.  And the software engineer in charge anchor, Kottweil says or Kottweil says he hopes developers are inspired to make their own magical experiences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What else could you do?  Could have an Easter bunny tracker.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.  Did you do the Easter egg hunt and all of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just really no.  You know, you're getting old when you buy yourself your own candy for that sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's sad.  All right, let's take a break.  No, we don't need a break.  We're going to go right through.  I see you.  Wait a minute.  Jason Howell is pulling the microphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, well, I was just going to confirm there is no break.  The break the show goes on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The show goes on with our traditional tool number and Matt, I'll let you do a thing of the week.  Let me just show you my new tool.  You're going to be a little jealous.  The Galaxy S6 from Samsung came yesterday and I'm kind of liking it.  This is the edge.  This is the one with the curvy edges on both sides.  They've somehow figured out how to take a screen because this is all one screen and just bend it around.  And in fact, the screen does go around the edge.  You can see the edges.  They use the edge not as much as they did.  Oh, by the way, one of the things I really like they've got a fingerprint reader that doesn't require a swipe.  It's very much like the Apple fingerprint reader.  It works really well.  It's very fast and snappy.  It's got Samsung's own Exynos 8 core processor in it.  But one of the and by the way, that means they've got a glass back and that means no removable battery anymore.  No SD card, but it does come in big memory variants.  There's 128 gig version.  I got the 64.  The 64 gigs is enough for me.  People are raving about the camera and I have to say so far and I've only had it a day.  I've been getting great pictures.  I'm not sure about battery life though.  I'm a little worried.  What I've been told is that Google, I'm sorry, Samsung is using it's an 8 core, but it's really effectively dual quad core processors.  One running at a slower clock rate, one at a faster.  Unless you need it, it doesn't kick in that second processor.  But if it does kick it in, this is going to get hot.  It does get hot when I was downloading all the stuff for, you know, to set it up.  It started getting not burning hot, but pretty warm and it just clobbers battery life.  And I'm a little nervous about battery life.  But again, I haven't had it long enough to know, you know, it's one of those things is so beautiful that you play with it a lot of first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How's the Samsung cruft?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's cruftable.  It's crufty.  In fact, let me change the the it's crufted.  Definitely heavily crufted.  Cruftalicious.  Cruftalicious.  Let me change the let me change the home.  I use a Nova launcher, which I really like.  Where do I change the other is applications.  Let me change the the home launcher to touch whiz, which is of course Samsung's own launcher and show you it's.  I don't know that woman.  She's just just strange wallpaper.  I don't know why it's there.  That's not Samsung's wallpaper.  They do have themes on this.  It's it's got a lot of this is from T-Mobile.  It's got some T-Mobile stuff.  It's got a lot of Samsung stuff.  Although, you know, I don't find it offensive.  It also has this is this is like, you know, the Google now launcher you swipe to the right.  You get Google now on HTC sense.  You get blink.  Well, Samsung's doing that now too.  Only it's a special version of Flipboard, which actually is pretty nice.  And it also demonstrates how fast the processor is because I can scroll this puppy like nobody's business.  And once you start reading stuff, it does a lot of you see those little special effects and things like that.  I'm actually kind of fond of it.  This phone is five hundred seventy seven dots per inch, which is crazy.  Crazy.  Wow.  Yeah, it looks like a sticker.  It looks like a poster.  It looks so good.  Let me just.  I'm using a I love this the five hundred PX wallpaper app.  So I just pull in at random new wallpaper every 30 minutes.  The camera is I think going to be the real selling point on this.  They've made it if you're used to the Samsung cameras, they've made it a little more subtle.  You know, they used to have these big pictures and stuff.  Now it's just very simple.  The different kinds of cameras, they've cleaned it up a little bit.  It's a it's lollipop.  It's an Android five point oh two.  But you don't see.  I mean, it's it's you know, this bugs the heck out of me.  S finder and quick connect.  You can't I don't know why when you do that pull down to get notifications, you can't get rid of that.  Drives me crazy.  I don't even know what they do and I don't want to use them.  But it takes up all that real estate.  On the other hand, I love the quick launcher and you can customize that, you know, and that's kind of nice.  It's just not it's not lollipop.  If you want lollipop, though, besides the Nexus six, I think the new oxygen OS on the one plus is very pure lollipop.  Both Jason and I have put it on our one plus one.  Are you still using the one plus?  No, you went to the Nexus six, didn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Nexus six is my current jam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you too, Jeff.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So you already have a nice lot clean lollipop experience.  Such a big phone, though.  This is so elegant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I fix it gave the S six edge a three out of ten on repair ability.  Obvious reasons nowadays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who cares?  Right.  Did you?  Okay.  So your Nexus six, which I'm sure is very repairable.  What did you do when the screen broke?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, no, they have fair point.  Did you repair it?  Not myself.  I'm not going to do that.  You got a new one.  I didn't got time for that.  You got a new one.  Exactly.  I contacted Motorola got a new one.  Had to pay for it, but that's all right.  So people do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My only concern at all because in every respect, this is the most elegant beautiful.  I just it just feels nice.  It looks nice.  It's snappy.  It works well.  Gorgeous camera might be the best arguably the best camera on the market.  Certainly the best Android camera out.  But the battery life could be a maker or break it.  So but I like I've been really happy with this.  There is a fair bump for the it's so thin.  There's a fair size bump for the camera on the back, but we're seeing that more and more now.  Some people are wondering whether they should buy the edge or the regular.  You don't get much function extra functionality with the edge.  There is kind of a kind of a cool thing you do with the edge, which is if I slide it in you can assign colors to up to five people in your life.  And if you get a message or a call from them and this is face down, it will glow with that color to let you know that whoop dee doo da.  And then there's a night mode which will show the time and weather and date on the side here on the left or the right side.  So since it does come with both Qi and Powermap wireless charging, I have it in a little wireless charging cradle.  So that's kind of nice.  I can look over and see the time.  Not not not a big functional thing, frankly.  So I think it's more aesthetics.  I like the aesthetics of it, although it's so weird because we're used to curved backs and flat fronts that I frequent.  I have not yet conditioned myself to think to realize this is the back and that the curved thing is actually the front.  But that's my tool of the week.  I'm actually pretty excited about it.  I'm enjoying this is the Samsung Galaxy S6.  I bought it from T-Mobile.  But of course, I think all the all the all the companies are carrying it and we'll have it soon.  Do you buy it?  Unlocked?  Normally what I do is I don't buy it from it.  This is the first phone I bought years from a carrier.  That's why I'm asking.  Yeah.  Yeah, usually I just buy an unlocked version.  But what it's happening with Samsung when you get an unlocked version on like expanses or somewhere is like my note for is the Hong Kong model.  So I thought you know what I should get a US model.  Let's just try it.  And you know, I'm a T-Mobile.  I'm a customer of all the all of them.  So T-Mobile is my preferred carrier.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now there's a strange baby on the phone.  I don't know.  I love this wallpaper though.  This 500 PX wallpaper is awesome.  It's coach wrote it.  Isn't that cute?  You get to pick which categories and 500 PX you want and it and it changes it every whatever you want five minutes hour.  Really fast really nice, but I'm a little nervous about little nervous about battery.  I'll tell you what's the one way they've handled that they does support fast charging.  I was able to charge the phone to 50% from 0 to 50% last night in half an hour and fully charged in under an hour.  So that's you know, that's one way to get around it.  But you need you need the fast charging capability and that you cannot get that on a battery as far as I know not yet.  Anyway, Jeff you got a number.  Let's go with this one.  So Business Insider speculated merely speculated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what the hell is what we do in journalism now that if Apple does drop Google from its default search position.  They then speculated that Google would no longer have to split revenue with Apple.  So they did some figuring and figured if 50% of the user is stuck with Google, which would be I think a conservative estimate of how many would Google actually earn 1.2 billion dollars more in revenue by being dropped from Apple and dropping Apple share.  Wow.  Oh, who knows what the truth of it is, but I found it interesting that the way the economics could work in this case.  I don't think that's true.  I don't believe that.  Because the reason Google spends the money 1.2 billion dollars and sends it to Apple is it's a I would guess a percentage of the money they make with those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a rep, but it says they get to keep that percentage.  Yeah, but they're losing whatever it is, four or five times more than that in revenue.  It's like saying it's like saying that.  This is great.  If I don't use if I don't use a realtor, I will save a lot of money, but you don't also don't get to buy the house.  Isn't that help beyond the math here isn't the money that Google pays to Apple percentage of the overall traffic Apple brings to Google the overall revenue.  You could certainly do it that way, but imagine that Apple leaves Google and now Google's not paying that large amount of money and now Google makes its case to all the users of Apple devices to change it back to Firefox users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which to change it back if those users change it back now, we get to keep the money from all those ads without paying anything.  Ding ding ding ding ding.  Yeah, but you get but that's a big if mathematics could be.  Yeah, that's a big if they remember the tyranny of the default people never change their default.  I googles Google though.  Yeah, I would change it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure.  So that's the key.  It just depends a lot of people on yeah.  And nobody's telling anybody the actual numbers, so we just.  Yeah, I would change it.  Yeah, I'm sure.  So that's the key.  It just depends a lot of people on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And nobody's telling anybody the actual numbers, so we just have to.  Of course not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's just business insider speculators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's no question though Google is making a point because when you do a, I can't remember when it comes up, but they do, when you do a Google search, they pop up, oh we noticed that we're not the default search on your browser, would you like to change that?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's important to do that not so often.  You don't want to annoy users, but a lot of the times if somebody's a Firefox user and all of a sudden they're searching on Yahoo and they don't know why, you know, letting people know, hey, if you want to come back to Google, here's a simple way to do it, you know, might make it easier for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess the real question is how many people would notice the difference and hate being in Yahoo so much that they say, oh God, what's gone wrong?  I need to get back to Google search.  They look a lot alike.  I bet you half of the people don't notice it.  There's a reason Internet Explorer was the dominant browser for so long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I also think there's probably a lot of people at Apple and at Bing and at Yahoo and at Google who are doing all this analysis and trying to figure it out.  I think one benefit from Firefox switching to Yahoo, I like competition and I like diversity in the search space and that lets everybody try out different options.  But it also probably gives Google a little bit of insight about what percentage of people would switch back and all those sorts of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Having had that happen once, now they know maybe how many people stick with the default, how many people will switch back and then they can make...  What it is, is you need the information so you can negotiate a fair price in future going forward.  So I don't know if Business Insider knows any more than we do on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they don't. They're just speculating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's some point where there's some percentage of people that will go back to Google that will make it worthwhile.  Yes.  We just don't know what that is.  Mr. Money Mustache, Matt Cutts, his pick of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. So at the top of the show we were talking a little bit about just trying to make great content and you will succeed and not thinking that much about SEO.  So I wanted to highlight a website that I've been really enjoying the last few months or so called Mr. Money Mustache.  It's at MrMoneyMustache.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Highlighting that a good name is very important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, it's very brandable.  And so he's basically a tech worker. He's worked at tech companies.  But he saved a ton of his money, a large percentage of his take home money.  And he's early retired. And so now he's got financial independence. He can do what he wants.  But he's got a whole philosophy. And the philosophy is stuff like move closer to your work so that you can commute with like a bike instead of with a car.  Or a second car. And learn new hobbies like woodworking or plumbing or working around the house to save you money.  And then that not only saves you money but you also get good exercise.  So he's got a whole philosophy about you can take the money that you would use when you were early retired and use that to make the world better.  And for anybody who's ever been like, oh, I should save more than 10% of my paycheck or anything like that.  It's like a little bit of personal finance but more about trying to emphasize all the fun things you could do if you were to learn a few new skills or not just sit and watch TV every single hour of the night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love this one. Muscle over motor.  You know, if you just mow your own lawn, blow your own leaves, walk instead of ride a Segway, you won't need that expensive gym membership.  Aided the truth. This is good.  So and what is the SEO lesson to be learned here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the SEO lesson is this is a guy who started in 2011, 2012 and has built a very profitable business on the side although he's already financially independent.  And all he's done is try to provide the best advice, no nonsense that he can.  And there's been a couple times where somebody has come to him as an advertiser and said, hey, can you tone down this post or take out these curse words or something.  And he's like, no, the whole point is that by being a little financially independent, I am able to turn down those things so that I keep my voice.  I'm the master of my destiny.  And he's got a forum. It's like a whole thing.  As a hobby, it would be a lot better for you to get into this sort of stuff because you'd be biking to the store and that sort of thing instead of a lot of other different ideas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love it that the ad banner instead of being at the top where we ignore it anyway is at the bottom.  That's fine with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Forbes just redesigned its site and got rid of the banner.  But they got rid of all the other stuff at the top.  All the if you just go to a story page after you get through that, you still have this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And now they're doing a countdown, which was just pick a story.  Clunky apps. Hold back Apple Watch.  Everybody, you know, is. Oh, yeah.  Well, so see, there's this big ad. Yeah.  But they got rid of navigation on the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think. No, it's here.  They didn't. No.  Well, maybe I'm wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm very aware of all this now because we're in the midst of a redesign and it's it's tough to balance.  You always want to make the site to be the most welcoming to users.  But it's hard to know. What's the best way to do that?  And it's really it's actually a great thought experiment.  And we don't have the luxury of being able to do a lot of A.B. testing and stuff like that.  So I'm just going to trust my gut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's them putting it in right now in the chat.  Oh, my God. I just got the gap ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, don't do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, disable notifications from D2I4NXEJANHW0H.cloudfront.net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, CloudFront is an advertising agency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Matt's loving this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, we found them. We found them.  Yes, we began the show with a commendium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, well, I lost it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hello, Dad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do I get that back?  I lost it.  Just rewind the tape.  I lost it, Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis has some work to do and we'll let him go do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do I get that back?  There's a disabled notifications thing from how do I get that back?  CloudFront is the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not the big numbers at the beginning.  It's CloudFront.net. That's what you want to know about.  So where do I go?  So you go to setting. I don't know how you if you can disable them.  Settings. It's in the advanced, you know, the second page.  And it's under Web, I'm sorry, Content. What is it?  Yeah. Privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was a whole nice thing that disabled notifications from.  Content settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Content settings.  Pop-ups.  Now what I would do is do not allow any...  I have no exceptions.  Oh, not pop-ups. It's notifications. I'm sorry.  Allow sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the one where it won't let you do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do not allow. Well, just click that. Do not allow any site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I already did and there's a whole bunch that are there and it won't let me change it.  So you can't delete these?  I can't. There it is. I found it. You're right.  And it just is in there as an allow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute. Click it. Wait a minute. I got it for you. Click it.  You'll see there's an X on the right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, there's not here.  Mine doesn't have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. See, the ones that are in italics have no Xs.  Exactly. How does that happen?  Yeah, because these are special.  Most of them are from Google. It's not a bug.  But why am I getting game-socaband.com allow and it's an ask...  Let's learn more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. I've got Amazon. I have flashcards.  WordPress.  What are these? Okay, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whoever's watching at Google, if they're still here,  what are these italicized ones?  And why can't we delete the italicized ones?  Oh, we got it. We got you.  We can delete the unitalicized ones, you get an X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But these are somehow they've gotten themselves protected.  Power wash. Power wash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But then...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but no, Matt. Then the same thing was happening on my...  It'll sync from some other one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It syncs. It syncs.  Do notifications get synchronized?  Hmm.  Notification settings? They may not.  They shouldn't because you would want different notification settings  perhaps on different machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait a second. I want to see. I'm going to go on...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what that is, and we should explain, is one of your extensions or apps  is monetizing using CloudFront.  Yes.  And so what you really want to do is find out which app is using that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's not...  Power wash won't do it, Matt, because it did sync it  to the Chrome on my other machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I still think you have not a rogue extension, but you have...  Something's wrong.  ...an unfriendly extension that is using notifications to pop up ads.  And I think you want to find that extension by deleting everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's doing something more.  It's doing something to the notifications exceptions,  and it's making them exceptions to exceptions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It may be that those talent-sized notifications are driven by extensions,  for instance, and you can't... They're not by websites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But CloudConvert, whatever the heck...  Hmm.  Oh, I used that one, yeah. But CloudFront, it somehow got in here,  and I can't...  Set by app popular on Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, CloudFront's a CDN. CloudFront is Amazon.  Not an advertising agency, it's a CDN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it was set by popular on Netflix, so it managed to sneak in that way.  I hope there's some good CSI Googlers right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So apparently the italicized exception, the italicized notifications  can't be deleted because they're associated with apps, not extensions.  So there's this new thing called apps, Chrome apps.  So see if you have a Chrome app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got apps, I've got to go through and kill them.  Remember we talked about that last week where I go through every once in a while and kill them.  Yeah.  But this is the fact that it came in through...  It says here it came in through Netflix.  Now the weird thing about Netflix is when I started with the Netflix app back on,  it didn't actually create an app, it was just a redirect to a webpage for Netflix now on Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  CloudFront is part of AWS, it's their CDN.  But it said Netflix, well then I think you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's actually a different address at CloudFront than the one I just read out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you're not doing popular on Netflix, are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why do you say that?  Are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is this the one you're doing?  This is not from Netflix, you know that, right?  Did I? Did I mess that up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I didn't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See if you have... there are several extensions that will do things like say stuff that's leaving Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I see I have an actual Netflix one, but it goes to Netflix.com.  That could be how it did it.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We'll know soon.  You might want to check not just the extensions.  Oh, I have popular on Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Delete popular on Netflix.  Delete popular on Netflix. You don't need that.  You don't need that.  Remove from Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now once I've done that...  You should never see it again.  You sure it's not going to clean it up?  You're never going to see it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sometimes I want to go through all of our extensions.  Do you have any favorite extensions that you use on your Chromebook, Matt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do have a few.  Let me see what extensions I've got.  Oh boy.  There's a few. There's one that I've written by hand.  Oh, you have...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He writes his own extensions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh my goodness.  Well, I use Face...  Well, there was one...  It turns out you can actually run a Chrome extension off of GitHub.  So you can like download something off of GitHub.  Unpack it into a directory.  Change like three lines.  That's all I did.  That's cool.  And then run that extension from your local download.  That's a great idea.  Yeah, it is.  I found something that takes Twitter usernames and makes them links to the Twitter username.  Which is kind of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I wrote a blog post about it.  I want that. Okay, I'm going to find your blog post.  Big folks disconnect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And let's see.  Oh, something that makes Hacker News where it's all red.  So that you can keep track of what you've seen on Hacker News.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love Hacker News.  That's become my product hunt.  My version of product hunt is Hacker News.  I think it's news.ycombinator.com.  It's really great.  Because it has upvoting.  So it's like Reddit, but it's Reddit for really smart people.  So the number one story on Hacker News right now is announcing git large file storage.  For a while people were trying to game Hacker News and it was kind of junky.  And I think they realized nobody cares.  Number two is Microsoft announces Hyper-V containers.  But the third one is the one I was talking about.  That's probably where I found it.  I quit. What really goes on at Apple?  It was that blog post about how life at Apple was so, so challenging.  Hacker News is so good.  Oh, it's amazing.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, user reviews for Popular on Netflix.  One says it adds advertisement pop-ups in the Google desktop notifications.  I think we found it.  Yeah, I think you found it.  Good work, detectives. Good work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hot dog.  Hot dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Woo.  Ladies and gentlemen, this, how about this, teaching Haskell to a 10-year-old day one.  You know, I found a great site on Y Combinator and on news called howistart.org.  It's kind of geeky.  It's a bunch of coders, most of them very well known, who work in various programming languages.  How they like start a new project.  So Peter Borgon, who is a Go evangelist and SoundCloud engineer, talks about what you should do, how he starts every new project in Go.  It's awesome.  And then there's some of them are really fun.  Let me, the one I like is Fred Hebert, who wrote the most amazing programming book ever, Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good.  And he, so if I don't know if anybody's interested in Erlang, but it's fun because the project is a Homer Simpson's nuclear power remote control simulator.  So if you want to blow up Springfield, this is for you.  And in the process, you learn how somebody who's like truly an expert in the language, in this case, Haskell, has figured, you know, works.  It's amazing how many people code in Vim.  It's like, why? Come on.  Gives you vigor.  Gives you vigor. Vim and vigor.  Are you a Vim guy?  I'm a Vimmer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm a Vimmer.  I'm totally a VI Vim guy.  Yeah.  Why do you do anything different?  Like, that's all you need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fred is also a Vimmer.  He says, I might.  He says, use the text editor of your choice.  Mine is Vim because I'm a terrible person.  You too, Matt Gutz.  You know what my project is to this last couple of weeks is learn Emacs.  It's going to take me years.  But I always used Vim.  But I want some a little, I know, crazy, right?  Just fun, you know, keeps in mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You didn't have enough carpal tunnel syndrome in your life?  Yeah, it's all keystrokes, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you can do anything.  It's like running a nuclear power plant with meta keys.  All right, everybody, we should wrap this up.  It's so much fun, but I think we got to let everybody go.  Jeff Jarvis is at the City University of New York.  His blog is BuzzMachine.com.  His books are Legion.  And he is blesses us every week.  And we just love it.  Thank you for being here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I got to give a quick shout out.  I was doing this event for Quartz magazine, which we quoted on the show twice today, by the way, in Nashville only yesterday.  And Monday night they had the party because it's a sales conference at the at the big brewery in town.  And the big guy behind the bar recognizes now looks at me, looks me again.  He said, Are you Jeff Jarvis?  So I want to give a shout out to our fan Lucas Hendrickson, a Twit and Twig fan and a bartender and a bartender.  It happens everywhere, everywhere.  I love it. It's the power of Leo's.  We always agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's not me. It's it's you.  It's you. It's not me.  It's you. It's you.  Thank you, Jeff.  I saw that tweet.  No, it's it's Matt.  It's Matt.  That does have the best laugh ever.  Matt Cutts, we love you.  Can I just.

So it's really fantastic.  Wow.  Ego pat on the back that way as well.  So I've experienced what Jeff has talked about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's impressive given that you're one of the first hundred Googlers and all that stuff.  Anyway, we love you, Matt.  Keep up the great work.  And I'm so glad you didn't go to work for that SEO.
