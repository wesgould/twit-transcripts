Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, well, no, actually you're wrong, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on.  And also here, Gina Trapani of SmarterWear dot org. That's her blog.  And of course, she's the author of Think Up and To Do Text and many other wonderful things.  Founding editor of Lifehacker. Hello, everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hello. Good to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, Jeff, go ahead.  Do you leave your vacation?  I am. That's why I'm translating things into Italian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's right. That's right. When do you leave? We're going to be Leo-less for like two or three weeks, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I leave next Tuesday and I won't be back until October 9th.  Good for you. Good for you.  Well, Jeff and I are on the fort.  Yeah, you know, thank you. Both of you are hosting shows, which is wonderful in my absence.  But I am going to record the ads for you so that you don't have to sully your Lily LeWaite hands on commercialism and capitalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You do this 300 times better than I was.  No, but he has to do it 300 times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, you know what? Last year when I went on vacation, I did record like, I don't know, I can't remember.  It was an ungodly number of ads, but we managed to cut that number down a little bit.  So that's a relief.  So, Jeff, last week we had a poll that made you open your Moto X.  And I figured it was about a 50-50 proposition that by now you would either blame us or love us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or have a re-boxed it.  Or a re-boxed it, shipped it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bingo. I returned it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You did!  We did!  Here's the rationale. Here's the rationale. I opened it and I used it for a couple of days. My 14 days was like up.  Yeah.  And I didn't hate it. Didn't love it.  Thought it was just expensive at $674 versus my Nexus 4, which I still have.  And so I thought I might want that Nexus 5. I could be kicking myself.  I do want a new phone. I'm willing to pay for a new phone. I want it to have LTE, more memory, some new features and that kind of stuff.  But I wanted to wait for the Nexus 5. There's still a chance I could buy the Moto X.  But we'll compare the Nexus 5, the Moto X and the HTC One and make a decision at that time.  That was my rationale.  That's fair.  Okay.  Now the other good news is my Nexus 7 with LTE arrives tomorrow!  Yay!

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you could use that as your phone. Just put Skype or something on there and Hangouts.  Will Hangouts make phone calls from a tablet, from an Android device? Or only from the desktop?  It'll do it from the desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Voices started to forward to Hangouts. Wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me see if I can make a phone call. It doesn't look like I can, at least not on this phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Through Hangouts though you can do video obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I can make a call to a phone number. When I'm sitting at home on my desktop, I use that as my telephone.  I can make a phone call to a regular phone number using Hangouts.  And that would be, if they put that on mobile, who needs a cell carrier?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right?  That would be huge. And I think they're moving toward that with voice and Hangouts.  I'm sure they are.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean the problem there is you're using data. But by the way T-Mobile just put out today new higher limits on tethered data.  Yeah, limited still. T-Mobile is competing really hard on plans.  Love them.  And the LTE 7 is coming with a T-Mobile SIM and one month, two gigs free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good. My car came with a T-Mobile SIM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really? Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that bizarre?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  T-Mobile is my carrier choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I use T-Mobile on my Nexus 4 and it is the best. If you can get it. If you have T-Mobile.  T-Mobile. Because nobody else is using it. Although that's going to change. They've really been growing.  Hey, before we go any farther, we should, and we do this every year it seems, but commemorate Patriot Day, September 11th.  Both you, Jeff and Gina, were in New York City at the time. And you've told your stories before, very moving stories.  Particularly Jeff's, who was in the basement of the World Trade Center when the first plane struck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I went back today, and it's weird because this is the first year where I really had no draw to go back.  But I kind of at last minute went. And it's triply strange.  First, because the memorial is now open for the first time on the anniversary, all of the activity around the commemoration moves to the memorial.  And if you haven't been there, the memorial is a fortress. It is behind all kinds of security.  You have to go through an airport to get there. And that alone is depressing and is troubling.  But I could barely hear a bagpipe off into the air. So instead what you saw was the scrum of TV cameras there, standing there saying nothing.  You saw the 9-11 nutjobs. Conspiracy buff nutjobs. Just littering the earth.  And then families were going around to go through the entrance of the memorial, and that was it.  So it was cut off, which to me is emblematic of where we are, where this should be a matter of openness and freedom.  It's instead another fortress. And this happens at the time of the NSA revelations, which the excuse for all of them is 9-11.  And I confess my mistakes that I thought we could do more to bring democracy to the world, and I supported the Iraq war, and I was wrong.  But it was a depressing 9-11 for me. It was a feeling we haven't advanced closer to democracy and freedom, in fact, or farther away.  So that's my cheery beginning to the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I think it's an apt point. It's as if the terrorists won in a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I almost used the line, and I couldn't find the right way to use it without the right level of irony and mockery, so I didn't. But yes, I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the goal of terror, is it not? To terrify people, to have them shaking in their boots, looking over their shoulder, paranoid. And it worked. It's very sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This was my first 9-11 that I have a daughter, a child, and I was giving Etta her bottle this morning and thinking about it, and thinking that I'm going to have to tell her about this when she's old enough.  And it's going to be a thing that I experienced that she didn't experience, and there's plenty of footage and documentation, right?  But she's going to look back at this the way that I look back at, or the way that I heard my parents explain about John F. Kennedy getting shot or the Vietnam War.  It's going to feel like a faraway thing that happened to people who are much older or dead.  Like us. Like we all do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't remember the Vietnam War? That's really depressing.  Well, I mean, you know...  No, of course you don't. Of course you don't. Of course you don't.  Yeah, it happened before.  But for Jeff and me, it was World War II. Our parents lived through it and remembered it, and we knew a great many veterans of World War II, but we didn't live it. We were born after it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And it just struck me as like, oh, this is a totally different thing.  You know, Jeff, Jeffrey McManus, who actually just recently passed away, he was at Yahoo for a long time.  I don't know if you know him, but he had written this incredible blog post. His daughter had been born like three weeks before 9-11.  And he said the way that he sort of experienced the whole thing was through the lens of having a child that was so small, and that for so many years he felt so bad.  Like, he would apologize to her. Like, I'm so sorry that I brought you into this terrible world, you know, that this wasn't a better world for you.  And he had this incredible line when he said, you know, it took me years to realize that the world isn't a gift that we give our children. Our children are a gift that we give to the world.  And that was that really... I was thinking about that a lot today when I was giving out of her bottle and thinking about September 11th and thinking about, you know, how much things have changed and yet how many things have stayed the same.  I still can't watch the video or see the pictures without getting like completely clenched. It's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think this is a good time for... this would be a good day, Patriot Day, for people, of course, to remember that, but also to choose to stand upright and to remember that the principles of the United States are openness and freedom and democracy, not paranoia, not, you know, shutting down, but opening up.  Amen.  And maybe that's, you know, 10 years after any tragedy, it becomes a tourist attraction. And that's obviously what's happened. It's very... it's kind of sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When you leave the memorial, you know, you walk through the gift shop.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. But that's us. That's humans. We have a terrible capacity for remembering pain. And I think that's biological, because otherwise you wouldn't have children.  Amen.  You wouldn't... you'd kill yourself. You'd go, Oh, God, it's just going to be more pain for 80 years and then I die.  So you don't remember that. Otherwise, we wouldn't have a race left. The people, the Neanderthals probably felt that way. That's why they didn't make it.  But I do think that it's important that if we do keep the memory of 9-11 alive, it's not as, Oh, my God, what's going to happen next? Oh, my God, they're out to get us.  It's the memory of the people, brave people, who stood up that day and to inspire us to continue to stand up against terrorism.  And that does not mean spying on our people, acting as if everybody who is Muslim is evil. That's not what we... that's not what this country stands for. And I would hope that we would remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree. And one of the problems I'm having these days is that, is with the Syria discussion, is... and recognizing the mistakes of Iraq, what are the obligations we have to other people on Earth?  Where is the red line? And I wish we were having that discussion. I mean, I'm glad we're having a discussion before launching military action. We're stopping and thinking and talking about it.  But we also have to not just be isolationists. We also have to recognize an obligation to other people to help them with their democracy. And, you know, the Arab Spring running afoul in Egypt is, I think, demoralized enough people to think, Well, it's not possible.  We have to still have to remember what's possible. I still have to look for the hope and look for the optimism. I find hope and optimism in what Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden did and what The Guardian is doing right now.  You know, I think it has to be a reminder to our leaders that their first obligation is to protect freedom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But yeah, yeah, I like that. But that way and that's why maybe, you know, maybe 200 years is all you can expect from a republic. I don't think so.  But that's why we need to stand up as that, you know, city on the hill, the bright shining light of hope for people. And we need to stand up for those principles that made this country great.  I'm a patriot. But that doesn't mean become a surveillance state. That's exactly the wrong direction to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I don't blame the spies. I wrote about this in my post today.  They're just trying to keep us safe. I understand. Cats must kill, spies must spy. You know, there's an instinct and we send them off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would even give them credit. I would even give them credit to say that they are patriots. They are trying to protect us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, yes, yes. A soldier has to set off and doesn't have a choice what war they fight in and go to follow orders and the spies the same.  I put the the the responsibility solely on the politicians and then in turn on us for choosing them and not holding them accountable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly. Yeah, we're the voters. It's our job. It's our government.  And what I really makes me sad is when people say, I see you just can't do anything. Government sucks. Yes, they're all politicians. I'm just going to opt out.  That's not how you fix this. Opting out is the wrong way to go.  As somebody in the chat room said, give me liberty or give me I don't know, something.  There is a lot to talk about. I tell you what, let's take a break. I want to get your so the Moto X is out for you.  I'm sorry to see. I'm curious if you even are considering an iPhone. I know all three of us probably had iPhones at one point.  I am still a Moto X lover. I'm a lover, not a fighter. I'm really loving this.  And this, in fact, I decided is the phone I'm going to take with me on my trip. And I have them all, as you well know.  So but you know what? When a Nexus five comes out, unlike you, Jeff, I will buy it no matter what. I have to own them all.  So I don't look to the future as you do. I, you know, I just use what's best right now.  So we got HTC one, we got a Nexus four, and we got a Moto X. And we don't got no iPhone.  So let's talk about the new iPhone if anybody's tempted. But first, a word from our friends at legal zoom.com.  They're not a law firm, despite the name. You might say, oh, you know, that's a $350 an hour white shoot attorney firm, right?

They give you a way to get the documents you need under your direction.  It's something that fosters entrepreneurship, for instance.

In fact, we're still using the operating agreement that I created through legal zoom.com.  That's how good it is. So nice to feel like that's one of the things that's so great about this country.  You can do this yourself. And legal zoom makes it easy.  You can also set a get a trademark. You can a chapter S or chapter C corp if you prefer.

And it was not of course this is before the Arab Spring.  But I was thinking there were two lessons I really gained out of that visit.  First of all, I knew that they were in trouble because the population was growing.  I think it was a million and a half people every other month.  And because Egypt doesn't have arable land, it's just on the on the Nile.  The rest of it's sand. They all came to Cairo.  And when a city is growing by a million people every other month, something's got to give. Right.  But the other thing that was a great lesson to me and I came home really appreciating the United States where we live by the rule of law.  You know, we we have these discussions and we get angry at the NSA.  But we live by the rule of law.  And I remember talking with people in Egypt and, yeah, if you want to, you know, do something, you had to go bribe somebody.  And and there was it was it felt chaotic.  It felt like if you knew somebody or you had the money to bribe somebody, you could get stuff done there.  But if you didn't, you were out of luck.  Half the house, most of the houses in Cairo are unfinished because the law is that when you finish your house, that's when you start paying taxes.  So nobody finished their house.  And there was this great sense of we don't care.  Everybody's in it for himself. And that really when I came home, I realized how powerful it is that in this country you can sue somebody.  And the judge's decision stands and you don't go out and shoot him.  In most cases, you go, OK, I guess I lost for all the complaints we make.  This is a pretty remarkable country we live in.  And and the the rule of law is so important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's absolutely true. I mean, there's lots of problems with the system, but we're empowered.  It's a system designed for us to be able to change it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's why these discussions are so great. Yep.  And nobody has yet come pounding on my door saying you better shut up about the NSA.  Now, if I were at Johns Hopkins University, they might.  Well, yes, that is that shameful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It really is. And now there's been an apology.  They backed down. They backed down.  But the fact that a university would not support free speech is appalling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I miss this. What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So there's a very well-known crypto crypto expert.  I'm going to get his blog post.  He's a professor at Johns Hopkins.  And his name is Matthew Green.  And he has a blog on blogspot.  But he also mirrors it to a site at J.H.U.  And he wrote a scathing blog post about this whole NSA stuff in which he said,  for instance, I was totally unprepared for today's bombshell revelations  describing the NSA's effort to defeat encryption.  Not only does the worst possible hypothetical I discussed in previous years appear to be true,  it's true on a scale I couldn't even imagine.  He was worried when he was talking about it in the past that he'd be considered a crank.  He says, I'm no longer the crank.  I wasn't even close to cranky enough.  The academic dean contacted him and said, take down all posts of that blog.  And the NSA logo.  The NSA logo was on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, he made him take that down as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, the reason it's a big deal is because there is this tradition in universities of open expression,  of freedom of speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Not just universities, by the way, but yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But particularly in universities, it's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Especially in those environments, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the question was, why was the administration asking for this, turns out,  that Johns Hopkins has a, let me see if I can find the,  there's a part of Johns Hopkins that does business with the NSA.  And it's unclear at this point what the chain of requests were.  The Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab, whose motto is,  enhancing national security through science and technology, apparently went to the academic dean.  Somebody, we don't know who at the APL, went to the academic dean and said,  these are classified documents you're linking to.  It wasn't by the, well, okay, well, this is an interesting point.  Well, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are they classified now that everyone's using them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was the Washington Post articles, public articles.  But in fact, and we had this discussion on security now, they are technically, they are still classified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, and so government people are told not to read them.  Not to read them.  He was linking to them, but he's not a government person, he's a professor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  So the dean of the engineering school, his boss, asked him to take down the post and to stop using the NSA logo.  And he made a point of saying it wasn't the dean's fault.  He also said, I should look, I should get a lawyer if I didn't take it down.  Yeah.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have since issued an apology?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not exactly.  They said he could put it back up.  They're not saying what happened.  Johns Hopkins told Ars Technica, we didn't receive any inquiry from the federal government about the blog  or any request from the government to take down the mirror site.  As to where the information came from, we are still tracing the path of this event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like, well, I don't know, somebody told me to tell him that.  Unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow.  And shameful.  And they did back down.  But anyway, Matthew Green is a very smart and good guy.  And his articles, his blog posts are very good, and I recommend you read them.  The full posts are on the blogger.  Google didn't ask him to take it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he also, by the way, he wrote another post today.  He said he and his wife talked about it, and he has this short window of fame where people are coming to it.  And he used that to make the point, and a very good post saying that we have to restore,  the question is, rather, how do we restore faith in technology?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because that's really the big, to me, the big detriment of all of this.  Well, there's a number of them.  One of the big detriments of all of this is nobody trusts anything.  When Apple announced this fingerprint reader, the first thought everybody had is,  oh, yeah, it probably sends your fingerprints off to the NSA, doesn't it?  But it doesn't.  Well, Apple says it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apple says it doesn't.  Now, consumers, I was talking about this with Kevin.  Apple says that it's stored locally, and it's just used to unlock your device.  It's hashed and stored locally.  It's hashed and stored locally, and it unlocks your iTunes account.  But do we trust, first of all, do consumers get that difference that it's not sent to the Internet?  Do we know for sure that it's not sent to the Internet?  Do we know for sure that there isn't some sort of a, that there won't be in the future some sort of vulnerability on the device  or in the operating system or some sort of hole that a malicious app could take advantage of  in order to transmit that information the way that your location information was transmitted from your account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, there is a slide in those NSA presentations that say,  oh, by the way, if you want to know where the perp's been for the last six months,  this thing on the Apple iPhone is stored, and you can just get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, here's the file name and the location of the device.  So we know that they're aware of these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're aware of these things.  This is exactly the kind of thing the NSA specializes in collecting.  I believe Apple, when it says we're not doing this, but that's the point of this is you can no longer trust.  You feel like I can't trust anybody.  And if you're not a U.S., if you're not in the U.S.  If you're in an airport.  Oh, that's another story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Would David Miranda have been physically forced to put his finger on his phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I am leaving the country, as you know, and I'll be coming back October 7th.  And we are now learning that it is the border and customs maintains a list of people for law enforcement in the U.S.  that they want to seize their stuff.  And because you're crossing into the United States, they don't need any warrant or anything.  You just need to be on a list and they'll take all your electronics.  And then they analyze them for bad stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So are you taking inventory of everything that you said and done, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm thinking maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, there's nothing on my stuff that I'm worried about, but I don't want to lose my computer, my phone, all my stuff.  And if and you don't know if you're on a list, there's no recourse when it happens and there's no recourse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a lawless zone, literally a lawless zone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, the thing, let's go back to the fingerprint real quickly.  I don't know about New York State, but in California, we get fingerprinted when we get a license.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  And that and that database is unencrypted and shared, I am sure, with law enforcement.  So I'm not worried about iPhones.  They already have all my fingerprints anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, when I'm in the process of adopting legally, adopting my daughter and I was they did a full background check and I was fingerprinted during that process as well.  Passports arrests, obviously.  But these are the things that I associate with getting fingerprinted for.  Right.  Background checks, arrests, passports, driver's license, you know.  So how about this one in Disneyland?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you get one of those passes that you can go over, they fingerprint you and that's how you really.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One of the like fast passes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Then they use the fingerprint as your way to get through the styles.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of the greatest things I ever did was was sign up for global entry so that if we were in the airport at the same time, Leo, you're standing alone.  Right.  I'm zipping right past you and my fingerprints go in the machine and I come in.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you're do they do biometrics of your eye?  Yes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not sure.  Actually, I'm not taking back.  I'm not sure that's.  I did an iris scan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I didn't.  No, no, I did an iris scan for clear.  Remember that?  Clear where you could jump ahead.  Where you get fingerprinted and iris scanned.  Now I realize the whole thing.  You got no secrets.  I'm surprised they don't take a little clank of your hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, except, you know, here's the thing.  One.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wrote another piece for the Guardian arguing that what's people say that privacy is dead.  But what I say is that secrecy is dying and that the lesson of Snowden Manning Greenwald Guardian and all that is and Clay Shirky says this better than I than I can as many things.  A secret is only as safe as its least trusted holder.  And what the government has to learn is that it can't hold secrets like this from us.  And that's the hope I find in this story.  So when the encryption story came out, I said, hallelujah, we know about this.  Yeah.  And there's no stopping us.  Yeah, at least we are having the conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It does make you wonder, though, how much we don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, and so so that is the real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Chilling effect of this is do people even trust technology anymore?  And do people outside the US trust US technology anymore?  We are going to see annual reports coming out from the likes of Cisco and Google and who knows else blaming the NSA for some portion of lost revenue to international clients.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's going to be huge.  Yeah.  I mean, our own our own government said don't buy phones from Huawei and ZTE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because the Chinese military are owners of these companies or part owners of these companies.  Well, if our Chinese, I sure as hell wouldn't buy an iPhone.  What goes around.  So here's here's the story from the New York Times.  Newly released documents reveal the government uses border crossings to seize and examine travelers electronic devices instead of obtaining those difficult to obtain search warrants.  There's there's such a pain.  Aren't they search warrants?  This is completely legal.  The government can subvert our constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizure merely because we're crossing the border.  Americans crossing the border being searched.  Their digital media is being seized in the hopes in the hopes that the government will find something to have them convicted.  Of course, anyone of any sense terrorizing the US government is a threat to the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course, anyone of any sense terrorist or criminal is not going to be bringing things across border.  They already know better anyway.  This is these are fishing expeditions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're Harrisburg.  It's the case of Miranda.  It was intimidation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's intimidation.  So text TCS is this computer system used to screen travelers at the border includes records from law enforcement, immigration and anti-terrorism databases.  A report from the DHS about border searches of electronic devices says a traveler may be searched because he is a subject of or person of interest in an ongoing law enforcement investigation and flagged by law enforcement lookout in the immigration customs enforcement computer system text.  And if you are, they're just going to take your stuff.  Be expect to be harassed, questioned, and they'll take your stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, what happened to though is that when David Miranda came across, he had to give up his they made him.  They said, you're going to jail if you don't give us your passwords.  So even if you have a Chromebook, a lovely pixel like mine, that virtual my data is the cloud.  It's not local.  And, you know, you've got to sign on the machine.  I they in the UK, they threatened him with jail saying, hand over your passwords, bud.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You might say this doesn't ever happen.  According to records from the Customs and Border Protection, it happens 15 times a day.  Geez.  Over the last of the last year, about 930,000 people are screened daily by border agents.  Four thousand nine hundred and fifty seven of them were subjected to what they call electronic media searches.  They go through your laptop, your phone, they look at stuff.  And this came up because a fundraiser for a young guy who was raising money to defend private manning, David House, he was on a list because he was doing that.  And so they took all his stuff.  He says, I can't make a living.  Twenty six. They took my computer for seven months.  I can't make a living.  After seizing his devices, immigration authorities sent a copy of Mr. House's data to the Army Criminal Investigation Command.  He was not accused of any crime.  I want to point this out.  He was a person of interest because he was raising money to for Bradley Manning's defense for something for someone to put up a constitutionally protected defense in a court of law.  He came back into the country from Mexico.  They see his sees his laptop camera thumb drive and cell phone and kept it for seven months.  No evidence of any crime was found.  Ain't that nice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Doesn't make you look forward to vacation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know what to bring.  I don't think I'm on any lists.  But if you could get on a list because you tried to raise money for a legal defense fund, then I suppose I could be on a list.  You promoted the EFF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, there's I mean, there's plenty of things that you said here on the air that could be considered.  You know, I mean, you're going to be fine.  It's just that.  Well, you know, it'd be great.  It's a great story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If they keep my computer and phone, I guess I will be getting that Nexus.  The great thing about the old board is that's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got 200 more.  I got plenty more at home.  Take everything you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You want.  Well, and of course, I don't take any anything out of the house that isn't in strong encrypted.  So I've got strong encryption on my phone.  I got strong encryption on the laptop.  The next question is, well, are they going to then demand the keys?  That's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You'll be only more suspicious because you have the encryption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. The PGP problem.  Well, that's another thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have I have regular encrypted email conversations with people all over the world daily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course, he's talking about where to find good people.  It's the most trivial crap you ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Most of it is does my PGP key work?  Yes, it does.  Yes, it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Occasionally we'll make a snide comment about the NSA.  Not yet illegal.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I hope you watched this earlier today.  Our security now, if you didn't download it, Steve debunks this notion that all encryption is broken by the NSA.  There is no safe encryption, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It gave me sort of that story came out.  Steve was already out.  Steve's on Twitter that much, but he was out on Twitter very quickly saying it's OK.  And we go read this.  And it was good to see it was reassuring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Call me.  Yes.  A lot.  Unfortunately, when it comes to technical subjects, mainstream media doesn't do a very good job either of understanding it or explaining it.  And unfortunately, there's this tendency towards sensationalistic headlines like from the New York Times.  NSA able to foil basic safeguards of privacy on the Web.  They can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not through technology.  It's through other kinds of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, this is what the article said, which is completely wrong.  The agency has circumvented or cracked much of the encryption or digital scrambling that guards global commerce and banking systems,  protects sensitive data like trade secrets and medical records and automatically secures the emails, Web searches, Internet chats and phone calls of Americans and others around the world.  The documents show they did not show that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, so they were saying the Times is saying they've broken.  They've cracked HTTPS, right?  That was my understanding.  Right.  That's what the Times was saying.  Right.  But that is not how we know they have not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because it's strong encryption.  Because it's strong encryption.  Because as Bruce Snyer says, trust the math.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bruce has seen all the documents.  Yes, he's seen the documents.  I made that connection and introduced him to the Guardian.  And he worked with Greenwald.  Good for you.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Because Bruce knows his stuff.  So.  And when he looks at the stuff and says, don't worry, folks, here's the status of it.  I have a lot.  You know, when he and Steve both do, that gives me a lot of faith.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So what seems to be true is that the NSA has a fairly large budget, about $250 million a year.  And by the way, all law enforcement has always been very nervous about the idea that a lot of the net is dark, that they can't see into encrypted stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're only making it's a strice and effective.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're only going to make more things.  They're pushing us under underground here.  So they have about a quarter of a billion dollars dedicated to somehow circumventing this.  But most of it is probably planting moles in big companies, finding existing holes.  In fact, the only thing that they cracked, they did two things.  They were able to crack broken stuff.  They know that stuff's broken.  We talk about it on Security Now all the time.  So if you listen to Security Now, you know, too, and don't use it.  Things like, you know, WEP.  And then they also apparently about seven years ago, persuaded NIST, the National Institutes of Standards and Technology, to release a completely broken,  one thousand times slower random number generator that they had a back door into.  Nobody uses it because it's so bad.  But they're trying.  And I think that is certainly the takeaway.  They're trying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Leo, what about what about not open encryption, but but a proprietary encryption?  Yeah, that's the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you can look at TrueCrypt and I can't you can't.  But somebody who Gina probably could.  Somebody understands code could look at TrueCrypt and say, no, no, this is clean code.  If you compile it from the original source code, you're guaranteed there's no back door.  You can't do the same with Apple's FileVault, Microsoft's BitLocker, any binary blob that you get from a company.  So if you presume that Apple's been subverted or Microsoft or Google's been subverted, then you can there's no way of vetting it.  There's no way of saying, well, I don't know, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And subversion is the right is the right verb here.  My my big fear in this story, I have no basis for this yet.  But my big fear and Bruce talked about it when he was on is that that there may be something going on in one of these companies that the companies don't know about.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is this whole unfortunately, this pair is kind of paranoid cloud now that's over all our technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the argument from people I know at Google, for instance, and elsewhere is, well, no, you know, there's enough of us who know what's going on.  We would know it.  We don't know anything.  If we did know it, by God, you'd hear it.  And on that level, I absolutely trust that statement.  But I don't I don't know enough to know what could be done by one person with security clearance and can't tell their boss what they're doing at a lower level in these companies.  There are lots of security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I have always said and I actually I finally converted Steve on this one.  Use open source encryption and and you're OK.  You know, if you're if you're really worried, use an open source compiler, compile everything from source and and you're fine.  You're not about brute force.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Leo is is computing get to the point where for the lower numbers of PGP brute force could do something for the low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  For the low. Yes. For the lower bit keys like a thousand twenty four bit key.  Yeah, absolutely. Even probably two thousand forty eight is probably that's a race.  That's a race of how powerful the computers are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. If they really wanted to get it, they possibly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And by the way, the weak link is not the key length.  The weak link is your password.  So if you have a crappy password, I mean, that's the that's the front door.  And most passwords are crappier than we know.  I mean, you know, this is hackers do us a great disservice by publishing this information about how easy it is to crack passwords.  So if so, you so have a very good password and then use long bit keys, you know, for that.  I use a 4096 key bit key on my and that that's going to be good for nobody's cracking your pizza recommendations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. Exactly.  Well, there's a Google there's a story in the rundown under the Google section that a Google executive today said passwords are dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I was going to say not only use a good password, but use anything you can in addition to or on top of password.  I like to to step off and step off. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, in fact, we're even getting smarter about to step off because things like Google Authenticator are subject to man in the middle of tax.  There are attacks on that. Now that we know that our government is is working really hard to attack this stuff, you know, not just hackers, but the NSA is working really hard to attack this stuff.  It's prudent to use stronger stuff. For instance, I just got from Yuba Key.  This is a good use for NFC, by the way. I got a Yuba Key has an NFC chip in it that so I have Yuba Key makes a Google uses the same old standard that Google Authenticator uses.  But unlike Google Authenticator, when I launch Google Authenticator just shows the keys, right?  So I've started to use the Yuba Key Authenticator, which doesn't show the keys until you tap it against your Yuba Key and the NFC unlocks it.  So it's not three factor. It's just double two factor, double two factor. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just make it as hard as possible. If if the government gets your phone in the airport, doesn't that take away?  No, unless they get me. Well, I'm doing something somewhat less secure, I have to admit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So one of the things that I like about the Moto X is this ability to stay unlocked when you're within range of a trusted Bluetooth source.  And they also have these skips, these Motorola skip keys.  So I have, for instance, an NFC chip right here on the table. And when I put the phone on it, it just stays unlocked.  Now, that's kind of a weakness. But what it does let me do is use a stronger passcode.  Now, instead of using a gesture, which is not very secure, I use a long passcode because I don't have to enter it very often.  And I encrypt my SSD on the phone. So if they didn't if the phone were locked, as it is now, and they don't have the passcode, they can't suck any data off of this phone even by bypassing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Once they do, if they do have the passcode, if they do, if you're sloppy about that, then...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, then they beat me with the if they beat me with a rubber hose and I give them the passcode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and then two step is meaningless because the second step is now broken. Right. Okay.  No, that's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, okay. That's what I'm asking.  That's not true. They just because they get access to this phone doesn't mean they then get access to my Google accounts.  Because I still have two step. If they have my keychain, though, I use the keys on that.  I use the keys on that. So this is why we always say if they have physical access to your stuff, it's very hard to protect you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. This is what I'm trying to figure out.  There's a funny picture of a guy supposedly sleeping and the daughter breaks the the finger print thing by putting his finger on the phone and she's laughing.  Right.  But in the one hand, you think that the physical is better.  But on the other hand, as you said earlier, our fingerprints are everywhere. You can get around that.  I don't know what the I don't I don't I don't know where the solution go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. So let's OK, let's go. We have fun with this. But let's talk about some shiny. OK, because I don't want to depress everybody.  iPhones, the new iPhones are here.  They come in color gold and space gray and white.  Yon.  Don't you want an iPhone fingerprint sensor? Don't you like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I think it's a bad sign that both Motorola and Apple think that adding color is innovation these days.  I think it's a very bad sign for innovation in phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, what may have happened is we might have just, you know, innovated our way into the corner here.  Yeah, I think so.  Like they do. It's the same thing happened with word processors, right?  You really couldn't improve on, you know, word perfect five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Microsoft just added 20, 20 more features.  Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You just add stuff you don't need. And oh, you got to have the new one.  We got the ribbon. That's what we got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We got the ribbon. So this is the equivalent of that or fins on a Cadillac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's just because you can't there's not much more you can do.  Although I would argue that a fingerprint sensor is innovative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the one bit that is innovative.  Right. I want to know if that fingerprint sensor is going to work better than, say, face unlock.  Here's why I think it does.  You're going to be able to pick up my phone and just tap the home button and it's going to unlock without me having to think about it, because I am lazy and I don't want to put in the passcode every time.  I don't love the idea of Apple like mass marketing fingerprinting devices.  But at the same time, I'm lazy and I see the value in just being able to tap the phone and have it unlock from me versus someone or someone else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not the first time. I mean, the Atrix had a fingerprint reader, but it was just unreliable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, this is the thing. Apple has to have made a very reliable.  And I tend to think based on the track record, although maybe this isn't true for all the things that they shipped, but that they got it right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think there is. They don't release products unless they feel at least historically.  Who knows what the new Apple is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But historically, you know, with the exception of BubbleMe and iCloud, with a few software services, you know, but hardware wise, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the Cube and 20th Century.  Anyway, they make mistakes. Nobody's perfect. But you're right.  I think in general, there's an attention to detail.  And here's where I think that this is, to me, the proof is in the pudding.  It isn't just for unlocking the phone. Apple has said we will allow you to buy stuff on the Apple stores with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because no one wants to type their password in, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's huge, because that's Apple saying we trust this enough to let it so you can use it for money.  Right. For stuff that costs. That is very big.  Because I think now we're going to wait and see. And if it works, Apple's going to wait and see if it works and works reliably.  People like it. They'll give out an API.  And this could end up being the authentication tool of choice, because it'll have hundreds of millions of people who have it.  In the next few years. So that's, to me, this is what's innovative.  And I do think it works. Or Apple would not say you could buy stuff on the store with it.  Right. They could lose a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and a lot of trust. And a lot of trust. A lot of customers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They put their money where their thumbs are. I mean, I think there really is a big statement.  Had they said merely, oh, to unlock the phone, I would say, yeah, I guess it doesn't work that well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Right. I'm interested to see what their app revenue, what their sales revenue is going to look like after this gets deployed,  because it'll be just so much easier to impulse buy, you know, in-app purchases and apps by not having to type in your password.  I know this makes me sound so lazy. But when that password pop up, pop pops up, if it's not something I really want, I'm like, yeah, I'll do it later.  Yeah. If I just have to tap it with my finger.  So, yeah, I think that the fingerprint scanner is really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I buy stuff all the time in Play, and Google lets me buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, Google has a setting that says, do you want us to make it so you don't have to enter the password? And you can say that.  Yeah. Yeah, Google's much more lenient than Apple is. Apple, you have to enter your password every time you buy something.  So you're right. That's a good point. Google just allows it to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I buy off the web a lot on Play as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, come to think of it, Amazon lets me click on my browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, one click. Yep.  But that's more on me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I don't know that it's going to make any big difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think that's more on me. That's like, well, if you turn this on and you buy something and somebody in your kid buys something, that's your problem.  Apple's saying, I mean, I think by putting it, by saying we're going to trust the fingerprint reader, it's kind of on them saying we trusted our technology.  I think it's a little different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What I'm trying to say is I think it's cool. I think it is in advance. All that's true. It's not a selling point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not. The average Joe's not going to say, oh, hey, that's great. I can put my thumb on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I was seven is really the thing that's like very different here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's to me. That's the you have any. That's the ugliest thing I ever saw.  Ah, Johnny, I've I think we always think of him because of all these very subtle gray, beige, aluminum designs, for example.  But I think Johnny secretly loves color. He's the guy I brought in the color IMAX.  Yes, he loves bright colors. I think IOS seven is disgusting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a tremendous change. I think people are going to freak out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I haven't played with it, so I don't know. Can you change the color palette so it's not so candy cotton candy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I haven't I haven't tried that. I haven't tried to change it.  I've been running the betas, you know, because I'm a developer. I have my IOS.  What do you think? Do you like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, you know, I don't live with IOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not my primary if I live with Android, really, and I use IOS only when I'm developing and testing.  I don't love it. I'll be honest. I miss it. I miss the old I miss the old design.  I miss the that I miss the depth. I miss the curves to the buttons.  Buttons looked a lot more like buttons in the old one.  Everything is just flat and a certain kind of, you know, the typography, the colors, the icons.  I don't love the flat design. I think I'm going to get used to it because, you know, you do.  I do like flat design, but Google's gone that way, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, they flatten their logos. There's no more bezels.  No more 3D. I like flat. I'm not against flat.  I just don't like the color scheme.  You know, it's just the color scheme.  It's just too freaking bright for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of my one of my number candidates go ahead and take it is nine things that the new phones look like from BuzzFeed.  Go take a look at them.  OK. Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cheese grater. No. OK. One, they look like Daleks.  They do those dots.  By the way, Apple, by the way, that image doesn't show it, but the the word iPhone shows through one of those dots partially.  And it's hideous. Steve Jobs would never.  I know I hate it when people say never. Oh, you're right.  They do look like Crocs. Oh, my God.  That's my favorite. Oh, my God. They do.  The ugliest shoes ever. Yeah, that's the cover.  Apple selling the dot cover. Gotcha.  They look like candy buttons.  They look like a cheese grater.  They look like a children's calculator.  They look like a baby toy.  That Connect Four is what Sarah Lane said.  And that's now that's the cover.  Without the cover, they look more like sweet tarts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Nokia, I love Nokia's response on their Twitter.  Imitation is the best form of flattery.  No, it's not. It's not imitating Nokia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nokia has had color phones, but there have been color other things.  It's not like the color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The H.O.N. does show through one of these holes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that hideous or what?  I know I hate it when people say Steve Jobs would never let this happen,  but Steve Jobs would never have let that happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Seriously, it looks like it says none through the hole  because the H is kind of cut off. Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow. Never would have let that happen with his attention to detail.  How did that happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very strange. Very strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just don't get it.  Anyway, I'm going to buy it.  Meanwhile, the stock is down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is made by Cheeto in our chat room.  Cheeto says, Dear Nokia, Imitation is the best form of flattery  showing all the color things Apple did long before Nokia did.  Color loomies.  But you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The color thing leaves me cold.  I don't think color seems more like a marketing gimmick than anything else.  I think the software changes are a big deal.  I think they're a big change.  Well, 64-bit, do you care that it's a 64-bit ARM architecture?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't care.  I don't think there's any benefit from that.  I have to think that Apple engineers are going crazy  when Motorola talked about its X8 architecture  with the extra chips that stay on watching what's going on  while the main chip is turned off,  exactly what Apple is doing with the M7 motion coprocessor.  Great minds.  I'm sure those were independently thought of,  but interesting.  They're doing the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What did you guys say on MacBreak and on Twitter  about what they didn't announce?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they didn't announce NFC, which I think is a blow to NFC,  but NFC isn't just for commerce.  I use NFC, as I mentioned, for unlocking the phone.  There's lots of ways to use NFC.  I like NFC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why do you think Apple seems to be religiously against it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They've decided to go their own way.  In fact, we talked a little bit about that.  Was it Ani Anakoh who believed that they were going to go  the Bluetooth low-energy route?  That's the technology that's used by the Fitbit and other devices  and presumably by an iWatch.  What else didn't they do?  Well, there were no surprises.  But none of this was a surprise.  There was a lot of swirling rumors, as there always are,  but this is pretty much what I expected from them.  I didn't expect them to talk about anything but iPhones.  This is the iPhone event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Complaints from some analysts that it's just too expensive for China.  It's not going to give them scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think we and a lot of others got it wrong thinking that Apple  might want to go after that low-end market.  In hindsight, that's not the Apple way.  Never has it.  I think one of the reasons the stock market punished them  is they thought that they should have made a $350 phone.  But I don't think that Apple cares about that.  These are high-margin items.  What is odd to me is I don't really understand who the 5C is for.  It's not that much cheaper. It's $100 cheaper.  And you give up the fingerprint reader, you give up the fast processor,  you give up the motion coprocessor.  I don't understand why they made that phone.  Chris, you have an idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, absolutely.  No, no, no.  Feet on the ground sort of view.  No, no, no.  The high school market, high school and college market, this is huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's why we titled our show, MacBreak, yesterday, C is for Kids.  This is a phone aimed at young people.  Absolutely.  Not third world, not underdeveloped nations, not poor people, young people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you just look at the Apple website,  it looks like the iPhone C is for someone who's much younger.  And then you look at the version of the iPhone 5S,  it's like this is the old daddy's phone.  Yeah, you're right.  Just look at the difference.  People in high schools, and in high schools,  I actually believe that those are sort of under-sophisticated users.  They're not looking for the newest Android phone that they can hack.  And the iPhone has that sex appeal that they really want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can see my kids, in fact, my kids probably will want the C, not the S.  They don't care about a fingerprint reader or a 64-bit processor.  This is for the colorful.  That's their tagline.  The 5C is for the colorful.  I'm a colorful person. I want a lime green phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's funny because yesterday I was looking at these  and I was thinking, maybe I want a C.  Do you? You're a colorful person.  It looks like the fun phone.  It is a fun phone.  It's crazy because I feel like I've been brainwashed.  I know it's just a 5 underneath, but I don't know why,  but it feels like the fun phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chad, you're right too.  And if you're going to go with color, they go with it more aggressively.  So I got my Moto X.  I'm not dissing on the Moto X, but I got it.  And I said, oh, I got a blue phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know. It's not that...  Look at mine. Does this jump out at you as a red phone?  Not particularly. Of course, I got the brick red.  You can get a brighter red.  They call this crimson. That's not crimson.  It's pretty...  The truth is, these aren't really jazzy items.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. Well, I guess we've come to the end of our shows.  This is the last episode of All About Android and Swig.  Go do innovation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, this morning, you know what, Jeff, you're saying that in jest,  but this morning I did start to think a little bit about that,  that we have been in a great couple of years,  and maybe I didn't appreciate it, where there was just lots of stuff happening.  It was very exciting.  And we may be entering a period of time, a little bit of a plateau,  as we have with personal computing.  Desktop computing, there's nothing going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but look at this show, and I'm going to defend our gig here.  But most weeks we say, wow, look at what we've got to talk about.  We can't believe this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think that may be changing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but maps, self-driving cars...  Well, that's kind of what I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I said at least there'll always be software on the Internet.  That's going to change rapidly.  Hardware, we may be at the end of the line of hardware.  Hardware, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and watches are not it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, everybody's going to be looking for wearable,  and I don't think it's glasses or watches.  I love the idea of wearable.  In fact, we're actively considering launching a show about wearables.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because I think that's going to be an exciting area.  But it may be early days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The host has to have very long arms, lots of watches on.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I really want to do a show about mobile and wearables.  I really think that's where exciting things are going to happen.  And that's one of the things we do, is we need to look...  You know, I didn't cover cell phones for a long time.  I hated it.  People kept asking me about, well, is the Motorola Razr a good phone?  When I went to radio stations 10 years ago,  that's all anybody wanted to talk about,  because they weren't into computers and the Internet.  And I said, I don't care about phones.  They're stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not a gadget guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who wants to talk on the phone? Email me.  Yeah.  And now it's where all the excitement is.  But I think rapidly, maybe we've got to see what the next thing is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it does feel like smartphones and tablets  are just these slabs of touchscreen.  It's very basic now.  And they're specs.  Once in a while you have something like the fingerprint reader,  which is kind of interesting.  And they're all starting to converge upon the same design,  less bevel, we have colors, which I think is sort of meaningless.  But yeah, it's true.  The hardware section of all about Android, don't tell Jason,  is probably my least favorite, because I'm like, oh, yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it's another square, it's another rectangle.  They are their glass rectangles, aren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, I'm not sure it's so much wearables or mobile as it is peripherals,  but they will have your computer, whatever form that lump is,  you've got your lumpo computer,  and then things are going to talk to it and get to the world through it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's the debate that's going on right now, actually,  very actively in tech circles, is should these be standalone  or should they be as they have been so far with the Galaxy gear  and the Pebble adjuncts, accessories?  I'm of the other opinion.  I think they need to be standalone to be any good, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, but the telcos are going to hold us back there,  because they're going to have bad plans.  You might carry 10 connected devices,  a camera, this and that,  and they charge you 10 to 20 bucks each month for every one of them,  it's going to squash them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Bluetooth pairing, that pairing with your phone degrades the user experience.  I agree with Leo.  If I had to design a watch that I really wanted,  it would have to be standalone,  it would have to be something that I can just put on and walk away.  The fact that I have to pair it, even with glass,  and I'm like, hey, they're talking, you need this,  the phone's in the other room, whatever,  it really degrades the user experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a really, really right point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Something like Chromecast isn't wearable.  It is kind of an accessory.  It's a remote device.  There's something interesting there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a good example.  I've been watching shows on that a lot, playing music for a lot.  I use it constantly.  I pray for other companies to support it, though.  I'm a little disappointed that we...  It hasn't happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was a brief time where on my Chromebook it disappeared from Netflix and Play.  I haven't checked Play again, but it's back on Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I watched Play yesterday.  I'm watching Orphan Black on the Play Store.  It's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo, I don't think your wearable show,  I don't think the glass and the gear and the current crop of wearable stuff is showworthy just yet.  No, I agree.  But I bet it will be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I do feel like that's the future.  I do feel like that's the future, but you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's too early.  It also is the precursor to the Internet of Things and yours to Thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, it's what it is, really.  It's the Internet of Things.  Maybe it should be the Things show.  We're going to take a break.  Come back with more.  Jeff, Gina, you, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  With a Q?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  M-O-O-C.  M-O-O-C.  It stands for Massively Online Open Courses.  Or Massively Open Online Courses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yes. I've heard of these.  I can't say that I'm into them, but I've heard of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, get into them. Mooks are awesome.  Coursera and Udacity.  Khan Academy was one of the first mooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, okay. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google is building a  YouTube for mooks  with edX.  This is a really neat idea.  Mook.mooc.org.  EdX is an open source  online education non-profit  started by Harvard and MIT.  And so  mooc.org.  It actually sounds like a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  racial slur.  But...  Hey, you mook! Hey, mook!

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Get out of my way!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You mook.  You mook, yeah.  You, I'll didact you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's really a crappy acronym.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I agree.  I agree, but that's it. So it's too late.  You have to go with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't realize that they were called, that things like Khan Academy and Code Academy  and that kind of thing, were called mooks.  Khan Academy is

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  non-profit as is mook.org.  But Coursera and Udacity are  money-making entities.  So it's going to be interesting to watch.  I like the idea that Google is supporting  an open, free

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  solution.  I think Google has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I-Tunes you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Somebody said to me, and I think this is true, we were talking about being  locked into Apple's ecosystem.  I said, you know, I can get along without it.  And he said, you know, the one thing I can't get along without  I-Tunes you.  There is nothing comparable to that.  And maybe mooc.org is the solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The problem with mooks,  I think mooks are fascinating.  But it reminds me of the early  days of media.  The early days of media, and we're still there to a great extent,  let's take what we did in the old world and let's just  shovel it online. CD-ROMs.  I see the same thing with mooks, where  we did 15-week lecture courses,  we do 15-week lecture courses.  We've got to just utterly rethink  how we do outcomes and how we  then get to those outcomes.  And Khan Academy is far  more disruptive to me than a mook,  because Khan Academy deals with individual  lessons and pieces of knowledge. I guess so Khan Academy

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  is not technically a mook.  Because you're not all in one course.  Right, okay that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You make your course out of it, or you're in calculus in school  and you don't understand, you go to Khan Academy.  I think that  what has the rest of media been about?  Unbundling. So we need to unbundle  education. You're going to unbundle  it from the university where you can take  courses here, there, and everywhere.  Then you're going to unbundle the course  into lessons, and then you're going to unbundle the lessons  into specific things that you learn  better from this way or that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They've redesigned Khan Academy,  look at that. Oh wow. That's  pretty. It was never the best  looking site, but  who cares, because it had all these free courses  in every subject possible. They've completely  we've got to get Salman Khan on  the show. He is  he's Nobel Peace Prize guy.  He deserves all the  kudos in the world.  This is the how to calculate the area  of a circle. You know I've always wondered that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's watch. All chocolate wafers  in the shape of circular disks.  The diameter, the  diameter of each wafer is  16 millimeters. What is  the area? I admit it's not modern.  So the candy, they say it's  the shape of... That's beautiful about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Didact, you know it's not using the latest  pedagogy. This is pretty  much a teacher on a front of a blackboard

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  right? Blackboard, yeah. Well, you know, I  was speaking with a bunch of people at NBC News yesterday  and I said at one point,  the best use of graphics on  television news that I have seen in decades  was Tim Russert's whiteboard.  Right. Right?  Very simple. Got something  across. There were no trumpets. Pardon me, Gina.  Right? It was  it just described something in a way you could understand  it. Florida, Florida,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Florida.  Who could ever forget that?  That's right. Udacity is  teaming up. Udacity is a for-profit  MOOC.  I just like saying MOOC. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just don't say it in Italy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  MOOC!  I feel like I should be in Jersey. Udacity  teams up with Google and AT&T

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and other tech giants for a  giant MOOC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They call it Open Education  Alliance. But  it's for industry.  They  want to provide students around the world with curriculum  and skills they need to pursue careers and  technology. So it's all about  having a workforce trained up.  Which is not to me.  That's fine. That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I shouldn't say anything. I think that's where it's going to go.  I was at the Four Square  Conference in New York a year ago  and  Mr. Ning, I'm forgetting his first name,  co-founder of Coursera, and  oh crap,  I'm forgetting his name. Sebastian Throne!  Former, no, he's amazing.  Former head of New  York City Schools,  Klein.  Anyway, I asked him, I said, what's going to happen  with the degree? And Klein said,  when people, when  Cisco starts hiring people because they've  taken and certified they've taken  these five online courses  because they have the skills that Cisco needs right now,  there goes the degree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We actually have a  new sponsor that's going to do online  certification training.  Oh, that's a huge  area. Isn't that great? ITPro.tv  I think. And they were inspired by  the screensavers, my old show, so it looks there in a garage  and it's really cute. It's really great.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the unbundling, Leo.  And what with Google, I talked about how education  was teaching  and research and certification  and socialization.  And you start  to unbundle those functions too.  So certification is done  in the law field, it's not done by the  school, it's done by the bar.  Right? And certification  becomes separate from education  because there's grade inflation and all these other  things. As it should be, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We should talk about

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Chrome apps. I have it in the  change log, but I feel like it's a big enough  topic that maybe we should talk about separately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Chrome desktop app. Okay, let's do this. Let's do the  change log. And then we will  drill down on this. It was  my absolute next topic because I think  I've been waiting for this show so you can  explain it to me. Plus there's new

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chromebooks, so it's a Chrome  time here. You may be taking  your Chromebook with you in Italy by the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  we're done with you. You could probably do a Chrome show,  Leo. You probably could do it at this point.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I already decided not to do  a Metro tiles  show. So  I don't think this is going to happen.  But I can tell you what is going to happen.  Some trumpeters are going to come out of  the woodwork and play  the change log theme.  The Google change log.  And ladies and gentlemen, here it is  Gina Tripani with the latest from  Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google Plus launches embedded  posts, which means that you drop a little JavaScript  onto any web page and  your Google Plus post along with  the ability to plus one and the link  attachment and your avatar and all the people  plus one and the entire comment  thread will show up on  any on any website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fast here, Gina. Don't go too fast here.  Don't go too fast. To be a  favorite, Chad, go to any  Google Plus post.  Click on the little arrow on the upper  right to embed and then see what

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it gives you. It can give you a  long Java string, right? Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see what it gives  you. It's not like embedding a video.  People, mortals will not  do this. Oh,  I was all excited. I was all

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  excited. I got  Chad's latest post here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Embed post. Yeah, click on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  down arrow. Okay, where's the  down arrow? Find embed.  Oh, it's the down arrow. It's not the share button.  Okay, well, that's the first mistake.  Should be in the share button, right?  Embed post. Okay, I see it.  Yeah, place this tag.  Oh, wait a minute. You got to place the  script in the header  and then place this in the body.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's an unfortunate  implementation error.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Gina, correct me if I'm wrong, but they don't even  need to do this. You can put script  brackets anywhere  on the page. It's called YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, you can. It's a wonderful  company I work with. Why do they do that?  I have a product called repost.us  which is really a really wonderful  thing that enables articles to become embeddable.  Now, in that case, the source, you put one  line of script onto  your source page. That makes everything on your site  embeddable. Every blog post you do.  So even that can be embeddable.  This, nobody's going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nobody. Well, they don't even need to do  it this way. You could just copy and paste the whole  thing anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You should be able to copy and paste the entire thing and drop it anywhere on the page.  You should be able to. You can call JavaScript anywhere on a page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doesn't it work? But you can't do this. This won't work.  If you put this whole thing in  my blog, it doesn't work.  Because you have to have that in the head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, you don't, though. You shouldn't. That's not the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or just before your close body tag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, Google. Google, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait, hold on there.  Hold on there.  Just one cotton-picking minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You mook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't believe  my memory of how JavaScript  works. I don't think you have to have  ... The only reason you would want to  put that at the top there  is for loading speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Optimization, loading speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have a blog. I put it, Leo,  I put it to my WordPress site.  I put it in there and nothing showed up on it.  Let me see. I'm going to make ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It might be doing some DOM manipulation, Leo, that requires it  to load at a certain time.  That's kippy.  And if that is the case, and I believe Jeff,  that's a really  poor ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I could have screwed it up. I could have screwed it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it doesn't work. I'm doing it right now.  You're right. It doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can drop it anywhere on the page. Google wouldn't have put those  instructions there.  Obviously, there's got to be a reason. There's got to be something  going on in JavaScript there that requires it to be some place  separate. That's a terrible thing. This is classic developer

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  experience. I worked with a company once  that said, oh good, we finished  all our work. We have an API now.  I said, no, no, no, no. With mortals, with media companies,  API stands for  I need a developer. That's going to take me a year.  Right? Yeah.  This is the same problem here. Oh, I got to change  my template.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait a minute, though. It says place it in your  head or just before  close bodies. That means you could be anywhere.  Body is the body of the page.  Why does it work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you're dropping this into a WordPress  blog post, for example, your post  is in the middle of the page. It's not just  before the body close tag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. That's exactly the problem. That's how I should be able

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to use this. Someone like Jeff has to go  and edit his WordPress theme  to put it in the header or just below  just before the close body tag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not someone like Jeff who does that. It's Jake who does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Oh, is Jake your WordPress

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  administrator? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Smart.  I don't even know where it's hosted now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know why that is the case, but  Google wouldn't put those instructions if it wasn't the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, one of the instructions are  place this tag either  in your head, which is the  normal thing when you have script. You'd  like to put it in the head before the body  render. Right. Or  just before close  body text. Oh, just before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just before your close

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  body text. As Gina said, this is a post that's in the middle of a whole bunch of stuff.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, you're right.  But that's for loading, isn't it?  No, it's just

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well, it won't be there.  It won't do anything.  Google, Google, Google.  Now, I also got excited when I saw this news because  I thought you could start to embed things  on Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Now, this worked. Wait a minute. All right.  Let me try it. Okay. So I'm doing  I'm going to I did  follow their instructions and I put it right  before the close body tag. And then  the page did open with the embedded  thing just like that. Great. Okay. But let me try  moving this  script tag  up  up to  should I put it at the top of the body?  Let's say. Right?  Now  that would be if you just pasted it in  I could put some here's some text  and then here's some text. We'll just put  some crap in here.  Well, WordPress may be stripping  stuff out. WordPress.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's my WordPress blog. I can put it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right. So there I'm saving it. This is  not following Google's instructions.  Oh, there it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It worked. It did come up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why shouldn't  this work just like a YouTube video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a standard for embedding.  You're not doing HTML. This is a pure  HTML doc. WordPress is doing stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I'm trying to say is  people aren't doing that. They want to get this  stuff spread around. People have blogs  and they have stuff like  that. The number of people who are still doing  it. Jake yells at me when we teach  HTML at my school because he said  nobody needs HTML anymore. They're using tools like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What are you doing? Well, but I  would point out that  any  WordPress is stripping out  WordPress.com does.  No, no, no, it's stripping it out.  You have a blog. You're loading

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  JavaScript in the head. You're loading CSS.  WordPress is doing some processing. It's got to do  a lot of that. I still go back

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to why shouldn't this operate like  YouTube? It's a Google  public newspaper, but it's not crazy. It doesn't.  Jeff is right. You should just

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  be able to drop tags in  one part of the page. That's how every embed

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  works. But YouTube is not doing a JavaScript  embed. YouTube's... Is it?  YouTube uses an  iframe. It's using an iframe.  This is JavaScript.  Watch. I'm breaking the rules.  I'm pasting both  snippets together in the middle  between text, not at the end,  not at the beginning. I'm going to  save this out, open it in the browser,  and in a bit it's going to  render, and there it is. It does it.  WordPress is stripping out  the JavaScript as it should  because it's worried about exploits.  And I agree, but there's nothing you can do  with that. Google can't help that if they're going  to use JavaScript. That's what's going to happen.  I'm puzzled as to why  they gave you the instructions, but I think...  It's not about DOM. It's about loading.  I think it's about optimizing loading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sure there's going to be a WordPress shortcode or plug-in  in a hot minute that does this for you.  But I've got to say,  I'm kind of with Jeff here, and this should  be as simple as... This shouldn't be a... Should they do  an iframe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the problem with the iframe is that the height of a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google Plus post is variable, so  like with YouTube embeds in an iframe, you can  set the width and height. So I think  you can do 100%, but I think that it gets funky  in some browsers, and I think when you expand  the comments on the Google Plus, the height  adjusts dynamically,  and that's kind of tough to do in an iframe because then you'd  force a scroll bar. I just think it gets a little funky.  If they could have done an iframe, I feel like they would  have done that. Also, the iframe gets  a little funky with SEO as well.  It's harder, I think, to read the content of the site.  So I think Google's doing the right thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that it's not an easy thing,  and that's probably why they didn't put it in the  reshare button, but up in the drop-down,  because it's like, you've got to kind of know what you're doing.  If it's a post that's not shared publicly,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it doesn't show the embed opportunity  on Google Plus.  That's smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's good.  Yeah, iframes are actually deprecated.  It's an absolutely horrible way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not a good solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, do me a favor. Humor me.  Humor me. Go to repost.us.  Go to...  No, go to njnewscommons.repost.us.  Humor me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay. NJ News Commons...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the same voice he used when he asked me  to stop using Hangouts today.  Repost.us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, Jeff.  You understand that  nothing that allows you to paste in  stuff is going to allow you  to paste in JavaScript.  That's a security flaw.  So you can never do an embed  that is using JavaScript in anything like this.  You never will be able to.  It's a security flaw.  They have to sanitize it.  Otherwise, you're running an arbitrary script.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, a CMS, you mean. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, no CMS is going to let you do the embed.  You have to control the HTML  and it can't be  stripped out. So go ahead. What am I supposed to do here?  So just pick a post.  Pick a post.  Oh, you're saying they're doing it right. Okay, let's see.  Apple Recipe Roundup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, it's the same one I have. Yeah.  Click on that. It's going to go to a page that says

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  repost this article on your website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, look at that. This is nice.  It's very nice. This is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And there it says WordPress right there.  Okay, the embed code's been copied.  They're doing a div  and they're doing a script source.  This is a script.  Let's put it in my new web page  and I'm going to put a bunch of crap in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Alright, so. I'm going to make you log in to  Leoville and start posting on Leoville.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I'm just posting this. I'm doing this locally.  So there is a script, repost  article, JavaScript.  But by the way, this is when I took it  from the arbitrary. I bet you with WordPress  it's doing something else.  Yeah, see, it's using  embed codes for WordPress.  I mean, it's using WordPress as native.  It's not using  JavaScript on WordPress. That's why.  So it's not going to be as pretty on  this is the WordPress code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what? It's so pretty on WordPress.  What it does is it reads the CSS  of the destination site and  mimics that. No, it's obviously what it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  doing. But it's not  doing any JavaScript. It means you couldn't do things  like comments and stuff like that.  So I'm using, if I use the one that's  for my site, it is using JavaScript.  And so now I have  Chad's post and underneath I have  this is, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  You have no CSS so it doesn't know what to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, this is blank  land.  It's unstyled. It's unstyled. But if you look  at the embed code with CSS,  if you look at the embed code that it gives people  who are using WordPress,  Gina, there's no JavaScript. This is  just  divs. CSS  plus an article link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I see what you're saying. So of

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  course, you couldn't do the  JavaScript thing in WordPress and strip it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  out. Yeah, I mean, that's why  WordPress has like short codes, right?  Right. Because using their code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would have thought Google would have thought this through

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to that extent. Well, they would have to do  this ugly thing, which is not  ideal, which is, where would you like to  publish it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Right. Right. You have to  have to get these choices. Well, interestingly,  speaking of Google Plus and WordPress,  WordPress.com and what else? Oh,  TypePad have Google Plus sign-in  integration. And when you when you connect  your say your WordPress.com account to  Google Plus, then you  will show up as the author of  your blog post and Google search results.  Yeah, which is which is which is a nice  new integration. Actually, I'd love to see this in our sponsor  Squarespace. I'd love to see  this in Squarespace. I'd love to see this in Tumblr.  And it seems like, you know,  it's an easy way to get your  name and face next to your, you know, your posts

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  in search results. Is that using the author tag?  Yes, that's using the author tag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. Right. Right now, it requires you  to, you know, change your theme and  or use I'm sure there's a  plugin out there. But now with the sign-in with  Google Plus or you don't actually sign in to WordPress  with Google Plus, you connect your account to Google Plus  and then Google will do that for you,  which is a nice integration. So they're trying  to do they're trying to do the right thing for WordPress users.  But yeah, I agree that that could be  a little a little easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Continuing on with the changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which continuing on with the changelog. Thank you.  Google Glass. You railed it.  No, no, it's okay.  I like getting into it.  Google Glass just got an update this week.  XE9 brings this new  screenshot vignettes feature,  which actually superimposes  whatever you see in Glass  onto the picture that you took.  So it's a nice way to kind of demonstrate,  you know, what you're seeing as you're looking through Glass.  YouTube videos and search results.  Sound search. If you long press  listen to a song, Google will do a search  for that song.  And the new update also lets you  control the Google Glass UI  with the My Glass  Android app. So that My Glass  Android app used to be able to see if someone  had Glass on and was using it, you could see what was  happening actually on your phone.  Well, now you can remote control Glass that way.  So you can hand the phone to someone else  or you can be maybe doing a presentation  and say, okay, if I swipe this way, this is what you're  going to see on Glass and remote control.  I also not go crazy with the finger motions

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because I just go nutty with it.  Yeah, yeah.  Let me just do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's a little easier to do on the phone.  Also, I thought something that would make you happy, Jeff,  Google Apps support. I've already done it.  Very important.  So now, is it right that you have to,  so you can sign into your Google Apps account on Glass.  Is it right that you have to factory reset Glass  and then sign in with your Google Apps account?  Because it doesn't do multiple sign in, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have to do one account. No, it does not do multiple sign in.  I do that because I'm going to do that with my Chrome crazy.  No, which is a whole other rant.  I didn't have the latest version on there.  So there wasn't a factory reset opportunity.  I had to put the latest version on,  then go to Settings, find factory reset,  hit it, boom, and then all I could do was  sign it back in, go to  google.com slash my glass and put in  my Apps account and boom, there it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it worked. Yeah.  It doesn't quite work.  Some of my things are in my Gmail account,  some of my things are in my Apps account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the same problem. My photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I want my Apps priority inbox, but I want my  plus Gmail account, so it's not multiple sign in.  But if you've got all your eggs  in an Apps basket, this helps you out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But pardon me for a rant.  The issue I've had recently  with, I've gone  over, don't worry folks, I won't go over it at length here.  But I've gone over this problem with multiple sign in.  And the latest wrinkle for me was  I couldn't get Google Cloud Print to work,  and I have to have work because I have a Chromebook.  And because it kept on thinking that I was in my  other account. I had to go through  25 steps. I restarted the machine, it still would  come back on. I had to  sign out of Cloud Print  to sign back into another account having  no idea why it was signed into the wrong account.  The machine, everything was signed into the right  account. Get it figured  out, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, every time, I run  into multiple sign in problems on a pretty regular  basis. And I think of you every time, Jeff, because  I think there was a time when I said to you, oh, it's no problem.  Just, you know, just switch from the drop down.  That's actually a problem  pretty regularly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The other one that gets me is if you have a Google  Plus link  in something,  right, and I click on it, it  goes to my machine account  versus my Plus  account, and I can't open it  in my Plus account. I just can't  comment on it, I can't do anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  listening, Google? Are you  listening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Alright, so a few more  updates. I want to talk about Chrome apps. A couple  of Android app updates. Google  started rolling out Play Music  5.2, which has two  cool new features. Genre Radio  for all access subscribers. So if you subscribe  to All Access, you can  go into, let's see,  you can go into Radio or Explore,  you pick your favorite genre, and you  get unlimited music based on what  you chose. And the new app for  Android also has a new download  queue. So when you're pinning  music or downloading music for offline  access, you can pause  and resume and prioritize and  manage your download queue easily  there.  Another Android app update.  Google Earth has been updated to version 7.1.2.  And it  now shows your  geo-encoded Google Plus photos  onto a map. So  you're geo-tagging your Google Plus photos and say you've got instant upload on,  you're automatically  sending pictures from your phone to Google Plus,  go into Google Earth  on Android, there's a new option  under More Maps, which is Google  Plus Photos, and Earth  will overlay the photos that you took  onto a Google Earth map, which is  kind of a really, really cool view.  If you spend a day out and about town taking  photos, you can see where you went  and you can see those photos kind of overlayed on the map.  It's really cool.  And finally, this is a topic I want to talk about more with you guys,  Google has announced  Google Chrome desktop apps.  This means that on  Windows and eventually Mac and other  platforms, you have  packaged Chrome apps that run  just like native apps.  Outside of  Chrome, but Chrome kind of acts as  the runtime. These are going to be apps that are available  in the Chrome Web Store, and  they will have  access to  native bits of your machine in order to act  just like a native app, but Chrome is  kind of the runtime, and  these are kind of rolling out over time.  And I want to talk about this more with you guys.  I'm kind of excited about  this is really Chrome sort of becoming more  of a platform, kind of like Android is,  not just on the Chromebook, right, but  on every operating system, this will spread to all  platforms. So that's all  I got. That's all I got for the changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Play the drums.  Thank you,  changelog. So Jeff, I just tried it  in my WordPress, and it worked fine.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just posting the whole thing in there?  Yeah. Oh!

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just paste it right in there.  Now make sure you're not, make sure you're  pasting as HTML,  that you're in the, you know,  you wouldn't, of course, of course.  Geez. So let me just,  so I just paste, this is the code  straight out of the embed. Let me do  a quick preview here on my  WordPress.  Post, add new.  Actually, let me just publish it.  Testing for  Twitter. Let's visit the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  post. Just testing  Hey,  No Nevermore. There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There it is? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I post it. Okay, now I'm going to publish.  If you go to BuzzMachine.com right now,  you'll see the fruits of what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love that  we're live, that we're live blogging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me see. BuzzMachine.com.  Clever way to get  traffic. What does it say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It worked. Just testing, paint on nevermind.  And there it is.  Jeff, you were just impatient. It's not working for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, works for us.  Hold on.  Let me go.  Now I'm really confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It does take a minute to load it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know why? Because I've got it. Oh, there it is.  It took forever.  Alright, I take it back.  Nevermind.  It takes forever. Well, then Google should really take those

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  instructions out. The whole Jimmy Jam  about the head or the protocols.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a little confusing, isn't it?  I was too heisty.  I waited before.  And I didn't get it.  It takes a while to load.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I think that's what the Jimmy Jam is probably about.  That if it's in your header,  that script will preload.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It'll be faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Alright, Google, I'm sorry, but I still want you to fix  multiple sign-in problems.  I take it back.  Phew. Glad we solved that.  All is not forgiven. I'm sorry.  So let's talk about this whole

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  thing. This applet thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Applets. Wow.  That's a throwback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're not calling it applets? Because that's what they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, they're calling their Chrome apps

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  for your desktop.  Yeah, but you have to have Chrome installed, right?  You have to have Chrome installed. You obtain these from the  Chrome Web Store. They only run  they have some Chrome specific code, right?  So you've got to have Chrome installed, right?  This doesn't work with any other browser.  And they don't run inside the browser.  They run, they have shortcuts on your desktop.  We were talking about this last night  on All About Android.  They're almost like, remember Air apps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, Adobe Air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like the runtime, right?  Well, that's why I call them applets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Applets was originally for Java.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For Java. You'd have to have a runtime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They ran

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  app, they ran kind of in-page though.  Or I guess you could have desktop Java.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can have applets, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So these apps, these  Chrome apps for your desktop have  native access to device hardware.  Like the webcam, the microphone, they work  offline, they support notifications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, Google. Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is such a security issue.  Oh, is it?  Is it? Yeah.  If they're not sandboxed, oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If they're not sandboxed and that they can  you mean that the access... They have hardware access

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and they're not sandboxed.  I mean, I guess that it's no different than Chrome  itself, but at least Google controls the code  on Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Chrome OS has, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What can you, can you  only use HTML5 commands? Can you use...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I believe that these apps  are built with web technologies. I think that just like  other Chrome apps,  but they must have extended, I mean  there has to be... I could just see the headlines  in about two years. Extended technologies  that let you access sort of native.  This is really interesting. Explain that to me, Leo.  Well, you

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  never want arbitrary code from the web  running on your machine, ever.  When you're running an  application from Google, you're trusting Google.  Extensions are  potentially problems in general.  But when the extensions run outside  of the browser, I mean at least, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they sandbox the... Here's my question.  Do you have to have Chrome running to have the  applet run?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  No, but I'm pretty sure. I haven't tried  this. I don't have a Windows machine, but it's...  I would imagine there's a Chrome process  running, but you don't have the actual...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't it like just a  mini Chrome window?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The premise of Java when it came  out was that it would be  running a Java virtual machine. Every applet  would be sandboxed,  have very limited access to the hardware  resources through an API.  It would be secure. And of course we've learned  that without constant,  rigid attention  to the JVM,  which Oracle has not given Java,  it's a nightmare.  And I just... It concerns  me that you're running arbitrary code on your

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  machine. Is it possible, Leo, that this is  instead like just opening  up Chrome and opening up... Having a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  window. If it's a Chrome tab, no  problem, because they are sandboxed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just a different display of a tab. And I don't know.  That's what I assumed it was.  Because when they implemented it on the  Chromebook, Pixel, which is a  wonderful machine. Did I ever told you that recently?  Basically, it's like any other tab, it's just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But that's the Chromebook. This is  Windows 8. This is a little bit different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Understood. But  right now I'm talking to you on Hangouts.  I wasn't concerned until Gina said

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it could access files, it can run  the camera.  I let Adobe Air

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  do that. I left to something else.  And it's a huge security issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Yes, you do.  And it's a very big security issue.  Air is a real security

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  issue. No more than any other native app  that I install on my  Windows desktop. I mean, any native app has access to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The difference is, because  it's coming from... It's a conduit  to the Internet, which is the problem, right?  So native apps that don't interact with the  Internet are potentially a problem, but much less

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so. But every  native app these days has some sort of automatic update  that runs home, connects to the Internet, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean... Alright, never mind.  It's secure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If I'm going to trust anybody to create  a runtime for my computer,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it's... Does Google vet the  apps, the extensions? How much does Google vet  this? You have to get them through the Web Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I imagine that they do. And I imagine APIs  are pretty well defined. Good. That's probably

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  fine. This changes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  what Chrome is, dramatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that's the whole conversation. Is this  Google's style? Is this why Google  put so much attention on Chrome OS,  which was baffling all of us? It's a browser. It's a browser.  It's a browser. But what it really is  is a platform. It's an OS. It's an OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a runtime. An OS. A platform. Yeah.  Yeah. Is it?  Yeah. I mean, this brings Chrome a lot closer  to what Android is, right? This is where

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  you're going to have trouble, though, because, okay,  it's safe as long as it can't  do anything that Chrome can't do.  But if you're going to make  these standalone apps, then you want it to do more.  And that's where Java got into trouble, right?  Mm-hmm.  Is that, okay, well, now we're competing as an app.  Now we're an app.  Well, then you're going to have to be able to do some more stuff.  Right.  That's what concerns me.  Well, here's the other thing about it all.  If Google's making itself an operating system  vendor, then  there's all the woes that that is.  And the whole point of Chrome OS was  how secure it was because it's so limited, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the difference, I think, potentially,  potentially, architecturally,  is that Chrome is  always connected.  And so a lot of the functions that you worry about  are not going to happen on your machine. They're going to happen up  somewhere in the cloud. Right.  Versus those apps you talked about were  apps that were standalone  machine disconnected would work.  There's a lot on Chrome you cannot do. The only two things I can do  with disconnected on Chrome are  email and docs. That's it.  Right. Everything else requires connection.  The connection is the path to security,  I think.  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Connection is the path to security?  You could argue the opposite as well.  Well, no, this is the exact opposite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's why. Here's what I'm trying to say.  Because it's saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  server-side code  is safer. It's not using your machine.  And that may be true. Server-side code may be safer.  Maybe.  I'm speculating about the architecture.  Code is code.  If it has access to your hardware,  your local computer's hardware resources.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, Google  already puts out an operating system that natively  accesses your computers.  It just happens to be the smaller computers.  Android already does this.  What's interesting is that this brings Chrome and  Android so close together.  You can no longer say  that Android's operating system in Chrome is the browser.  Right.  This is a totally different thing.  Chrome has offline capabilities right now.  It has push notifications. It has a lot of these capabilities.  Granted, only a few  native Google apps take advantage  of these capabilities, but they're there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So is Google going after desktop  computing? What is the end game  here?  Some called it a  Trojan. The Verge called it Google's Trojan  Horse. How Google  will eventually take on Windows.  Is that really what they're looking for here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That they want to be  the operating system that runs all your computers.  They want to be the platform that runs all your computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That doesn't make sense because you still need to run on an OS.  I mean, even  Chrome runs on Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Yep.  I think that this is  a way for developers  to deliver. Yes, Jeff. You got Linux under there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but then why do I have to run a  store? I know, but why do I have to install Linux?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're installing an interface to it. You're just installing an interface to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, is that what it is? Because it's still calling on the same things.  It's the Linux kernel there.  Never mind. That was the stupid moment. Isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I may be wrong. I thought it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're trying to make the language  of developing all apps or native  desktop apps web technologies, which  many companies have tried  many times before.  They're trying to make Chrome the  platform for running these apps. They're trying to deliver  the original vision of Java,  which was, you know, this right one's run  anywhere. Right? If Chrome runs on  everything and I'm a developer and I  can make a native app that  runs the same way  and very well and behaves  like a native app in that it can access the webcam  and do notifications and, you know, it doesn't look  like a browser app, then I'm  going to choose to do that. And that just  means that Chrome gets installed everywhere,  which is only good for Google, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the app has to be updated  automatically.  There's no choice but to update Chrome. That's true too, which is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And that will happen through  the web store.  Sorry about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's what they say on the  packaged apps page.  What are packaged apps? Packaged apps deliver  an experience as capable as a  native app, but as safe as a web  page. By the way, this is exactly the come on of Java.  Just like web apps,  packaged apps are written in HTML5,  JavaScript, and CSS. But packaged apps  look and behave like native apps  and have native-like capabilities. They're much more  powerful than those available to web pages.  That's what concerns me. They're much more powerful  than those available to web  apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's just that's always

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the balance.  As long as it's just a web page,  but as soon as you give it hardware  access, then it's more like ActiveX.  And yeah, JavaScript isn't  inherently secure. It's just code.  Packaged apps load locally.  This allows the apps to be less dependent  on the network. Once a user installs an app,  they have full control over the app's life cycle. Apps  open and close quickly. The system can shut down  apps at any time to improve performance.  Users can fully uninstall apps.  They're modified web apps, same code,  frameworks, tools of the web platform.  Some browser features have been removed.  Other web APIs disabled  or changed to improve security and  programming practices.  You know, it's all in the implementation.  It's all in the  implementation. It could be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right now, to your consternation,  I'm talking to you from a  web page that is  attached to my hardware.  My camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're running code. I mean, come on, you're just running code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Web pages have a natural  there's very few things.  There are a lot of things you can't do when you write a web page.  Leo, you're saying that you don't like the idea  of the browser sandbox.  You're taking away the browser sandbox.  There are only certain things you can do. You can only access cookies  from the sites that you put them down.  You can only execute code that does certain things.  I mean, most browsers will just  prevent you from doing certain things.  Accessing the file system on their own  and that kind of thing. It's all in a sandbox.  Right. And this one has to take  that code out of that sandbox.  But hey, you know, this is the conversation we've been having, right?  There's always that trade-off  of security versus convenience.  I mean, these apps, it's just  it is all just code, right?  And this code is going to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the issue is how much  permission the code has to access  what hardware resources.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. What permissions model is like?  How that's implemented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who's responsible for it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and this is about Google. I mean, Google has a lot of experience with this, right?  With Android. I mean, Android has some of the  best permission modeling  out there.  As far as I'm concerned. You know, with Android,  they've got a lot of experience with this. They've got the Chrome OS  out already. So they're already running  Chrome as native. I know that's on top of Linux.  But still, Chrome OS  accesses the file system and the webcam  and all those things natively.  I don't know. I think this is an interesting  I think this is a really interesting proposal.  I wonder if Chrome apps are ever going to run on  Android.  Talk about that. Isn't that interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's an OS inside an OS.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  Yep. I wonder which operating  system is going to win in the end.  I mean, don't you feel like eventually  Google is going to have to choose between one or the other?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're Sundar Prachai,  what do you think the world looks like in three to five

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  years? Yeah, that's a big

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  question. Well, part of this  isn't this part of it because Google  has until recently felt like they've lost control  of Android. I think they've reasserted  it. I think with Jelly Bean,  Android now is  the best Android experience is the Google Android  experience. And I think people are going to realize  that. So, but  I think this might have been a defensive action  against what looked like was going to happen until recently,  which was that vendors  even like Samsung were just going to  take Android and say, thanks, Google. See you.  We'll create all our own apps. You don't need  the G apps anymore.  And we don't need to be tied to Google.  And they were going to lose control of Android.  And in that case, Chrome was their  defense.  But now  they're stuck because you know what?  Google is going to  keep Android because you know what? It's a great experience.  It's the best experience. Everybody agrees  the best Android experience is now the Google  experience. Yeah.  Maybe not in China, but in the US  anyway.  So the fact  that Amazon's Kindle uses Android, but  doesn't defer to Google  is no longer as much of a concern. I think  it was as it was to have been  until recently. Do you think they'll abandon  Android? Not as if it's a success and they're making  money on it. And they clearly are  making a lot of money on Android. Do they break  that down in the quarterly  results?  Do they say how much they make from Android? I bet they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think so.  That's interesting. It's got to be a profit

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  center for them. What's wrong?  If you're Google  and you're cocky, don't forget,  what's wrong with having two OSs?  Apple has two OSs?  Microsoft has two OSs? What's wrong  with that? You can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Page is so  focused.  He's all about focus these days.  I think there's tension.  There's tension in terms of resources, in terms of  vision, in terms of UX.  Page is all about converging those things  and cutting off other products  and having  a similar design vision across products.  I definitely think that there's a tension  inside Google between Android and Chrome,  which have both been runaway successes in very  different ways and both started out  in very different ways. Chrome starts out as a browser.  Android starts out as a mobile operating system.  Android was an acquisition.  Chrome was a web kit fork.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was WebKit, right?  It wasn't an in-house development.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Not a fork. I shouldn't say WebKit fork.  Well, now it's a fork.  Blink is a fork.  Both build on open-source  technologies. It's very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When they were separate  divisions under separate heads, I think  you could argue that there was creative tension at work.  Putting them both under Sundar, I've got to  guess his job is to figure out  which one wins. Really?  Why? Why choose?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's two stores. There's a Chrome Web Store.  There's a Play Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just finished saying Larry wants Unity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I didn't say  that. Gina did.  I don't know. I don't see why  you would kill one.  I don't want Chrome  OS on this. Not kill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But one has  a theoretical preeminence  that Android will run on Chrome  or Chrome will run on Android.  Right now, Chrome runs on Android.  Where are you rating apps  for in that world? Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'd feel safer with Android.  I would love to run, as I do with Bluestacks,  Android apps on my Chromebook.  I'd be very interested in that.  Wouldn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Chromecast is an Android build with Chrome on top.  Right?  It's both. It's kind of amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right.  Meanwhile,  there are, as of today, six new Chromebooks  and three new manufacturers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I hear that. HP is going to do a Chromebook.  So where do we find the list of all  the different new Chromebooks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't really say a lot about them, but they're all based on the Haswell.  That's very  good news, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a fast processor,  fourth generation processor.  Great power.  Great battery life, too.  The HP is  14 inches.  14 inch Chromebook, full size,  $299 from HP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't see the details.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And while  Android devices fly off the shelves,  I mean, are they actually, sorry, Jeff, are they selling  these Chromebooks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think they are. It's the number one  computer on Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't it?  Under 300 bucks, it's 25% of the market, and I'm  pretty sure my numbers are not screwed, and they're in  5,000 schools, which is  20% of the district.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a good choice for schools, I think. Very good choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Great choice for education, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think internationally,  once  connectivity is good in a country,  this shows you the way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's a 14 inch screen,  which is, this is the HP,  three USB 2 ports,  RJ45,  it's got  Ethernet.  Wow. You don't have that on a Macintosh.  I don't have it.  Headphone out, this is for schools,  clearly. Headphone out,  microphone in, HDMI,  card reader,  $299, and you get 100 gigs of  Google Drive with it.  Where is this? The odd player?  No, this is on HP's  site. HP?  Oh. Any of the others listed?  Well, I just looked for this one  first. Let's see, it's a, oh,  this is a Celeron. This is an 847  Celeron.  Well, that's the existing one.  This is not the new one. Okay.  So there are new ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The HP, that one's in the stores now.  A little clunky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I didn't know the HP made one. Alright.  HP, Acer, Asus,  Toshiba all announced  new Chromebooks.  Let's see.  Let's see, HP Chromebook  and the Acer  Chromebook are live now.  This is the HP, oh, it's pretty.  14 inch display.  0.81 inches thick.  Four pounds?  What the hell is in there?  Four pounds?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What?  That's four pounds?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does it have a price tag?  Doesn't look like it has a price yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a... Are you sure this is the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Asus one? This is the new one.  It's on Google's site.  And this is the Acer.  11 inch display.  Smaller display. 2.76 pounds.  That's more like it. 8.5 hours  of use. Samsung.  That's not new, right? That's the one we saw  before.  Unless they just swapped the chip.  Acer.  Four hours of battery. Forget about it.  That's the old one. These are the old ones.  I'm going back to the old ones now.  So...  This is the  new Acer.  11 inch display. 100 gigs  Google Drive. 8.5 hours. I like the battery life.  These must be as well considering the battery life.  They've doubled the battery life  on some of these.  That's pretty. Colorful.  This is...  See, it's for kids.  They love the color.  They love the color.  You know, I think every  school... This is what school should be using.  Not an iPad. Not Windows.  Not a MacBook Air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait. Let's play back  the tape when I made fun  of the LA school system getting  iPads. I did too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yes.  You don't mistake me for thinking  that was a good $30 million deal.  That was terrible. And they bought it with a bond.  A 30 year bond.  They'll be paying for iPads. I think you still may have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  been baiting me about the Chromebook though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, no. I think the Chromebook's good for education.  I've never... I've always thought it...  It's good in limited environments like education.  A business where the IT department  doesn't want to mess with it.  I don't think they're good for anybody  as a home computer.  But I think this is great for schools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's nice to see schools come around  from installing NetNanny and limiting  access to the internet to buying a computer that's based  on a browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm on the education Chromebook  Google group and it's hilarious to see  what the IT guys will do to  or the security guys will do to  the poor person who's implementing Chromebooks.  Really? Oh no.  Oh yes. Stupid stuff.  Oh what about this? What about that? No, no. That's Windows machines you have to worry about.  This is different. It's a browser.  And the need  for Google to help them  educate their colleagues  is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  HP is going to be $299 available in  white, turquoise and peach.  Unfortunately a low res  14 inch screen. 1366 by 768.  That's a little bit disappointing. 16 gigs  of storage.  And of course it's not touch.  I still am looking for something somewhere  in between this and the Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, that's what's needed. Yes, that's absolutely what's needed.  How much  does it add in expense to do  a touch screen? Oh a lot I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a $500.  We don't see any  sub $500 touch screens I don't think.  Unless I'm missing something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the cheapest 10 inch  tablet though?  Oh gosh, there's lots of cheaper ones.  That's what I'm saying. If you can do a  tablet at a low price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  $20 to add a  touch screen to a laptop  says MavHC in the chat room.  Alright, let's move on.  Motorola says  they're shipping 100,000, I'm sorry  Moto X phones from Texas.  Because one came back from Jeff.  That seems like a decent  amount.  Not huge. I would say that's probably  Motorola considers as  success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Back to Apple for one quick second.  Do you think that there are going to be lines at the  store for Apple or are we over that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a good question actually. Because Apple did  something which I cannot think of why they did it  except to encourage lines.  They allow you to preorder the 5C  on the 13th for delivery on the  20th. They do not allow you to preorder  the 5S. You have to go to a  store to get it if you want to get it on the 20th.  Is that, I mean there can't be any  reason for that except we want a line.  Give it up. Which sucks.  It does. That's like  oh yeah we're going to sacrifice our customers  for better marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That sucks. They just want to get you in the  they want to get the folks who are willing to spend a lot  more money for the 5S, the  the grown ups with  a little extra cash, the people who are really hardcore  want the powerful device. They want them in the  door so they buy some more stuff.  But yeah I agree. No. That sucks. That's a really line thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  As somebody who for the  I waited in line for the first two but as somebody  who in the last couple of  years has just preordered it the week before  and it comes on that day and that's beautiful.  I don't have to get up out of my seat.  I think to screw your  customers so that you get better  coverage in the local news at 6 o'clock  is stupid.  That's very frustrating. And it's not supply  constraints. I don't see how making people come  to the store has anything to do with that.  I think you're right Gina. It's the lines  but it's also getting people in the store so that they buy the case  and they buy a cable.  And oh let's get an iMac while we're  here. They're so pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pick up an Air. Oh I've been meaning to look at these  minis. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's spend $23,000.  Yeah.  I just think that's disappointing.  Unless I'm missing something and there's  some reason why this makes sense.  It sounds to me like pure marketing and that's sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder too about  the plans. They put up a list of all the  plans for the iPhones and there's  a ridiculous one. I think it's  AT&T has like a $500  a month plan. You don't even get  unlimited data. What do you get?  You get unlimited phone  messages and you  get 50 gigs  of data. Now I  pay, though this was a whole  other rant,  when I switched phones back and forth. I go  to the A&T store  to say I need to switch  this device. I have an unlimited  plan. Don't F with my unlimited  plan. Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no problem.  Mook you Mook.  Hey no problem. We could do whatever  you want. So guess what? Of course  I get a message at one in the morning. You're  out of data you fool. You have no plan.  And I you know I  I'm psychotic enough this this keeps me up.  I go to Twitter. I go all over  it's Friday  night. I got other stuff going  on. I spent  39 minutes on the phone  with them to get it switched and they told  me it was going to take 21 days to switch  it. It did happen the next day  because I suspect somebody on Twitter looked like oh  yeah he's ranting again. Could  get him this time. Anyway  sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's funny. T-Mobile looks better and better.  I love T-Mobile. Go to T-Mobile  on your Nexus 5.  Plus one.  Plus one.  Is that the new thing that we're all doing?  Plus one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The iOS 7 release is actually a really  big deal for developers. This is the week where developers  are scrambling to get their

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  apps to work. You got one week  to get your  your act together there. Yeah I mean my

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  app is a very standard list.  We're not doing anything too crazy. We're not doing anything too custom.  But it looks totally different. iOS 7 and we definitely  had to make some changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Color Gina. Color. Do they give you a palette  that says this is the color palette?  Or how does that work? We use

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the standard UI views with the standard and the default  colors. So like the  gray chrome is now just flat  white and the button labels  are just changed into the  it just changes to that  to the default. Whatever the default  colors are. And I didn't really look  beyond that.  There's got to be a way to customize  choose your own colors. If your app has its own  palette or has its own styles.  We were just using the default. But if you're using any of the default  Apple styles for your  settings area or anything  those look pretty different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would stick with the default  because you don't want to pick a color  that clashes or something.  If people are buying iOS  7 you want to look like iOS 7.  You don't want to be the center.  Oh no I want everything to be  skeuomorphic.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't you love it that as Apple is  abandoning all leather and stitching the  Galaxy Note 3 has a stitched  pleather back?  Yeah. Something for everyone.  We're all about choice  here at Samsung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Speaking of Samsung I went to an event  in New York this week. They're opening a new incubator  in New York.  Old friend of mine, you'd put your pen and chart on and start  in a company there. It was neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  An incubator for  mobile focused companies?  No. Not at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  New companies. They did have a developer  conference or have they had that yet?  I don't think they've had it yet.  I guess it's October. They did announce a developer conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What did you guys think  about the new Yahoo logo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have to give  props  to Marissa Meyer's geeky  blog post.  But Renee Richie  who was a designer in an earlier life  said, are you  kidding? Corel draw bezels?  This is the best Marissa could  come up with.  They had an intern.  Rex our intern did a video.  This is  I've got to read  the pros in this.  I admire Marissa Meyer.  I don't  want to make fun of her.  But

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I really like that she thanked her  intern. But this did feel very much  like a case of you  don't know what you don't know.  Yeah. You know. So one weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is what she wrote. So one weekend this summer  I rolled up my sleeves and dove  into the trenches with our logo design  team. Bob and Mark and Russ  and our intern Max. We  spent the majority of Saturday and Sunday designing  the logo. We spent the whole weekend  from start to finish and we had a ton  of fun weighing every minute  detail.  You

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  don't want the logo to be a thing you do  over the weekend. Over the summer.  Over the summer. I can't believe she realized it sounded  so trivialized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I just I mean the designer folks in my  circle of friends were just absolutely  appalled. All the designer hate

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  designers hate it. For instance  this is an example  that Renee I'm not a designer. I don't know.  It looks good to me. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm a mocha. I don't love the bezel. But yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. The bezel is dumb.  So apparently

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the typography doesn't offend me but the bezel is bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But well the designers were totally  offended by the typography  because  they wanted mathematically  all the letters to be the right  you know a programmer would say  yeah they didn't do any kerning.  The typographer  wants kerning. The programmer in them wants  them to be uniform. And that's not how  you do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what the millions of users out there  couldn't give a crap. I know it's just

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  they don't even notice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This does kind of harken back to  that post from a designer who  was at Google who said that Google would test  every shade of blue  that it was a data decision. That was Marissa.  A data driven decision. It wasn't about design.  And yeah Meyer brought  that I think a little bit to  this logo design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And here you go. Our last move.  We decided to tilt the exclamation point  by nine degrees just to  add a bit of whimsy.  Oh lord.  Well you're right. It doesn't really matter.  Go ahead Marissa. You're doing so many good  things for Yahoo.  I really like the new Yahoo weather app.  And so  you know we'll forgive her playing around  a little bit with the typography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah I mean you know  she's making the company her own. That's good.  Wish she had gotten rid of the exclamation point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apparently that wasn't on the table.  That was not on the table.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know. I'm not a designer.  Renee who is there to go. There's a little  tilt. Renee who is  a designer said it's horrendous.  But designers are given to hyperbole  when it comes to design right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm a curn freak.  The kerning between the y and the a is  a little bit wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The kerning's wrong. Kerning's done by  a non-typographer.  Alright I think we should do one more  ad and then come back with our tip tool number  of the week. Jeff you'll find a number. I see numbers  all over the... I've got them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  week. A tool that I've started using  in artist. It's called Draft.  I've got a Draftin.com  This is a really really cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  web app that's basically like  github for writers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's a place  that you can write a tweet or a blog  post or an email.  And then you can send it to say  I can send it to you Leo.

And he's a really really thoughtful  guy who just thinks that  writing better  changes the world which I agree  and has been you know  making making this app really for himself.  So to encourage more people to write more often  and he's really done a nice job with it. So  check it out if you're looking for a writing tool  I'm actually using it to write some  I'm going to relaunch my blog and I'm using it to  write and think about edit and collaborate on  some posts I'm working on. And I've just been really  really loving it. So check it out. It's free to  try and then you can  it's like three bucks a month if you want to support the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  on it. You know Amber and I were going to write a book we never did  but I set up SVN to keep  it was like a pain in the ass. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Totally totally crazy. Yeah. But the idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  of using versioning for  text is a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. I wonder  possibly. You know editorially just launched  I believe it's a similar thing. I haven't had a chance

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to try it but medium it's  kind of neat to see. Well especially for  someone who loved wave and I mean wave was about  collaborating on  but didn't didn't do  it as simply and as easily  as this. I think that there's  definitely a market here and I  just think Microsoft Word track changes  doesn't do it. GitHub version control  doesn't quite do it version control great for code  not as good not as easy for pros.  I think there's definitely a need  here. And yeah I'm  trying to it's helping me write more.  I find that I write more when I have tools that I really  enjoy using and so that alone  you know it's been worth it. Medium has a kind of a similar  thing right. It's composed feature is so  nice and so slick that it makes you want to write  right well and so I've had the same experience
