It's time for Twig this week in Google, the show where we cover the latest, but not just from Google, from the cloud, from social media, Facebook and Twitter.  Joining us from Ars Technica, Ron Amadio. He's the Android guy over there. Great to have you joining us, Ron. We love having you on.  Great to be here. Thanks.  And Mike Elgin is also here, sitting next to me from Tech News Today. Jeff Jarvis has the week off. He's actually traveling for the next two weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For a change, he decided to travel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no. He just, for some reason, usually when he travels, like last week we were able to get him on from wherever he was, but I guess he's in the air or something like that this week.  Gina Trapani will be with us next week filling in for Mr. Jarvis.  Sweet.  Yay! So it's not Crandroid. We got all head up. Hiroshi Lockheimer says, no, no, we're not getting rid of...  Well, actually though, if you compare what Lockheimer said to the original Wall Street Journal story, it's pretty much the same.  Yeah.  So it's not like, it was kind of a non-denial denial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Before we wind up, Ron, and turn him loose on this topic, I have a prepared statement, which is that I'm really confused about what this is going to look like.  The combined, or they basically, Google gently hinted that there would be the best of Chrome OS and Android would be combined into a new operating system.  I don't know what that means. Ron, what could that possibly, like what does Android need that Chrome OS has and vice versa?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the biggest thing that the report said is that Android is going to run on PCs now.  And I think that's probably the most important thing here.  Like a lot of people have been worried, like, oh, what's going to happen to Chrome OS?  And it's like, Chrome OS is going to hang around.  Like the Wall Street Journal report says right in it that Chrome OS will remain an open source operating system and that other companies can use to make laptops and Google engineers will continue maintaining it.  However, Google's focus will be on extending Android to run on laptops.  That's from the Wall Street Journal report.  So it jives with what Google is saying.  But I think Chrome OS will end up being like the old operating system from Google and it'll it'll hang around and get security updates.  But all the feature stuff is all the exciting things will come from this this merged operating system.  And I think so.  Android would need a completely new interface.  The what's there right now for tablets is horrible with a mouse and keyboard.  There's been a few like janky Android laptops you can buy.  I think the HP Slatebook 14 or something was was one of the latest ones.  You'll need a whole new interface.  You'll need like a windowing support.  So you know you can have apps on top of apps and all that stuff.  Third parties are going to need to make desktop apps, which is going to be super hard because they can't even get third parties to make tablet apps or Google to make tablet apps or that matter.  And it's that's like the exciting thing.  There's going to be so much that's going to need to change about Android.  And if you look at the time frame they gave on this, they said it started two years ago and won't be out until 2017.  So this is going to end up being like a three to four year project inside of Google, which sounds like a really big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a couple of theories about this.  And actually I was going to try to show you and I will show you a little later on the AMI version of Android running on Windows, which is really full Android.  It pretty much works just like Android.  And it's not a great experience because it's on a giant screen.  Clearly a lot has to be done.  I can't show you right now that surface book is locked up.  Oh, gotcha.  But but I will show you.  No, you know what?  This this is a great laptop.  This Windows laptop.  But the problem is if you do what I did, which is before I logged in, I tried to remove the screen and it just now it's completely confused.  Doesn't know where it's getting its input from.  It doesn't know what's going on.  I can't I can't do anything.  I can't even type anyway.  Anyway, so I'll reset it.  It's not you know what?  This is actually the whole class of problems that come with this.  You see, it's not accepting input happened because of the detachment.  You know, if they didn't detach, then but it gets confused.  The GP, the window, the video driver crashes.  The keyboard is apparently stopped working.  The mouse is funky.  And all of that because I think it's just it's a hard hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The user needs a certain level of detachment to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, because you just don't do what I just did, which was detach it before I'd fully logged in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're detaching it wrong.  I'm detaching it wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I attached it prematurely.  So we'll just put that away and let it think for a while.  But it was but I've been using I use it all last night.  Android on Windows.  And it's not a great experience because it's just not designed for a large.  And you know, it's just it feels weird.  And I really would be sad.  And I think you agree with me.  If Chromebook went away, I think Chromebook is awesome.  I would be super sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're using one.  I'm using one here.  And of course, the touch screen versions of the implementation of Chrome OS, like the Chrome bases and the Chromebooks and so on.  That's a terrible implementation.  Implementation to my touch pixel, though.  Well, but it's the interface is not designed for it.  So you're poking at file menus and then it's dropping down.  And it's kind of a workaround.  That's why I agree with you completely.  I would like to see the Chrome OS continue ad infinitum.  And I in fact, I think Google would be crazy and they seem to agree to kill it because, of course, they're killing it in education.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're just well, that's one of the questions that I have about what Lockheimer said, which is, is that just really to preserve another year of sales for Chromebooks?  And is that where is that really Google's strategy?  I mean, it would be a mistake for at this point for Google to say, oh, yeah, two years, no more Chromebooks, because like you say, this is a big business for them now, especially in schools and as it should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I can argue it both ways.  So here's the argument in favor of killing Chrome OS.  Lately, you may have noticed that Google is really emphasizing the products and services that they have that have massive scale.  And so have they been acquiring things?  No, there was a while where they were acquiring a company a week.  Right.  And when was their last acquisition?  They're really slowing down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was the slowest year since 2009, I think, for acquisitions.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they seem to be just really phasing out all the small things and doubling down on the big things.  And here they have two operating systems.  One is the biggest operating system in the history of mankind.  And the other one's, you know, pretty tiny by big operating system standards in terms of numbers.  And so there's an argument to be said that says, OK, let's just double down on the gigantic one and make it even more gigantic.  Now, here's the argument in the other direction.  There's no downside to them getting everybody using the Chrome OS, Chrome plugins.  It gets people on the Internet.  It's very secure.  It's great for implementing at scale.  You can essentially manage a huge number of Chromebooks centrally.  So it's a very appealing solution for lots and lots of people.  And there's just no reason for them to kill it.  They can go ahead and integrate elements of Chrome OS into Android without touching.  You know, that should have no impact on the existing base of Chrome OS users.  So it's really hard to tell.  I think that they're playing it straight.  I think they're going to continue Chrome OS.  And I don't think that's just wishful thinking on my part.  I think they're actually going to keep Chrome OS going and definitely keep trying to grow it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Ron, what's weird to me is the Wall Street Journal quote is we're going to fold Chrome OS into Android, which from a market point of view makes sense.  You take the little one, you fold into the big one.  But from a user point of view makes less sense.  I wouldn't mind seeing.  In fact, I would like I would welcome a Chromebook with the ability to run Android apps.  And that's something we know Google is working on publicly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's in beta.  I think this report kind of says that they're going to go in the complete opposite direction.  That was Android apps on top of Chrome OS, like using Chrome OS as a base.  This report says they're going to start using Android as a base.  And it makes sense, I think, because that's like Mike said, they want to do the scale thing.  And Android is definitely not a worthy replacement for Chrome OS today.  But I think because it's you have to keep in mind that because it's a three to four year project, you're going to see Android change a whole lot in order to to take over this this PC spot.  And, you know, Chrome OS will stick around, but this is going to put Android directly in competition with Chrome OS.  I don't see.  I think it'll be a lot like when Windows when Microsoft comes out with a new version of Windows, you know, like Windows seven and eight are still for sale today.  But so is Windows 10.  And nobody like you can go out and buy seven and eight, but they're not the future like the future for Microsoft is Windows 10.  And I think when this hybrid OS comes out, you'll you'll be able to get the older stuff, but they won't be the future.  All the all the development is going to happen on on this new version, which which makes total sense.  I think a big part of it besides scale is they want to get Google Play on every device imaginable because that is that's become like a core strength of Google, where they have all these developers and all these apps and all of these development tools specifically for Android.  And the Google Play ecosystem and Chrome OS does not integrate with any of that at all.  Really, I wouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I think the problem is we're kind of thinking of a computer running Android as we know it today.  I don't think that's really what we're talking about.  I mean, certainly how many Chrome extensions are there?  Hundreds thousands maybe.  Yeah.  How many Android apps are there?  A million.  Yeah.  Including Chrome.  So if you if you took a couple of things I really like about Chrome OS, the security of the platform is huge and it's very different from the security of Android.  It's a very different kind of platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And in fact, I've said much to the chagrin of some Android fans that I think that pretty much Chrome OS is probably the most secure, easily significant operating system.  And Android is easily arguably the least.  A Cambridge study a couple of weeks ago found that 87.7 percent of Android implementations are currently running one of 11 known massive security vulnerabilities.  It's a big, big problem.  And it's associated with the fact that the OEMs that make the phones are in charge of the updates, essentially.  And they they they range from Google itself for the Nexus phones, which is the best but not even that.  They're not super great compared to say iOS to who knows there are a thousand companies that make Android phones.  And most of them are in China.  But but you know, the average Android phone is incredibly insecure.  And so I don't know how you marry the two unless you basically have Android apps running on Chrome OS.  Then you'd have a secure.  But then I don't know what that is.  I can't picture that.  Again, it sounds like that's not what they're.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or or you you rebuild Android from the ground up with Chrome in mind.  That's what I kind of hope comes out of this is because Google knows obviously everybody knows Google.  One of Android's biggest enemies right now is the fractured update system and the state of updates across multiple devices.  The way Android is designed right now, that is incredibly difficult to do.  And then you bring in the carriers into into the whole scene and then it becomes even more complicated.  If Google focuses on rebuilding Android from the ground up, integrating the things that work for Chrome, which, by the way, has an amazing update strategy.  And they're able to execute on that the way that they should be with Android.  Then maybe they solve some of the underlying issues in the US along the way and make it so that, you know, aside from any of those other roadblocks and interferences,  they can still update things like security and just the OS in general without having to bring other parties into the situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So would this future Android be a cloud only product?  That would be really interesting.  That would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, I think I think if you're if you're going to do this this big change with Android and Chrome OS, I think like Jason said, you do take the opportunity to say,  let's do this right and let's do a ground up rethink of the operating system.  I think the thing that would fix the most problems is if they defined some kind of platform on ARM chips like an analog to a PC BIOS, where it's like there's this there's this layer of there's this layer that makes the hardware communicate with the software.  And it's super basic.  And the hardware makers write to this and and Google will write to this and then everything can talk to everything else like just like the way the PC BIOS works.  I mean, on that you can take windows and install it on pretty much anything or without an operating system at all.  You'll still be able to do input and get a picture on there and all that stuff so that you can like install an operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and Android is best suited to that because it's running on the Java virtual machine, which is already ported to every possible hardware platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, Microsoft did this with Windows Mobile.  They they kind of defined a platform and said everybody has to write for this and arms kind of making like a BIOS style thing for arm server chips.  And you've got to hope that by the time 2017 rolls around, they've they've brought this back down to phones and and everybody can kind of write to that.  And then I think the other big problem is the ecosystem partners more than anything.  And I think when you do this big merge, you say, hey, these are the new rules now and this is kind of a new product.  And we're kind of starting over with with what you guys think you can do.  And we need to be in charge of updates.  Now Google has to say that we're in charge of updates now.  And and maybe they could make some kind of skin system for OEMs to use that doesn't touch the base operating system.  But I really think they need to just rethink things from the ground up because everybody has to do that at some point.  We saw Windows do it with XP when they when they dumped Windows 98 or the MS-DOS base like 9x code base for for XP.  And Apple did it with OS 10 when they switched to a UNIX operating system.  And it's every operating system has to do this at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I see the world's biggest Android device.  I detached.  Now this is the other the other.  This is the surface book and I detached the screen so it is more a little bit more like Android.  It's running the launcher that I use, which is Nova launcher.  I maybe doesn't like the vertical orientation.  Oh, yeah, I guess it was about to do that.  Hold on a second.  This is running an emulation, by the way.  This is well, no, but no, no, that's that's how the AMI I believe that's how the AMI Android works.  But it's but this is Android.  Palpably Android, you can see the widgets are swamped by the screen size and and so forth.  You know, it's really great icons are tiny.  Yeah. And that's why the pen is really helpful.  I mean, all of that you could fix.  That's just because this is a pure port of AOSP Android.  You even have to go out and get the Google services in the apps.  It's great for us gaming.  Yeah, this is awesome, especially because game developers have to develop for an environment where you don't know what the resolution is going to be.  And it could be as high as three thousand by two thousand.  So so that's that's this is developed for that.  And it actually works fairly well.  You see a little hesitation in the in the graphics display.  But but not not a whole lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The sound knowing that that's like a three K screen is very impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, they're pushing a lot of pixels on here.  And as I said, in emulation, this is not going directly to the X eighty six architecture.  By the way, ARM versus X eighty six.  The nice thing, both Chromebooks and Android can run on both.  So I don't think that's an issue.  I wonder if there are issues with AOSP with the open source.  It certainly would help Google to be able to get away from that.  Right. Yes.  That's that's the problem with updating is that anybody can develop a quote Android version.  I think you abandon the Android.  You might even abandon the Android trademark for that reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had heard internally the code name for this was Google OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that makes more sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it would it would be cool.  I mean, I don't know if they want to rebrand and lose, you know, all the cute little Android figures and all that.  But I think if you did some kind of rebrand like that, you could definitely go to partners and say, hey, those were the Android rules.  And these are the Google OS rules and the Google OS rules say you don't get to mess with anything.  And and we're going to do updates because every new Google platform is like that.  Even the new Android platforms are like that.  You know, OEMs can't mess with Google TV or I mean, they can't mess with Android TV or Android Wear or Android Auto.  All of that.  The interface is off limits and you've got to run it and just build some hardware and you can preload apps on it.  But that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look how good that looks.  I mean, that looks great.  Yeah, that's pretty impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what you're describing, Ron, of course, the OEMs don't like that, but users do.  Users love vanilla Android.  Tend to be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they they started that to spur adoption.  And at this point, the the mobile OS duopoly is so strong that Google could do whatever they wanted and no one can say no to them because there is no alternative.  It's not like you can go license iOS.  And if it's not iOS or Android, nobody's got to want it.  Like even Blackberry has fallen at this point.  Yeah.  And there I mentioned that because their phone's coming out next week.  I think.  Oh, yeah.  The Priv Priv.  Yeah.  Or the Perth.  What a terrible name.  It's a Prive.  Yeah.  But hey, the name is dumb, but I'm super excited about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at this is Google Plus looks like Pinterest when you screen that big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's that's your standard awful tablet interface for Android.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah, that's the problem, right?  It's not on a big screen.  You get nobody.  Nobody.  As you said at the very beginning, Ron, even Google doesn't support this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, Android supports like you said, it supports x86 and arm.  So that's good for PCs.  It supports mouse and keyboard and gamepad.  Like you can take USB stuff and plug it into Android and Android will figure it out and work and you'll get a mouse cursor.  It's really impressive, actually.  They're just going to need a whole new interface and all new apps.  There's actually a thing called remix.  Is it remix OS that takes Android and kind of turns it into a desktop operating system?  It's a it's a third party project.  But the interface is interesting.  It kind of shows you what a windowed version of Android would look like.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that remix OS is at jied.com.  J I D E dot com.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So what if so what so Chrome OS is this right?  It's Chrome.  Yeah.  So it's Chrome running on Android.  But and you can't do most Chrome extensions on the Android version of Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No extensions at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what if you could?  How would that be significantly different?  I mean, then now you have windowed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you don't really have a windowed experience in Android at the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unless you had a Chrome extension that gave it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, but wasn't windowing in.  I mean, didn't we see it in some code?  Oh, you're talking about multi-screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they had a beta version of it.  They just didn't implement it, right?  But that was a that was really not appropriate for a mouse and keyboard.  That was kind of like what's on iOS where you can or windows the tablet version of windows.  You know, you can drag apps to the side of the screen and it'll lock to its split screen.  It's not windowed.  There's a big difference.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Although that's the new thing, by the way, is not so funny because it brings back the debate that happened in the very earliest days of graphical user interfaces.  Should we be tiled or should we be overlapping windows?  And there was really like battle to the death.  Yeah.  And overlapping windows, obviously one.  Yep.  And I feel like tiled is coming back.  Both iOS and the iPad Pro is doing tiled.  You're seeing tiled in an OS 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really?  If you do that split screen thing, it's really Windows has it with the snap.  Well, snap will see I like snap because that does or whatever the thing is on desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not overlapping, though, even though you can resize it.  It's still not overlapping.  And that's the key.  That's tiled versus overlapping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think what's really changed is you can't assume that anybody has a mouse anymore.  Right.  They may have a touch pad.  They may not have a touch pad.  They may be on a touch interface.  You don't know what people are using, but you can't say, oh, they're going to have a mouse.  Right.  And I think that's great.  I think the mouse is kind of from the 60s.  It's kind of over.  And I think we should move on and have interfaces that invite touch and voice and things like that.  Hybrid interfaces.  And I think that could be part of what Google's thinking about this ground up reorientation.  Enough of the icons and the trash cans and that whole metaphor, the WIMP user interface is 37, six years old, something like that.  I think I'd like to see us just completely go entirely into the post PC interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say as bad as this is just because there was no consideration given to a giant screen like this, it's still better than the touch interface on Windows.  That's actually is a kind of a more sensible.  This is Flipboard, the Android version running on a Windows machine.  And it actually if you if you do touch first, I think you get some some benefits that you don't get if you take a desktop OS and you add touch to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know, though, if you if you want to get work done, you I think you pretty much need a mouse.  Just stuff like text selection is impossible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why I love the surface book, because it's it's it is the best of both worlds.  So I can reattach this and it becomes a mousing operating system.  And I mean, I think that's kind of you know, I got a trackpad, I got a desktop and I think the flexibility is appealing and the and the pen and everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Could we see a world where the Chrome OS and Android combination is something similar to that, where when you're in device mode, you're running an Android, which it's kind of native to.  And then you pop it into the keyboard and boom, you're in Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I could imagine like a continuum style.  Yeah, sure. But I don't think it'll be Chrome OS.  I think it'll just be big Android and little Android.  Like what you see on an Asus pad phone or whatever.  But but good.  Right. I think one of the more interesting angles is what Google will do when it has to build.  If it does this Android on PC thing, it's going to have to build a bunch of like PC desktop apps.  And Google has never really done that in its history.  They've they've always kind of said, oh, just go to this website on the Internet.  And and now they're going to have to have you're going to have like a desktop version of Gmail and a desktop version of Google Calendar and all this other stuff.  That's less than ideal, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  From Google's point of view, because if you're in the cloud, they have access to all your data.  I mean, don't they want you to be don't they?  Well, it'll be just like Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It'll be just like Android, where there's an app that that syncs everything to the cloud.  And it's just because the interface is there and you don't have to have, you know, browser Chrome and all this other stuff.  You it's a lot more powerful.  But unlike mobile Google, it seems weird to say like Google might abandon the Web, but the mobile Web where they have mobile apps for a lot of things.  That's absolutely the case.  Like you go to a mobile browser and try to go to Gmail or Google Calendar and you'll get like this super old version that's like two or three major redesigns old.  And some some of these things, Google Music and Hangouts, there's just no mobile website at all.  And it's just like go to the Play Store.  And you wonder what their Internet what their their Web selection will be like when they have to make all of these desktop programs.  Do they say like, will the desktop Gmail app be the best version of Gmail then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. I personally tend to avoid desktop apps.  I use a number of different devices, but my main device is is a MacBook Pro.  And, you know, for stuff like Slack and all the social networks and lots and lots of things that have desktop apps for OS 10, I just use the browser version.  I do it all in browser.  I try not to install anything.  And I just you know, the the the Chrome OS is what made me love that idea.  I agree.  And it's just so reassuring to know that no matter what device I go on, whatever I was doing, I can do it in just the same way on the new device.  I don't think, oh, I didn't install the so-and-so app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Come down to how smart Google is.  They they're in a great position because they have set the time frame as to be a couple of years.  And they have the opportunity, having learned a lot now from Chrome OS and from Android to and I hope that they do this to do something from the ground up that makes sense in the modern context.  That's the thing that Microsoft really couldn't do.  They did reinvent Windows, but they can't go from the ground up.  They've got all this legacy.  I think my Apple's in the same situation with OS 10 and iOS.  They're really I think even at least Microsoft was willing to take a chance.  They're really reluctant at this point.  They've got a problem.  They know they have a problem because usage is changing and how people think of computing is changing.  Google probably is in the best.  I would submit.  What do you think?  In the best position right now to do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, when you look at what they did with with OS 10 and like Windows XP, it was they didn't abandon their legacy.  Mostly they emulated it.  I'm hoping Google will be willing to do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a third thing is what I'm saying.  Do they think they'll have the guts to do that?  Start from I think start from the say this is what we've learned with Android.  This is what we've learned with Chrome OS.  Now let's start from the ground up thinking about how usage patterns are going to change over the next 10 years to make a modern OS.  Boy, I'd love to see that.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's still going to be pitched as the new version of Android, regardless of how much the core changes.  Maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't Android polluted by the fact that the AOSP and the and the name Android is used in a non-Google context by people like Amazon and and cheap handset makers all over the world?  That's polluted the Android name.  Stage fright has polluted the Android name.  Maybe this is an opportunity.  I would expect Google to say yes, like a rebrand.  But not just a rebrand.  Yeah, we're going to maintain AOSP, the open source Android handset.  And we've got this new operating system that we control that we update that works on all your devices and works has in a modern way like you like to work.  The question, of course, is will consumers trust Google to do an OS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, the other thing is that Google Google just doesn't have the fascist sensibility that Apple does.  Apple says, here's the thing.  You're all going to do it our way.  And if you don't do it our way, nothing is going to happen.  Google's like, well, you could do this way.  You could do that way.  Here's another app.  Here's the you know, it's like and you and but it creates a certain level of confusion for the mass market.  So I think that if they strongly differentiate the fascist Google version of Android versus the open source version, that would be good because you know, if it's a premium OS, I mean, look what they're doing with Android one.  They're already in India.  They're already loosening the restrictions on what's required for you to use it if you're an OEM in India because they really want adoption.  They really want people buying into the Android one platform.  And if these if the handset makers want to dumb down the specs or whatever to make it cheaper, Google is now saying, yeah, go go ahead.  You know, if that's an indication of where they're thinking, yeah, we'll go ahead and allow there to be crappy Android phones out in the world.  But meanwhile, we've got most of the no choice.  The ones that we touch are like awesome.  Right. If that's if that's the general direction, I think that would be fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you could make the case and I bet you have Jason Howell and all about Android that that really there is now only one good Android phone.  It's Nexus and everybody else should just get out of the I'm sure Google wouldn't say this out loud, but I think this is the message.  You've said this, Ron, haven't you?  Just this is the end.  This is it.  This is the only this is the Android handset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Definitely. Yeah.  I mean, from a consumer perspective, sure.  You're you know, Nexus devices are half the price of everything else.  And in the past, that's come with big compromises.  But the newest ones are great and they nail pretty much everything you'd want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no reason to look at Samsung or HTC or LG.  Yeah, there really isn't.  But I think Google just released information that Samsung's touch was interface added.  How many?  Thirteen new exploits.  Yeah. Nice job, Samsung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This OEM software doesn't it doesn't add anything positive like it slows down your updates and security gets bad and it's it's uglier.  And you just don't want it.  You just want to stay as far away from that crap as you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is I think the release of this information is no at the same time as as Nexus phones hit the market is no is no accident.  I think you're seeing more and more from Google saying don't buy those other Android devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And look at the business side of it.  Apple by itself makes 92 percent of the profits in the smartphone industry because they control it all.  They make money on the hardware. They make money on the software.  They make money on the services.  They make money on picking up a third of all the app revenue.  And so that's really the model that turns you into a incredibly not that Google's business model is different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Their model is not to sell more phones or models to get you to use Google services everywhere as much as possible.  But the Apple model is even more compelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. You make money on the services. Yes.  You make money on the advertising. Yes.  You make money on the licensing.  And guess what? You can also make money on the hardware.  You can make money on the city.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the argument people had of Apple versus Microsoft.  Yeah.  Would you rather be the software company that licenses software or the hardware company that makes hardware?  And for years it was rather be Bill Gates.  And then all of a sudden.  Right.  I think you'd rather be Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And look what Microsoft is doing now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. They're moving out in the Apple way.  It's a we live in interesting times.  And I guess what I'm saying is I hope there's somebody super smart who's sitting down and thinking about well how our computers.  What is a computer going to even mean in the next decade?  Maybe that's too long a time frame.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well did you guys see the tweet from Mattias Duarte, Google's VP of design?  He was he was going to town on Windows 10 saying it looks just like Windows XP did from 10 years ago on Twitter.  So I thought that was interesting where it's like at the same time where this Google PC operating system news comes out.  You know their their head designer is like is bashing windows on Twitter and talking about how old it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well in fact that's exactly what Microsoft I think did at the behest of its users.  They went back and said yeah we went too far too fast with Windows 8.1.  We're going back a little bit.  I'm looking he tweets a lot this guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On the other hand look at how Mattias Duarte dresses.  Look at that coat.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Keep going.  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have no beef with that Windows 10 looks.  I'm disappointed.  It works just like XP.  I understand that's a feature for many which it is.  It's Microsoft's selling point.  So this is the original tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They went back to the old school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When you think about the computer of the future for lack of a better term I think Google's in a great position because they they focus on the cloud.  The computer of the future is everything.  Your house is the computer.  There are screens everywhere devices everywhere.  Some devices with no screens.  No assumptions about the form factor at all.  And it's in the cloud.  Google now will become will grow and grow and grow and become this ever present interface to do that.  Exactly.  And so Google is in a great position.  They really need to continue to be radical in going into the cloud getting people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why you should be agnostic about hardware and not even get maybe not even get in the hardware business.  And that was the traditional Google model wasn't it.  We don't care what you use as long as you use more Google.  We're happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well but but on the other hand we're talking about alphabet now.  So they've got their hardware under Google.  They have Ness but then they also have other potential businesses they could launch to make hardware including cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jason Howell is very kindly given me not forever just for this show.  The next two years is an extra six p box.  Mine comes tomorrow.  They advanced it a little bit.  So if you're one of the people who was delivery time November 10th through 17th there is hope.  I'm going to get mine in November 6th instead of that.  So but we'll open this box and because Jason he says well I already got to open a box so he's going to let me open his virgin Nexus 6P never touched never touched touched by human.  Well except for the child labor that yes.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And don't worry Leo you don't have to try and bend it.  I already tried.  Can't it's just you can't bend it.  You can't bend it.  See it's all my all my strength but I could not bend that phone book in half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is no small wimpy guy.  This is Jason the Rock Owl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what they call me.  Never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's take a break when we come back more with Ron Amadeo from ours.  Technica.  Great to have you Ron.  Are you at home or at the office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am at the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes it's very lovely.  Yeah it is.  I feel like you're in a Japanese Rio con.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well you'd be staring into my kitchen and stuff.  So I bought stupid.  You dressed the set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah I try.  Very nice of you.  I appreciate that.  Love having you on.  It's great to have you here.  Same for you Mike Algen.  In fact let's kick that Jeff Jarvis on the road.  I know.  Just take this show over man.  You snooze you lose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm also in front of my kitchen.  This is actually a green screen that I built to make it look like the courthouse.  We can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact I told the crew.  You're a hologram.  Yeah.  Film this backdrop without people and without any furniture because we'll have to put the  furniture in at all times of day or night for three hours with things going by and stuff.  And then we could just put a green screen up and if we have the table and the chairs  and the microphones no one will know the difference.  In fact maybe that's already happened.  Our show today brought to you by Braintree Payments.  Maybe you're working on the next unicorn.  You know the next Uber or Airbnb or GitHub.  Why not use the same payment solution that helped them become what they are today.  That's right.  Uber uses Braintree Payments for their in-app payments.  Isn't that the secret of Uber though?  You get in the car.  You go for the ride.  You get out of the car.  That's it.  You don't even pay.  You don't press a button.  They already got everything.  Invisible payments.  That's really it's awesome.  That's the V.0 SDK.  Airbnb uses it.  GitHub.  GitHub scaled from the very beginning from their first dollar to their billionth with  Braintree Payments.  It's this fast, easy, seamless way with just a few lines of code to add mobile payments  to your app.  And when I say mobile payments I mean everything your customers want.  Apple Pay, Android Pay, PayPal, Venmo, credit cards, even Bitcoin.  I talked a couple of weeks ago with Ankur Arya.  He's the general manager for Braintree Mobile.  I didn't know this.  He told me they started in desktop and then when they wanted to go to mobile they started  again from the ground up.  Listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We looked at mobile as where the majority of the e-commerce market was going very early  on and we built a platform to be optimized for mobile but we actually started powering  desktop sites.  There are a whole host of merchants, thousands of web merchants and also cross-platform  merchants that do use Braintree.  So some of the more popular names like Airbnb and some of these other folks that you see  on our marquee also have desktop websites that we power.  So it's for native mobile experiences as well as the web, mobile web and desktop web.  So we're pretty much everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know you've probably seen all the attention that Buyable Pins are getting for Pinterest  on the web but now they're doing it on their Android app.  That's Braintree.  Buyable Pins is Braintree.  In fact it's the technology that they acquired when they brought Harper Reed into the fold.  Harper sold his company.  Was it called Modest?  I feel like it was called Modest to Braintree not so long ago.  That's the basis behind Buyable Pins.  Braintree, fast payouts, continuous support.  That means you'll always be ready whether you're earning your first dollar or your billionth  dollar.  You'll see fewer abandoned carts.  You'll see more sales.  You'll see happy users.  And by the way, don't write this stuff yourself because it's hard.  Money is hard.  You don't want to mess with money.  Let Braintree do the hard stuff.  A full-stack payment solution that's so easy to integrate into your platform.  Check it out for yourself.  Braintreepayments.com slash twig.  And just a little bit of sweetener.  Your first $50,000 in transactions will be fee free when you go to Braintreepayments.com  slash twig.  Ron, our US Nexus, I think you told me you like the 5X better.  Is that right?  5X, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, just because it's smaller.  I mean, I'd love to buy a 5P, but they don't make one, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you want the small screen.  Yeah.  What's the best way to open this?  I don't want to tear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a silver thing that's kind of sticky on the side.  So there's a flat there that you can kind of peel.  Just unstick this?  Okay.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right.  It's like, almost slightly sticky.  You can reseal it.  Yeah, I'll reseal it before I give it back to Jason.  Mine is the phone.  Yeah, please.  I'll get you some glue stick.  Yeah.  Put a rock in it.  And you'll never miss it.  Now, I really feel like, as we see the reports, Andy Anaco has been taking pictures with his  6P.  If you go to flickr.com slash andy, I have to say this camera is amazing.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Great results.  And you, on the 5X, it's the same camera, so you're not missing anything on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love Dandy's comments on that.  He basically went straight to the point and pointed out that the bottom line is you can't  see any superiority between either the 6P or the iPhone 6S pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think, and we talked about this on MacBreak yesterday, I really feel like at this point,  if you get any of the top of the line phones, you're going to get a really good camera.  That's no longer the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But those phones are all 7 to 8 and $900.  Right, and this is what?  This is 500.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, it feels like an $800 phone.  Yeah.  That is nice.  This is, you got the aluminum.  You know what?  I'm jealous.  I think that was a smart move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've had black phones.  I've had white phones.  This was my opportunity to get an aluminum phone.  It's like, okay, I'll get an aluminum this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then the periscope really looks more like a periscope on the aluminum one.  All ahead, full.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So people know you have a 6P from across the room.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's pretty.  If you want to get really fancy with the camera stuff, you can install a third-party app and  do raw photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which one are you using?  Is it FV?  Is that the one that everybody uses for raw?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  FV5?  Something like that?  FV5, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have both stills and video, and they have more settings than, you know, it's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, every setting known to man.  And you can stick it in, you know, Snapseed or Lightroom or whatever and tweak all your  settings afterwards.  It's really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do use Snapseed.  I have to say it's an amazing thing.  There you go.  That is a gorgeous screen.  Oh my goodness gracious golly.  Yeah, sure.  You betcha.  That's a beautiful phone there you got there, Jason.  Okay then.  Okay then, eh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And if you don't like the nuclear AMOLED colors, you can go to the developer options and there's  a fun little, it's sRGB, the little checkbox, and you flip it and it'll look closer to LCD  colors, which is really fun.  I learned that in your review.  Yeah, it's really neat and it should just be in display.  It's not something that they could hide in developer options behind a Konami code and  everything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is a shame, but thanks to Ron, we know how to do that.  Is that how you run your phone, Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I actually leave a little bit of that OLED color.  It's like the showroom dynamic television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's very bright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean that's why Samsung does it because a lot of people just like it.  They like how bright and poppy and vibrant the colors are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You might think this is nutty, but what I'm actually trying to find is what is the wattage  of the adapter?  Because of course this is a Type C connector and it's fast charging.  Everybody's raved about the speed of charging.  And what I'd like to know is, I mean, it's not quick charge so it's not anything special.  You just need to have the right wattage in the adapter.  And I'd like to know what the stock adapter's wattage is.  I'd also love to know what the maximum you could push out is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's USB Type C quick charging, which is supposed to be like some weird new standard  that they're going to have.  Oh, all right.  But probably that's the weirdest thing about owning that phone is that it's USB Type C,  so you need to go and invest in cables.  And if you're at a friend's house and your phone is dead, you're not charging it.  It's going to change though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got to take a picture of the fine print on that charger and put it up on the phone.  Oh, that's what I'll do.  Yeah, that's what I'll do.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can use my phone as a magnifier.  I don't want to ruin Jason's...  See, I'm using FV5 or whatever on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you don't want to ruin Jason's phone, I will.  I mean somebody's got to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  I already tried to bend the thing.  No, no, let me focus on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do I get that nice and steady?  Then I can blow it up, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Adventures in dealing with fine print.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  There we go.  I took a picture.  Now...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you blow it up and it says, if you can read this, you're too close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're too close.  Now, the problem with this really crazy camera app is it's just crazy.  Wait a minute, I didn't want to do that.  There we go.  Today...  No, not that one.  That's one of those crazy shots.  Those crazy...  Oh, come on.  Oh, there it is.  There it is.  Oh, come on, man.  All right.  Oh, it's going to be too dark.  Well, maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at that.  Wow.  You need to bring it in a snap seat and up the controls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  Let's see.  It says right there.  It is 5 by 3.  It's 15 watt.  Is that right?  No.  Yeah.  That is a 15 watt adapter.  That's bigger than the iPad adapter.  You probably can't see that, but I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  Yeah, that sounds right.  It's 15 watts, 5 volts, 3 amps?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  That's a very...  Yep.  That's a lot of power.  So that's good to know.  So that means if you want to get maximal speed and charging, you're going to want to get  a 15 watt adapter if you need more than just this one.  That's amazing.  So that's why it charges so fast.  That's pushing a lot out there.  So that's USB-C to USB-C is a cable of 3 amps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the 6P comes with a Type-C to Type-C cable and a Type-A to Type-C cable, which  you absolutely need.  Like I ran out and bought a ton of Type-A to Type-C cables.  I did too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But see, I had the Pixel and I had the MacBook, so I have been on Monoprice.  I have been to the mountaintop.  I have seen the Type-C connectors and I have every possible Type-C connector.  So congratulations, Jason.  It's a 6P.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and it can actually charge other phones, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know, that's not a good use of your phone.  Don't do that.  You don't have to decide.  I've actually tried that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  It's pretty slow, but it does it.  Right, I did it and it was like microscopic amount of power.  Don't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's capable of it.  That's the point, I guess.  So what I have to decide, I'm getting it tomorrow right before I leave to go to my son's father's  son frat weekend.  And I'm trying to decide, and you can help me, guys, am I going to get enough battery  life?  Should I bring my iPhone, which I know can get through the day without any problem at  all, or should I take a chance and bring my brand new shiny new 6P?  What's the battery life like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I understand that it's on the good side of average.  That's not good enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an Android phone.  Damn it.  Even with those and all the new things in Marshmallow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to know what this father-son frat party is.  How's your beer pong game?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, we're playing something called Snappa.  You remember that?  No.  Ron, you're a young fella.  Did you play that in college, Snappa?  No.  Apparently it's very popular in the frat.  I thought it was going to be beer pong too.  And then they said beer dye.  And I thought, I hope they mean dice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or food coloring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then I just got the itinerary today and it said, get this.  So we're doing father-son Snappa tournament.  I don't know what that is.  And then I know that there's significant beer consumption involved.  And the next day we're going skeet shooting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That seems like a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What could go wrong?  Anyway, yeah, that's...  Okay, here's Snappa, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that looks exactly like CU Boulder, baby.  Right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's dice involved, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's all sorts of... it's a fairly arcane...  I see beer.  That's good.  There's a ping pong table.  I have seen them play this, actually.  I was bewildered by the rights of the natives.  Oh my god.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is this what you play when you're too good for beer pong?  Apparently, this is the next generation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When you're too drunk for beer pong.  The kids today, I'll tell you.  CU Boulder is one of the last schools with a very rich fraternity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you're going to be struggling against altitude sickness as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That'd be great.  I can't wait.  But at least my 6P will be.  Well, it's also... and I don't know... it's Google Fi.  So it would be Sprint slash T-Mobile.  So I don't even know if that...  I should probably read my iPhone, too, just in case.  Grantland.  Bye bye.  What a shock.  ESPN... maybe not a shock.  ESPN had done some layoffs last week.  Several hundred, I think, laid off.  Because they said, it's not that we're doing badly.  But we've got to kind of align our costs, given how much the NFL and other game rights  cost.  It's gotten so expensive.  And yet, if you're ESPN, you don't really have much choice.  You have to get as many football and baseball games as you can.  Well, the next casualty of this is Grantland, which I'm even amazed that they did.  It was as much a culture site as a sports site, headed by Bill Simmons, who they fired  in the spring.  So I probably should have seen this coming.  But a good article by Ben Thompson and Stritecary...  In fact, we're going to get Ben on Twitter on Sunday to talk about this.  He says, conventional wisdom is that both are worse off for having split ESPN for having  lost Simmons.  And in the end, a truly remarkable online magazine, Simmons lost access to ESPN's massive  audience.  He quotes Deadspin saying that Grantland had six million unique visitors in March.  I don't know about ours, Technica, but six million...  Wow.  It's kind of low, isn't it?  Is that low?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Especially for 50 writers.  50 writers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  50 writers, editors, and backend staff.  Actually I think we have more than six million.  Not to the website, but downloads.  I think it's seven million.  Even if Grantland writes Ben had been much more aggressive in monetizing through advertisements,  the site was not, by the way.  It was beautiful.  It was exactly the kind of site those of us who use ad blockers would like, which is basically  one banner ad plus you might be interested in block at the bottom.  There's no question that Grantland was an editorial success, he says, in terms of quality.  I'd agree with that.  I read it a lot.  And I'm not even a sports fan.  Site got three national magazine award nominations, a primetime Emmy, which must be hard for a  website, and was nominated for and won a number of sports Emmys, Webby Awards, and  more.  Ben was a fan.  But I think the issue is scale.  He quotes Todd Vanderwerf writing on Vox.  The problem is scale.  A larger general interest site can't be built purely atop long form because long form takes  time.  Both were writers to write and readers to read.  Therefore as both Buzzfeed and Gawker realized early on, well done long form could be the  steak but couldn't be the meal.  They needed quick hitting, fast link generating articles.  So, the question is, and here's his famous, Ben's famous for his illustrations, where  he kind of finds the sweet part in the curve between massive content discovery with Google,  Facebook, and Twitter, and highly expensive but smaller value content creation.  This is the bottom line.  This was his tweet.  Writing is really about lead generation.  That's sad, isn't it?  As a writer, I see you shaking your head.  I'm sure Ron is also as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think one of the big deals about Ars Technica is how kind of slim we roll in terms of people.  Like 50 people is insane to me.  We have meetings and everybody fits into a medium sized meeting room.  A lot of these places that closed down recently, when you hear about how many writers they  had hired, it's crazy.  I don't know how fast you want your homepage to scroll with new stories.  When you have 50 people, what is your plan?  What is their output a month?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We won't mention Giga Home by name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Simmons has gone on to do two things.  One is doing a TV show for HBO and the other is a podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently, Grantland's podcasts were really good.  I never listened to one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's part of the problem with podcasts.  Well, I didn't listen because I don't like sports.  Ben writes, the trouble with podcasts, they are difficult to grow while text can be shared  and consumed quickly.  This is something we face.  A podcast requires a commitment, which is why advertising is so valuable on podcasts.  If you've made that commitment, you're engaged and those ads work better.  Simmons though, by virtue of his previous writing, and this is the writing as lead generation,  is averaging 400,000 downloads per episode.  I can tell you from our experience, that's astounding.  It's a huge number.  Although I always look, and I would caution everybody to do this with a grain of salt  at podcast numbers because there's no accepted way of measuring that.  I know what our numbers are, which is at best half that, but we measure numbers in a much  more conservative way than most people.  Most people just look at the number of downloads.  If we use that number, it would be over 400,000 downloads an episode even for this show, but  that's not an accurate way to measure.  I don't know what that number means.  Podcast rates are hard to come by, says Ben.  I'll tell them on Sunday a little bit more about this, but I'm aware of a few podcasts  a quarter the size that are earning somewhere in excess of $10,000 per episode.  That's very low for us.  Presuming proportionally similar rates, Bill Simmons' podcast, which publishes three times  a week, could be on a $6 million run rate.  That's probably correct.  Which per my envelope math could nearly pay for a 15-person staff a la Grantland.  In other words, he's found a more efficient way to monetize, but writing was the great  lead generator for an actual monetizable business.  That's the lesson.  Interesting.  I'm not sure it's right, but that's the lesson that Ben pulls from the failure of Grantland.  The failure of Grantland that led to, he says, the success of Bill Simmons as a brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's accurate.  I think that the model that would have worked for them is the Buzzfeed model, where you  have clickbait and you have long-form quality journalism.  That's exactly what he says.  Don't overextend yourself, as Ron says, with the staff.  Keep it lean, keep it mean, and take it from both ends, in long form and the very short  form.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says the website should have been, Grantland should have been step one to a multimedia  converted visitors to fans willing to invest in time and formats that can actually pay  the bills.  Not just podcasts.  I think that may not be the right answer, but I think you're right.  Buzzfeed and Vice both have mastered that model.  On the other hand, that's sad because it kind of deprecates long-form writing, the stuff  we really appreciate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Human beings will tell you they want long-form, high-quality content, but in actual practice,  there's so much content out there that people just skim and they brush over things.  You want to do long-form content because it's the right thing to do.  You can do original journalism.  If you don't do original journalism, you're just a pick-up site and you shouldn't even  exist.  At the same time, you need both.  I think one of the challenges of podcasting is that, unlike article, if something's viral  on Twitter and it has a devastating headline, it's a fascinating thing, people go in and  read an article.  They don't care that they don't always read that particular writer or that particular  publication.  They read that article just on its own.  Whereas podcasting, people tend to think, okay, well, I'm either subscribing to it or  I'm not listening to it at all.  People tend to listen to their podcasts serially, so you try to get subscriptions.  How do you get people to subscribe if they don't sample the goods?  That's where the writing and the short form is useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of the things I really like that the Twitter does is you'll cut out the good stuff  and throw it up on YouTube as a little tiny thing like that.  When you got the note pens stuck in the Samsung Notebook, when you got stuck in the phone,  that got a ton of views.  If you had never seen the show before, that was a cool introduction to it and a fun moment.  It was like lead generation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think actually, Ben's pretty accurate.  In a way, that's kind of what we do.  Certainly you write.  I don't write, but you write.  But everybody here has built a fan base outside of podcasting.  Then we bring on writers, people with their own fan base like Ron.  A lot of Twitter is made up of that.  It's people like you, like Jeff Jarvis, who have their own fan base that we use to lead  generate, I guess.  That seems like a scummy way to play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It works both ways.  People that watch Twitter get to see guests come on and see articles and stuff like that.  So it's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think really there's the big issue, the broader, larger issue is discovery.  I, as a user, I've always felt this way with the internet.  There's too much great stuff on it.  I can't figure out how to find it.  I know I'm missing good stuff.  Eventually you just give up and say, well, I hope I get some of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm exhausted.  I'm going to bed now.  I'm going to stop looking for content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why else do we sleep so poorly?  We're constantly scanning the internet at three in the morning.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep.  Somebody's ringing your doorbell.  Yeah, I know.  It's his ring video doorbell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, my wife is schlepping in groceries.  So every time she walks by the door, it's like another bag of groceries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Discovery is a big challenge.  I'm watching the World Series and all you see is these ads.  They're not for Twitter.  They're not Twitter really, not really Twitter ads.  They're Twitter moments ads because Twitter realizes that Twitter has no value at all  unless you spend some time creating a Twitter feed that's of use.  So they created this new moments page, which has nothing to do with who you follow.  It's just kind of newsfeed.  And then they spend, it must be millions of dollars on World Series ads and on another  I think it was on Blood and Oil, big, big TV show ads, millions of dollars to get people  not to go to the Twitter homepage, but to go to the moments page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think moments for me personally, I think is a huge failure.  I agree.  I keep thinking surely there's got to be something good there.  And every single time I don't find anything compelling that's there.  It just seems like it's just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's basically random.  Even Flipboard's better because at least it's tied to my Twitter feed.  This is not tied to anything.  It's just what some editor at Twitter thinks is this is like a bad newspaper.  It's USA Today for the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like any other website, but Twitter's running it.  It's just any other news website on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And speaking of this, there's a really cool app that I'm going to go ahead and recommend.  It's called TL Semicolon DR, of course, too long, didn't read.  And it's a good name for an app.  And their story selection is what moments should be.  They're surfacing really interesting content.  And I have it set up.  I've actually got it set up as a notification on my phone.  And I don't get irritated by it.  I actually want these notifications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's an email app called TLDR.  That's not it.  First problem they've got is that there's another app with the same name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And not to mention it's a very common thing that everybody uses when they write on the  internet.  Yeah, well, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Part of, I guess, what I'm saying is that Twitter's problem with moments is that it's  bad editorially.  It's not that the concept is bad.  It's just that they're failing as an editorial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do you feel about Apple's news?  I feel the same way about news, that it doesn't do what I want it to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't use Apple News either.  I mean, you're talking about the Apple's News app?  Yeah, it sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At least that supposedly is driven by my interests.  Do you agree, Ron?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My exposure to Apple News has been complaining from the people here about how many hoops  they have to jump through to make it work.  But I haven't really tried it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here is TLDR.  It's TLDR.io.  Yeah.  So it's a Chrome extension.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there's also an iOS app.  I don't actually, I thought it had an Android app, but it apparently doesn't yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Too many tabs open, remembering too little, too much to read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that may be yet another thing.  Look, it's sponsored by Giggle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the rude baguette.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the thing that bugs me about so much of what Twitter is doing these days is that they  don't seem to appreciate Twitter.  So Twitter is a thing.  It's minimalist.  It's not algorithmically sorted.  It's linear.  It's based on who you followed.  And those are the qualities that make me like Twitter a lot.  And they just have this Facebook envy where they're flirting with algorithmic sorting,  inserting stuff from people I didn't follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's because if you come to Twitter as a normal person, that's why Twitter growth  is now just a couple of million less month.  You come to Twitter as a normal person, it's befuddling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It took me forever to get used to Twitter.  And I'm definitely not a normal person.  Like I probably tried and quit about three times before just kind of every other journalist  on earth using it forced me to finally sit down and try to make myself use it.  But it's very confusing.  It's hard to figure out why you would need this.  Like most of the time when you describe Twitter to someone, they're like, why?  Why would I need that?  But for me, it's a source of breaking news and kind of comments and nothing else.  And a lot of people don't care about breaking news.  They're happy to read about it like newspaper style, like tomorrow on whatever your website  is.  But for people like us where we need to see the new thing, it's useful, but not normal

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  people.  How do we solve this?  I mean, this really is the discovery issue.  Right.  You know, how do we want to?  We don't want to miss everything.  We don't want to see everything.  Is it curation?  Is that the key?  Because that's kind of what moments is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's kind of what everybody does that for Twitter.  You know?  So many tweets are the source of news stories now that that's everybody on earth.  There's Twitter curation.  And I think normal people don't need that level of speed or noise that Twitter gets  you like.  Twitter is the crap that curators have to dig through to find the good stuff.  But I don't think normal people need to get involved in that or want to get involved in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it.  Oh, this is too weird.  So I've installed TLDR.  Now as I read websites, is it going to shorten?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it shrinks your stuff down.  I should totally try it on one of my articles, see how bad it is.  I can't imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's a human doing that.  So I don't have any TLDRs on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is there a human doing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They say it's human.  Oh, you have to press this button.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Options.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me see the options.  Don't check the existence of TLDR for some sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it says powered by liquid helium.  The plugin analyzes the content and creates summarized versions.  So it's some computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's computer generated.  Oh, Lord, that sounds terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If we're talking about the same too long, didn't read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but I don't see they specifically single out hacker news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a picture of a sloth or panda or some kind of furry creature.  Are we talking about the same?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  TLDR.io.  I don't see a sloth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, OK.  Oh, here we go.  Here's some here's some short name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, already, they're suspect.  Let's go and look in tech news, right?  Because that's what we do.  And we know a little bit about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, OK. You don't have to install anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you can. Well, you think you do.  I don't know, because I didn't see anything like this until I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't see any of my articles.  So obviously, this is crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what? I have to say it is  given what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, there's bullet points for everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's yeah, I know this is, you know, I hate to say it  because it sounds horribly antiquated, but RSS is really awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wish RSS would come would have revived.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still use it. I use Feely.  And what I do is every time I find an awesome source of news  and of course, you stumble across things, I just throw it in there.  And I must have I'm scared to even know 400 news sources or something.  And it's in reverse chronological order.  I can scroll through it quickly.  I can save things to instapaper.  And so that sort of thing, you know, one of the problems  I think we have with content discovery is that we discard good ones.  Right. While we're chasing the shiny new thing.  And then later we realize, oh, the shiny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We miss RSS. Look at this.  This surfaced a whole bunch of articles. Compare that to TLDR.  This is the top front page of my Feely Nexus 6P bends easily again.  Here's a list of USB type C cables Google's lead engineer recommends  because they're not all made equal.  Motorola's opening a retail shop in Chicago.  The Nexus 6P features a double tap to wake feature hidden in the kernel.  These are all articles. This is good.  Yeah. But of course, as you say, we had you and I had to do  the hard work of putting together hundreds of sources.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But well, there's you can they have pre-made packages in Feely  and you can just subscribe to like technology and it will give you a bunch of things.  But yeah, that's like one of my favorite views where you can just look at titles  and just blow through your list of feeds and see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this raises what I think is a central confusion around content discovery.  It's not about discovering new sources of content.  It's about hanging on to the sources of content that you discover.  And we all discover that you've discovered.  Yeah. It's like the problem is we forget about great sources of content  that we've already discovered.  And if you can figure out a central place to retain them,  we discover new source of content all the time.  People refer to them here and there.  I mean, you know, they're everywhere.  But the trick is to not forget about them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and frankly, podcasting is based on RSS.  So, yeah, I don't know what we would do without it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, that's another great thing about about RSS is you can  it's it's agnostic about the source of content, right?  Your podcast in there, through your publication.  And it's, you know, it's all presented in a very readable format.  I'm a huge fan of RSS, and I think Google screwed up royally by  canceling reader.  I know that's an old gripe.  But you don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think some kind of some kind of new RSS interface would do pretty well.  I mean, Feedly is kind of there when like you go to titles and it shows you  how many people read each article, which lets you like really quickly  see what news is important or popular and what people have read.  And that's made me read articles that I normally would never click on.  But but I see because they're oh, everybody else thinks this is a big deal  or everybody else thinks this is really funny or whatever.  It's definitely made me click on it.  And if you were to do something that kind of took all those popular  stories like Feedly has access to everybody's RSS feeds,  if they were just like, here's the most popular articles in the world,  you know, in these categories, that would be,  I think, a really neat thing where it would be like crowdsourced,  you know, crowdsourced, like deciding what what stories are good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, here's a story I just found in Feedly.  Zach Hall writing in nine to five Google Facebook supposedly will be launching  its notify news app next week.  Everybody wants to get into this business problem with Facebook's app  is it's with partners, right?  So what determines what gets in the news app  is whoever gave Facebook the most money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would. Oh, whoever signs up for instant articles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess so.  The app will be called notify.  Actually, this comes from the Financial Times.  So let's go to the oh, I was going to say, let's go to the original article,  but it's got a wall in front of it.  But here's the secret.  If you search Google for the headline, just Google the headline.  You guys already know all that.  Huh? Wow. You're good.  Uh huh.  Or I'll just read nine to five Google's synopsis of it.  Media partners include CBS, The Washington Post and Vogue.  Well, thank God, because I am looking for a better way to find great articles.  I was right. I am looking for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have articles in Vogue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So hey, hey, that's that's that's one of my.  It's a conding ass publication.  A fine. I think so. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Probably a fine conding.  Hey, I read The New Yorker and and Wired, so I think we're covered here.  How does Conde treat you?  Are you kind of autonomous at ours or? Yes.  You just can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ken Fisher, the guy that runs ours, the founder, does an excellent job  of kind of insulating us from from the mothership.  Yeah. And we get to do pretty much whatever we want.  So it's cool. Plus, nobody understands you.  Yes. Yeah. Right.  Because we're this weird website and everybody else is like the what internet?  Does that what kind of what kind of paper does that get printed on?  And it's like, no, we don't have a magazine.  No, never did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it reminds me of Bill Gaines when Mad Magazine was sold to Time Warner.  Bill Gaines, the founder of Mad Magazine, who was quite the character,  yeah, just made sure that they did not have anything to do with mad at all.  And was, you know, cantankerous and just, you know,  he kept time at arm's length. Yeah.  And until he died, Mad Magazine preserved its integrity.  Of course, as soon as he passed away, Mad Magazine got co-opted.  And suddenly they've got ads and all sorts of things.  So you're lucky to have like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you heard the latest dead journalism empire, National Geographic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, my God, this makes me cry.  Rupert Murdoch bought National Geographic.  And today, how many layoffs? 200? Everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everybody. Everybody was. Yeah.  That's what I saw. Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So obviously, this is a developing story  because the first story I saw was it was a percentage.  It's the biggest layoff. No, no, it's not everybody.  It's the biggest layoff in their history. It's 180 out of 2000.  Oh, OK. Calm down. Calm down.  Unless unless this unless something else has happened.  It's a cost cutting move, but it is the largest layoff in National Geographic  history. It'll it'll also affect people at the National Geographic channel,  which is the most profitable part.  That's everybody knows that the data that the data right.  That's that's been a very successful thing for them.  The National Geographic TV stuff is nine percent.  Involuntary separations will make up about nine percent.  And the rest are buyouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The. Wait, so how many then?  180. OK, that's also what pirates used to call people walking the plank.  Yeah. Involuntary separations made it sound like National Geographic was dead

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and everybody was. Well, it may be.  I mean, I can't imagine Rupert Murdoch is going to preserve the.  Yeah, see, yeah, here's the story I saw that you probably saw.  Rupert Murdoch lays off National Geographic staff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. Right.  That makes it sound like everybody on Earth got.  Yeah. Yeah. Reverb. Yeah. Right.  That's what I was reading. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, wow, the memo went out November 3rd, came to the National Geographic office.  This was the day in which Rupert Murdoch's.  So it happened on November 3rd, 20th Century Fox took over  National Geographic, the management of National Geographic sent out  an email telling its staff, all of its staff  to report to their headquarters and wait by their phones.  So that's the email you don't want to get.  Everyone who is in the field, every photographer, every reporter,  even those on vacation.  I don't I think this is.  Because the Washington Post said it was 180 people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this is a 180 employees received involuntary separation  playoffs while some other staff members were offered  consideration of voluntary buyout, so that's 150 people were forcefully fired  and some other people were like, will you please leave?  I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not in the end, I think that it's it's not.  I think that that article.  Is overstating it, because as everything else I've read says around nine percent layoffs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But anyway, it's sad and scary and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's a begin.  I would say the beginning of the end, right?  I can't imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, the Wall Street Journal does OK.  They're a Murdoch enterprise.  And they're you know, they were good before and they're still good now.  They break tons of Google News.  You know, we were just talking about them earlier.  So I don't know, maybe they're just doing super cost cutting or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They laid off their photographic editor, Sherry Bruckbacher.  That's yeah, it seems like a big deal.  It's like a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's like what National Geographic is most known for.  Is there awesome pictures?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Their picture editor was also laid off.  She's Hubbard.  Yeah, this doesn't sound good.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we kind of knew this was going to happen.  And of course, the Financial Times, which whose story I was trying to read  behind the paywall, it's also a Murdoch.  The future of news is Facebook, Facebook Notify,  which is an app which supposedly will come out tomorrow.  You know, if you'll Apple News,  this Twitter moments, I imagine this will be very similar.  I just feel like these are.  This is not what I'm looking for.  Feedly is what I'm looking for.  I don't know. What about you at home?  What are you looking for?  Are you looking for some, you know, glossy thing that come?  I feel like this has already failed.  Remember, what was what was it?  The Murdoch effort that was app based was it called the National?  Oh, they hired 100 journalists,  built a newsroom, built an app and within a year folded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So one of the things that's different about Notify that I think is  remember Facebook Home?  Yeah, where Facebook wanted to be the flop.  Yeah. Yeah. But they wanted to be the first thing you touch  when you get an Android phone.  Well, this is I think to me, this is a kind of sort of like that,  because the news is not going to be inside the app.  You don't launch the app and then sit there and look at news.  It is based primarily on notifications.  So the notifications center is where you read the news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and and by the way, we were talking about this on Sunday on Twitter.  It used to be the home page was the real estate you wanted.  Now it's the notification.  That is, it turns out we're so busy.  We pay so little attention to what's going on that you want to get in the  notification and to do that, you have to be a standalone app. Right. Yep.  That's the new that's the new ground zero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the new that's one of the reasons why Facebook wants everything to be  in its own app, because it's a new opportunity to be in the notifications  window and you won't be for I mean, this is this is a real problem.  You know, you're talking about how Android is awesome because it has so many apps.  Well, you know, how many apps can you really run?  So the shelf space issue with apps is just the biggest issue. Right.  The only issue, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I would never want like a monolithic Facebook app.  They have so many crappy services that I just have no interest in at all.  And half the time I don't even have the regular Facebook app loaded.  I just have the messenger app because people actually use that.  And I don't really care about the baby pictures that are on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think paper, which was a Facebook app with the same purpose, basically.  Right. That was a flop. Right.  They still I think you still can get it. But  I thought paper looked pretty good.  But it was Facebook.  Let's take a break. We'll talk about smart smart replies.  You can show me how to use it in inbox.  I use inbox. I like inbox.  It does. It does not work yet.  It doesn't work. So you can't show it to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's supposed to hit today, but who knows?  All right. Keep trying.  I'll give it an ad and maybe it'll and then maybe it'll work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll do an ad.  It's so interesting because  more and more we talk about health and we talk about staying healthy.  Of course, the conversation was about exercise, diet.  Now it's about sleep.  More and more, it's about sleep.  It's about getting a deep, restful sleep,  not letting the your your phone or the Internet distract you from that.  And it turns out this impacts health in so many in diet, weight.  In heart health, of course, state of mind.  A good night's sleep is maybe one of the most important things  you can do for your health.  And of course, who wants to be tired all day?  That's why the Casper mattress is a mattress everybody should take a look at.  C.A.S.P.E.R.  These are made in the USA, premium mattresses that are designed  to give you that night's sleep you've been craving.  No springs.  These mattresses are made out of a unique combination of memory foam  and latex so that you get support and softness.  It's a very interesting feeling.  I love my Casper mattress.  They are delivered for free in these surprisingly compact boxes.  Here's one. This is a queen size mattress.  Easy to get in the room.  When I got my son wanted a queen size mattress in the frat house.  He's up three flights.  I got him a Casper because he could easily get it in there.  I don't know how he's going to get out of the room.  But you know, after a year in a frat house, maybe you don't want to.  He's loving it. He really loves it.  He says his friends love it, too.  I don't know what that means.  You can you can you can buy it online.  And by the way, you may say, but wait, I want to I want to try before I buy.  You are trying before you buy.  Well, you're buying, but then you have a hundred days to return it  and get every penny back.  Free delivery and yes, friendly free return.  Should you not like it at all?  It's easy and you have a hundred days to do so.  They know they have to do that because you're not going to be able  to try it in a mattress showroom.  So they're going to have to let you try it in the house.  But I have to tell you, you're not going to want to give up your Casper.  But the first few nights, you know, take your old mattress, set it aside,  put it in the basement, keep it for a while, just in case.  It is amazing.  They're so restful, so relaxing and very affordable,  because instead of that huge markup in the mattress store,  you're going to get direct from the factory.  Five hundred dollars for a twin going all the way up to the biggest mattress.  Nine hundred fifty dollars for the king size.  That is less than half what you'd pay for a mattress of this quality  at a mattress store.  And you're going to save an additional 50 bucks  by using the promo code twig.  So go to Casper dot com slash twig.  Read up about it.  Answer your questions.  Take a look at how they're made.  When you order it, make sure you use the offer code twig for fifty bucks.  Off.  They say we need.  A Casper in the UK says Keith 512.  Yes, you do. Yes, you do.  That's all I can say.  Tweet at 1251, two hours, less than two hours ago,  by inbox by Gmail.  Thank you, chat room, for passing this along.  Thank you, Gardner.  To all those asking, smart reply will start rolling out to inbox  on Android and iOS tomorrow.  I'm not sure this could be all that useful.  The idea is and then here's a screenshot so you can kind of see what happens.  And you got to use inbox, first of all, which a lot of people don't like.  It's a very stripped down email client that takes advantages  of the auto categorization built into Gmail.  You'll have at the bottom of each message, three responses.  I don't know if they're customized for the message.  In this case, it says I don't. Sorry. I guess it must be.  Yeah, so I'll have to look for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're highly customized using very advanced AI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So so the email begins.  Do you have any documentation on how to use the new software?  If not, maybe you could put something together.  And the automated response is, a, I don't. Sorry.  I'll have to look for it or B, I'll send it to you.  And then you do the attachment and you've written the email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's powered by Google's like it's a cloud based natural language  processor thing that they're like crazy research team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just admit it. It's powered by what Google knows about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's actually it's interestingly, it's not based on what it knows about you.  It's not customized in that way. It isn't.  There's two there are two basic AI engines.  One is to understand the message.  And what they do is they go through the message word by word  and it's purely semantic.  They they discard everything in style and they actually the software  actually under tries to understand, understand end quotes.  What it actually says, if it's a long winded message, right,  it will get it that it will seek not only is this something that needs a reply?  Is this something that can be replied to in three to six words?  If not, it doesn't do anything.  But if so, it will take a shot at it and then it uses a different engine  to construct using the same tone. Wow.  Using you. And so what the here's what this really is.  Here's here's the best way, I think, to think about a smart reply.  Basically, think about chat bots that researchers have been working on for decades.  They're trying to pass the touring.  Eliza. Yeah, they're trying to create a chat bot so that you can text  back and forth with the machine. Right.  And you can't tell that it's a machine or not.  It's no nothing has passed the touring test yet, despite a couple of controversies.  And so what this is doing is it's taking that whole area of of research  and it's applying it to not replacing the human inter, you know,  a converse conversant, but it's augmenting a human one.  And so what it's doing is it's essentially using the human as an editor  in order to pass the touring test.  Ultimately, that's what this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so so they're going to I wonder if they get feedback from which ones you choose.  I bet they do. They keep track of how they don't.  There's a suggest don't.  Yeah, but they don't. OK, they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They promise that no human will ever read either what you get or what you say. OK.  Yeah. Well, no human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't read your email. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No human does not mean no Google.  So here's an email.  Turkey. Hi, all.  We want to invite you to join us for an early Thanksgiving on November 22nd,  beginning around 2 p.m.  Please bring your favorite dish RSVP by next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the reply is don't call me a turkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, my reply would be I'd love to go to Turkey.  When are you leaving? No.  So here are the three replies, by the way.  With exclamation marks, which means they saw the exclamation mark  in the body and they said, oh, that's how they write a number.  One is count us in exclamation mark.  Number two is we'll be there exclamation mark.  Number three is sorry, we won't be able to make it period.  That's actually pretty good.  Yeah, that's I would love it.  And I know they're going to come out as emojis here pretty soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My favorite story from this is when they were when they were working on it,  the algorithm would reply, I love you to every message early version.  It's like, oh, it's such a sweet computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is actually a great article.  It's on the Google research blog.  This is not the announcement article, but it's linked from the announcement article.  It's describing how it works, which is pretty impressive. Yeah.  This is isn't this it's using recurrent  neural networks, two of them, one to encode the incoming email  and one to predict possible responses.  But this is always what we wanted computers to do. Yeah.  And I really get sad because so many people are so worried about privacy  that they go, oh, no, that means you have to read our mail and blah, blah, blah.  And I feel like we're not going to get the computer  future, the technology future we wanted because of people being so  privacy focused. Yeah.  Now, I understand. I support privacy and all that.  But I want this stuff.  And if it has to read my email to do it, fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're reading your email anyway for ads and categorization and everything else.  So it's not like people don't like that. Well, but see, I, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that this is the thing that Miss Lee, you know,  then they are not reading your email.  It's anthropomorphized a machine that responds in specific ways.  If certain things are in the email, if a forest falls in the tree, et cetera,  if nobody's actually reading, if a human isn't reading it, right, then  then I don't think they are reading your email.  It's and besides all that, even if they were, I agree with you, Leo, that there's  if you know what you're getting into, I think this is something  that people shouldn't automatically reject.  The other thing that's interesting about this is that it seems to me that  inbox is sort of becoming a virtual assistant.  I love the direction is going. I do too.  And lots of people, it's like Twitter, it's like Ron's experience with Twitter  and my experience with Twitter.  People go to it and like, I don't know, I don't feel like I have that much control.  And they they leave and then maybe they come back.  I really strongly recommend that everybody who can  force yourself to use inbox for a couple of weeks.  Let Google. It's a great way.  I knew bumper sticker. I achieve.  I don't have it today because Leo, you've kept me very busy today.  But normally I keep a zero inbox all the time.  Zero inbox. I'm impressed.  And it's because of inbox.  It's so easy to procrastinate intelligently.  It's so easy to I use the feature of like, OK, make a go away  and come back when I when I'm at home.  I don't want to see this news email.  Yeah. Stuff like that. It's such a great service.  I really like inbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, my problem is you can't you can't use it with Exchange.  So on Android, you have to use Gmail to use Exchange.  Yeah. And a lot of times I'm like, well, I'm already in Gmail now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think it still doesn't work with Google for Work and Mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I am. I am blissfully free of all of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've actually been considering trying to get  everybody at work to use their work email, which is a Google for Work email,  because then we have better control over who has access to the documents.  And when you leave, instead of having to go through the documents  and seeing who has access to which documents, we could just kill your  your work email and then you won't have access to it anymore.  Which is why you need Android.  It works. But you don't. I don't. Lisa doesn't.  Half the staff is using their personal Gmail account.  Because we want these features. Right. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the the closer we get to the release of the Blackberry Priv,  the more I'm like, man, I hate software keyboards.  And this is going to get a Blackberry Priv.  I'm going to try to play with one. I don't I don't know.  But like this this feature is an indication of like how much software  keyboards suck, because it's it's got to type one sentence for you.  And on a desktop with a real keyboard, you wouldn't care at all about that.  You're like, I could type one sentence in in half a second.  But on mobile, on a mobile phone, that's a huge pain in the butt.  So so having it type that that one second, you know, the one example was,  I'm on it like three words.  But on mobile, that's that's useful. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the thing is that I'm excited about Ron is that,  you know, people talk about whether, you know, something is keyboard friendly  or mouse friendly or whatever.  I think that these next generation  AI based virtual assistants and and all these other features should replace  the need to be typing all the time.  I mean, we we type way too much, I think.  And I'd love to see a lot more intelligence  where it's always suggesting things.  You want you want to just say this whole thing.  Yeah, just say that, you know, that sort of thing.  I mean, if you think about it, here's something that came up  in all this blather about inbox smart reply, which is that how often does  everybody reply to email by saying sounds good, exclamation point.  Like half the emails that I get, I reply with that basically.  And so, you know, I've written I've written,  what do they call them in Gmail filters and sort of macros  and they sort of canned replies.  We've always have these sort of dumb approaches to semi automate email.  And it's great to have some help from a massive artificial intelligence  bank of servers, I think. Yeah.  But yeah, I really I really like this this whole thing.  And of course, the other thing is interesting about inbox is that it keeps  getting smarter about various things.  So increasingly, as you type in something, especially into the reminders feature,  so for those of you unfamiliar with inbox, you can send an email  or you can send yourself a reminder.  And I use the reminders thing all the time.  But if you start to type in certain things into the reminders box,  it will auto fill in certain things like pick up whatever.  I don't remember the exact features.  And then oftentimes it will populate that reminder  with some, you know, some intelligent thing.  So if you, for example, you set up a calendar invite or whatever,  it'll put the link to the calendar invite in there, stuff like that.  And I just want to see a lot more of that, because I think that I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody badmouths, even if it does a bad job.  Yeah. Part of the process is we got to start.  So and correct it and give it feedback so that it gets better.  Yeah, because I want the computer to do what I want. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And I love the fact that, you know,  well, first of all, everybody badmouths email talking about how it's an antiquated  email is actually pretty great because it's so universal. Right.  It's not a social network.  Well, so I have to be on Pinterest in order to communicate.  No, it's it's email. It's everybody uses it.  And it's it's automatable.  And especially with things like with inbox,  the people I'm I'm talking to don't have to be an inbox,  but I can use inbox to do all kinds of amazing points.  Yeah. And I just I just love it, especially since I've been able  to maintain the zero inbox thing, which just gives me so much peace of mind.  It's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just wish Google now would be able to do more.  I feel like they've held back on that, too.  And I worry that it's there that it's because of privacy advocates  and they don't want to go too far because they're afraid that people get upset,  that they're creepy and they're too cautious about crossing the creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there was there was an internal fight about Google.  Now the Android team wanted it.  Right. The Google search team wanted to take it over.  So so they've been they've been going back and forth about who exactly owns  that and all that.  And and maybe now that that's decided, I hope that they will,  you know, add more features to it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's got to be everywhere, including and especially in inbox.  I'd love to see it completely integrated in an inbox. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, just so you know, Jason, I went over and gave Jason back his  Nexus six piece so he could do his own.  You know, I've you were very it's very generous of you to let me  take that out and open that because I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm I'm spoiled because I have two Nexus six piece with me right now.  So it's OK. Now I just hate you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry I said anything.  But I love the Verges article, which says the Nexus six piece will snap in half  if you try to snap it in half.  So don't try to snap it now because you know what happened?  Because it will.  Apparently, it does bend the box doesn't, as we now know.  You're welcome. But thank you.  But apparently you can snap it in half if you really try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So don't. Yeah.  And just by the way, from that video, if you watch it,  he does a lot of things to the device before he ever tries to bend it.  I'm not saying that it wouldn't bend without that other stuff,  but I definitely am saying that the stuff that he does to it  probably weakened it a little bit as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just shows you that people will do anything to get clicks.  It's the world of YouTube. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thin smartphones are dumb. Give me a bigger battery.  I agree with that completely. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what that's what's kind of making me mad.  I mean, Apple, Apple is able to do it.  But the 6S Plus, which is what I carry around, I can't kill that thing.  It's indestructible.  As long as you charge it every night, you're going to get a big,  nice, long day of battery life.  And I just wish there were an Android phone besides the OnePlus One,  which is the last phone that did that.  Maybe the maybe the Sony's do it.  People rave about the Sony's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The BlackBerry battery is huge. The Priv.  It's like 400 milliamp hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is the 6P. That's it.  It's 3450s on the 6P. It should be better.  Is the smaller screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And is it for a UHD display on the Priv or is it 1080p?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  5.4 inch 1440p display.  Curved AMOLED if you want to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's ergonomically perfect, according to me.  You know, I am.  I wouldn't mind going back to a physical keyboard, I guess.  Yeah, it has a Schneider Kruzsnoch certified camera.  What's your language, Leo?  It's a family shock.  But what's so sad about this is this website is pathetic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm this BlackBerry.  It amazes me. The iPhone came out in 2007, eight years ago.  And I would say now today, BlackBerry has something that might compete with it.  Yeah. And it's on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Can I buy a Priv?  Choose a color. Black.  Just like the Model T.  Any color you want, as long as it's black.  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On Friday, it'll be at AT&T.  OK. Ships from BlackBerry directly on the 9th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You really want this phone, I can tell, Ron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to have to buy one.  Frickin BlackBerry will quote me in their blog post, but won't send me a review unit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hate it. I hate it when that happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm so astounded at how stingy some companies are and how badly it hurts them.  There are certain products that if they just gave everyone in the press one,  they would be guaranteed to dominate their market segment.  And then all these companies like, oh, we have three Aval units as soon as  Mossberg and Jason Howell are done with the three units.  Yeah, you know, and it's kind of crazy because BlackBerry is being super sleazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think the plan is to give it to the fan sites first.  Like, you know, BlackBerry is going to get one.  And then once the super positive reviews can hang out for like a week,  then they'll probably send it to two more impartial people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If it were my business, I'd do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I get the strategy. I just don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's 700 bucks, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep. But hey, man, you get a keyboard,  you get a hardware keyboard and a hardware camera button and a hardware  convenience key.  And there's like all this old school stuff on it that everybody cut off.  Right. To cut prices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why don't they have an extending antenna? That would be now.  That'd be cool.  Little slide out and that's awfully pricey.  Wow. I'm not sure I want to spend that much money to find out how bad this  might be. It'll be great.  I'll read Ron Amadio's review when it comes out and then I'll know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if he ever if they ever give him one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, great.  High, high praise to O'Malley, who two years ago said  Amazon will open a store. Watch.  He said two years ago, he said the future of of shopping  is obviously with Amazon.  It's obviously with ordering online.  But we need somewhere to go to look at it.  Yeah, we need it's the it's the Apple Store model.  It's the Microsoft. Same thing.  In fact, I got a tweet or an email from somebody said,  I wouldn't have bought the Microsoft band had I not been able to go  to the Microsoft store. I wasn't I looked at it.  I thought I don't. But then I tried at the store and I bought it.  And Amazon is opening its first bookstore in Seattle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And, you know, it's a bookstore.  And what's amazing about this, first of all, the books selection  are chosen by ratings and sales on Amazon dot com. Interesting.  So it's it's sort of kind of crowdsourced in that sense.  The other thing is that the the reason Amazon is harming physical  brick and mortar bookstores is a phenomenon called showrooming.  Right. People go to people go to Barnes and Noble.  They're like, oh, this is I want to buy this book.  And so they went about their phone and they order from Amazon  for next day delivery.  This is this is the first store that I'm aware of ever created  where showrooming is the main point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the MN7 says, I thought Best Buy was the Amazon showroom.  Exactly. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But of all the things on Amazon, I definitely don't need to see before I buy.  A book is is at the top of the list. Who cares?  Like, that's true. You can you can flip through the first couple of pages  on Amazon anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Aha. But but Ron, they're also showing off their hardware, their fire stuff.  And so it's also a kind of an Apple store type of a concept  where people can sort of be introduced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's a Kindle store. Yeah, it's a Kindle.  I did fall for the new Kindle.  I ordered the paperweight 300 DPI. It happens.  It happens.  I've bought I bought many a Kindle, which I have never used,  because I always end up using the phone or the tablet. Yep.  But I really I keep thinking this is such a good idea.  And as we know, apparently the people who use ebook readers are falling  dramatically, I think was 19 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, because of paper books, which are on the rise. They're big.  They're big and they're growing. And vinyl records.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And pretty soon we're all going to watch black and white TV  because, you know, monochrome is always better.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but I think the vinyl record thing and the paper book thing  are two different things.  The vinyl record thing is a sort of a hipster affectation.  For the most part. Oh, boy.  The paper the paper thing, I think is the paper.  And the paper book phenomenon, I think, is directly related  to the number of hours we're spending already looking at a screen.  People just can't stand looking at screens anymore.  Yes. It's like after, you know, the number of hours  people on smartphones is now about five hours a day on average.  And then we're looking at TVs and you know what?  I have a different solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got I stopped reading books. I only listen. Yeah.  That's what that was my solution.  I just I if it's not an audible, I rarely read it. Yeah.  In fact, the only books I read that aren't audible are programming books,  because it doesn't really make a lot of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. And plus they read every table.  Right. Yeah. They read the whole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Plus all of this all of this extra book and game stuff  that you can do on your phone.  It's like if you do that on your phone, you're going to kill your battery  and you're not be able to text anybody or make a phone call  or any of that stuff. So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  King. OK, talk about bad timing.  King, which creates candy crush.  Just was sold to Blizzard Activision for five point nine billion dollars.  Right. This reminds me so much of OMG Pop. Yeah.  Which was the game that sold for God a huge amount of money.  And then, of course, that not another game came out of it.  Eventually, they just shut the whole division down. Yeah.  They even already King has admitted we cannot come up with a sequel  to Candy Crush.  Just variations of the same game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this is the ultimate model for social and mobile games.  You you come up with a game that's so faddish and viral  that it becomes a household name and sell, sell the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's the smartest thing you could do.  It's an all cash transaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is three times the amount of money that Facebook spent for Oculus VR.  All cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a 25% premium to King's stock price.  It is below the public opening price, their IPO opening price.  But still, Activision is going to use three point six billion in cash  held outside the US.  That's always the problem, right?  Is you offshore your money for tax purposes, but then you can't  you can't repatriate it to buy something.  So you only buy stuff that's overseas, which helps King  because King, I guess, is in Ireland.  So Activision will use all of almost all of its offshore funds  and then borrow the rest. Oh, dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder how much Guinness you could buy with five point nine billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just one. Why is King worth that much?  I don't know. They're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if Minecraft is worth two and a half billion,  how is Candy Crush worth more than twice that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the way Activision looks at this is that it's all going to mobile.  That's what they're freaking out about.  And so they think these guys know mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Activision Activision has been great at mobile.  Hearthstone is like one of the best mobile.  Hearthstone is a good example. Yeah.  That's a good point.  Well, that's the Blizzard side.  It's the only triple A like mobile game, really. I feel like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unbelievable.  They're buying it for that advanced Candy Crush technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have tried other games.  So what does Zynga pay for OMG Pop?  Do you remember? Let me see if I could find it, because that would.  That's the classic.  You know, and two years later, they shut it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the risk of looking at previous acquisitions,  that is they keep getting so insane that the old value, you know, the old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is meaningless. You should multiply by a thousand.  Yeah, 200 million. See, they got a deal.  At the time, it was this huge amount.  $5.9 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In a couple of years, 200 million has become a paltry sum.  Yes. Except if it doesn't have a B in the word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know. But then you hear about sales of companies like, well, Gazelle,  which sold for 17 million dollars.  Yeah. Just a year ago, they got 63 million dollars in venture funding.  I have to think that that's yeah, it's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But but that's I mean, you know, they're they're actually doing  Gazelle is the humans work.  That's not scalable.  They have to individually interact with every phone they buy and sell.  Whereas with games, you just, you know, just make it once and make a billion  downloads is more or less the same. Free profit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's talk about Facebook's results.  Speaking of profit. Yeah.  One point five, five billion users.  And was this up to date?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A billion users a day now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Daily active users, a billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I believe so. Yes. Holy camole.  That is insane. And that's not counting WhatsApp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Eight billion video views a day.  Eight billion Internet.org, which was their initiative  to get the offline third world online.  Yeah. Well, 15 million plus people online every day.  Or no, I just in general, 900 million WhatsApp users.  Now compare that to what? What? Twitter's 300 some million. Yeah.  Nine hundred million, seven hundred million messenger users.  Four hundred million Instagram users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook scares me. They have too many users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Four point five billion dollars in revenue.  That's actually not that much.  I mean, they couldn't even buy a candy crush with that money.  That's not that much. Yeah.  It is. It did beat the street.  And of course, when you beat the street, that's all good for the stock price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the street hates it.  But the street hates Facebook.  I'm just saying it just doesn't sound good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The street loves Facebook.  What else?  Percentage of monthly users to come back daily is sixty four at five point one percent.  So really, really is most people just check it every single day.  And four million new users in the US and Canada.  That's more than Twitter added in the US and Canada, worldwide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, it's really impressive about their user numbers  is that they're banned in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, it doesn't even get to include it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But but Zuckerberg is working on it.  He's learning Mandarin.  And he's he's going to get into China. Net profit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Eight hundred ninety six million dollars.  And that's OK.  Again, not enough to buy a candy crush.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's really not huge.  It's amazing that they have so many users.  And I don't know, I just find Facebook so, so, so boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, you just don't have good friends.  You need better friends, my friend.  Facebook now sees eight billion dollar video, eight billion daily video views.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, those are fake. They they autoplay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, you're right. We shouldn't count that number.  You watch for a second.  You watch as you scroll by.  I scrolled in fairness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I believe the cutoff is two seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well, let's be fair.  But they did put a lot of money into R&D and.  So forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The thing that freaks me out about Facebook, in addition to their user base,  is the fact is two separate facts.  One of them is they're they're doing the AOM model.  They're trying to duplicate the Internet.  So you never have to go on the regular Internet.  You can live on Facebook, get the news on Facebook, get your video on Facebook,  get everything on Facebook.  And the second thing is that they're immune from the laws of of of nature.  They they they're the only major social network that still has a real names policy.  The total jerks about it.  It's a very biased and bigoted policy.  And there's no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, my friend. Are you serious?  Is really upset because even though his Facebook name is can't.  His real name is Ken Goffman.  Nobody's ever known him for that.  He founded Mondo 2000.  He's an Internet pioneer.  In fact, as he pointed out in a letter to Mark Zuckerberg,  hey, basically, hey, Brad, I created that thing you call social media  without me here, nothing.  They won't let him use Ken.  Are you serious?  Goffman, he has to just be plain old Ken Goffman.  That's just crazy. Yeah.  I understand. You know, we've talked a lot about the, you know, anonymity is what  fosters trolls.  I understand it's desirable to have people use their real names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But but they don't need it. They just need pseudonymity.  They should establish a process whereby you have to tell Facebook what your real name is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that what they say?  They say it's you're commonly accepted.  The name people know you by doesn't have to be a real name, just the name people.  But you had somebody on today  who they made him divide his or was that G plus had to divide his name into two names.  That's right. He was a whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. That was that was Google.  He was complaining about Google's real names policy. Right.  But the problem isn't that what their rules are.  It's not what Facebook says.  It's what they do. Right.  They don't actually have a real names policy.  They have a normal names policy.  So if I I could right now just create a new Facebook account  and I could call myself Leo Laporte and say, fine, that sounds like a real name.  But if I call myself something that sounds like it was a made up name  or sounds like a Native American name or if you have a foreign name or whatever,  they're like, oh, wait a minute.  So it's not about they don't have any way to tell if it's your real name.  They just want it to be normal, which means a Eurocentric name or commonly held.  And it's and nobody cares.  This is the thing that bugs me.  They're immune to the pressure around this.  Every other social network is because they have a monopoly on everybody. Right.  Yeah, they have a network effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They can do anything.  Facebook can do anything they want.  And you see people, you know, complain about new Facebook features all the time.  But it doesn't matter because all your friends are there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They didn't add search until last week. Right.  And you tell people, are they don't have search and people like, whatever.  OK, all my high school friends are there.  All my former coworkers, they're all my families there.  Who cares about search?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you're right. In fact, kids, I was talking to high school kids.  They know very well that their Facebook profile will be searched  when they get to the real world.  So they use a different name for their either.  They use a different name for their high school profile.  Or then when they get a grownup, they change their name to something else.  Yeah. And that works.  And it doesn't stop that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then they put phony posts for the family to see on Facebook.  And then they run off to Snapchat and do their real communication. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well, OK, we can go on and on about how bad Facebook is,  but it doesn't matter. We're all still using it.  I keep I quit at once, but I realized as a tech journalist,  you can't not use Facebook. That's right.  That's the I mean, here we are talking about.  That's a huge part of the story, like it or not.  But now I realize that's how everybody feels.  Nobody wants to be on Facebook.  You just can't not be on Facebook. It's like the phone system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, you can't say, oh, I have a small business,  but we're not going to have phones.  We're not going to have a phone number. You can't reach it.  No, you can't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love Elon Musk's quote.  He says, soon not having an autonomous vehicle will be like riding a horse. Yeah.  I think that's true.  Having a horse and buggy.  Let's take a break.  When we come back, would you like to do picks of the week?  I would sort of thing.  Your tips. I'll show you a little more about what Android looks like on Windows.  But first word from Linda Dot Com.  We love Linda Dot Com. It's a great place to go to learn.  And I presume that you love to learn.  You've got a big brain, obviously, you wouldn't be watching and listening to our shows.  And I think you probably come here because you learn.  Well, that's why Linda is so great.  Linda lets you learn what you need to know in a variety of fields, a lot of technology,  but also business. And creative skills, more than three thousand beautifully.  Professionally produced videos with teachers who work in the field and have a real passion.  So it's not going to be your boring high school teacher  droning on and on about how to use Microsoft Word.  It's going to be an exciting, interesting, dynamic, beautifully shot video  that will teach you what you need to know, whether it's what you want to take better photos,  develop an app, master Excel, sharpen your SEO skills or algorithmically changing the art of games.  Wow. Now I want to take that course. That looks awesome.  I want you to visit if you are a problem solver, if you're curious, if you want to make things happen,  you want to get a better job or keep your job or you just want to have some fun.  This is a great place to go.  Linda's courses, new courses include communications tips.  They have a lot of business skills.  Creating a business plan, executive decision making, sales, management,  fundamentals and avoiding burnout.  They have a weekly series called Monday Productivity Pointers.  Each installment gives you a quick tip on a tool that will help you run your life and business more efficiently.  I like that I tend to go.  One of the nice things about Linda is your your monthly fee covers just everything.  So you don't have to choose what you want to watch.  You can watch a little here, a little there.  It is really fun to browse around and see what's out there.  Learn a thing or two.  I tend to watch the photography, Lightroom, Photoshop stuff.  Burt Monroy is so great.  I can't miss his pixel playground and all the stuff he does is so great.  But then I also go into the coding area.  And coding for me is not a business.  It's just for fun.  And so I love it because I can just dip in and watch a little bit here, a little bit there.  Now, if you really want to learn something, you can also take it from beginning to end.  You get to do what suits you.  You learn the way you want to from the best in the business.  Take a 10 day free trial.  So you just get an idea of of what's available at Linda.com.  There's Ben Long teaching photography basics.  He's so good. So good.  Linda, L Y N D A dot com slash twig.  That's it. That's all you have to do.  You get 10 days free.  It's kind of fun just browsing around and finding.  I think that's what you did, Jay, just finding weird, you know, courses on the strangest things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hop into a category. It's fun.  It comes up. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With over 3000 courses, there's just a ton of stuff there.  Linda dot com. We thank you so much for their support.  I think it's a natural relationship between Twitter and Twig and Linda dot com.  Ron, you have a pick of the week for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a podcast called Design Notes.  It's design notes at FM.  It's it's from Liam Spradlin, who works at Android Police and does does a bunch of other stuff.  But it's a podcast about design, usually designing Android apps and talking to people that design applications and kind of what tools they use and how they go about.  Oh, that sounds great. You know, coming up with these new interfaces.  If you go down, the one that was October 1st was with Roman Nurik, who works at Google.  It was it was really interesting talking about, yeah, that one.  It was really interesting hearing them talk about, you know, what what kind of he uses internally as a guy that works at Google and, you know, how he kind of does design advocacy for other for third parties and stuff like that.  It's it's one of those areas that doesn't really get talked about a lot.  Like, you know, you can read Android news from anybody till you're blue in the face, but not too many people go into design.  And like Liam is an actual designer, like he works on Nova Launcher and all sorts of other apps.  So it's very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, here's a guy who did Nova Launcher and kind of coincidentally, this week's episode is with the designer, Fiedli Arthur Bodlewijk.  So there you go. I'm going to have to listen to this.  That's a great pick, Ron. Thank you.  And you know, it's amazing. He keeps him all about an hour.  I don't know how he does that.  That's I got to learn that skill.  Maybe I have a Linda class on that.  Keeping podcasts to one hour.  Never step one by a clock by a clock.  I have so many clocks.  The staff has provided me with clocks everywhere just so and it's like going because I'm a rebel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they embed SoundCloud stuff there, but it's on iTunes and all sorts of all that usual podcast stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, good. All right. I actually like SoundCloud.  It makes it very easy to play around the page.  Yeah. All right.  Your pick of the week, Mike Elgin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the we all suffer from the problem of Internet distractions.  The Internet is very distracting.  And from an evolutionary perspective, it's evolving, become ever more distracting.  Meanwhile, we feeble puny humans do not evolve accordingly to resist said distractions.  And therefore, we need technology to help us with that.  And I'm recommending today a Chrome extension called Dayboard.  Now, Dayboard helps you survive distractions.  And here's how it enables you to do that.  It's it replaces the new tab whenever you open a new tab in Chrome.  So you see it every time. And it gives you the opportunity to have five to do items.  So you will have to do items as probably hundreds of items.  But but really, you're not going to do hundreds of items.  No, you'll be lucky to do three items.  So what this does is you can put five, exactly five items on your Dayboard new tab interface.  It's very clean and clear.  You can click it to cross it out if you've done it.  And every time you open it, you get described, you look, oh, look, a squirrel.  And you go off to the Internet to check something out.  First thing you do is open a new tab.  Oh, yeah. TPS reports to do and all that stuff.  It also has if you if you really want to get crazy with it,  it's got a view that just shows you the first item.  And so every time you open a new tab, it's in very large letters.  Do this. And it's a great way to stay on track.  Now, if you don't complete all the items, it forwards the uncompleted items to the next day.  So the next morning, you open it up and there's the stuff you didn't do yesterday.  It runs offline. So if you're on an airplane, you open and using Chrome or Chrome OS,  it will be there for you. And they've also got a team version coming.  So if you've got a team, you can set up this whole team thing and you can look at what  other people are working on today and it has other sophisticated things.  But forget all that right now.  It's great the way it is because it will show you those five items.  And I've introduced this to half a dozen people and every single one of them loves it  because the psychology of constantly being reminded, not having to go find where is my list.  It's always coming up.  It's always popping up because you're always opening up new tabs.  Dayboard, search for it on the Chrome extensions site and you will find it very,  very productivity inducing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I use a Wunderlist for my to do list and they also do the same thing on a fresh tab,  but it could be a very long list.  So this seems like a good, maybe an alternate way of doing this.  Dayboard, it's free. It's a Chrome extension.  So I guess my pick is something I already talked about, but just a little more information on Duos  or Emi Duos from AMI.  Remember AMI, American Megatrends, they did the BIOS's for all the old PCs.  They have done a Windows 7 Android emulator.  There's two versions.  There's one that comes, I'm not sure why, with, is it ice cream sandwich?  It comes with an old version of jelly bean.  And then there's one for version 2.0 that comes with Lollipop.  It's not upgradable with the standard updater.  So it's like Lollipop 5.0.1, but that's fine.  And it also does not come with the Google Apps, but they point you to where to download it  and add it. And it's a simple thing to add it.  And when you do that, now you have pretty much on a Windows machine, an Android device.  So actually, I installed all the apps were on my Nexus 6, including Nova Launcher, my file launcher  and 500px screens, live wallpaper.  So I just have my beautiful wallpaper, all the apps around here.  And as I showed you, it pretty much works just like Android.  With a lot of space, as if Android were on a massive phone.  But I think the number one use for me now is playing video games.  Fallout Shelter plays great on this.  So do most of the apps.  In fact, almost all the apps run just fine.  It is an emulator.  I don't feel like it's particularly slow.  It just sort of hung up on me.  Well, look, what do you want?  This is better than Bluestacks.  It was very limited in what it could run.  I think I made a mistake pressing that button.  I think I praised that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you are pushing it about as hard as you can push it on that, what, 3200 by whatever screen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't really get a bigger...  Oh, I see it's downloading the latest Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the highest res Windows device on Earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks good, doesn't it?  So I think for developers, this would be a great way to try out your Android apps.  If there's an Android app you want to use that you can't get working on Windows, maybe  Netflix or I don't know, there's just something you would like to have.  It all works here.  Meerkat.  Oh, actually, camera apps don't work, at least on this Surface Book.  They may work on some Windows devices.  It's probably something about the driver situation.  Is it Windows only?  Is Windows only 7, 8 or 10?  They don't have a Mac version.  It's pretty wild.  I mean, just to see these apps on a high-res screen is pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Easily the most expensive Android tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the good news is the software is free for 30 days and $15 if you want to buy it.  So it's not horrifically expensive.  I always wanted to be able to run, particularly Android games on here because there's no...  Now, of course, I can run many of them on my Android TV, but this is kind of wild.  You know, any crossword puzzles, all of that stuff.  Pretty crazy.  It's free to try for 30 days and the website is amiduos.com.  It's Amiduos, I guess.  How do you think you pronounce that?  Amiduos.  Nobody knows.  No one knows.  Actually, after playing with this a little bit, I've invited the CEO of AMI onto Triangulation  so we're going to talk to him about this program.  Gary Vaynerchuk, by the way, Monday on Triangulation.  And the following week, Larry Wall, the creator of Pearl, will join us.  That's going to be a lot of fun.  Nice. Cool.  Ron Amadio is at Ars Technica.  He's a must-read if you are into Android.  He's the guy.  I mean, just basically the guy.  Did you ever update your on-hub review?  It's basically the same.  Your thoughts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They haven't done much in the way.  There's been like one software update, I think, that kind of changed the way  Wi-Fi worked but nothing super significant worth writing about.  I tried that crazy.  Somebody rooted it a couple weeks ago.  Turned it into a Chromebook.  I haven't been able to get that working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wouldn't worry about that.  Exactly.  And now they have a new one.  The Asus.  Built by Asus instead of TP-Link.  But it was because of your review that I cancelled my on-hub purchase.  It hadn't been shipped yet.  And I instead bought an Asus AC3200 and it's super fast.  It's a great router.  I'm so happy.  And with far more functionality than the on-hub had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's absolutely no reason to buy an on-hub today.  Someday, maybe, it will be useful.  But not right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Anyway, that's why you got to read Ron.  ArsTech.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So next week's going to be crazy, man.  I will probably end up doing a BlackBerry preview.  The new BlackBerry.  The OnePlus X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that looks nice.  Did you get the ceramic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  It's not here yet.  I would love to get the ceramic one.  I'm hoping this happens by next week.  And they're going to show off the TagCure.  Oh, yeah.  Android WearWatch from Intel.  It's going to be an Intel chip on your wrist and it's $1,800.  Wow.  It's expensive.  So the most expensive Android WearWatch.  So that will all be on ArsTechnica at some point.  I'm not going to have a review of the watch.  I'm still working on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what happens when you don't have 50 people working on a blog.  But boy, I tell you, ArsTechnica is a must-read.  And one of the things that you offer is a paid version,  which I immediately took you up on.  And I've been a paid subscriber to ArsTechnica,  I think for a couple of years now.  Oh, thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's big plans in the works for things,  redesigns, and subscriber things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't redesign it too much.  I kind of like the staid.  It's like the New York Times of tech blogs.  It's very staid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's very old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That page.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Oof.  Ooh, da.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But yeah, there's stuff happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like it.  Andrew Cunningham's Apple TV review.  Yeah, we love ArsTechnica.  I always felt like Ars was the closest to what we do  in terms of point of view and sensibility.  And I flatter ourselves, quality of content.  You guys do the best stuff.  Thank you, Ron.  Great to have you.  Anytime.  Mike Gelgin.  He's here every Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. Pacific,  1 p.m. Eastern time, 1,900 UTC for Tech News Today,  our daily morning news show.  It's like crack.  It's very addictive.  It is.  And you know what I love is that feature at the end,  how I watch tech news today.  People watch you in all sorts of weird and interesting places.  Yes, they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, they do.  And sometimes they...  Sorry, my phone is going off here.  Yeah, they do.  And then people take pictures or boomerangs.  They take a lot of boomerangs and stuff like that.  Oh, that's fun.  Boomerangs now.  Good.  And surprisingly, there are a lot of dogs that watch TNT.  Yeah.  Notice that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know what that is.  Yeah.  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Get your advertisers on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The dog whistle.  Actually, we had a bark box advertiser.  I just got a box in the mail from somebody else.  Maybe we have a new advertiser on the wings.  So tune in every Monday through Friday for Master Mike Gelgin.  I'm Leo Laporte.  Thank you for joining us.  We do Twig right after Windows Weekly on Wednesdays,  about 1.30 Pacific, 4.30 Eastern.
