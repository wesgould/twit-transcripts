I don't know  what I call you guys. Ant Pruitt is here from Hands on Photography, our own Ant Pruitt from the  Twig Studios North. You've got the window open. You're muted right now, Ant. You got the window  open because- I didn't mean to be muted. I'm sorry about that. I didn't mean that because it's such a  weird day in the Bay Area right now. There's a picture from your balcony. I'll also show you  the picture in the New York Times where they called it a nuclear winter over the Bay Area.  And this is what it looked like this morning when I got up at about 10 a.m. It's morning.  It should be bright. That's Jeff Jarvis. So good to see Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am in nice and safe New Jersey where it is. 79 degrees. Look at that beautifully lit room.  It's nice. Here it is. California is meant to be admired, not inhabited. I've come to

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  conclude. Now you tell me. Who would have thought the air would be better in New Jersey than in-  New Jersey. Hey, hey, yo. Jeff is the Leonard Towne Professor for Journalistic Innovation at the Craig  Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York. Good to see you, Mr. J.  See you as ever. And from the not burning portion of Washington State, Stacey Higginbotham-Joyce.  She writes the Stacey on IoT newsletter at stacey on IoT.com and co-hosts the IoT show

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  with Kevin Toffol. She wore that top in solidarity with California. Yeah, I was saying her top matches

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  our sky. I just I got fancy today because I did a thing with the I did a panel and

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  nice was up at 630 working like for you. Good for you. You've been you've been working hard.  So yeah, I just I mean, it's not news. Certainly not tech news, but because because the wildfires  all that never stops us. Yes. Good point. We the state of California has already set a record  for the number of acres burned 2.3 million. Awful acres burning. It's not even the height of the  wildfire season. We got them early this year because the freak thunderstorms we had a couple  of weeks ago. So we this could be the beginning of the end. It's not good. And you know, it's the  truth is ProPublica had a very good article. The president wasn't far wrong when he said we haven't  been raking our our public lands properly wasn't raking exactly what we haven't been doing is  regular controlled burns. We stopped doing that about 40 years ago. California is a Mediterranean  climate that is supposed to burn supposed to burn on a regular basis. But because we have been very  good at fire suppression, we've kind of built up a fire debt. Normally what would happen is you would  have you know these burns periodically, you know, they've been going on for millennia.  And of course, with no inhabitants, that's no big deal. As as we got to be trying to tell that to  the squirrels, but squirrels just run away. But now because they're everywhere is built up.  The state of California, which used to do these controlled burns, the ideal would be kind of a  checkerboard where you burn in safe spaces, you burn it controlled, and then you don't have these  big wildfires. But we stopped that about 40 years ago. And ever since wildfires have been worse and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  one doubts whether they could control them very well. Now, I don't think so. They're not enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  firefighters. That's part of the problem, especially since here's another. Here's another happy stat.  We used to use prisoners for five bucks an hour. We would most of the fire suppression was done by  the prisoners. But they've been sent home because of COVID. They're either sick or not in prison  anymore. And so we've lost a lot of our firefighters. So it's just a perfect storm,  or an imperfect storm. This morning, it was very red and just looked awful. And today, even now,  right now, it looks like it's twilight. It's twilight of the gods. It's got their damarung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's terrifying. Thank you for the correction. Yeah, I didn't even I never knew how that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  pronounced. I'm like, Oh, I just I just say it as I see it. What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This the the the something of the gods, damarung, the twilight of the gods, got her twilight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Damarung.  It's umlaut. You can't miss the umlaut. It's the there's two umlauts in God or damarung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, Mark Twain was supposedly said I can't never found this actual quote. It was told me.  He said, I'll bring the vowels you bring the umlauts. But I can't find that. I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And how do you pronounce this?  Good to damarung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I should ask my son who is actually proficient in German. And it does in fact, here's Valhalla in  flames. And it does look exactly like that. That's that's what we're seeing right now outside the  Bay Area. That's the Golden Gate Bridge on the right. And the East Bay right there. There's the  East Bay in flames. So I guess Stacey, you got the same thing up north.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've got less of it. But we do have we can't go outside. It's still unhealthy. And there's less

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  of smoke. I just in fact, when Stacey got on, I, I pin a pigeon hold her for a while. What outdoor

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  air sensor should I get? And I said, you should go with pigeon labs. And they have an air sensor  and you went with purple instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because my producer told me.  You always do what Karsten says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Karsten, are we gonna have to fight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  As we've already established, Karsten has photos.  So I have to whatever he says I have to do. Anyway, it's yeah, the air I'm sure is unhealthy,  but I thought it'd be good to have a sensor purple and a pigeon do maps based on the sensors that  they distribute. But the one reason I get the purples is kind of mostly meant to be worn,  right? On your body.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, the reason you got the purple is because it's Wi Fi connected and meant to sit on the  outside of your house. I want to just hang it on the day.  The pigeon is it's more of a wearable device that you like snap to your purse or your backpack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I need something authoritative because the problem is, you know, I have the Apple has a  the Apple watch has an air quality index on it. But it turns out it's getting that from Healdsburg,  which is up the road like 20 miles. It's not used.  I don't care what it's like.  Way up the road.  So this morning I got up and I looked at I said, well, honey, it's red out. I don't think that's a  good sign, but it smells fine. So I started opening the windows and doors because I'm trying to get  some air in here. And she said, close them. I'm working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I Oh, that's right. You don't have air conditioning.  No, we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it was snowing ashes again today. It smelled fine.  Yeah, my car is loaded up with ashes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I think that's part of the problem too is sometimes it doesn't smell smoky, but it's got  it. But there's air is full of hydro poisonous hydrocarbons. I know. Now I know how the dinosaurs

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  felt. Right. Honey, is it okay to go outside the cave? No, it's that damn asteroid ruin things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay, so anyway, that's the story of my I'm going to get that purple sensor and I'll put it up and  then that's why Karsten wants it. Because he knows I live close to the studio. He can check

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  before he comes in. He can check my sensor and see how there's always a method to his madness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes. There is indeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Karsten on the chat Karsten himself says Karsten knows all.  Yes, indeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All about Leo's checkered past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Karsten has a better hype man than I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So what should we talk about today kids? I'm getting the new Android phone from  Microsoft tomorrow. That's pretty cool. The Google duo. Unfortunately, I don't think it's  going to come with Android 11, which came out yesterday. So I haven't gotten that.  Well, you could get it. Just you have a pixel, right? Yeah. Yeah. Just go to your updates.  Just force an update.  Yeah. You don't have to force it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I didn't force an update. I'm just going to wait and see how soon I get it. Since it rolled out  yesterday, I said, let me just see how fast I'll get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did I get it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I never, I never wait. So I don't know. So it will tell you eventually, oh, you have an update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Eventually it just auto updates. And then you'll pick up your phone, you'll enter your pen and

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  then it'll be like, by the way, yeah, that's really, that's one thing I don't like. So I say,  okay, check for update. It says it's updated. I say update it. And it says I'll update it when

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  you're not using your phone. The only reason I'm using my phone is to update it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mike actually offered me the chance to, it was like, you have an update. Do you want to schedule  it for 1 a.m. in the morning? That is nice. And I was like, thanks Google. Thanks Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So where do I get to it? System? Yeah, it's weird. You have to dig for it, believe it or not.  There it is. There it is. Yeah. It's not an immediately obvious system. And then you have  to do advanced and then at the bottom system update. I remember on this show, we used to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so excited. We'd all spend the whole show trying for an update. All the new things are coming.  Yeah. Oh boy. It's just not exciting. The phone book is in. The phone book is in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why is it not exciting now? I know why it's not exciting for me, but I want to know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I can't name one new feature that I'm saying, oh gosh, I got to have Android 11. When was the last time?  10 was big because I feel like there was like there was I really like that  behind the scenes transcription thing. Would it live transcribe? I guess they call it.  That was new in 10, right? Or was it a pixel? Yeah. Oh, you actually used it or you just  demoed it? I use it a lot. Well, you do. Yeah. In fact, sometimes I just leave it on. I'll tell you  why. When I'm watching YouTube videos in bed, I don't want to wake anybody up. I can see the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  text. Yes. You can also use your phones. You know, mine's telling me that the new features  include improved device and media controls. I can manage my conversations in one place. That is a  lie. Google. I know it's not true. Built-in screen recording and more privacy controls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's really not different. I think maybe the one thing that you would like, Stacy, is now you have  these scenes that you can do with the Google Assistant. So when you press the on off switch,  you get the same old choices, you know, emergency restart power. But now you'll also see the Google  Pay and at the bottom here, you see these tiles that are home automation scenes. So that's yeah,  Kevin loves those. Yeah, you have to set them up. And I guess one of these days here, I'll show you  online. I have a couple of things. I don't have Google Pay payment method in here for some reason.  But yeah, that's nice. That's easy to get to. Now we're in it's true for all the devices and  all the computers too. Yep. There isn't really anything you got to you say, Oh, God, this is  huge. I got to have this. That's why I'm excited about the duo because it's a hardware form factor

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  change. Software is a big shift, big, big iteration far as form factors go. Yeah. It's not just another

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  candelabra size slate of glass. So here's that messages thing that they were talking about,  Stacy, which is you'll have you can see if you've got a thread. Oh, it went away. What did I do? I  have to refresh maybe. If you've got a thread of messages, you can see each individual thread.  And then you can control it individually as well. You can say, Oh, that's principal Tobin. That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  got to be a priority. That kind of thing. Part of me really would love to, and this is really only  an issue with my family and with Kevin, but is to be able to, they're on Google meet still or chat  or hangouts. I don't know what we're using. Some we're using hangouts and then I'm also texting them  and then. No back and forth. I kind of want to be like, show me everything from Kevin so I can,  like, cause sometimes he sends me stuff, but I don't remember where he sent it.  And the same thing with my husband. So, but that's just too hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's this bubbles thing, which I actually like Facebook introduced this,  but I also have to point out this is a security flaw. And, and Google, which knows it's a security  flaw keeps it in because initially cause of Facebook and now others, it's the ability of an  application to write over other applications. And that allows an application for instance, to  superimpose something over a form like, so you think you're at your bank, but instead it's  malicious application, just stealing the log in by superimposing something over on top of another  one. So you should only allow this if it's something you really trust the Facebook chat bubbles and now  bubbles, I guess are an Android messaging. They are not as far as I can tell in hangouts,  which is what I still use because I'm a Google, a Google fi user. So, but I think on the duo,  I will have to use this. So, but I won't have an Android 11. So it's, you can never win.  Bubbles are nice. You drag them around. You pop them. If you, you don't like that person,  capture and share content, built in screen recording. Finally.  I did. So that is surprising because Apple's had that on iOS forever.  So you don't need an extra app. You can just record with sound from your mic. So you can even

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  narrate your, your screen recording. That is the feature that excited the hard head.  Yesterday afternoon, I think it was about one o'clock or so our group hangout pinged with  Android 11 is here or something like that. That's excited. That's so cute. And he was,  he was pretty pumped up because he read through it and he saw that feature and he was like,  yes, screen recording. And it just, it really blew my mind to see how that feature excited him in

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  particular. This is a kid that barely talks to me, but he had to text you. Maybe he'll send you some

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  screen recordings. If you're right, I know that's coming. Dad, look what I did. Yeah. I, it just

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  feels like it's all, you know, smart reply, which of course we've seen first, we saw an inbox and  we see it in other places. Now smart reply will happen in your text conversations. There are app  suggestions. I don't like that at all. The bottom row of your home screen, see your most used apps  on the home screen. There apparently are better names, better suggestions for folder names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When you organize, I mean, like, who was the product manager with that stuck with that one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. I just, I feel like the problem is it's done. Yeah. And it's not much more than you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  imagine. Can you imagine what the next phase of a phone should be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It shouldn't be a phone. So what is it instead? I kind of like the idea of glasses.  I really do. I like the idea of glasses. I like the idea of a projector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's PTSD for me, but go ahead. A projector?  I wonder why. No, no, the glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He had the Google glass. He got beat up in a men's bathroom. Don't ask him about it.  That was scoville. Oh, that's right. Nevermind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway. Projector, projector. That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think at the home, having a projector integrated in more places in your, and I've seen some really  cool ones where you can actually interact with it. So when you touch, it'll project a screen on,  you can interact with it and then it'll like to press a button or to like, you know, swipe right,  swipe left, whatever. Those are kind of really interesting to me just because I don't want to  have to pull out the screen. I want the screen to just appear where I need it to be.  That's why I'm also excited about glasses. Well, and you know, Android Auto is another example

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  where it's projecting your phone onto the car's screen. And actually this is the introduction of  wireless Android Auto. So Apple's going to do wireless car play and Android 11 has wireless  Android Auto. So you don't have to connect, you still have to connect with a cable. I think that's  an example. I think the idea is that this data is going to be able to be used to connect with  this data and computing power that you're holding in your hand should manifest itself in other  places like on your eyes or on your car's screen or I don't know, on your Google Assistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you want it, you carry a little globule, a little computer globule on you somewhere  and you can have it on your phone, you can have it on the nearest TV, you can have it on a wall,  you can have it on your glasses. It doesn't matter if the computing is occurring,  but the interaction can be anywhere. Yes, it's computing at the edge, right, Stacy? Isn't that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  what the... Yes, if we would like to call it computing at the edge, sure. I would like to.  I mean, it is. It is. It is. It is the idea. Think about it less as computing as the edge  and think about it more as distributed computing. So you're computing, you're putting the compute  where it needs to be. It's locally distributed as opposed to centralized. But it doesn't...  Yeah. What's interesting is if we could figure out ways to do this and share identity in a way that  is acceptable to the user and in a way that is scalable and not controlled by like one  corporation, we could have a lot of really interesting where like my computer glob,  for lack of a better word, talks... Hey, I like it.  Yeah, I'm like computer glob. I walk into a restaurant, the computer glob can say to,  you know, the restaurant, hey, Stacy's allergic to bell peppers and she hates the following music.  And that may or may not be interesting to the restaurant. I can't wait till your computer glob

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  is fighting the other guy's computer glob because he says, I like that music and no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's what's kind of fun is figuring out like in a world where you have all of your  preferences traveling with you, how do you mediate a shared environment, which we're seeing in a  very small level in the smart home, right? And we're doing a terrible job at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But it's early days and I think you nailed it because in effect, that's what your phone is,  is your glob because your identity is in there and especially with a fingerprint or face recognition,  it's a pretty strong identity token. It's got not, it has all your preferences in there.  It has the computing power to share it, spread it. It's got the radios to do the same.  The one thing that is missing from your description is it's not economical, it's  it's either Google or Apple. It's not cross-platform. So I agree with you. We need something  that is not tied to a company that does this. But right now it's really, you're going to choose...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I could see you design that and it could switch on and off. It could license  Android, it could license Apple, it could go back and forth.  Carsten, Stacey, obviously, Carsten loves you best.  Why do you think that?  The show title already here is Stacey's Computer Glop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, but I think Stacey, you're onto something. I actually think that's,  that's an actual description of where we're headed. Except for that one, you know,  a piece where it's... But, you know, there are people like Tim Berners-Lee. In fact,  I can now kind of a little bit more understand what TBL was trying to do.  He started a new company. He's, of course, the inventor of the web. And he started a new company  that was kind of around that idea of controlling your data, having a data,  an enclave where your data is stored. And then there'd be various manifestations of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's, that's a little bit different because that's your data as well as your connectivity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no, it's the idea of your data and your identity. It's not the idea is the connectivity  is a solved problem. The next problem to solve is like, how do you share your preferences in a way?  It's basically think about it like, you've got to create a directory of people, right? And you've  got to have the like an active directory of like, who can access what, you know, and who can share  what things and it has to be federated across any service out there. And that's where you're like,  because we don't even have one identity. And we not want one item.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is solid is what he calls it. It's the solid project. And actually, there's a new,  there's a new website, I'm looking at the MIT version. Solid is a technology like the web,  but with a new level of standard, which adds the existing protocols to make it more powerful,  and particularly empower individuals at home and work. That's a singularly awful vision statement.  But it's a single global log on, it's a storage, a place to store securely and privately,  your information. I mean, it really is the phone because without internet connectivity,  without connectivity of any kind, it's useless. It's a blob. It's literally a paperweight.  But it's a glob. Get your glob. It's a blob, not a blob. Okay, so a blob has no connectivity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A glob has connectivity. Yes, right. So but Stacy, I'm going to disagree to an extent.  In essence, now the entire internet comes down to your phone. That's where it stops, right?  What we're saying with what you're saying with that is that no, now, the entire internet comes  down to your glob, but it can go back out to the restaurant, to the nearest TV, to your car,  to whatever. So there is a connectivity out from the glob that still needs to be solved.  It's solvable. It's very solvable. It's not presented to the product yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's not the connectivity that needs to be, and maybe I'm thinking you're being more  technical than you are, so that's my bad if so. But we have connectivity that allows us to talk to  the, like our glob, our phone, to talk to other globs in the restaurant.  It's not prioritized anywhere. Solid assumes connectivity. All Solid talks about is a place

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  to put your data and protocols to talk to other globs, but it assumes connectivity. Otherwise,  it makes no sense at all. So I still would submit that it's kind of like maybe a secure enclave  in your iPhone or Knox in your Samsung phone. It's a secure space only you have the keys to,  where you put your stuff, your data, and then you have the permissions. You share it,  but you still need the hardware around it, whether it's a web server or a smartphone or  something. Otherwise, it's nonsensical that you can't share it. It doesn't make any difference

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  if you have it. I'm trying to make up what glob would stand for. Chat room? A global location only

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  biome. That's it. Global location. Glob. Location oriented biome. Your global location oriented biome.  So you can breathe. I think that's very good. I think this is it. We've solved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We have solved the future of computing right here. Well, it seems to be though there's some

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  consensus that we need some control over our data. Yes, and identity. Or identities, plural.  So let me read what Wikipedia says. The project, actually, and this is a quote,  aims to radically change the way web applications work today, resulting in true data ownership as  well as improved privacy by developing a platform for linked data applications that are completely  decentralized and fully under user's control rather than controlled by other entities.  The ultimate goal of solid is to allow users to have full control of their own data, including  access control and storage location. I think that's exactly what we're talking about, right? And the  phone just is a logical candidate because it's basically your pocket computer. Well, you have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  dongle in your pocket and it can talk to a piece of glass if you like using that. It can talk to  other things. Doesn't matter. So what's the business model for that? Wait, do we have a dongle or a

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  glob? The glob has to have a dongle. Yeah, but if you don't have a dongle on your glob. You know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  what, Stacey? It's a virtual dongle because it can dongle plug into anything without the actual plug.  So it's a glob quick as a dongle glob. Are there cookies involved with this gongled blob?  Yes, we'll just call them something else so you more panic people don't get all scared of them.  So but the business model for this becomes a problem because how  does Apple make money by selling you phones? You pay for it. You pay for this and you create a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  service around it. So you say to yourself, it's a service business, not a hardware business anymore.  Right. You say, is it worth it for me for the world to adapt itself to me as an individual  and my wants and needs whenever I go places and I will pay for that? Yes. We'll call it a concierge

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  service. You know who wins that? Maybe first is Amazon. Yes, very possibly. Yeah. So that makes

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  sense. You're going to need to negotiate with commercial entities for a number of things.  Your blob storage could be Dropbox, could be your iPhone, could be Apple. So you want a trusted  partner that you could say, here, you have to keep this secure and I'm the only one who has access to  it. You have to have a company like Apple create the access mechanisms, whether it's face ID or  touch ID or whatever. And then you also have to have somebody provide the connectivity.  What we're talking about is something that computing is always needed, which is protocols  agreed upon ways of communicating. So I can say, for instance, okay, I allow this restaurant to  know what my food preferences are. You have to have that set up. And you're going to need data

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  models for all of those different scenarios. And this is why I said you got to call the IETF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. Because you need XML schema for food preferences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. So you're Reid Hoffman, who just started a new fund. And he's waiting for a  founder of LinkedIn, LinkedIn, right? So it's one of those one of those backwards IPO things,  where he has the fund and it'll buy a company to make it. That's how it goes public without  having to go public. So you're Reid Hoffman and you're an entrepreneur, and you're going

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  to disrupt Google, Apple, Amazon. It's funny you should call it that because Tim  Berners-Lee's commercial entity to do this is called Inrupt.  So you're kind of not far off. Okay, go ahead. Actually, that sounds painful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're going to start it. I got a bad interrupt in my side here.  I prefer an X-Rupt if you don't mind.  So what company do you start to do this? You're the obnoxious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel like this is something that would actually be started at a big company and spun out into an  open source project. So I feel like it's like an ethernet kind of situation that was invented.  Was it a... Who invented it? Is it 3M? I know Bob Metcalf. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow. What did he ever do to you?  Holy cow. Is there a story there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Every time I have to interview Bob Metcalf, everything boils down to ethernet. I'm like,  I get it.  Didn't you do anything else, Bob?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That is your hammer.  Everything.  Three com, not 3M. Three com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Stacey, the good news is the blob glob is going to replace the ethernet. So he's done with.  You'll never have to interview him again once the blob glob exists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like it's fine. I just, you know, you get excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I know. You talk to Vint Cerf and all he wants to talk about is the internet, the internet,  the internet, the internet. Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know you did that, but let's talk about something new and exciting. What's next?  See all the pork talks about podcasts, podcasts, podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I actually am excited by this. Part of the reason I am is because when Tim announced this,  I was like, in fact, we talked about it on Twig a year ago. It's like, what is that? I don't even  understand it. But now I think thanks to you, Stacey, we kind of, I kind of get the outlines  of why this would be. And there are definitely opportunities. I mean, the plot of existing  incumbents like Dropbox or Microsoft or Amazon might well say we want to be the trusted storage  location for your data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Some people think of it like a DNS for your data. Right. So you know how when I do a URL,  I go to a DNS lookup service. Think about that for building a service for looking up.  So there have been a couple of companies that have started around this.  There were a spate of them probably 10 years ago.  Anyway, yeah, this is fun. I love thinking about this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What really happens, I actually talked to Tim Berners-Lee about this about three or four years  ago when he advised a company that came out of MIT that I ended up investing in and briefly  advising, I did them no good because they were trying to go into media and media people were  stupid. But he was he was germinating that then. And what we were talking about is that there are  trusted third parties that can this is the key that can hold your data and have the mechanisms  to act on your behalf upon your order. Perfect. Right. And so this company, Infinite Analytics,  which is still going strong, was a way to use your social genome to improve commerce recommendations.  Right. My vision for the media, well, the reason he brought me in for a brief while,  but media people again were too stupid, was that imagine you have Hearst and Conde Nast.  And this is personalization that works for you. Right. So Hearst knows what Hearst knows about  you. Conde Nast knows what Conde Nast knows about you. Here's the third party, Infinite Analytics.  And it does a service for both of them. And it improves recommendations on both services.  But because it knows about me independently, I can give it permission to say without telling  Hearst anything to use its knowledge of me and Conde Nast and use that to improve the recommendations  I get at Hearst or vice versa. That won't work between the companies because they don't trust  each other. It won't work for me if I have to have them keep my stuff. But if the third party keeps  it and Tim was saying, Sir Tim was saying that his dream was that that was a way in which you  could store and activate your own data across multiple parties. So he's been talking about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  for years. See, I'm listening to this and it makes me think of the CRMs that are out there and how  they try to model all of this data for different customers in their system versus the different  representatives in-house and all of the gazillion different attributes and the gazillion different  scenarios that you could be put into. And it just seems like it could be a bit of a coding nightmare  from far as being a software as a service type of thing. Like that's why you need protocols,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  established protocols that make that a little easier. But yeah, this is this is never going  to happen. It's tough to see a business. Maybe not never, but she's pessimistic, cynical,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  moral panicker. She's a little optimism. She's just you just, Stacy, you just wait a minute,  Stacy, you just invented it and killed it in the same show. I didn't invent it. It's it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  it's what is that? What is that? It's part of the zeitgeist. No, no. What is the term Einstein used

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  for the thought experiment? The good Duncan? What's that? It's another German word. Anyway,  that's what we've been doing. We've been doing a thought experiment. I think really interesting.  Now here's the question. Duncan experiment experiment experiment. Duncan Duncan Duncan Duncan

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Duncan Duncan. Right after this, I've got a new German word of the week. It's a killer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a killer. It's a killer. What is it? It's a killer. You got to go down on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  rundown. I'll save it. Save it. Save it. Save it. Because I want to go back to

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Duncan experiment. There was one more thing I wanted to touch on Android 11. Save him. Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. What were we talking about? Oh, yeah. Android 11.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just downloaded. I'm excited. What else are you excited about? You know, again, my son was most  excited about the screen recording, but it also made me think about it from a content creator  standpoint. There's a lot of screens that I have to record for B roll and things like that,  whether it's something for hands on wellness or hands on tech or whatever. But it is using that  third party AZ screen recorder. I believe that's the app that I use. It works, but it'd be nice to  be able to have something native and not have all the extra hoops to jump through that I have to go

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  in and adjust in the settings menu. We've used this on iPhone for ages and it's a really nice  feature. It's actually in the control panel on the iPhone. You just press the record button and  you can do all sorts of screen recording and actually I do it all the time because you want  to show somebody something or how something looks. Yeah, it's a natural. So it'll be a nice feature.  Also, by the way, and this is how we got into that whole good Duncan, the good gong,  is these are these features that are starting to come out in iOS and Android are kind of,  I think leading us in this direction. For instance, this is another feature of 11. It'll be a feature  of iOS 14 as well. These permissions that when an app is first run or first installed, it's more and  more we're going to have the, and I guess we'll get to a point where I'm fatigued, but we're going  to have that app say, now, you know, or this chat app wants to access the location. How do you want  it while using the app just this once or never? And then this, I really like an Apple should adapt,  adopt this. If you haven't used an app in a while, Android will reset the permissions.  So it will stop doing anything you told it you could do, like getting location until such time  as you use that app again. And then it'll ask you now you've turned that's been turned off by  automatically. So do you want to turn that back on? I like that. That's something that should adopt.  This is all, but so this is my question. Clearly, this is what users want. We would love it if  no company owned this data glob that we had control of who gets it and who doesn't get it,  perhaps getting compensated if we give up permission that we'd love it to then, you know,  be something in our pocket that then talks to our house or a restaurant or environment  and interacts for on our behalf becomes an agent, a user agent for us. We would love all this,  but companies are not financially incented. So this is what I so how do we get what we want

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is the so this is what I yell at Germans about. And the Germans just whine about, oh, we don't  have Google. We don't have Google. We don't have Facebook. You're the headquarters of privacy in

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  the world. You just did a Max Headroom do that whole V starting with V don't have Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My back. We don't have Google says the Germans. We don't have Facebook. We should. This is awful.  We're going to kill you for this. And I say no, invent. You're the headquarters of privacy  in the world or as they call it dot and shoots. Can you say that? Lord Leo,  dot and shoots, dot and shoots. So which means data protection. They don't have a word for  privacy. That is a word for protection. That's a better word. Yeah. Well, so well, actually,  the privacy hasn't sold. But anyway, so I'm gonna say to them, entrepreneurially, start this,  right? Start the perfect privacy company. Where else should it start for Germany? Stop whining,  start investing, but they don't like to invest. They don't like to risk. But move ahead from that  and stop doing protectionism as a future strategy and do this. So I think that actually this is  something I wouldn't expect to come out of my mouth. But this this company could actually be

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  the child of regulation. So that is good. Good luck. Stunning. No, my question was, how do we get,  how do we get this? How do we convince companies to do it? And your suggestion is

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  let's convince the government to do it and they'll make the company. No, no, the Germans do it because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  GDPR exists and it's the ultimate GDPR compliant company. Okay. He's saying build a company around

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the current state of regulations. Okay. Right. Right. Even ahead of it. And then build a giant  lobbying arm to make sure that the regulations never change to disadvantage your company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I apologize. Yeah, because I don't know about you guys, but I've actually come to the point of  despair. No, really? Yeah, me. I used to be happy, happy, happy. I used to be happy, happy, happy.  But now I've just given up on the notion that we will, that we individuals users will ever convince  companies or government to do anything we ever we want ever again. 1475. Gutenberg. Bart Muthur

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  isn't even born yet. The Reformation hasn't happened yet. Yes. The 30 years war hasn't come  yet. No one has invented the essay. No one has invented the newspaper. No one has invented the  modern novel. We are in the stone age of the net. Just calm down. Has anybody invented Dattenschutz  yet? They think they have in Germany, but they haven't. Tim Berger's League might invent it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I just I because I feel like  I don't know. I think the people with money have so much money now that there's nothing we can do

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  about it. Can we just get that just right there? A cut of that and we can just in the show just say,  and now let's take a moment for Leo's existential despair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And then we'll just move on. Well done. I don't see any move on. Just say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  pretend none of that is true and that we have that we have some sort of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's not pretend. So we acknowledge that that's the reality. But we also say it is  fundamentally human to not give up to fight against these things and work our way around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I just I feel like we have no agency at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We have agency, even if it's just to stop using these products. And you know what?  I am slightly optimistic. It's not going to go 100% the consumer way because there are other  interests at work and consumers honestly are wrong about some things. Like we want everything for  free and we want it to be the best and most awesome. And we don't want to take, we don't  want to pay for externalities and all that. Right. But if you look at what happened in the smart home,  everyone was like, yeah, we've got this. And they built all these things and no one bought them.  Yeah. It will know it. But now the, the powers that be are like, well, crap, that didn't work  out the way we planned at all. Now we're going to have to work together and create some standards.  And now we won't have as much lock was born. And that's why they're doing this project ship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do you think though, I speaking from my little corner of God or Domero,

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Good to demo room. Good to demo. There you go. You can say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Look, it looks like it's the middle of the night outside. It's three in the afternoon. And my  little corner of the fireball burning world, it seems like, oh yeah, Apple, Amazon and Google  are going to just get together and there'll be an open source smart home standard that we'll all  be using next year. Do you believe that? Do you think project chip will do better than anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  else that's tried? I believe that it will make life easier in a lot of ways for a lot of consumers  and a lot of people building products. Will it solve every single problem? No. Will it address  the red sky out there? Absolutely not. That's we, I'm just pointing that out as a,  we have felt kind of despair over things not working for a long time in the space.  And then the fact that nobody bought into it was a signal that the companies had to listen to.  When we talk about things like climate change, if we want to go to there,  we're going to have to make some painful choices and companies are going to have to make painful.  I think some of that's starting to happen. We're seeing more people who are young become  vegetarian. So in seeing like, seeing lots of small changes, will that be enough? I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But see, Stacey, Leo and I were children of the sixties. Yeah, we thought we were going to  form the world. We were going to end the Vietnam War. We were going to bring racial harmony.  We were going to kill capitalism. We were going to bring a global peace.  We were just the best and look what we did to the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, y'all were a bunch of selfish kind of pokes and I get it. But I think we're,  I know that I have become much more conscious of the unseen, the externalities and the things I  choose to purchase, the way I spend my money. I also know that I'm very privileged in the sense  that I have money to make those choices. I don't have to buy non-organically produced  cotton or something like that, right? I can buy fair trade coffee for an extra  cost, but I'm willing to make those things and I don't know if it's helping, but I'm putting my  money where my values are right now because I have the ability to and because I think it's more  important than just buying more stuff. And I think other people are doing the same.  And I think there are people making choices that will help. And I think we need to just get things  and I think we need to just get things like our stock markets and our fiduciary duties  aligned with where we really want things to go. And I think that's hard right now, given  some of the leadership. These are hard problems, but at least we're talking about them. At least  people are starting to acknowledge them. And in some ways the backlash is so large because  we're talking about them more and it's threatening more people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I feel so much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What about people?  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You want the German word? You want the German word?  Yeah, what's the German word?  It'll make you happy. Go down on the rundown. No, I'm not going to say it. You've got to play it.  I've got to play it.  Don't worry, Karsten. It's like a Facebook video. There's no music or anything. It'll be fun.  And where did you put it?  It's down on the rundown. It says...  Line, line, line. I see it. I see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The one that says, starting burden hardened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes, that's it.  Okay.  You're going to love this.  Okay.  You're going to love this.  Oh, I'm not a Facebook user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Use Facebook, but you're going to love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do you see what it just did, by the way? It put a picture of this guy and said, you know,  if you want to see more of him, you could sign up. Okay. Here you go.  This is how you call cats in German.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's Korean.  Kiss, kiss, kiss.  That's Russian.  The cat came.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Chinese.  Italian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, German and all this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What does that mean? What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The link below, the link below. He goes on forever with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He does. He calls his cat and only it says, but it can mean a lot of things. For example,  I love you or hey, look at me or come here. It's used to get the attention of animals  and it works because it's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Hardenbart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's only words for cats.  No, that's that's that's that you just been a Swedish.  Swedish chef says that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Speaking of the Swedish chef.  Yes.  If you have Disney.  Oh, what a Swedish chef.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amazing.  Yes.  Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, I do have Disney plus.  Yes.  Swedish chef cooking segment on the Muppet show.  Yes.  Is amazeballs. I love it so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is this a new one or the old one that's been around for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the new Muppet talk show that they rebooted for Disney plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And you're telling me, are you telling me that they, wow, they have a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wonder if I still know my Disney plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's Booky Dooky Cooking.  Booky Dooky Cooking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, that's what it's called and it's so great. They had, they have the best people  come on and make things and the Swedish chef is just ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I could, you know, if I were, for instance, right now to play that,  I think Carson would actually fall over dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, we can't play it.  Should I try it?  I'm just going to let you all know that that you all should, if you have it,  you have to do the whole show.  But the Okie Dokie Cooking, so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is the Muppets.  No, I mean, that's the movie, the Muppets.  You're saying there's a now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  More trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's a show.  On ABC.  Yeah, it's Muppets now.  The Muppets return with a documentary style show.  Let's see if I can find the Swedish chef.  I know Carson's already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's called Muppets now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Having, yeah, Carson's already having a little bit of a heart palpitation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, Carson.  Our work here is done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He's done.  He's turning red.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's you're looking at him through the air.  I see it.  It's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay. Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  It's just the air.  Okay. He's fine.  Oh, I don't see.  Oh, here it is.  Oh, is this it?  No, that's Fozzie Bear.  Something went wrong.  Please try again.  If the problem persists.  Oh, I don't have DRM enabled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, is that part of your cookies as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Firefox is installing components it needed to play the audio or video on this page.  Please try again later.  Carson is saved by the Firefox, but he wants to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He says, did you see this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Apparently pregnancy tests that have displays have little computers in them.  And a guy has created doom on a pregnancy test.  This is you're welcome.  You're welcome.  Thank you.  This is kind of a meme is doom on something.  Now he admits.  Well, it's really just a video of doom playing back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, but then the next day.  What?  No, here he's playing it.  Oh, this is now he's actually playing it.  Just playing a video.  Now he's really playing it.  He took the challenge.  I presume it's he.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So the reason this works, apparently.  Who else would waste their time?  The pregnancy test, the digital one, same test.  It's still got a paper strip, which still does some patterns color, but there's a scanner.  This is such a, this is, this is a perfect example of consumerism in the end times.  It wasn't enough.  Or geeked them, Leo.  Or read a paper test.  They have now built a disposable plastic thing, one use thing that has inside it,  a computer and a scanner that scans the paper test and then the computer converts it to  thumbs up or thumbs down.  I don't know what the result is.  It's a sufficiently sophisticated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tells you you're very pregnant.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sufficient sufficiently sophisticated computer in this one time use disposable piece of plastic.  You could play Doom on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Low res.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But see now you're so much for Moore's law, right?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel like you not buy the digital.  I please don't buy the digital one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Use the paper strip one, but plus or minus is okay.  Unless you want to play a game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go get a rabbit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Get a rabbit.  Yeah, that's true.  At least we're not killing rabbits anymore.  Right.  That's a good point.  Single use rabbit is even worse.  Yeah, that's true.  So here, here's the closeup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See Leo, technology improved.  It saves the lives of rabbits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's for sure.  This is good.  Are you old enough, Jeff, to remember that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Rabbits?  Yes, but I didn't cause anybody to get tested.  No, I'm just saying, I'm just saying.  I swear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think that they stopped using rabbits before I was of age, but that was the thing.  They would call up with joy in your voice and say the rabbit died.  Rabbit died.  Yes.  And that meant you were pregnant.  That's horrible.  So we've come a long way.  You're right, Stacey.  We no longer, we don't even eat rabbits anymore,  but we can't put doom on a pregnancy stick that you pee on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So people still eat rabbits?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, French.  Do they count?  You buy rabbits for consumption in the US.  I'm just joking.  I know, but we don't because we're good people.  We don't eat little Peter Rabbit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There was actually a fascinating article a couple months ago in The New Yorker about  the tensions between regulations around rabbits because they're both, all the organizations  are either pet owners or eating rabbits.  So there's a lot of conflicting desires in those two groups around any rules.  It was really kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm bummed because it turns out he actually had to breadboard in the CPU.  This is just, this is not fair.  He's not playing doom on a pregnancy stick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When he did the video one, was that the case too?  Do you have to use a breadboard?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He says the existing CPU cannot be reprogrammed.  The existing LCD can only show four things.  So I had to replace both to make any changes.  That doesn't even count.  That's not a pregnancy stick doom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.  Well, let's move to, I don't know.  What are we excited about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm trying to find something that's not dystopian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We didn't even talk about Chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, let's talk about Chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you want to know what they actually said?  Yeah, I'm actually confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, because it sounded like it was now part of Zigbee Alliance.  Is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So when they announced it back in December,  they created it under the Zigbee Alliance.  Here's my sources and common sense say that eventually the Zigbee Alliance,  if Chip is going to be the more successful project,  will one day separate these out.  But for now, and Chip will run on top of Zigbee thread.  Right.  And to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here's the, here's the pyramid from the Zigbee Alliance page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And if you go to the GitHub, they actually take that blue application layer  and they split it out even more.  Oh, interesting.  So they talk about, you know, framing the framework for the request.  They talk about security.  They don't give you a lot of details.  But the new news here, the biggest news is that they're still on track to release products next year.  So, yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now, I do have a question because Zigbee is a competitor to Z-Wave.  And not compatible with Z-Wave, right?  Until the big players, Apple and Google and Amazon got into this,  it was like Zigbee versus Z-Wave.  And then even before that, what was the other one that everybody bought  that, you know, is practically the clapper.  It was like really, anyway, there were these warring protocols,  none of which understood anybody else.  If Chip is part of the Zigbee Alliance, does it eliminate Z-Wave  or are they all just going to come together?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they're not necessarily going to come together.  So the thing to know is Zigbee and Z-Wave and all, they solved radio issues.  So they solved the actual connectivity problems.  So they were in the hardware layer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They were really lowered down.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So when you think about what Chip is going to solve,  Chip is going to solve, it's going to create a standardized layer for things like,  hey, how do we connect this connected light bulb to the internet?  It's a software layer.  And then once, yeah, and then the application layer.  Then it's also going to say things like it's going to build a data model  or a framework as we were talking about earlier with things.  This is going to say, hey, and that the light bulb will be able to say things like,  I'm a light bulb.  I can turn it on.  I can turn it off.  I can change colors.  I could do this.  And all of that will be standardized because right now you actually have to do that individually  for each platform.  And it's a pain in the butt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I know.  So I can see why manufacturers would like to say, look, we'd like to have one  application layer that talks to everything.  Right?  That's what they're going to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The question then, yes.  But then the question becomes, how far does that standard go?  Does it go so far like HomeKit did that you don't need to download the app  for like the connected door lock you bought?  Because the people making the connected door locks are like,  hey, I need you to download the app.  I want your address.  So these are some of the fights that people are having.  Fights is a really strong word.  But these are some of the debates in places where you're trying to get value.  And if you're like, should I be able to talk to Madam A and Siri and ask them  both the same thing?  Should I be able to set up Madam A and Siri once and have it work across all those platforms?  That's not going to happen.  So there's a lot going on there.  We got a ways to go.  That's beyond just the radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We got a ways to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because really you think that Glob is a funny name, Zigbee, Chip, all these things.  It's a good name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Z-Wave, by the way, just the global location oriented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the Google Lovers Online beloved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I feel like so I did recently and actually this is kind of worth mentioning on this show.  We finally got tired of I had two Wi-Fi networks in the house.  I had Comcast Business, Comcast Consumer.  It was just a mess.  And Lisa was yelling at me all the time.  So we finally got somebody in and they put ethernet throughout the house.  They crawled up in the attic.  They crawled in the crawl space.  There's ethernet jacks everywhere.  In the house and they installed an industrial grade Wi-Fi network throughout the house.  And they, thank God, not me, called Comcast and upgraded us to gigabit down and 40 megabits up.  Or you.  Which is really nice.  So that's all been resolved.  But what hasn't been resolved is I have now because we renamed the Wi-Fi.  So we started fresh, go through the house.  There's 30 or 40 little doohickeys that all have to be reprogrammed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And nobody is the sequel to the cookie drama.  Nobody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Nobody does it even the same way, even within a single company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So some of them like so Google the Nest Hello Doorbell.  I just go out there and the Bluetooth they connect and I say, hey, new Wi-Fi.  And I can do it.  But the Nest camera, I have to scan a QR code on the back of the camera, which is 10 feet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  worth of remoral panic about technology and security and privacy and everything.  So they added this for you, Leo.  Stop complaining.  That was within the same company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that is some of the stuff that should be resolved.  No, it's basically like, hey, when we built this, this is what we used.  This was state of the art.  When we built this, we were excited about this.  So we tried this out.  So you're going to see one way to get things on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Will I be able to go to my phone, run the chip app and say, hey, all of you little guys,  guess what?  There's a new Wi-Fi in town.  And here's the password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this maybe this actually ties into like the issue of, you know, if you want all your  things on the same Wi-Fi network, not everything will be on your Wi-Fi network.  Some things will be on the hub.  So you're going to have to manually discover your devices on your Wi-Fi network.  I imagine here's what I think is probably going to happen.  I bet it's going to be a QR code.  That's my thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That'll just be the way it is.  There'll be a QR code and everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  QR codes are going to be subject to nostalgia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It'll be with a QCAT.  It'll just be another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Once you have your blob, it will just know it.  It'll be smart.  It'll do it.  You don't need this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It'll be psychic.  No, you're also going to want to take everything out of your Amazon or Google  ecosystem.  Just basically do a hard reset, hardware reset.  Because otherwise when you change everything up, it'll double count some of your things  and then it gets all confusing and you don't want that.  So just take everything out and it's a pain.  They don't have an easy way to dump all your data unless you do a hard reset.  Just let you know.  I've been there.  Done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, let me tell you.  I did all of the Google devices.  Now I have to do all the Amazon devices.  Then I have to do all the Sonos devices.  Then I have to do all the Hue devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And I did all the Nest devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We should have had this pain as part of our twit bits.  This is good content.  And watch you walk around and fussing all of the devices that you need to reconnect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So and now, okay, so now it's all.  You cursed too much, Ant.  And then yeah, dag, navet, the dead gum routers.  So now Steve Gibson yesterday throws me a curve because he's for the first time ever,  Steve never had any IoT devices in the house.  What does he do?  Oh, Steve.  He decides what do you want?  He wanted to be able to turn on the AC remotely so that when he gets to the office, it's cold.  Because it's been really hot around here.  So instead of just doing like a normal person would do is get a Nest thermostat, right?  Then it's all done.  You don't know.  Or an AKB.  Yeah, or something.  He got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  An AC connected thermostat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh my God.  He got some Chinese thermostat.  It was only a hundred bucks.  And then he got a bunch of Globus Chinese power,  Wi-Fi without a hub, power plugs.  And he bought a thermo sensor.  He got like five, all these different things.  And now, of course, because they're all from no name Chinese companies,  he's thinking, well, this is dumb.  I just put interlopers into my network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why can't he do that?  He's a security reporter.  That is like the first advice I give people when they're like,  I don't want to bring my network to its knees.  What do I do?  I'm like, buy from established vendors.  That's what we've always said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Buy Ecobee or Google Nest.  And then you at least, and they patch it.  And then by that means, still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I need to ask him what he's thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, but wait, there's more.  So he's spent a lot of security now talking about how do you take these IoT devices.  And I guess his position is, it doesn't matter.  You still have to isolate whatever,  even if you get it from Google and Ecobee,  you still have to isolate it from your main network  because you never know when there's a security problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wrong.  So here's the issue.  Or maybe it's not wrong, but that is,  if you want to do anything, like tie it to your phone.  So if you do geofencing, for example,  you need the things to be on the same Wi-Fi network.  So you can say, oh, I'm on the Wi-Fi network.  Now I need to turn this on.  Or, and what you're doing is you're going to send,  nothing will run locally.  Everything will then go over the cloud.  Well, so that's what I asked him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And run it on a separate network.  I asked him that and he said, well, they always, they do that anyway.  They're always going out to the cloud anyway.  Is wrong.  Well, okay, so I was going to ask you this.  No, no, I was going to ask you this because when he said that, I said,  oh, I guess that kind of makes sense that they don't talk to each other  on the local area network.  They both talk.  So you're, when your phone talks to, let's give you an example,  not Steve's example, but I've got a Hue Hub, which controls the lights.  My phone talks to it.  It's not going to it over the network.  One 28.1.  It is.  It is.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Unless, so your Hue actually, Hue is a great example because they actually  make you set up a remote blog.  And so you actually have to, everything is local unless you.  Okay.  Yeah, because I can control it from the, I could control it from the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But you're saying if I'm not specifically telling it, I want to control it from the  internet.  If I'm in the same, if I'm on the same subnet.  House, it's local.  It's local.  Okay.  See, that's what, see now someone's insured.  Steve said, oh, no, no, no.  But I guess it always.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So things like the other issue is things like your doorbell camera.  You want that on the same wifi network because it's faster.  Right.  Right.  And you want that to talk to like your Google Home Hub.  So my hello.  On the same note.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  When it's talking to the hub.  Yeah.  It's talking to one 20, one 92.168.1.100 talking to one 92.168.1.202.  And they, they go, they know each other's IP address and they talk to each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google is implementing local control for some, but not all of their devices.  When I'm talking about local, I'm actually talking about your, your phone.  Talks to the doorbell.  I'm pretty sure.  Well, I would add delay does talk directly.  Can you find out?  They built that with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Can you find out which devices talk over the land and which devices use go out to the  internet and come back down?  It does seem like that round tripping would be undesirable, but it's his contention  because what he then did.  So he bought these, these, these wifi outlets from this Hong Kong company called GoSund.  Ever hear of them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have heard of, we actually talk about this.  For some reason I have.  Okay.  And then he got a $39 GoVee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Logging thermometer.  And then he got a thermostat.  That's let's see from Emerson electronic, a $91 thermostat.  So he's got these devices and now at first he said, well, you could put your wifi,  you could have a guest mode and just put them on the guest network because then they only,  they don't have access.  Now I've talked to other people said, no, if something's on the guest network,  it doesn't mean it can't get across the network to other devices, but he said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not a wholly new air gaps network.  It is not.  Cause Kevin and I actually set up guest networks and put all of our IOT devices on it and it  caused no end of trouble, but it also meant you could actually see the things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So a malicious device could still get into your network.  So the guest is not sufficient.  So he then suggested if for people who don't have a guest mode, he said the guest mode  would be okay.  But for those who don't, he says you get a cheap 2.4 gigahertz only wifi access point  and you set it up in effect as a set isolated IOT network coming off of your main network.  And so it's a two router solution.  Basically, he's always talked about a three router, but he said, well, now you really  only need two routers place it upstream of your primary network, wifi router,  then plug your primary network secure router into that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or he can buy a ubiquity router that lets you actually create truly virtual lamps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's recommended that and I have that and it's not expensive.  $50 for the edge router X, which is a four port POE router that you can set up VLANs  and they wouldn't theoretically be isolated.  You have up to four different VLANs isolated.  Actually, that's probably if I were going to do this, what I'm going to do.  Do it seems like a lot of work and yeah, it's going to muck up some things.  So that's my real concern is that things won't work as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What was his rationale for going to all this rather than just buying a national?  What was his argument?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Just because he's Steve, no, because he would never.  He doesn't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's not going to buy a Google solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's going to do it his own way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I didn't ask him.  I didn't ask him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know why.  Those pods from China from somewhere that didn't sound like he was too familiar with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think that, you know, he's assuming now.  So by the way, this is how Google does it.  It's called zero knowledge or zero trust rather, which is you can't assume that anything on  your network is safe.  Used to be we'd assume anything within the network is ours and so it's okay.  And he comes from and Google comes from and I think the modern consensus is trust nothing.  Okay, that's fair.  Right.  And I think that's sensible, especially in a high security network.  And I guess if you're Steve Gibson, you probably say, well, my network should be high security.  Right.  So I guess he's going from that zero trust point of view.  But I do.  I am concerned it won't work.  I guess it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The problem is the benefit of networking devices, right?  Is that you have a network and they can talk to each other over the network.  So if you don't trust something on your network and you isolate it, then you're limiting the  benefits you get from having it on the network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.  And I would guess he would say, well, then I'm not going to use it because I don't trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just spent so many hours in time buying these cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Steve doesn't mind that.  That's Steve.  That's his thing.  Right.  So he doesn't mind that part.  In fact, I'm sure he got a lot out of it.  He enjoyed it.  You're right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have we done an ad yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We could do an ad right now.  But listen.  I'm just curious.  I would love it if you, Stacey, listen to Security Now.  It was yesterday's show, episode 783.  It's titled IOT Isolation Strategies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.  And I would refer you to the local home SDK on Google.  They have a page that talks about how it works and what goes locally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So they do use some local stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't see the hello on their list.  So I don't know if the hello actually talks to the hub yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Locally.  Okay.  Interesting.  Really interesting.  So there's still a little bit of an unanswered question, which is  how many devices talk over the land as opposed to through the internet to each other?  So interesting question.  Really interesting question.  And you know what?  Steve is our security guru.  So I'm sure there's good reason for everything he's doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I'm curious to hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel like as your security guru, I have some questions for him.  About his device choices.  I mean, they may work for him, but the other thing to think about is we can't expect normal  people to do things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not even going to do that.  What is he?  I mean, is he showing off there?  Like, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's talking about how you would do it if you were in a zero trust network.  How would you isolate these?  But honestly, everything you put on your network is a threat.  Even your router, as we well know, has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which is why you shouldn't, which is why you may try for zero trust, but in an environment  like that, I feel like you should have continual monitoring and updates and maybe automatic  quarantining.  Right.  But.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  It's interesting.  I'll just put it this way.  I'm not going to get an argument with Steve over this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I might.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will let you.  That'd be fun.  I'd pay for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We may have a cage match a little later on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think an IoT cage match is a very good idea.  That would be a good show.  It would be.  Steve, what were you thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Steve's an old school.  He's an old school, do it yourself kind of guy.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he's the expert of experts.  Yeah.  He knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Melissa.  Melissa is a company that helps you keep your customer data good.  Did you know?  I didn't know this.  30% of customer data goes bad every year.  People move, but also email addresses go bad.  Phone numbers go bad.  And also duplicates can be a real problem.  That customer list you have is slowly rotting away.  Melissa can make sure your data is accurate and current and fresh.  So you reach the right customers.  Their tools have helped keep businesses data fresh for over 35 years.  They started with zip codes.  Now they do it all.  Addresses, emails, phone numbers, names even in real time.  Oh, I love it that they've got a Petaluma address in there.  Incorrect data entered by customers.  Happens all the time.  Fat finger it.  You've done it.  I've done it.  Simple human error.  Customer service reps making a mistake.  Duplicated records.  Makes it easy for bad data to find its way into your system.  But Melissa can help you verify your data.  They can even do it right at the point of entry.  So they've got a great API which you can add to your point of sale or your customer service tools.  You've probably encountered it in the past when you're talking to a customer service rep  and you give them the first few letters or your name or the first few numbers of your address.  And they say, oh yeah, I've got it right here.  Or they know your zip code ahead of time.  That's Melissa going to work.  Melissa's matching and deduplication tools can help you uncover,  merge and purge hard to find duplicate records.  Their flexible deployment options mean you can set it up to suit your needs.  Your business size, your preferences, your budget.  They have flexible on-prem solutions.  They've got a web service.  They've got secure FTP processing.  So you can just upload a list and download the clean version.  They have software as a service delivery.  You can choose the best way to meet your specific business needs.  And it's important for you to know since you're going to be giving them your customer data  that Melissa continually undergoes independent security audits  because they're totally committed to data security, privacy and of course compliance.  In many industries they have, you know, there's GDPR, there's a California privacy.  They're completely compliant.  They have the utmost dedication to your data security.  They implement strong controls and safeguards so your data is safe.  Over 10,000 businesses trust the address experts and you can trust them to make  Melissa your foundation for data-driven success.  They can even add demographic information.  Public records like property and mortgage data, marital status, social media handles.  They'll fill in the gaps.  They add emails and phone numbers as you're entering the customer record.  You can also identify current customers which will allow you to find new prospects  through Melissa's prospect database.  There's a lot of great tools at Melissa.  I want you to try it.  By the way, Melissa is supporting communities and qualifying essential workers right now  during COVID-19.  Your organization may qualify for six months of free service.  By applying online go to Melissa.com slash twit.  No one should put up with sour customer contact data.

At Melissa.com slash twit.  That's Melissa.com slash twit.  Thank you, Melissa, for supporting this week in Google.  And thank you this week in Google listeners for supporting us by going to that website.  Melissa.com slash twit.  Yeah, I think I'm just going to let my IoT devices live as they wish.  Float freely.  Be free on my land.  Enjoy.  It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you have a device on your land to track what they're doing?  So you said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How do I do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there are a bunch of outside devices.  I mean, they provide some sort of indication like things joining the network.  But that device, the Firewallet I mentioned, that tracks where the devices on your network go.  I think Bitdefender has one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right.  That's a good idea.  So you could put something on your network, another IoT device on your network,  that monitors the IoT devices and makes sure they're not phoning home inappropriately.  Or does it maybe monitor for patches?  Or what it must be doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A lot of them do DPI.  A lot of them are doing deep packet inspection.  So it's not just the IoT devices.  And it's very clear when you put something like this on your network,  you should tell everybody in your household what it's doing.  Because you will be able to see things like where your wife goes online,  like what site she goes to.  If you look at that data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no.  I wouldn't do anything without her permission.  We use, I'm using something I really like it called Next DNS.  I've talked about this for a while.  It's kind of like a Raspberry Pi in the cloud.  So all our traffic goes through that because I modified the DNS instead of using Comcast DNS.  I use Next DNS.  And it allows you to do all sorts of security monitoring.  I don't know exactly.  I feel like it's protecting me against certain kinds of issues.  And then it also blocks malware, which is great.  So I think that's a really good thing.  And I don't use all of this stuff.  There's parental controls on it.  This is a really nice service, inexpensive service.  Plus you get analytics, which is great.  You can see how many queries are blocked.  This kind of stuff.  So this is just a software service, Next DNS.io.  But I bet you something on the network would probably even do a better job.  No normal person's going to even be aware of this.  I don't know how we solve this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's why a lot of these devices are geared towards consumers.  Comcast actually, they actually offer a fairly nice service that does some of this automatically  as part of your Xfinity home or Xfinity Wi-Fi.  XFi, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because I can see what's connected to mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  And they'll do some basic network monitoring.  I know Eero offers a little bit of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, Eero Plus is pretty good.  We're not using Eero anymore because we're using this new thing that this  company put in.  So I don't know.  It's a company called Arachnus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Arachnus, fancy high end CDS server.  Spiders, Spiders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it sounds like spiders.  But yeah, I actually talked to the company and I said, well, what about Ruckus?  Can we use Ruckus?  Because we use Ruckus here in the studio.  I said, this is the same.  It's the same as Ruckus.  Use the same chipset.  It's just, you know, he really liked it.  Now I'm really nervous.  He said, but the good thing is we can manage it remotely.  So they can log in.  They can log into our network.  You trust this stranger?  Yeah, he's a nice guy.  So part of the reason I did this is because Lisa was really suffering and she's in the  work at home thing.  I get to come to work, but she gets to work at home.  And so we did this so that she could call them if there's a problem  instead of having to call me.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I made a huge mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, we're terrible people.  We're like, Leo's like, oh, we're like, do you know why I'm despairing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do you now know why I'm despairing?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Steve is going to come over and replace everything he has with a steam powered thing.  Yeah, I don't know.  I give up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I just give up.  Tweet from Zach James.  And I would love to know what you guys think of this attention.  In the last 24 hours, YouTube publicly but quietly admitted to using your Google activity  to recommend videos.  They did this after I exposed this fact via tweets yesterday.  This section was not in the privacy statement until today.  Recommendations using your Google activity.  So they've been doing that for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they apparently, he says it was.  Fine, they didn't put it here, which is stupid.  But this is not some secret.  They've been doing it for years.  That's been the whole antitrust fight about the fact that they pulled all together under one ID.  Right.  We've known this for ages.  That's what I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You can go to myactivity.google.com and you've always been able to do that  and see what they know about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've dropped ourselves to a tweet scoop.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I'm just giving you a chance to shoot it down.  This was nothing.  It's shot.  Is there anything bad about them?  I don't think there's anything bad about them using everything they know about me  to recommend YouTube videos.  You don't have to do it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've said it before.  I like what the algorithm does for me and YouTube because I watch YouTube more so than watching  regular television shows.  And the algorithm just, it just gets me.  Even if I'm changing my mind on certain things that I normally seek out during the week,  it picks that up and says, well, maybe you like this too.  And it works.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So sorry I even mentioned it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't spend enough time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do you watch YouTube?  Do you let your kid watch YouTube?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  We watch a lot of SNL and she does.  She has all her lo-fi, ASMR-y things that she plays while she studies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And you can turn that off.  You can manage that in your privacy settings.  I mean, obviously Google knows, like everybody knows, about the tyranny of the default.  And defaults are what 99% of the time are chosen because nobody's changing anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I do like the fact that say I'm looking for how to repair a dishwasher or  something like that.  I'll go and look that up on YouTube here at my desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You pick up the yellow pages, Ant, and you call the person.  Okay.  I just did a TLDR for you there.  The what?  Go to the yellow page.  What is that?  You call them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The yellow pages?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that that thing I put up under my chair so the chair level's off?  That's right.  That's right.  See?  You have some yellow pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wow.  They don't still.  I haven't seen yellow pages on my doorstep in a long time.  I actually haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I asked students, do you know what a yellow page is?  They all know.  Yeah.  They all say, oh, yeah, yeah.  They know the yellow pages.  I'm sorry, Ant.  I couldn't give up for a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There is yellowpages.com.  You could always go to yellowpages.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My mother-in-law actually keeps yellow pages in her car at all times for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Throwing at people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a mother-in-law thing to do.  I think it's because if her smartphone doesn't, I don't really understand it, but sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ant, I'm sorry.  I interrupted for a cheap joke.  Keep going.  No, it's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm saying that if I'm looking to repair a dishwasher or something like that,  I'll look it up here at my desk, trying to find different steps or whatever on YouTube.  I'll go downstairs later on in the day to end my day, if you will, and watch TV.  I may see one or two of those related videos pop up as a recommendation,  but I won't see it every single day after that.  It's not like how Amazon will keep putting those cookies out there because it saw you  shopping for something and it just shows up every single day until you finally just  yell at it enough or delete your cookies.  I think YouTube gets it right from the algorithm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google News does not or Google Assistant does not because I will search for things  that I will get just the stupidest stuff for two weeks afterwards.  Weeks.  It kills me.  And that could be annoying.  No, it's totally annoying.  I'm like, I am not interested in L brackets.  Why do I have to tell Google that I'm not interested in L brackets?  For the longest time, I was getting barbed wire advertisements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know what it was I searched for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, these aren't advertisements.  These are like content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Content about L brackets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was also surprised that there were multiples like news articles that were recent.  So yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For those.  Did you get your Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did.  I got my updates.  Yay.  They're nice.  Did you see the new emojis?  Oh, I didn't see them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You can now do this.  I don't know what it means, but you can do it.  The pinch the fingers and thumbs.  Hey, Chef Kiss.  I don't know what it is, but that's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, that's the Italian thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't that something from Don Finucci in Godfather 2?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think it's so generic that you can use it.  It's like the eggplant emoji.  Use it for whatever you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, the eggplant emoji is not at all generic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now, a word from the yellow pages.  Can you put my sound up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  Yellow pages is a pet.  Whether you already have an animal or looking for one, sit.  And you will find pet shops, kennels, even veterinary services.  This is creepy.  Close to where you live.  So before you go walkies, give yellow pages a thumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I had no idea yellow pages had a TikTok channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's a British one.  And it's funny because now we have to explain walkies  to a whole group of people who don't remember walkies.  Here's another one.  No, that's not it.  Oh yeah, here it is.  This is British also.  That's not the yellow pages jingle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, that's a fake.  This is Furner's yellow pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That is the strangest thing.  It's a yellow pages cover band.  I want the let your fingers do the walking with the yellow pages.  Right?  Right.  I've seen yellow pages in the real world a couple years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In North Carolina, they were dropping them off in our neighborhood.  And like I said, they weren't as big as I remember them.  So I guess that means people aren't buying as much space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know where it's also going the way of the encyclopedia.  You don't see those anymore.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So when I started, let's see this.  This is online sites.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let's see this.  This is another 30 seconds for the yellow pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Help!  The crazy pool hose broke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that Gilligan?  The bell yellow pages talks when your fingers do the walking.  Pool doctor, we make emergency calls.  Calling can save you time and energy.  Mrs. Murphy?  Pool doctor?  You recognize my voice.  Get the yellow pages talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We make emergency calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let your fingers do the walking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That was the right jingle.  The worst ad though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So when I started the advanced local sites, the newspaper sites,  we thought that yellow pages was the future.  Yellow pages is going to be everything.  We spent a fortune developing our own yellow pages system  because we were going to replace the yellow pages.  Don't forget a lot of ad money.  A lot of ad money locally within the yellow pages.  For years, advertisers still thought, why can't not be there?  And we were going to take over.  It was going to be the future of the internet.  And oh, did my boss regret that for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So AT&T, which developed the yellow pages, never trademarked  the name yellow pages or the fingers.  Never applied for a trademark,  which is why there are now so many yellow pages.  Or well, not anymore.  But there are online yellow pages.  You can use that.  They never protected it.  Wow, that was a rat hole.  I apologize.  I apologize.  Yeah, that was your rat hole too.  No, you started it, dude.  You started it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, how did I start it?  When I start, you made a joke about the yellow.  You made the joke.  Oh, I did.  Yeah, I did.  Sorry.  Don't blame me.  See, I'm so old.  I forgot three minutes ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's take another YouTube story in there.  If you wanted to look at that, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, you like that one.  Game creator has his YouTube video of his game.  This is from Mike Mazinik's tech dirt.  Timothy Geigner writing, demonetized over the soundtrack.  What?  He even created the soundtrack himself.  Dan Salvato, who created the Doki Doki Literature Club.  What?  Yeah, I know.  OK, not the best name.  Is being demonetized for his own music on YouTube  because the platform claims the soundtrack included in his videos,  which he composed is someone else's content.  He tweeted about this.  Apparently his videos have been going on,  been demonetized for several months.  I don't know who it is that he's...  See, this is why I would hope he didn't sign up for Content ID.  Maybe he did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It just makes me wonder who was the other party in this that it's supposedly...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I'm guessing he signed up for Content ID for his music.  So you think it was automatic?  Yeah, of course it was.  I'm not sure I share his...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But this is now a story and one would think that  someone could get on a phone and speak to an actual person instead of an algorithm  and get this squared away, right?  Come on, I need some optimism from you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  OK, here's the optimistic last paragraph.  Once Salvatore complained on Twitter, YouTube got in touch to investigate  and fixed it.  So I guess the moral of the story is tweet about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This...  We nearly tweet off it.  It made me laugh.  I read this.  I have a couple of videos on my small little channel  and I get the warning every now and then because there's some songs that  I have rights to from the artist that says,  hey, I provide written consent to use my songs in his videos.  And I get that notification every time I put those songs out there  and dispute it and it gets fixed.  But the problem is it's algorithmic and it comes from not the artist,  it comes from some other distribution or whatever.  But it's never the artist's name and the notification is always some distribution company.  And I have to respond back and appeal it and they say, OK, you're good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I bet you our 17 year old knows Doki Doki Literature Club because it's kind of an anime  style horror game written by Dan Salvato.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm finding this thing interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, good.  Thank you.  Because I'm not.  I know you're tapped out.  Have an existential crisis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Line 123 and 20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, you jumping way down.  I was up in the 70s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, OK, fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, 123.  There's no order in this.  There's no order in this madness.  Stanford.  A show for 20 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I should know that by now.  Stanford.  Stanford University.  Oh, it's Stanford.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They have a cable TV news and they have a cable news analyzer, which is fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you go to the next link, you can you can play with it.  OK.  See the possibilities of what it can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So this is, you know, actually, this is one of the things that has always powered.  It goes back to The Daily Show and with Jon Stewart and then all the modern,  you know, commentary shows.  There have always been clipping services and search tools.  You know, for instance, when you're watching John Oliver's last week tonight,  he does that middle piece, you know, and now this where they mock newscasters  or something.  And it's and it's for the most part, I think it's based on these search tools where you could say,  well, give me every time Leo said the dookie dookie literature club  and then you can string them all together.  And it's a fun little montage.  So these tools have been around and widely used by TV for a long time.  But this is a little different.  This lets you search for query terms in cable news.  I imagine it's using the same back end because everything, I guess,  is transcribed and stored somewhere.  But you can do a comparison.  For instance, this is the canned one that it comes with where you compare Joe Biden  to Donald Trump over the last eight months.  And you can see the frequency is this is only on cable TV news.  The red bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you go to the getting started link on the top line there, you can see some examples.  OK. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Computing screen time.  Oh, this is more than just mentions.  Yeah.  This is screen time.  Face time.  So you're seeing their faces or people?  Oh, yeah. This is Kamala Harris face.  So this is using face recognition.  That's interesting.  Compare Kamala to Elizabeth Warren, for instance.  Filtering by face.  A lot more male faces on cable news than there are female faces.  About 50 percent more.  That's interesting.  Not a surprise.  Male presenters also outnumbering female presenters.  Yeah, this is kind of this is like that Google Book tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's yeah, exactly.  So here's Kamala Harris on the three cable networks, which is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  OK. So more numbers of BC, obviously.  Yeah. CNN, which is orange.  I can't tell.  It's hard to read.  Yeah, actually, if you change the date, it'll make it easier to read.  OK. Make it more recent.  Yeah, it goes back to 2010.  Let's let's go.  Let's do something a little more recent.  Invalid date.  Come on.  Be patient.  I'm getting there.  He's an old man, you know, and can't type that fast.  So there you go.  This is in the last nine months.  Orange is just Kamala.  Oh, this is all Kamala Harris.  I see.  So orange is MSNBC.  But this is you would have expected.  Fox was more than CNN.  Oh, CNN is very low.  Yeah.  So the idea would be you detect bias or favoritism.  Perhaps.  Spin spin.  Yeah.  Here's.  Yeah, I know.  Here's Hillary Clinton.  CNN, Fox and MS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Hillary Clinton and email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And email and not mentioned at all on anything but MSNBC for the last.  Did I do something wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you did.  I don't know what you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, it's only Fox.  Change the date again.  It's only Fox.  Look at that.  That's all Fox.  MSNBC until March 2020.  CNN, not at all.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Video club.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like that.  This is the kind of thing you teach your students, right?  For data driven journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Whatever I put in here isn't showing up in the news, believe it or not.  Is this only dealing with the political side of things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  What like what are you putting in?  I put in.  Yoki Literature Club.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just let's see.  I'll just put in Brett Favre and it doesn't come up with anything.  I'll put in Twitter and it didn't come up with anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's weird.  Well, did it say name Twitter?  Because I think name is for the database of just proper named entities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  And put in Twitter or capital T for name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, put it put in human names.  OK.  Jack.  It's cable news.  It's not sports.  Try Mark Zuckerberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's a little more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Definitely been in the news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that'd work too.  Let's try that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm bored.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just saying.  I just wanted to see if this thing would work.  You know, is supposed to go into training.  But it's not about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hold on.  It's not working.  You broke it.  You broke it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It would actually suggest it.  Zuckerberg.  So that's not a bad thing.  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do you ever any of you ever get seeds in the mail unsolicited seeds from China?  No, I have not.  I have not.  That was kind of a thing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was at one time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Never figured out what it was, but apparently was Chinese companies mailing  seeds to random Americans.  The thought maybe it had to do with this thing on Amazon where they would send you  seeds and then you'd be a verified buyer.  And then they could put a review in.  Amazon is now banned foreign sales of plants.  Not because it's their phony reviews, but because it's a threat to US agriculture.  The US and other countries, according to Engadget, have been dealing with a  wave of strange unexpected seed shipments all summer.  The Wall Street Journal has learned that Amazon's banned all sales of foreign plants  and seeds in the US, whether they're imports or sales inside the country by non-US residents  to protect our customers and enhance the customer experience.  Amazon did not explain why.  Tens of thousands of Americans received mysterious seed shipments in the past few months.  Post-markets coming from China often falsely labeled as another product.  As at least some of them were potentially harmful to US agriculture, including  noxious weeds, plant diseases, and even pests.  But it's not considered by the US to be a new kind of attack, a seed attack.  Actually, the main theory is it's a brushing scam where vendors pay people  to order cheap products and write bogus reviews to spur sales.  Amazon maintains seed deliveries from its site where real orders delayed due to COVID-19.  But I think it's brushing.  So now we've learned a new word.  Brushers or brushing, which is phony reviews on Amazon.  And maybe that's why these seeds were going out.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Vocabulary time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What's the German for brushing?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, there's no, there's no word.  Amazon is filled with fake reviews.  It's according to CNBC and it's getting harder to spot them.  Spot them.  It's Katie Skulov writing on CNBC about Amazon's fake reviews problem.  I think we've known about this for some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but we're not the normals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Speak for yourself, Ms. Drahan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think normal people are kind of aware of it.  I mean, like when you go to the wire cutter, for example, a lot of them talk about like how  they determine the difference between the fake reviews or they use fake spot, spot fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a service.  In July, UCLA and USC released a study that found more than 20 fake review related Facebook groups.  So they solicit on Facebook, bad actors solicit positive paid positive reviews to bots and click  farms that upvote negative reviews to take out the competition.  Average in these 20 fake review groups of 16,000 members each in more than 516 posts,  60 posts each day sellers offered a refund or payment for a positive review, usually about  six bucks. So that's why it's harder to spot them. It's one thing when the company itself writes them,  they're always too glowing or the negative review that's always too negative because it's a  competitor. But these are normal people getting paid six bucks in a free product to review something.  I think this is an issue because I tell you Amazon reviews are a very useful tool.  Amazon told CNBC it uses power quote, powerful machine learning tools and skilled investigators  to analyze over 10 million new reviews every week, 10 million aiming to stop abusive reviews  before they're ever published. The company recently removed 20,000 reviews after an  investigation found that the top Amazon reviewers in the UK were engaging in fraud. So maybe  you shouldn't be trusting those Amazon reviews. They certainly have gotten less trustworthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we'd agree on that. They 100% have, which is such a shame because I can't trust

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Amazon's like Amazon's. Amazon's choice is stupid. Choice. That's just random.  It's some, you know, maybe Amazon makes it or that's the Benedict Evans piece actually.  Amazon's profits, AWS and advertising. What is Amazon's real business?  I love this graph. So this is Amazon's anything that makes them money. Yeah, that's their real  business. So this is Amazon's revenue versus profit. And the revenue is a hockey stick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's going to go into detail. It's really good. And this is in billions. So from 1995 to 2019,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  from zero all the way up to almost $300 billion in revenue. But look how flat profit is. It's  almost always zero, just a little bit above zero. Wouldn't you want to make more profit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, because you want to invest in the future.  Keep going. There are lots of charts. It's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, or do you think they're hiding profits? I was going to say, let's talk about taxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't pay taxes on revenue. You pay taxes on profit, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it depends on where you are. In Washington state, you pay a business tax on revenue,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  which is crazy. Did you know that when you decided to move there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't. But it's okay because I have a high margin business. But man, I'm glad I don't have

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  a low margin business because that would kill me. The closer your revenue is to your profit is to  your revenue, the more equitable that tax is. But if you're like Amazon with a low profit and a high  revenue, maybe that's why Washington state does that. Because they don't have a state income tax.  They do not.  The money's got to come from somewhere. If you don't have an income tax, you're taxing somewhere.  So that's smart of them, right? They have some large companies perhaps in the state that very  rarely declare profit, but often have a $300 billion revenue as an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I hadn't thought about that. I wonder when that came into being and how, although then you would  think, well, no, you'd still want to optimize revenue. I don't know. I'm not a tech lawyer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. This is a good article, but I don't know if I can boil this down into less than a  half hour discourse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but you keep going. So what he's saying is that one analysis here, AWS is like,  it looks like it's the whole profit of Amazon.  They're web services.  It's not. The way it works out, the way he tries to cut it up,  e-commerce is now only half of Amazon revenue, which is fascinating, but e-commerce from the  other stuff is about as much as selling Amazon stuff, which is a big deal. It's a big major  part of the business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That was a big story that half of Amazon's revenue comes from third party sellers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Amazon under accounting rules does not report the gross sales. It only reports its  own sales and its fee for outside sales.  So we don't know what the outside sales gross revenue is.  Total gross sales. It would be pretty freaking impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, interesting. That's smart. You don't want to raise any, get any attention for  the total amount of selling you're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so then the advertising piece is growing quietly and rapidly.  And that's interesting because it really is taking away from Google and Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Amazon's ad business probably covers operating income and could be plausibly close to what  everybody says is their big cash cow, Amazon Web Services.  Amazon is not one. So he says close to six years ago, I wrote a pretty popular essay about  Amazon's business at the time, quote, why Amazon has no profits.  That made two points. First, Amazon is not one business.  It's many different businesses at all different stages of maturity and profitability.  Yeah, the more established, obviously, the more profitable.  Others are new in a loss, you know, early to loss startup phase.  But because Amazon doesn't break it out, you can't see from the outside  because it's all gets aggregated into one pool and then reinvested.  Amazon is not a loss making business that will eventually have to raise prices to make  money. Rather, this is important. It's many businesses leveraging a common platform  and a common balance sheet. So that's actually a good insight.  The second is Amazon is run not for net income, not for profit, but for cash.  He's always said that.  Bezos has always said he runs it for trailing 12 months, absolute free cash flow.  He's let's not forget he's a hedge fund quant. That's where he came from.  And he's always seen this not as a traditional business, but as almost a derivative.  It's a sophisticated financial instrument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's really interesting way to say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that that but that's his that's how he thinks. And that's his genius, isn't it?  It's had positive cash flow since 2002, 18 years.  So when you are looking at charts based on operating income, not cash flow,  you're not seeing what's really going on.  So this is the question. Why does he run it that way? Why is he running it for  cash flow? Why is he trying to so that he can invest in new businesses?  That cash flow, he creates established businesses, which then generate cash  that he pushes forward into the new businesses. So it's a giant growth enterprise.  You could almost call it a pyramid scheme, but all of the  But it's his own pyramid.  But it's his own pyramid. So he's not tricking anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that why the warehouse workers are paid so less because it's secure?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I don't know about that. I don't know if there's any excuse for that.  When you're running that much money, I don't know if there's any excuse for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and then they also, if you think about it from that perspective, all of the data  and insights that they derive from running all these businesses, they get to actually  use those to plow into businesses that they know will generate more cash.  So it's a virtuous cycle. The other thing that's interesting there, and  I don't know if this is antitrust, but it's kind of someone brought this up,  and I've been thinking about it a lot in the like IOT space, for example.  Most connected devices are built on Amazon's cloud or maybe Google's cloud, and they pay into  Amazon, right? Amazon has tons of devices that are kind of subsidized by their cloud business  in the sense that they don't have the ongoing cloud costs, or they do, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they're charged. Internal charges are made, but you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. So that becomes really interesting when you think about companies that are starting out.  And I've seen companies fail, and it's not just because they couldn't pay their cloud bills,  but it's a really interesting question about the advantage that having your own cloud  gives to Amazon and Google's devices, for example, that other products don't necessarily have.  So I don't know. I was thinking about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey, to make your point, if we go to my middle number, I'm going to sacrifice a number,  the altar of Stacey. You have estimates of tech company cloud spending.  Oh, there's a chart. So Netflix estimated 500. What is this? 500 million a year.  They're the biggest. Yeah.  Right. Snapchat at 300, which is amazing.  Tick tock.  Snapchat was on Google. Snapchat.  This is clouds. This is not Amazon. This is cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, OK. I was like, they're a GCP customer. OK, sorry. Go ahead. Netflix is AWS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Palantir right under fourth here. Snowflake. What the hell?  Actually, that's the new database.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. Ohm wrote about that this morning. And we just learned that Warren Buffett  put a quarter of a billion dollars into it, which is the first time I think ever that the,  what do they call him? The Oracle of Omaha has ever put money into a startup. He usually  invests established businesses.  No, he wants old ice cream places. Right.  Snowflake is a big cloud company, but it's about data insights, right, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's data warehousing. And I think part of its cache is because it's Bob Bouglia.  Right. And Ohm was raving about him.  Yeah. He's done a lot of really, he was at Microsoft. He was something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. Ohm's piece is a Buffett of Snowflake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a big deal.  Storage isn't sexy, but those companies can do super well because everything,  we're only generating more data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They do it on AWS. They don't even own it. Snowflake, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They, yes.  What are they adding? What value do they add?  Software and smarts on top of it. So you get the right data at the right time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's managed. So we're used to that. This is what Ohm writes. We're used to that.  When you buy Dropbox or OneDrive or iCloud, we're used to that. It's managed cloud services.  But usually when companies buy cloud storage, they're not buying the management as well.  Snowflake is basically giving the same kind of managed cloud services we're used to as  consumers for big companies. And part of the problem, and one of the reasons I'm sure that  you're seeing a quarter of a billion investment from Berkshire Hathaway and a quarter of a billion  from Salesforce Ventures is because cloud is really taking off. And there are the people,  really the sweet spot at this point is people who are saying, I can't trust the cloud.  I don't want to put my data in the cloud. I don't feel like it's safe in the cloud.  I prefer on-prem storage. So they're competing with Amazon Redshift and Google's BigQuery and  Azure SQL on Microsoft. But according to Ohm, it's Frank Slootman, the CEO,  who was from ServiceNow, I think was the company you're trying to remember.  But also that this is a hot category, right? Yeah, their sales, their revenue increased

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  two and a half times. They're still losing money. They're not making money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You can't make money and go public. Right. So Ohm says, and I think this is really kind of,  I would agree with him on this, we're experiencing an historic shift away from a traditional  industrial economy to one with a digital heartbeat. And so you're seeing somebody like Berkshire who  says, I want to buy Dairy Queen McDonald's and sees candy saying, you know what? All of the growth  is shifting in another direction. He's late on that. That's what he does. He just got rid of a  bunch of banking, right? Yeah. Yeah, he did. He's a little late on it, but he's not too late, I don't  think. Especially because of COVID, right? Especially because of COVID. I think if anything,  COVID has made the big tech companies more powerful and more profitable. That's why  Apple hit $2 trillion. That's why Jeff Bezos became the richest man in the history of mankind.  It's because of COVID. Yeah, so I think, yeah, Snowflake. So let's go back to this.  So that's why Snowflake is way up there in the top six. Then Pinterest. Pinterest, who would think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's still so big? Yeah. So here's the- I don't know whether their list is all inclusive or not,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  but here's the Google Cloud portion of Snapchat. So really, if you had those,  the Snapchat plus the Google Cloud part of Snapchat, now your stack gets up there to the  Netflix size. Lyft, Slack. By the way, Slack- What about Slack larger? Slack stock is tumbling because  Slack, of all of the big messaging platforms like Zoom and Microsoft Teams, has not grown during  COVID. Just because I'm using it constantly. Yeah, but that's the point is that maybe the competitors  are starting to outpace them. Datadog, Sumo Logic- Datadog does log, it's like Splunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Analyzes log files. So you know what's interesting and what you'll see is there's two factors that  are happening that are important to note with your biggest spenders. Video and imagery. And then the  other thing is high processing analytics and data storage. So with Palantir and Snowflake,  what you're seeing is having to pay for getting the data someplace and then the cost of analytics

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  on it, which are more expensive. The other thing that's interesting in this is number of multi-cloud  companies. Not all of them by any means. And I would have thought AWS would be totally dominant,  but Google Cloud has a number of big clients here. Snapchat, TikTok, Unity, Datadog-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is Palantir, Palantir doesn't have a parenthesis next to it? Is it?  It's unknown. We don't know. We don't know where Palantir lives.  But Vladimir knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Who knows? No one knows, but they're spending like crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Palantir runs on AWS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, this doesn't say that, interestingly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Amazon, there was a big kerfuffle two years ago where their employers were like,  we can no longer host Palantir. But I don't think Amazon gave it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they don't care about those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Microsoft has once again been affirmed as the victor in the Jedi contract, by the way.  And Jeff Bezos is hopping mad. He says this is a corrupt process.  He's right. He's right.  Well, I don't know.  You can't tell. That's the problem. There's no faith left.  I'm not the expert in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what corruption does. It just utterly destroys your faith in any system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But Amazon's contention is, well, we're clearly, obviously, technically superior.  The Pentagon should have chosen us. Is that true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no. Amazon would like you to think that, and like Gartner's magic quadrant puts it up there,  but Microsoft's cloud is not shabby. If they chose Google, I'd be like,  OK, that was a weird deal. But choosing Microsoft is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, so I'm not sure I buy that part. But this is the thing. It's an unknown process.  The Pentagon admitted they screwed up calculating the cost. And they said,  but we're still going to give it to Microsoft. Amazon came back with a lower price.  But they said, but we're still going to give it to Microsoft.  So maybe that kind of confirms it. This is the statement from Amazon.  Why we will continue to protest this politically corrupted contract award.  When the DOD announced its plans for corrective action in March, we objected  because it was clear it was nothing more than a do-over for Microsoft to fix its non-compliant  proposal. The DOD's reevaluation was nothing more than an attempt to validate a flawed,  biased, and politically corrupted decision. It's important to point out the DOD cited price  as a major factor in the previous decision. This time, we offered AWS, this is Amazon speaking,  offered a lower cost by several tens of millions of dollars. The DOD's decision to intentionally  ignore the clear cost benefits offered by AWS reinforces the fact that this corrective action  was never meant to be fair. That's Trump's favorite word.  Fair. Unfair. Sad.  Very unfair.  Sad. Anyway, I guess there's still a court battle, but from the point of view of the  Department of Defense, it's done and over and that's it. But yeah, Jeff's really saying,  this is a corrupt process. He's not pulling punches anymore. Unlike a lot of big CEOs  who are still kind of careful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, at this point, I don't think. It doesn't matter. I mean, I feel like Trump could set  like a small animal on fire on national television and people who like him will still like him and  the rest of us would be like, oh my God, did you see that?  That's very clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it's fearful.  He said it at the beginning of his campaign. He said, I could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue  and it wouldn't lose any votes. Now he's killed who knows how many people with COVID-19.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here's a question for you.  It doesn't matter.  Are you pissed that Bob Woodward held what he knows for the book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Isn't that interesting? So that's another insight that some have drawn is that plenty of people  knew what was going on in the White House but waited until it was close to the election so  they could make big bucks with a book contract. And that's pretty obvious, right? The books are

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Woodward has it on tape and he's had it for six months.  Yep. Sat on it.  And could have made a difference early on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So here's what the president said to Woodward. By the way, did you find it interesting how  instead of Woodward asking a question and sitting back, he was really interacting,  talking back and talking over the president and stuff. What did you think, Jeff, of that  conversation? That seemed a little odd to me. That wasn't like a reporter saying,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's how you deal with Trump. I think that's how you deal with Trump is you push him.  And that's how you get him to say things like, I don't care about black people. Why would I care  about black people is basically what Trump said. I don't have any empathy.  Maybe that's the case because Jonathan Swan.  Are you really saying this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe that's the case because Jonathan Swan did exactly the same thing in his access  interview with the president. He kind of prodded him. And I guess the idea is if you continue to  prod, eventually he's going to throw up his hands and say, well, let me tell you the...  So what the president said to Woodward is, oh, I knew in February was going to be bad,  but I didn't want to panic the nation. Now that's something a lot of presidents would say. I'm sure  when they discovered aliens in Area 51, that's what Herbert Hoover said is, I don't want to  tell the nation that the aliens are among us, whoever it was. I don't know. It was probably  Eisenhower. Eisenhower, he didn't want to get people upset, riled up. So he said, I'm not going  to tell them about the aliens. Let's just keep this between us. I think it's probably the case  that you could tell people, look, this virus is going to be bad and we need to really prepare  for it. Wouldn't panic people the same way aliens might. But is that a reasonable... I mean,  that's certainly presidents have said that before. Presidents don't tell us the truth all the time,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  right? To prevent panic. So Margaret Sullivan at the Washington Post is writing about it and  talked to Woodward. What did he say? What did he tell her? I'm trying to fight it now. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  because it is a shame that he didn't release this earlier. But it's also, I guess if you wanted to  make an impact and you want to make a lot of money on a book, holding it to a closer to the election  isn't a fully cynical... Is it cynical? Maybe that's a little cynical. It's, this is cynical.  Here's the calculus. Would it have changed anything if he released it three or four months ago? Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think at least media couldn't have had the narrative that, well, they say this,  but Trump says that. The denialism would have been at least poked through. He would have found

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  something else to say, but... It does seem bad. If you're a journalist and Woodward is a journalist,  does he still work for the Post or is he just on his own? Yeah, kind of. So he's a journalist.  So if you're a journalist and you have a big scoop, saving it for the book, I can understand why  Mary Trump might have done that. I can even understand why Michael Cohen might have done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These are not journalists. Woodward's a journalist. He told Trump, I told him it was for the book,  but did not sign any agreement promising any timing. He says, I don't do that. Woodward said  the aim was to provide a fuller context that could occur in a news story, which is a real slap at the  Washington Post. I knew I could tell the second draft of history. Oh, gag me. And I hate that  phrase. We write the first draft of history. That means we ignore history. That means the only  things that are new are news to us and we don't care about history and that's ridiculous. Anyway,  I knew I could tell it before the election. Let's see here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's really interesting. What do you think, Stacy? Are journalists compelled  to write the story the minute they learn something? Tell the world what they know and they know it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you're muted. She doesn't want to tell the world, you say, because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, my dog started growling. I would say... He doesn't like Bob Woodward either, I think.  I would say normally we are. I do think there are cases where you might not share information  for a short time for national security or for weird patriotic reasons. I'm old-fashioned  that way. But I think for the most part, I would not have sat on those tapes. Maybe his publisher  told him to. I don't really understand. It's possible the first couple of weeks he didn't know  how bad it was going to be. So I don't... Yeah, that's part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This conversation was when in April? No, well, the original one was in...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, Trump was referring to February. But I think the conversation was later. Trump said,  I knew in February it was going to be bad. Part of it might just be a cynical reaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, February. It was February. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's where he said... Sorry, Stacy. Information point. Point of order. There were these two  problems with what he heard from Trump in February that kept him from putting it in the newspaper  at the time. First, he didn't know what the source was of Trump's information. It wasn't until months  later in May, which is still a long time ago from now, that Woodward learned it came from a high  level intelligence briefing in January that was also described Wednesday as reporting the book.  In February, what Trump told Woodward seemed hard to make sense of, the author told me,  says Margaret Sullivan. Back then Woodward said there was no panic over the virus,  even towards the final days of the month. That's not true.  I agree. Anthony Fauci was publicly assuring Americans there was no need to change their  habits. Secondly, Woodward said, the biggest problem I had, which is always a problem with  Trump, is I don't know if it is true. That I believe...  So funny, one or more reporting, but still it was February.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In May, I feel like... So in February, I've only dealt with an unreliable source in very few  instances and it's horrible. It's horrible. Trump would be a nightmare to interview and try to work  with from that perspective. So more reporting, okay, and not understanding where Trump got that  from. But as soon as he got that, I do feel like I would have released it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Woodward said he believes his highest purpose isn't to write the daily stories. That's a really  snotty thing for a journalist to say. But to give his readers the big picture, one that may have a  greater effect, especially with the consequential election looming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's just his ego talking. Exactly.  I could influence an... So there were a couple of conversations. February 7th,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Trump said the coronavirus is more deadly, you know, you're even than your strenuous flu.  On February 26th, he told the public it's gonna go away. So at that point in February,  he maybe knew, maybe he didn't know, maybe he was trying to impress Woodward. Oh, it's bad.  Because, you know, that's part of it is, like you said, he's an unreliable. He says things for a  variety of reasons, sometimes just to, you know, as any human does, to, you know, sound more  authoritative. It was in March that he told, it's when in March that he, March 19th, that he told  Woodward on tape, I always wanted to play it down. I still like playing it down because I don't want  to create a panic. So in February, he says really serious. In March, he says, a month later, he says,  but I'm playing it down. So I don't know. I mean, these are ongoing conversations, it sounds like.  I'm also amazed. I'm so amazed that the president will talk to people who are clearly trying to  write negative stories. Ego. Ego, I guess. Ego meets ego in this story.  He can't help himself. Good Lord. You know, all of this is going to be a very, I hope,  you know, the old phrase, history will judge them. I hope that I live long enough to just  hear a clear, concise, accurate story of what the hell happened in 2020. Because I don't think,  I think there's as much we don't know. But I do think I kind of agree with you. It is somebody  like Woodward's responsibility if he knows something that early to say. But it could also  be respect of the office. If, you know. What? Oh, yeah. If LBJ had told you, listen, Jeff,  there are aliens in area 51, but I don't want to create public scare. You might not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  send that tape to Twitter. No, you have a higher, as a journalist, you have a higher

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  responsibility to the public. I think at the point when the aliens had clearly come down  and started murdering small children. Yeah. That's when you would say, yeah, this could be worse.  You might sit with that for a minute. Like, oh, okay, let's see how this plays out. But once,  you know, a hundred thousand people were dead, I think you'd be like, well, April 19th,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  we, it was still early, right? We only, no, it wasn't that early. That was a month of the lockdown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you're right. But still we would have stayed in a lockdown. I mean, lives would have,  could have been saved and trying to prove the negative gets you nowhere. He withheld information  from the American people. He's a journalist. He should be ashamed of himself. Full F stop there,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  John. I didn't say it. So are you going to stop teaching Woodward stuff in your journalism classes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know, but I fancy today whether, whether there should be a movement to withdraw as

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  pure surprise for killing people. I don't think, but let's do a change log and end the show.  I'm going to do a change log, but I'm just going to add one more piece of information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  On April 19th, there had already been 13,899 deaths. Yeah. Yeah. So there were enough deaths  to say, yeah, this could get bad. This is serious. Yeah. Okay. Time for the Google.  Well, wait a minute. I got to do this thing. Oh, this thing, the thing, the thing, the thing,  the Google change log. It's coming up and now it's time. So how long do we have to wait for it? Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mr. Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Mr. Jarvis. And now there may or may not be an ad here. I don't know.  And now it's time. And now it's time. Let's play the drums or trumpets, whatever those are called.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The Google change log. Sorry, Leo. Why are you apologizing? I don't have, I enjoyed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hey, this is cool. That's cool. This is cool. That's autoplay autoplay. You don't know what's  going to happen next. Google's got this new verified calls feature. It's coming to Android  phones, verified calls that display the caller's name, their logo. But a company when it's making  business calls can now add why they're calling. And what a scam you. And yeah,  I would like to sell you something. How's your sighting? And there will be a verification symbol  that will indicate the call has been verified by Google. So if you're a legitimate business,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  verified how? With Google's amazing information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Think about this. I get business calls all the time. Maybe it's from somebody, you know, maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  your car is done. Kind of a call. It's Karnak updated for the mobile era.  I just know that it's a good call. What the hell is Karnak? Oh, God. Another rat hole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sorry, I didn't ask. I don't care. I'll Google it. Go. Oh, you do. Now he's going to show you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now he's to show you who Karnak is. Here. We'll do this. Jeff and I will do this. Jeff and I'll

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  do this. Imagine I'm wearing a giant purple satin turban and you've got an envelope in your hand.  No, I have an envelope and I'm putting it to my head and I am saying, Cis boom ba. Cis boom ba.  And then I give this to you, Jeff. You open the envelope and you say, I don't have the punchline

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for you. So you're going to have to do one. What is the sound made by an exploding sheep?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's Karnak the Magnificent in a nutshell. It's Johnny Carson. It's an American eye

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  con. It's a Johnny Carson bit. Wait, did you know who Karnak was? Yes, I did. You did? Whoa,  Uncle Ant. Thank you. How did you know, Ant? Is this something you saw? My grandparents

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  used to watch the Johnny Carson show. Oh, his grandparents. Okay. Okay. Watch and learn,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  children. Just a little bit of a message. Watch and learn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The guy was going to break up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because he knows the joke, but he's laughing. So the idea is he's a mind reader, right? He's

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  reading an envelope and he's saying, Cis boom ba. It's the answer to a question. He opens the  envelope. He always glows in the envelope. He always did that. Describe the sound made when  a sheep explodes. Now, in order to laugh at that, you also have to know that Cis boom ba  was the cheer. Who's cheer was that? I'm trying to remember it. Now, Karnak, if I look it up,  I don't remember the cheer. Now it goes to Karnak. It's a cheerleading chant  originally from 1867. That's how old we are, Stacey. Yep. And actually it imitates the sound  of a skyrocket flight. The burst of the fireworks, boom, and the reaction of the crowd. Stacey, Stacey,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you had to ask, didn't you? You see what you started? You had to ask. You could have just let  it go. Karnak reference. I'm sorry. I was just confused. Cheerleaders at the University of Texas

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  after they were saying, I've been working on the railroad, would chant Cis boom ba.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh my gosh. One more. Play one more Karnak joke. No, no, no, no, no, no, no more Karnak. No more  Karnak. Keep going. Keep going. Moving on. Change log. Android 11. Let's talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay. You can choose to leave this in or edit it out.  It's up to you. This is from 1974. I think this is going to get us taken down by the Johnny Carson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, probably will be. Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very exciting night for us. Not only  are all the members of the great Ed McMahon with us, we also have a great visit. Three feet wide.  The famous seer, sage, all knowing, all seeing, all omniscient and former master of ceremonies  at a house of pies. Ladies and gentlemen, Karnak the Magnificent. So this is what passed for comedy

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  in the seventies. Now I should also tell you he would do this as a regular bit and he will  watch as he enters stumble over the step because he did. Always. Every time. Go ahead, John. Let's  roll that tape. It's Johnny in a cape and a giant, I was wrong, it's red turban. Watch.  Every time. He stumbles on that step. Every time. I guess this is from an era when...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When we didn't know what funny was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There was an article a while back about how sitcom writing, if you go back and look at it,  it's horrible compared to what we see today. Yeah. Well, even today, if you watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  my favorite geek show, the Big Bang Theory, and if you take the laugh track out,  it's not funny. It's like, that's not a joke, but people are laughing. Yeah. It's not funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let's, shall we do one here? Let's do one. Yes. Hermetically sealed. Yes, I understand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Funkenwaggle's porch. He's going to say something about a camel nesting in your bippy or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That happens too. Yeah. A thousand clowns. A thousand clowns. A thousand clowns. That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  what I said. It's very formulaic, but that's part of what's funny about it. Who put together  the NBC fall schedule. That's funny because the affiliates we should mention are in the audience  for that one. Because he mentioned our NBC families in the audience. Right? So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's good stick, right? Well, in its time, Ant, in its time.  I'm sure your grandparents loved it. He was hugely influential on my style of comedy.  Oh, exactly. Oh yeah. Yeah. Okay. What David Letterman was to the next generation,  Bonnie Carson was. So, so Cheers, you were on sitcoms a minute ago, Stacey's Dying, I love it.  Cheers. There was a really interesting analysis I just put up of its premiere episode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Stacey's going to ram the mic into her eye in a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have my TV guide column there being a former TV guide, TV critic. Yes. Which I said that Cheers  was perhaps the perfect show, the best ever. It's all there online. Wow. I disagree, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You're wrong. There have been better shows since, so it's not, you know...  Well, since perhaps, no, no, no. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you just to prove your theory.  This is a modern sitcom, the Big Bang Theory without a laugh track.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nothing makes beer taste better than cool, clear, rocky mountains, spring water.  Where are the Rocky Mountains anyway? Philadelphia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really? I thought they were out west someplace. Think about it, Raj. Where did the movie Rocky

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  take place? Philadelphia. Okay, now I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let me know if you hear a joke in there. So it's funny though, because there were a lot of laughs,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  which we didn't hear. It's like going to a Rodney Dangerfield show, which I did a couple of times.  And the stuff was never funny, but you laughed your ass off. I like Rodney Dangerfield.  Because it was part of being in the X. I like it. All right. Google's Area 120.  Stacey, do you know who Rodney Dangerfield is? Yes, yes. Thank goodness.  Unfortunately. What was his main line, Stacey? Let's prove this now. Let's see if you really know.

Transcript:  Google's Area 120. Yes, they are. Google's Area 120 launches Orion Wi-Fi,  a service that allows carriers in need of better service to rent public venue Wi-Fi networks.  I don't even understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this like because the hotel is ripping you off? I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So Area 120 is the blue sky research arm of Google, right? Area 120, experimental stuff.  Later sometimes becomes a business. They've created this thing, Orion Wi-Fi.  Orion Wi-Fi. Here's their description. As you walk into the grocery store,  Orion helps the local network tell the carrier about its price and quality. If the carrier  decides the connection is good enough, we'll auto connect you. If the quality is too low, we won't.  When you're connected, internet traffic flows over the Wi-Fi network just as if you had connected  directly to the Wi-Fi. Orion cannot access users' internet traffic. I don't understand what this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The grocery store says why would we do that? Is this like phone or whatever Comcast and stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  do where they take available public Wi-Fi and they, but instead of just giving it to their users,  they're selling it to carriers? Is that what's happening here? I don't know. Let's keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's actually kind of an interesting arbitrage thing. But yeah, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Cachoi, pepe. We have some in the freezer. Did you eat it, John? You didn't eat it yet? Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  John, how can you be so inhuman that you would delay this? He said it's just some spaghetti with

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  cheese. I got more at home than I ate. It's not good reheated. It's got to be fresh. Hey,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  here's a good thing. Have you tried it yet? Stacey, you need to try it. I'm telling you, it's good.  Cachoi, pepe? I eat it all the time. The Trader Joe's cachoi, pepe. The frozen  trachoi. I don't have a Trader Joe's anywhere near me. Oh, poor you. You need to move back to Texas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought they were from Seattle. Yeah. Okay. By near me, I mean on the island on which I live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  On the island. There's no Trader Joe's on the island. I have a town and country at the same  way. This is worth going over a bridge. It's not a bridge. It's a ferry. A 35 minute,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  $20 ferry. It's 20 bucks? Oh, wow. Is there a bridge somewhere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a bridge to Peninsula, which is rural, and then I can drive all the way around Tacoma

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  for an hour and a half. That's too far. Yeah. Oh, you're really living in the sticks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to have fiber in a month. Do you like it? I do most of the time. I mean,  most of the time I don't mind taking the ferry and the ferry has summer rates, which is why it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  expensive now. They should have local rates like, oh, I live here, so I should get a deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it is public transportation, so I'm paying for it and I am able to live on an island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that's cool. I don't want to do that. But like you, I would have to pay for  life evacuation insurance, medevac insurance. That's another story for another day. Google  podcast for Android. This is good news. Allows you to cast. It's on the now playing screen.  There's now a cast button. So if you're listening, this is a good reason to use Google Podcasts.  You can now cast it to your home theater system or anything else with Chromecast or casting  available. I guess you can cast it to a Google speaker, your Google Home Max or something.  And I like this. Karsten is padding a little bit because there are only four stories in the change

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  log and two of them are Google's area 120 launches a riot. If you didn't understand it the first time,  you'll get it the second time. You fool. And that's the Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy. Let us let us wrap this pleasant. It's been a five hour show.  So it feels like it. This show is longer than any other show I do for some reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it? It's Jeff's fault. No. Well, we do get you asked about Karnak. We do have directions,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  but I think it's because we enjoy hanging out with each other. And it's just a big part of it.  I just wish the listeners felt that way, too.  Actually, I always start with Stacey's thing. Let's start with Ant's stuff today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mine's easy. At the time of recording this show, Phil McPro announced the new feature with their,  excuse me, with their iOS and Android mobile app that allows you to get clean HDMI out  with your camera to be used as a webcam computer setup. Now, I must say, this is an app I've used  for for quite a while now. But when you go to buy that app, it's a $15 app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but I own it because that was the one that was going to have use all three cameras  record all three at the same time. Did they ever add that feature?  I don't recall.  They put it in a free little app, but I wonder if they put it in the Phil McPro app ever.  It's probably in there by now.  By now it ought to be. That's great news. So how do I get HDMI out? Oh, there's a dongle,  isn't there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep. And get a dongle that actually has a USB-C power supply on it where you can plug in some  power to it as well. And you'll be good to go. Like I said, I've used them for other things  that I've done with my smartphone and Gimbals because their app also ties into smartphone  Gimbals and allows you to do different controls with the video on the Gimbals hardware. It's a  really good app and seeing that they're sort of thinking forward with, heck, everybody's doing all  of these Zooms and Skypes and things like that. And if you try to look up a Logitech C920 on

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Amazon, you're not going to find one.  Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What? Is it, will it be better than the Logitech that makes me think?  Oh yeah. You got a good camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Heck yeah. Your smartphone camera is.  Yeah. Oh, you think? Yeah. Nice.  Put a nice light in front of it and put it on a tripod and good to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm going to play with that tonight. I'm doing what you're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're going to have to help me do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I need to buy a dongle for my Android device because nowadays most of the smartphones only have  one IO port on them. So I need to get a dongle that's going to allow me to be able to connect  HDMI out as well as add power to my smartphone. Because when you're shooting video, you're going  to chew through the battery and Phil McNose that says, hey, get a dongle that'll let you do both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have just re-downloaded Phil McPro. That's fantastic. I paid for it a while ago.  My pick of the week is something you can pick up at your local  Trader Joe's. It's something we like to call Cacio e Pepe, which is just Italian for spaghetti

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and pepper.  It's really effing good. Now don't get scared when you open it up.  The Cacio is little squares that of course microwave out, but it's spectacular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  According to the cover, spaghetti pasta and a rich creamy sauce with pecorino,  Romano cheese and black pepper. That's my pick of the week. Stacy, what's your pick of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My pick of the week is IFTTT Pro. This morning IFTTT launched a pro service for consumers.  This means a lot of things, but what it mostly means is you now can have your triggers,  can become, they can set off multiple actions and you can also do queries with your triggers.  So if I say, if my Android device comes within a certain range and my door is locked,  my door, my yellow lock is locked, do the following. So there's a lot more things that can happen.  The caveat here is it costs money. The other thing it does, so they want to get us to a 9.99  subscription fee, but they're willing to accept a dollar 99 until you feel like the service is  worth it. So the idea being you pay what you want, but at least a dollar 99. If you decide not to pay,  then you only get the applets that are available to you already from the brands and three custom  ones that you have made. Oh, so they're also limiting the free plan considerably. Yes.  But you also get faster service if you pay and you get support, which has never existed.  So it's basically trying to compete with Zapier or some of the more robust paid services out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I pay for Zapier, but I'd be, you know, I have used if this than that for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like Zapier for lots of like web-based things, but they don't have that many smart home things.  Now, if only they say only about 25% of their users are actually doing smart home stuff.  So, but as a smart home person, you know, most of my devices are on ift. And so like I was actually  playing with air quality sensors right now, given the thing. So I'm like, oh, maybe if my air quality  sensor sells me the air quality is disintegrating, my lights can turn red and flash or, and my window  sensors say my windows are open, then do this. Ta-da! Multistep Zaps, which are a big part of Zapier,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  really are great. I use them in a lot of ways. And that was always one negative of if this and that.  It's only two things. If this than that. So I think this is a huge improvement. And, you know,  I don't know if it's worth 10 bucks a month. If I say 399, which, you know, notice they don't put  199, you have to enter that by hand if you're going to be that cheap. But if I put 399, which  I think would be fair, would it be that forever, I wonder? Or at some point are they going to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean, they can't charge you more without telling you. They will let you know when  the price goes up. But, you know, I had, Lyndon's going to be on the podcast tomorrow. And then I  wrote a story today based on our conversation. But the idea is he really, cynically, he doesn't want  to piss everyone off because that's been happening a lot. But I do think he's acknowledging that for  10 years, people have been using if for free, and this is going to piss a lot of people off,  especially his hardcore users. But those hardcore users, I think could be enticed with, you know,  faster, I was going to say faster latency, but lower latency, faster service, and actual,  really complicated and good applets. So I'm going to try it. I think it's possible, too. It might  help me save. Like, I could actually do things with this that I couldn't do with Wink,  or that I could do with Wink. So now I don't have to have a Wink subscription. And it's possible,  like, if I took my smart cameras, like my Arlo feeds, and I put them into like a drive,  maybe I wouldn't have to pay for that subscription. So it might save me money. I'd have,  I'm still playing with it and looking at it to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I pay 20 bucks a month for Zapier. So 10, even 10 bucks a month would,  I shouldn't be so cheap would be a good deal. It's just that I already have Zapier. We use Zapier  a lot. Sponsor?  They used to be a sponsor, right? I don't, are they still a sponsor?  Former sponsor? I think former. I would say if they were  a current sponsor, but I don't think they are. So, but you know, they could come back. So I should  say sponsor-ish. In the past, they have been a sponsor.  And I do use them a lot. It's how we get all of those stories about the Orion Wi-Fi in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  in the change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So it isn't, Zapier's got a free tier, which gives you five Zaps, which isn't too bad,  but it gets pretty expensive pretty rapidly. So I wonder, I'm guessing, are there other things  besides Zapier? If this, then that's been around forever. But I think I would guess that Zapier is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  starting, was starting to beat him. It's the closest competitor I can think of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I've just subscribed to If This, Then That Pro. And so I'll play with this a little bit.  Yeah. Cause I've, I've always had in my heart, I've always thought, you know, you, I want them  to succeed. So, and I look forward to seeing Lyndon Tibbetts on your show or listening

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  on your show tomorrow. That's great. There is no video component to my show because  we record it like 6.30 in the morning. Yeah. You wouldn't want to see Stacey  at 6.30 in the morning. I look mostly like this.  I'm teasing you. Of course. Just a little less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Eye makeup. It's not the makeup. It's the, I need my coffee.  You don't want to see me at 6 in the morning. Why do you record so early?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have to get it to my producer. Wow.  I know. And we do news and so. What is it about producers that they,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  that they are so important to the production of a show? Like they really are. We people often think  the hosts are the most important part of a show, but it's actually not true. It's the producer.  Wouldn't you agree? Karsten gets it done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I could produce my show, but I don't want to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, that's the hard work. It really is the hard work. Jeff, your number of the week, my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm changing it right now. Oh, it's a new number.  So, uh, 49 years ago, a very big deal. Harry Belafonte sat in and hosted the tonight show.  That was a big deal. And so now there is a, in honor of this NPR, uh, is, uh, or there's,  there's a documentary called the sit in Harry Belafonte hosts the tonight show. Nice. And right  now on MSNBC on the readout, uh, they're talking about, that's how I knew about it. Wow. That's a  big deal. Yeah. What year was that? Uh, well, what's today versus minus 49, uh, 1968.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  68. So the civil rights act had been passed for four years.  You would think math doesn't work out. Yes, it does. Yeah. You would think that, uh,  by then having a black man host the tonight show would be no big deal, but it was,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they see, you know, that was right. It was, uh, yes, I do because I like music. Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's his famous song?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Daylight. I want to go home. I feel young again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Our mask of the week from, uh, this is our newest intern, Carson son, Zach modeling.  The, we have pictures of Zach and Alex wearing it in the red doom of, uh, the Bay area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It looks like it has two old TV clickers on either. Those are the big respirators. These are the three

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  M tech T E K K protection, full face respirator. Now, Carson, tell me it doesn't have an outbound  valve that it protects both the wearer and people around them. Otherwise I can't recommend it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no one's going to get within six feet of you if you're wearing that thing. So I would love

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  to, I actually would love to have this. How much is it? Did you buy them for the whole family?  He also recommends the stylish yet comfortable  face cover 1597 from Verde. It's just base. I don't think this is going to work. It's just a  basic plastic, more than a face shield. The aerodynamics allow it to be used even as a wind

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  deflector for cycling. So let me ask you a question. Wear a mask folks. Don't wear that.  Go ahead. Yeah. I feel like we could actually do a service for people. So I bought the number one  wall street journal mask pick from their article a little bit ago. Yes. And I just,  would y'all like to hear how it performs or not? Yeah. Please. And thank you. So I, I feel like  these masks are cool, but maybe not as helpful. And I am looking more for like everyday mask wear.  Sorry, Karsten. This is the number one wall street journal pick. I'll tell you who makes it  in like a wear W W a Y R E and it's a five layer mask. And they say it features a thoughtful face  enveloping design and a silky touch fabric. It's $18. You buy them at all. It looks good.  This is the mask. It actually does pin to your face and it's super lightweight and comfortable.  It's kind of breathable. The downside is the material is not awesome when it comes to washing.  You have to hand wash it. You cannot put it in the washer. And I'm sad because it has the stretchy  these thingies and you get to custom fit it. So it, it's very comfortable, but it's not maybe  practical. So I was just going to let y'all know that cause so can't, you know, one of the other

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  ways you can sterilize a mask is by ironing it. Oh, this has us putting spraying isopropyl alcohol  on it for like 15. Okay. So you don't have to wash it each time. You could just spray alcohol on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But then you got to let it set for a long time while the alcohol evaporates. Otherwise you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  like, Oh, you know, I have to stand by the masks that I make, which I feel the more I learn about  them. I feel like they're really good, which is use 600 thread count cotton, two layers, one,  one layer of either chiffon or silk in between the silk or chiffon uses static to stop aerosolized  particles and the cotton on both sides protects the, you know, people around you from the  spume from your coughing. But also when I wear it with my, my mask fitter, I also only breathing  through the mask. And I, I believe that gives me an, according to the research I've read close to  N 95, 95% protection against aerosolized particles. So, you know, you can, and you can also do that  with this, where a fitter with a surgical mask, which I think is going to give you an N 95 as well.  So these are inexpensive. These are disposable though. So they're not really good. Maybe you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  don't want it. Yes. But because the New York times has a fascinating story and it's just a theory.  But the theory is that masks being imperfect, let a little bit of the virus in and we know that you  need a major load. So enough in that it creates a kind of crude vaccine vaccination. Yeah. Very

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Elysian. This is, yeah. And then even if it's not a vaccine, it is the case that you will have a much  milder case of it. If you get a smaller dose, give a smaller viral load. Yes. And it's unknown  whether it provides any, uh, preventative effect, but it certainly is known to be a less serious  viral load. I think with the fitter, and this is worn a lot of times in medical offices, you'll see  these in dental practices a lot that seals what would normally be open sides on a paper surgical  mask. Um, but you know what? I like that where it's beautiful. It's beautiful. It's very,  it's very comfortable shop. W a Y R E dot com. I guess they make clothing as well,  but they also, they also make masks. So there you go. And I'm not trying to poo poo Carstens

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  things. I just like, like, I really need some, no, you're right. Carstens got a little bit into the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  burning man side of masking. Yeah. Yeah. The steam punk masks. Yeah. And I think we can safely say,  despite the politics of the whole thing, that, uh, every serious scientist agrees masks are  effective. They reduce, they flatten the curve, they reduce your chance of infecting somebody else,  an asymptomatic individual affecting people. And they may even if worn properly and maintained  properly, protect you from people in your environment. And so we, everybody at twit is  always masked. John is masked right now. The only person who's not as me when I'm in either this  part of the studio or in my office. And, uh, these, this I can wear forever. This is very  comfortable. Uh, I usually wear it with a, I don't have it with me, the face shield. So I think that  helps a little bit. And I like the fact that it keeps strangers away and you can hear me pretty  well, right? Yeah. I don't sound muffled. Do I? No. Is this the longest show we've ever made?  No, not even close. Well, if we do three more minutes, right, John,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  five more, we'd have to do five more minutes. I'm not, it's okay. It's okay. I don't want to,

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I don't need to set a record. No, I have caught you in a paper awaiting me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I need a drink. I've been recording and performing since six 30 today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was, this was my easy week, Stacey. This week I was only on zoom today for eight hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Last week was 11. You know, if you would like, I will be glad to make this show a lot shorter

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  from now on. No, no, no, no, no. I don't want you to suffer. No, I enjoy it. That's, I mean, honestly,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't want to hear her answer. I enjoy it. I make it long only because I don't want to stop,  but I can, I can be disciplined. Stacey, is there anybody left listening now? No,  no, we can say anything we want at this point. Cause they've all disappeared. Anybody out there?  Crickets. I hear crickets. I was on my college radio station. Yeah. And I offered $20 to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  first person who would call in. Nobody called him. He called in. Wait, did aunt go away because

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  aunt, what is your thought here? How long would you like the show to be, sir?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not going anywhere. I'm just watching. Like two hours feels like a good show unless there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  like a lot of news. This is fun. We had, they could think of the fun we would have lost in the last  hour. The whole, the whole Karnak thing would have been lost to posterity. I mean, Stacey,  how dare you steal that joy from history. That's true. And apparently several people in the chat

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  room were like, Karnak, who is that? So I don't feel so lost. There is the course existential

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  question that if a podcast is produced, but no one listens, does it matter? Is it a podcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't make any noise. Or is it just a ridiculous phone call?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Startin' Burton, heart and bot. It is time to say farewell to our friend Stacey Higginbotham.
