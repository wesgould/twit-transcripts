Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Congratulations. Thank you. I was so exciting. That's Jeff Jarvis. He's a professor of journalism City University of New York. Also a regular  Not in Davos yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no next week. All right, and Jeff Jarvis dot think up comm  Yay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or plus Jeff Jarvis or budge machine comm that's right. We can now start using our think up URLs  Also here from gig on Matthew Ingram and by the way, Matthew I owe you a great debt of gratitude you sure do you did a  Fabulous roll-up page of everything there you need to know about the FCC decision yesterday. Oh, thanks priceless  Is that something new cuz that's a great idea?  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Know we do that periodically when when there's a big story that's complicated and a lot and it's developing so  I enjoy them because I enjoy reading them  So I try and make them you know as to pick out all the good stuff so you you can just read one thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's exactly what I did and it's very useful for me because of course we have to talk about this thing and  You know the initial media coverage just for people who haven't read about this  The federal appeals court  Essentially some say overturned the notion of net neutrality by telling the FCC that it did not have jurisdiction  In a case against Verizon Verizon had sued saying exactly that and the court said you're right now the  FCC may appeal but there are other interpretations of this one interpretation is it's merely that the FCC  Attempted jurisdiction in a way that perhaps was inappropriate because in the in the decision the judge  Who wrote the decision was pretty clear that net neutrality did need to be protected?  Ah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Am I right man said they basically did it the wrong way  Yeah  so they instead of they they tried to treat the ISPs like common carriers without calling them common carriers is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  why you know, that's an interesting point because  Common carrier if they had said you are like broadband service providers are like telephone companies  FCC regulates radio television telephone companies among others if you were a common carrier  Then we could regulate the internet the same way. Why is the FCC reluctant to do that?  Well, it's not just the FCC

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there's a lot of people who are reluctant to have it do that because if you recall they  There was a big fuss when they were talking about maybe regulation  The internet people said no, you shouldn't do that, right?  So we kind of you know people kind of want them to so that we have net neutrality  But don't want them to screw it up. And so the risk is the FCC being what it is  It tries to help and manages to screw everything up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, I remember talking with John Perry Barlow  Who's on the board of the EFF one of its founding members and  Even within the board of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. There's this debate over  Well, does the government protect the Internet or is that the worst possible solution? Right, right?  And I think you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even if you agree a group that agrees that the open internet unfettered net neutrality is something that needs  Protecting who does it?  Who makes that happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the argument the argument that that Cory Doctorow makes is that we're not trying to regulate the internet  We're trying to not break the internet that the internet has always been  Open in this way and the phone companies are the ones who are trying to  Go to a new direction and you're trying to stop them from doing that  And that's a good point. And in fact, if you see the internet as a sort of evolution of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know phone lines and phone service then then that sort of common carrier  Principle should continue so all the court said was you need to make that explicit  Mike was downside of the court of the FCC seen

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Telcos as common carriers in the internet context  So I actually there was a fascinating Twitter discussion last night that Mark Andreessen was involved in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That that home started and I did a sort of pulled together all of Mark Andreessen's tweets about the internet  And his point was that he very much wants an open internet and is very much in favor of net neutrality  But he's afraid that the investments that are required in new networking technology won't occur  If carriers and ISPs are treated like common carriers that they won't  Invest the money because they're not going to be able to get the return mark Andreessen

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's where I'm attempting to square the circle. You can't you know, how do you how do you encourage investment and preserve net neutrality?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And preserve net neutrality, you know, but but but the problem with that is number one they've invested so far  This is how we got the internet we have so far as my investment and and neutrality so far  They haven't had the balls to to go against it though AT&T just is just starting to try  And and second a lot of these people are  Phone companies that are losing their entire phone business and a lot of them are cable companies that are starting to lose their cable business  So having a decent internet service for consumers  There's no question there's market demand for that  double charging on both ends of it if you have a monopoly and you can get away with it and if you're  You know phone companies, that's the way you treat people as prisoners. Yeah  So the real solution in the long run isn't regulation  The real solution in the long run has to be competition and has to be consumers going to a decent choice  The problem is we don't have that competition. We don't have that choice  The judge the judge specifically mentioned that yeah, you know, he said even though I'm making this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ruling the risk is that that these companies will take advantage of the fact that there's very little choice  So does the FCC appeal or does the FCC rewrite its regulations?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's also some concern because Tom Wheeler the chairman of the FCC is a former cable company lobbyist  But he it seems to saying the right words at least now maybe not that much  Saying the right words at least now maybe not in the past about net neutrality  What is the FCC's next step they're gonna be as it said he's going to have said he has not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And in fact Mike Maznik at Tector pointed out in his piece that even if it goes to the Supreme Court  There there's no real indication that sort of in the law  That the Supreme Court would find any you know any other way than than the appeals court did no in fact

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's why the decision was written so narrowly  It's very clear that the FCC does not have the jurisdiction if you don't declare broadband providers  Common carriers and that's been the issue all along who has jurisdiction and it's I don't I think I think Mike's right  The Supreme Court now Mike is worried because he thinks that the outcome is going to increase government

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Regulation. Yeah. Yeah, and then that is the risk. I mean the the you know, Mark Andreessen mentioned that as well  If you look at virtually any other example  If you if you give a regulatory body like the FCC an inch they will take a mile and that's and the risk is that they  Just wind up, you know  Cluttering everything up and slowing it down instead of making it better for years. It was a hypothetical discussion that the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  AT&T and Verizon and Sprint said oh we would never do that. It's not hypothetical AT&T with a sponsored  content  Proposal is doing exactly  The wrong thing they're saying sponsored data. They're saying if you are a company like oh, I don't know Netflix  And you want to give us a little extra will  We will make sure that it does not come out against the can't the bandwidth caps that our customers have  But if you're a company like Twitter and you don't give us a little extra well, I'm sorry  But every bit they download goes against their bandwidth caps. That is  very clearly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The kind of discrimination we don't want and unfortunately, it's also really attractive if you have huge customers  You know bills. Yeah customers are gonna like it, but but it implements this toll road  Mentality Fred Wilson had a great post where he looked at, you know, imagine a start-up going looking for VC funding  They've got this great communications tool or this great feature photo sharing or whatever and and the VC says well, why would I?  Subsidize you or fund you your competitor has paid money to the carriers so they get preferential treatment

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mmm, there's no upside

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah customers and we need to be educated I think  frankly that  Yeah, this sounds like a good idea  Netflix won't cost you anything  YouTube won't cost you anything  but what it is is fundamentally undemocratic because  and this is the power of the Internet is this  democratizing force and this is why you have to do this because these come I I don't think there isn't there is a conflict between  Innovation on the internet and and limiting what these companies can do because as you pointed out Jeff these companies are the incumbents  protecting old business models exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go ahead Matthew

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  I mean the risk is if if we do get that model where certain things like YouTube or Netflix are given preferential treatment  And you get a discount you're not even gonna know what you're missing because it won't be there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You literally won't realize what you have seen. Yeah, and nobody would start something like twit you'd be nuts  Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So so I'm gonna get to that question in a second before I get there  Is there a chance that the FCC is going to declare them common carriers?  You heard anybody speculate to that end no, we won't appeal this decision instead  We'll do what the court says and we'll go seems like the right thing to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It I mean Wheeler seems to be hinting that he wants to do that. There was another commissioner who  But there everybody's dancing around it. I just don't think they've you know, even though it's two small words  It's it's it would be quite a huge step  Tim Wu wrote would be something for the New Yorker  Saying that you know effectively that's that's all they have to do  It's not that difficult, but it's gonna have tremendous implications

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Second question. So we we mobilized sopa and people what's to mobilize here?  Well, there's gonna be

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Free press is trying to do that. Yeah online petition  And freedom of the press who sound similar but are different  Organizations, but you know, they're trying to get a sort of groundswell going. I think it's a complicated issue for people understand  And so it's hard to sort of rally behind

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then third question leo how does this affect you well right now it doesn't these are this is all somewhat speculative right? Yes  It it presumes two things one that most viewers will start watching on mobile because this is all about mobile right now  Although it could easily extend to  You know home internet service providers. There's no reason comcast would watch  AT&T sponsor data and say hey, that's not a bad idea. We ought to do that  Right and verizon may have agreed with google some time ago. That was in proposed

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  FCC regulations that are now thrown out anyway, so right verizon says well what google who's that? Yeah  Yeah, you could see comcast saying, you know you if you if there's this deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't have a bandwidth cap and if there isn't this deal you do have a bandwidth cap  So so a it doesn't disadvantage us. It changes it not at all right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now because right now everybody's charged  Everything counts against your bandwidth cap. So it wouldn't change anything for us right now  But it would raise a barrier to entry to somebody coming in later and it could it could affect us if we don't get the  And I do think by the way most viewing is going to go mobile if all of a sudden we don't get the mobile viewing  Because people say well, I don't see why I should watch twit because it's going to cost me  When uh when netflix and youtube do not  When uh when netflix and youtube do not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you see have you seen a spike in mobile viewing is it is it is it relative to the kind of spike?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're seeing in general internet usage at twit. That's a good question. I haven't looked at those numbers

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean, I imagine that people stream. I don't know  I'm sure that most of your listeners download the mp3s and listen that's changing rapidly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is changing. I imagine yeah, so more streaming a lot more streaming streaming is coming on strong  And everybody I think everybody agrees streaming is the future for content. Yeah. Yeah, so uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just saw a number for somebody big like nbc or something like that flashed by  On twitter and they mobile was a huge proportion. I have to think it's gonna be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I have to think it's gonna be  Uh, and well all computing's moving to mobile all computing's moving to tablets and smartphones. That's computing not just  Content consumption that's computing  So i'm you know, I mean people watch us on our on their roku boxes much to my surprise but uh  um  I just feel like mobile is the future  and uh  You know anything that makes I i'm not so much worried about twitter  I just I hate to see anything that makes it less democratic the power power of the internet  The reason the internet has wrought such change and will continue to write to rewrite the rules and change everything is it's fundamentally democratic  That's so much more important  Isn't it?  Than anything else that's where yeah, and there's plenty of money to be made  I mean if there were rules made to protect barnes and noble against amazon.com that would be bad. We'd all agree on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but that's exactly what happens in in europe. Leo where in germany you cannot discount books, right?  Not allowed to yep. Uh, I don't I don't know whether they're allowed to give free shipping or not  But but uh, the bookstores are absolutely protected  And and institutions protect institutions. They don't protect their disruptors  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, anyway, I highly recommend if you want to uh, and so it looks like you're continuing to keep this up to date matthew  Which is cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, i've been trying to add stuff as much as I can

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, so go to giga ohm and look at matthew ingraham's article that is continuing a continuing story  What you need to know about the court decision that just struck down net neutrality  Um, and I you know, I the only thing i'd quibble with is I don't know  I don't know if it's clear that it's struck down net neutrality  It just told the fcc that it could not do it this way

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the only well, it's certainly on hiatus

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Net neutrality takes a vacation. Yeah, the only

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Government statement of net neutrality was the fcc's ruling and that is now  Voided ergo, there is no protection for net neutrality. I guess if you're a conspiracy theorist

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could say the fcc did in fact, I think this is what ars technica said didn't in fact screw it up intentionally  Maybe you know that like well, we don't want to uh, because I mean everybody saw this coming  They did. Yeah. Yes. This is not a surprise not a surprise and the fcc surely has intelligent lawyers who would know  That the court's gonna say well, you can't do it this way

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I know tim tim woo who wrote uh, he's he's the law professor who coined the term net neutrality he  he wrote a quite a  Sort of rant about the fcc and how they deliberately instead of using their big guns. They used the little guns or the pea shooter  And it makes you wonder why why was it just arrogance or was it were they hoping it would somehow they could slide it through or

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, or was it just it does seem strange. I feel like tim has a little bit of a bias here because his book  uh the master switch the premise of it was  Like every other innovative new technology, it's only free for a little while then the big guys come in  He well, he expects this to happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, although his tip to be fair his his view is that it goes in cycles, right?  So it's open then it closes because large players want to make money  they influence policy then eventually it gets disrupted and  Open things it becomes more open and then closed and then open. All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He starts off in the beginning of his we've tried to get him on by the way and he now consults for somebody  I can't remember who that makes it impossible for him to do interviews  Really? Yeah  Really? Yeah  He did one with the washington post. Yeah, maybe that's changed. I should I should inquire again  Because uh, I think it's I think he's very smart. He teaches at columbia. He's very smart. Yep. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, extremely smart. He actually worked or I think he worked at google or consulted with google for a while way back  I actually was on a tv program with him  Up here in toronto and we were talking about I think the master switch had just come out  and and he was looking at sort of the  You know from the earliest days of the net and and phones  You know the cycle that that tends to come closed open closed open

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hate to I mean, yeah, it's it's a good observation and he uses the radio tv newspapers  Um, um and long distance starts with long distance service, uh telephone service and says, you know, this all started open and  Freewheeling and innovative and then yeah the money came in and everything shut down  But I think I think you'd also make the case the internet is not like anything else we've ever seen before. Yes  In many many ways. I mean it's truly global for one thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Agreed agreed. Although you you know, the telegraph was global  Um, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know what

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It didn't have animated gips though. It did not have cats

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It didn't have cats and you couldn't deploy balloons and get telegraph. Yeah, there you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's where they really messed up. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Balloon telegraphs, let's take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm actually going to help ask you guys help with the change log this week  So i'm i'm less prepared than usual since i've been in launch mode a little busy. Are we?  I'm gonna give it a little shock. I have to say i'm honored that you took my website down leo  You're the first it makes me happy that you're the first person to take down my app that that it feels like a  Like I leveled as a chief and unlocked. It's a rite of passage

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And don't blame me blame the twit army my friends. It's back up. It's back and it's running just fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is back up. It is back up. I have great people. Um, so but thank you for doing that  All right the change log  chrome 32 launches with my favorite feature ever in a browser in a really long time noisy tab indicators  A new windows 8 look and better malware blocking and supervised users. I just I man. I just love this noisy tab indicator  Basically, it's just a little icon on your tab that shows you which one of your tabs is playing a video  streaming, um a sound music whatever or using your webcam  Uh or casting to your tv if you're using chromecast. So really really helpful  I i've always got you know dozens of tabs open and when you can't find the one that's playing that gosh darn music  It's kind of a pain  And that's chrome 32  What else do we have here? Oh, let me just before you move on to mention

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We talked a lot about the new ui the new  Uh chrome in chrome 32 on windows 8 and paul therot and mary joe foley on our windows weekly show were pissed off  They felt it was an anti-competitive move that google was trying to you know  Get people to embrace the chrome ui because they want everybody to chrome os  Uh, I disagreed strongly. I don't think google's out to screw. I think google wants people to use chrome on windows  But a lot of people are saying that the scroll bar is too narrow. The the ui is not native

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's not native. It's not native. Yeah  No, that's that's interesting. It's a bold move. That's like you're gonna use our ui. We see that all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They say well, in fact microsoft does it all the time. They did it with windows internet explorer 11  So it's not unusual. Uh, in fact, that's what the chromium team pointed out  They said we have a new graphic engine. We wanted to unify the controls across the board not just chrome os  And mac os and windows but everywhere  and uh because of this new engine  and um, they say hey microsoft does it all the time, um, but I have to say it's always a mistake to go non-native  Don't you think jean as a programmer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To not go native. Yeah, you got to use native controls. Yeah, I mean it just yeah, it feels better  It just it's a jarring experience. I think for the user when that an app doesn't feel native

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at microsoft's android apps says jimbo logic in the chat room  Good point. I mean they do it not to android  I don't say that i'm running do you think do you think google and microsoft hate each other so much that google would do this  Just to piss off microsoft. I don't think so  Yes, you do matthew ingraham says yes paul and mary joe thought I was a naive innocent to think otherwise  I don't see why they wouldn't why not they they do not like each other. I think that's obvious your muscles

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I think google is just  Standardizing on a particular look and feel across all their projects a la a la larry  And this is the one manifestation of that. Yeah, um, you know, we're seeing hamburger menus  we're seeing some particular ui bits, you know and everywhere and and it just kind of  Went to went to windows. I actually haven't seen it on windows. So I don't know how sort of jarring it is  It looks just like it looks just like the chromebook  Right. It looks just like the chromebook. Yeah, I see it. There's a screenshot here on the on the next web

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will say the  the the noisy tab  Is one of those little things like it's a it's not that big a deal  But it is so annoying like it's just when you have 55 tabs open and something starts autoplaying  Which of course all websites do even though it's a big middle finger to your users  It's it's just so annoying to be able to see that happening so i'm i bow down to google for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's a really nice thing and there are plenty of extensions that do this kind of thing  But it's a nice implementation and hey, it's a it's a nice way to promote or show off the chromecast as well  That they got in the cool cast icon as well  What else we got a youtube launches a new comments management tool and chat  I was going to ask you a little bit about this. I haven't had a chance to take a look  It's a new tool for managing comments on its site. It gives video creators a central inbox for all the comments that their videos  receive

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, yeah, and so what happened was is when they did the big switch to google plus  They removed a way for you to look at one big inbox and see all your comments  And so now this is this is my comments. I have a way just to go to a central location. Can you moderate?  Um, yeah, and so and so I could you know, thumbs up trash it flag it and so I don't have to go into every individual  Um place to to find my most recent comments. That's nice because anybody produces a lot of comment

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Content on youtube is gonna have all sorts of comments. Yeah, and as you can see it tells you which which video

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it's been you know, I just uploaded this one today. This one's been out for a while now  Um, and so it's good to have it all in one one location so that I don't have to uh,  Jump from video to video to check out all my comments. So much much needed and very happy that we have it now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, very cool. Very cool  Uh google plus is now showing up in your gmail. This is a new feature that allows anyone on google plus  To email you and vice versa

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not anyone not just anyone in your circles anyone  anyone

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unless you said it otherwise

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, unless you opt out. So is it by the way you can set it. You can set it right  Yeah, by default it's turned on. Uh, but and you can opt out but you know defaults are powerful things  So so leo I want to hear you don't sound too happy about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I I don't read much email anyway, so I it could be bad. I don't know. Oh, is that why you don't many spawn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, how many circles are you in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Almost half a million fewer than these guys  Um, so supposedly if you're in more than what is it 10 or 20 000 you get the special treatment you get some special treatment

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so I don't I I tried to look at the the ops out upouts and I wasn't there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, so my my you have to approve it the first time though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My no my default and I haven't ever looked at this before says that only people in my circles can email me

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, you get that from where?  It's in your settings of gmail

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's in your way man. That's via your google plus profile. That's different  Oh, or is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that's what it says on this article  it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Via yeah problem too. My my main gmail is not my google plus because my main gmail is apps

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So so in mine by default and I didn't change it  Uh currently it says circles so I must be in that vaunted  Celebrity, yeah, mine did too. Yeah, mine did mine did too anybody with more than a few thousand followers  But the other choices are any and this is the default anyone on google plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually changed it to anyone  which  Maybe makes me a mental case, but I did it. Mr. Wide open matthew

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean look

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know email addresses are not that difficult to find  I mean, you know, it's an interesting debate about like our email address is really private  Like is somebody sending you an email? I mean, I guess people feel differently about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gina is it true that no one gets your email? I mean the the oh no another privacy fear  As I understand nobody gets your email and they don't need your email  They don't agree. They just send you a message. They just route through just roused through google plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I don't think it matters that much that they don't get your email  They can still email you until you turn and you can say don't email don't let this person do this again

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can block on a per individual basis you can do that's good  Right. Jeff's point is a good one. You could argue that it's actually a a privacy setting

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's making your email address more private. Yeah, because I could set it to no one like unlike matthew ingraham  And then nobody can email me via my google plus profile

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know I can communicate with you without you giving them your email address  And then you can block them, right? You can't once somebody has your email address. You really can't block. Oh, that's a good point

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I see what you're saying. I see. Yeah, so I actually like that feature  People will email me using the google plus  Connection and then I decide do I want to give them my real email address?  Do you know what I mean? So you it's a filter in a way. Do you want to extend that connection?  Or do you want to just keep it at you can google plus me and that's it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right, okay thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How far do you want to go second base? Yeah, right like you can have my twitter handle, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I like you can have my email, right?  If I really like you can have my phone number text me and then if i'm in love with you, you can call me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or or you can have like a push a push button restraining order, which is great

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Click here for my dna sample

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Another google plus related change to gmail  Is that you can star you can now star your contacts?  In gmail much like you can star messages  But when you start contacts in in your contacts if you're using android your starred contacts sync with your android favorites  So it shows up that those people show up in your favorites on android  So starting a contact on the desktop will start that same person your android contacts  So you can kind of keep that in sync and have your have your favorite people  Not a huge deal, but you know, I do like that favorites feature. I do use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do too and there's a lot of nice tie-ins for instance. My motorola x  assist program  Says nobody can ring you during do not disturb hours unless they're in your favorites. So  Managing your favorites is very handy. So that way people I I want to call me can

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, right. And finally, thank you for this one. Jeff  You can find creative commons creative commons images in google image search a little bit easier now  You used to have to open up the advanced search page to restrict the results  But now you can click on the search tools  Button to the right if you search for an image or click on search tools and then you can  Filter by uh by usage rights. So labeled for reuse labeled for commercial use label for use  All the time  That's great for anyone who publishes and writes and needs needs art for their work. This is this is huge

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All of our art is creative commons  And so i've used other search engines that do that but it's so much easier to just use google images. Yay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you could always do it before you just had to go to the advanced search now you don't have to right right it's just easier

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, which I really like because it it encourages people to be aware of of you know credit  You know not just pulling pulling photos and they can do it and they could do it  You know right right there on the front page of that having to know all the tricks

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's all I got that was uh, that was larry lessig's idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really? Yeah. Oh, well, he's the the creator of creative commons. So that makes sense. Yeah  Yeah  And that my friends is the google change log  You didn't need our help at all you sandbagger you

Yeah, like so so wendy looks like it's from new york's  It'll match like local followers and what people local follow you and um, if you retweet a lot if you favorited things in years past  It will surface that that's yeah, I never favored anything. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

So it's gonna be fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the basis of it's nice to be nice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah at the bottom that sounds like a jeenaism doesn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's funny. It was actually it was an anilism making fun of jeet not making fun of me  But he it was it was one of our early mock-ups  Anil dropped into the footer and I loved it because you know, we always joke about how you know  I'm the nice like people know people associate nice with me  Yeah, so so anil said, you know, it's nice to be nice and he dropped in the footer and we just never we just always kept  It it's sort of a little little inner inner joke and you know the  The point of the app is to be sort of positive, you know positive and show you kind of the good part  The good part of the network the thing, you know pat you on the back for the things you're doing  Well suggest things that could be better  I mean the whole the whole idea is to sort of make your interactions on these networks like as meaningful as possible  um and to kind of you know, like we have superpowers with social networks and  Think up's goal is to kind of show you how to use the powers for good  So it sort of sort of drives with our with our mission

I do want to talk about that nest acquisition  There's lots more to talk about too  Uh, we could go on for hours, but I promise we won't because uh, we gotta let gina go on about half an hour  So she can go send out that email to all of you who supported think up  In the crowd sourcing campaign crowdfunding campaign  Gina trepani here from think up.com matthew ingraham from giga ohm from buzzmachine.com  Jeff jarvis, this is this week in google our show today brought to you by our friends at  Squarespace.com the place to make your website  Never goes down gina  Never goes down just think about you actually have appreciation of how hard that is to do  Oh, yes, imagine if you weren't just hosting think up, but you were hosting hundreds of thousands of websites  Any one of which could go viral at any time?  That's a truly amazing thing and uh, I think you have to really credit the square space folks for making that  a fundamental  Kind of tenet of what they're doing. We want to be reliable  Dependable web hosting and then on top of that the best content management system you can get anywhere  You'll start with 20 beautiful designer templates that maybe you say well, that's not enough but believe me  It's it's plenty because every one of them can be highly customized. In fact, all you have to do is pick a template  I'm looking at forte here and then look at the different ways people have used it  One thing you'll notice about square space sites. It tend to be very visual a lot of photographers artists  designers use square space because  You know, yeah, it's a really good example. You may be a great photographer  But web design is a different discipline. Wouldn't it be nice if you had a place where you could put your website?  Where you could use your innate aesthetic abilities, but you didn't have to know css or javascript  That's square space drag and drop point and click you could take that template make it your own  Make it reflect your sense your style who you are  If you are a programmer, they got a great developer platform including this, you know color-coded syntax  Editor and and for javascript and css and all of that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  3.2 billion is not a lot to google

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I know it is I beg your differ, but it's a lot for nests  It's a it's a lot for google even if you're talking 5.8 percent of their cash position

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a lot of money  Okay, but they'll have that much like by the end of the week, right won't they? I don't know. I mean  They produce like 40 billion dollars  in cash like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. I just  When you talk about it in percentage, it's non-trivial  Yeah, no, no, you're absolutely right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's future developments and there's patents and there's talent

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think part of it is the design they picked up a whole team  Of of really leading apple designers, right? I mean, yeah, this is nothing that they have. I mean they do google does some hardware but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're not that good at it. They're not that good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's be honest, right  Google promised android at home to google ios ago and they never shipped right nest shipped android at home  So google wanted them period like that's they couldn't do it and nested  Uh, so, you know so it worked, you know  That was the android at home was the first thing I thought of when I heard about this news  The other thing I thought of was my friend my good friend paul ford wrote a piece on his website in 2002  I don't know if you guys have seen this piece. It's called robot exclusion protocol. You should google it. It's really funny  It's really good. It was 2002. So it was you know a long time ago 12 years ago  and it's  About how google  It's it's just kind of a short story about how google sent these little bots  I imagine them to be kind of rumba ish into his apartment  To index all his space and he has this conversation with this little google bot about it's you know indexing his space and so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hi, i'm from google. I'm a google bot. I will not kill you. I know what you are  I'm indexing your apartment. I don't want you here who let you in  I am google. I find many good things  I find that pair of underwear with little dice printed all over them and I watch the tape of you with the life-size stallman puppet  These are good unique things many keywords many links my master will say much good job little robot

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, I put the robot exclusion protocol on my door. That's my favorite

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Didn't you see it? I put robot.txt on my door, please  You understand google person. I index many things and if I am very good  I get to go to bot park and have more processes and an oil job  Thank you google must come inside apartment and index must  I know my rights. I'm giving you 10 seconds to leave  Yes, I will leave first. I index everything everything. I am google  I like it and that was 2002

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He beats it to death with a folding chair

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We also have that that german thing we showed once where where google street view had google home view and they went into your  Home and took pictures. Remember that? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  um, yeah, I don't really first of all, I had a nest  I installed the nest. I got rid of the nest. I have two nests and when we moved I didn't install it  Because it kept turning on the heat at inopportune moments  Really? It's well, it's supposed to know it it learns right? What the hell does it learn?  Well on fridays at 3 pm leo turned up the heat i'm not apparently consistent enough for it to deduce anything  So it was randomly turning on the heat and i'd and i'd come upstairs be 80 degrees and I'd turn off the heat say bad google bot  Bad nest it didn't it did you know what this was a solution to a problem that frankly didn't exist

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I think that those I mean maybe not the nest. I haven't used one  Although I do know trust me. Trust me. Use it. No, they don't they think it's a love it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's an in first of all requires a wi-fi connection  True and does not work without wi-fi period  It checks the weather outside and says it's doing some it's not anything  It's not the problem is it's not smart enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And maybe that is the problem. Maybe it needs more  controllability

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I I personally think  That it doesn't do as well as my thermostat that is stupid that I say at 6 am  Turn on at 8 am turn off at 5 pm turn on at 9 pm turn off  That's what it should do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, although I think the potential of the nest is that if it if you do have regular habits  And it learns it can actually help you save money  Yes  By reducing your your heating requirements and I got an email every month from that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I personally think nest is a really classic example  of a brilliant marketing  That people go. Oh, this has got to be good. It's wi-fi enabled. It's got a color led  Picture on the front and it's smart. It's smart  And I get an email every month telling me how much money i've saved  And and none of this really is meaningful. It's just magical

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So maybe it's just not smart enough like you said

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the money I mean the money saving thing is the so  This is interesting. I mean you live in california leo. I don't know how regular your hours are they seem to be pretty regular  I mean, is it possible that  It's it well, I don't know. I mean, I haven't tried it either. Here's the problem people say it can't be smart enough unless

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, okay, maybe i'm really if you're really rigid then the nest could learn if he comes home every night at five o'clock  But what if you don't the nest there's nothing for the nest to learn

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Okay. All right. All right  So you tie the nest to your android device and that really knows when you're on the way home. Yes. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it could it could be better. It will it could be better. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean my friend kevin has a thermostat he can control remotely  He was telling me a story about how he accidentally was showing off the app to someone and he was thousands of miles away  And he turned the heat up to you know, 150 or something and his wife phoned him and said why did you  Why did you turn the heat up? We're roasting it here, right? And he had forgotten to turn it down

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's actually what the only thing I found very useful in this is I could turn my thermostat up and down when i'm not there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that is useful  Especially if you know if you have pets or something or so maybe maybe version two

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, actually we've already had I had version two maybe version three  We'll get smarter. It's obviously refreshing to hear a critique

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  From someone who used it not liked it because I feel like i've just heard everybody talk about how great it is  I've heard people, you know, it's fine, you know, whatever the whole thing. So i'm glad I mean  It's good to hear like this that doesn't work for everybody. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I heard I got one I haven't installed. I got it for my wife for christmas kind of because something but but uh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Read read the read the article in the economist called the folly of solutionism  But he's not wrong that the notion that somehow technology is going to magically  Solve our problems because it's wi-fi enabled is is is is not wrong. I mean there is  All right, all right, all right, who said it solved everything a lot of people they're buying no no  It's very germane people are spending 250 for this thermostat  And because they spent 250 and they get a full color chart every month in the email  They've decided this is solving a problem that it isn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if you have a family with if you do has genus has have a regular schedule  There are things that you can do that will make it that will move along and and maybe be worth it for you  Or maybe not be worth it for you. I'm not sure either  I don't get the the the one that I don't understand is the smoke alarm. Don't call me call the freaking fire department

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I do like to smoke. Okay, here's where the smoke alarm might be and I don't own it  So this might be all supposition it does say where where it is  So there's a fire in the living room or more more to the point my the battery is dead in the living room  Because it's that alone that alone is worth it. That is worth money  By the way, they're being sued by both honeywell and first alert  Who also make three billion dollars? Yeah also make talking smoke alarms

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was gonna say that I heard the next version your google plus contacts will be able to turn

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What I don't I did see a lot of coverage worried about the privacy implications of the nest acquisition

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't really see that well, but maybe but just think a little bit further think about you've got a thermostat  You've got your smoke alarm you've got who knows window blinds that go up and down you've got your toaster  Your your home phone all of that stuff is connected to things your fridge your stove  There are privacy issues there  Depending on where that information goes and there were a lot of people concerned about nest  Was it going to share the information with google?  Right gonna google gonna add that to the sort of you know corpus of information that that it has about you and all your browsing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  habits at this time nest  Satoni said and the nest blog said we're going to continue to honor our privacy agreement  Which is that we will only use information from your nest to make nest a better product  We're not going to share it with third parties or google

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but it's not at some point you're going to voluntarily choose to share it because you're going to get value out of it because  When you connect it with your travel plans or something like that  So so, you know if it knows you're going you're you're leaving town and it asks you  Do you want me to turn the heat down for the week? Right? You know that kind of stuff  Uh could make it more valuable and I think people will choose to connect them

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I do know i've gone away on trips and forgotten to turn the heat down

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure other people have and this is nice because if even if you do you can go online and turn it down later. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So so yes is promising that they're not going to share data with google  But they're being acquired by google and google like expressly change their privacy policy to say that products could share data between them can nest  Did motoro I mean that's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That doesn't it's they said for now  Google says they're going to run it like uh, you know like motorola as a separate unit like motorola. Yeah  Um, I I you know what I here's okay i'll say what I actually think now  Which is that you're absolutely right the connected home that google had that promise of the connected home never delivered  Uh, if you're looking every company  In any big company and even small in this space is trying to figure out what's the next big thing  What is the what is one area that really has not been well addressed is connected home  Everybody's talking about the internet of things wearables  the  removing of cpu power to the periphery  What better way to get into this than a company that has two successful products and a lot of smart people  including programmers  I think this is this is google's announcement that the connected home is the next big thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And think about even just having those designers whether they're worth three billion or not  I don't know but it's one thing to come up with ideas like that and you could there's probably  people already coming up with humorous versions of what google's version of that thermostat would look like but  People who can design those things in a way that makes them appealing makes them simple  Easy to use that is not  You know that is a hard problem in many cases  And so to be able to have that right something google hasn't typically been that good at

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have a diversity of standards. You know, it's a tower of babel  Nobody's figured this out  You know, we've all seen the video of the guy using his android phone to unlock the door and said everything  That was somebody who spent hours and hours cobbling this together  What if google could just offer this as a full solution that'd be fabulous  So I think it's actually I mean, I don't know if it's worth 3.2 billion, but I understand I think you've got a point there  Absolutely. I I understand why google acquired them and I think it's a very clear signal from google  It's a shot across the bow. We're gonna do this connected home is big

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And microsoft has been talking about connected home for a while doesn't i've actually I did a tour through microsoft's like home of the feature  Which is one of this kind of thing that they have set up, you know and redmond and it was amazing  And that was years ago and i've never seen i haven't seen anything actually come out of it  Yeah, um, no everybody knows it's the thing apple does too. Everybody knows it's the next big thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's all about shipping right not very few people have shipped and somebody's shipped

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody shipped those are the guys shipped. Listen, it may not be the next big thing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The paperless office was the next big thing and it still is  You know, maybe we get dribs and drabs and it stops. I have now finally for the first time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Okay changing the subject  Changing the subject  Visuals oh, I know I shouldn't bring it up. Okay, changing the subject  Changing the subject somebody in the chat room said I next thing google buys if this than that  Yeah, we can see that totally right and then connecting things hue lights  and then  Hue lights, I don't get it all. Oh, I love the hue lights better than my nest  Hues are pretty cool. Okay, so here's an application jeff  There's an application on the ipad and iphone called exoplanet that notifies you whenever another planet outside our solar system is discovered  You set it up  It has a little button that the hue light then changes to the color  That it looks like on the surface of that planet depending on the sun that the planet's in the solar system

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's off the that's off the nerdometer  Ever existed without that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, matthew yeah, no, that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the geekiest thing i've ever heard of the nerdometer

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Off the nerdometer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nerdometer needle is like spiking in the red now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hue lights are very nerdometer very very big on the nerdometer. I don't think i've heard of these

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These are just smart lights phillips phillips makes them

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're not that expensive huge amount of money out of you that what's big smart about them is that they rip you off for how

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Much money 60 bucks in a bulb 60 bucks a bulb. Well, what no way they're led lights now  Admittedly leds have gone down you can get them in for 10 bucks now  But and i'm sure these will go down at the same time phillips is is rapidly reducing the price of leds  But leds are expensive, but they're 10 000 hour bulbs. These are rgb leds, which means they can make any color at all  from this light  So much so that you could take a picture with your smartphone  Put it in the hue app  Click a part of that picture and say light bulb you go to that color

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It can literally wait a second. Wait a second. Wait a second. All right, maybe you'll tell me for one thing  Can it stop me from looking pink? Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guarantee you  So for instance, for instance, I have a picture of a moonlit night  I I put it in my hue thing and I said, okay bulbs  I want to be a moonlit night and you feel like you're literally  In the moonlit night  You can also use if this and that with it. You can set alarms  You can say for instance, I want to slowly wake up  I want the bulbs to ramp up starting at 6 a.m. To give me a sunset or a sunrise in my bedroom  Uh, you can have daylight you can have night light now admittedly  There's no this isn't that practical and there are some strong negatives  For instance as I discovered if the power goes out and then comes back on the hue lights turn on full bright  And so in the middle of the night i'm lying in bed and suddenly good morning  Because I have a lot of them take me to the light and i'm how many do you have? Uh, nine  and then um  Uh, I reach for my phone because I know what's happened. Although god damn it the hue lights came on  And i'm and i'm starting to open the app and lisa just reaches over flips the switch which was actually the right thing to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like you live in the in the kingdom of modern marvels

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Between your toilet and the light and yeah in the future. Okay. So, okay the toilet now don't listen cover your ears  You gotta do it cover your ears. So you you get up you go into the bathroom the toilet the toilet goes  to welcome you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does it play a song or no, no this one does not there's the creepy line

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have found the creepy line

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then and then it's the seat is warm. It's heated warm. Very nice. Never sit on a cold toilet seat again  And they're also the water is heated. I wait wait stop there what I sit on a warm toilet seat is because somebody

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I know this is this is a clean warm

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a clean warm  Is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  59 years of a visceral response to sit down the fan goes on because it has a carbon filtered  exhaust fan in the bowl so that  Everything is exhausted out  and then  When you're done  Uh, there's front and back washers. They oscillate or pulse or any combination thereof. It's warm. You set the temperature  It bates you a wiper blade of any kind. No, it's a modern midday. It's a bidet  There's no touch no touch and then it has a nice little uh blow dryer  So after you're done washing you press the blow dryer goes  And it dries you off and then you stand up and then you walk out because the seat automatically the toilet automatically flushes  The seat automatically goes down it sanitizes and it's ready for the next person

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. All right. We're gonna have a howard stern moment here  No  No, it's okay. It's okay. Does it does it deal with dingleberries? Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a very powerful the thruster  Oh  It's slightly it's I don't want to go too far show time. All right, it's very pleasure. It's very pleasant  So on the howard's turn show  There's no brushes though, right no there's no physical so I realize what it is  I realized I suddenly understood this after doing this see you have to use the nest you have to use these things  To get it right and to get the pros and the cons  And one of the things and you I mean you can't just and this is why reviewers sometimes miss the boat  They try it for a week. Okay, I get it and they go on you gotta live with it  So what I realized is the japanese don't care so much about butt cleanliness as they do about not touching anything  So what this really is is a toilet where you could you could walk in like this and not touch anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. That's the point of it. Well because we've gotten the point, you know, you don't touch  In public restrooms, you no longer touch the water faucet, you no longer touch the paper towel  That's what this is. But of course you use your hand on the damn door

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So the idea and I think that they're probably right is it doesn't really matter how clean your butt is it matters?  How clean your hands are?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is the blower like the ones in the airport where it's like 8 000, you know, no, no, it's not a dyson

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the dyson. Yeah, you know what I want. I want a dyson in my shower. I just want to go  Around me dry. Yeah, I hate getting out and being cold while I dry off. That's a good idea actually they they have those actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think I could stand the side of the flapping flesh though. Like I always freaks me out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's gonna come off

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So let's just this is yes or no, this is an acceptable level of cleanliness for you when you're done. Yes. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's acceptable. You don't want you don't go god. I wish I'd

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And of course while we're while we're on  Supplement technologies two from the howard stern show one is poopery

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Would you I have poopery it's  Oh really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do not buy poopery side of you. I didn't know but okay. How about how about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is sounding like I am so  Anally fixated. I am not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What about the squatty potty in japan? You're just describing a normal. I am normal for japan

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unusual Japanese toilet. Yeah, a squatty potty. Yeah, i've heard about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, poopery doesn't work. So the whole theory  Is that it?  Creates a barrier in the surface of the it's just fragrance very very very strong fragrance  And uh, I it does not have any magical properties up in quivers as she carries it with her  Yeah, because she smells like flowers everywhere she goes  All right. So that's that one. I the theory of it sealing out  the  Deodorant that's me  But it does it's a very strong deodorant because it smells like whatever flavor you got and it's very very strong

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's the squatty potty which howard now swears by oh, so this is an image. I don't want

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I reviewed it on gizwiz  I reviewed the squatty potty on gizwiz

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that the one that where you're so it's not that you're like it's not a uh,  It's not a hole in the ground that you squat over. No, no, no, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It raises your legs up so your angle is better. It's a step stool for the can which is supposed to be better

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is ridiculous because all it's doing is bringing your knees to your chest to make your organs all fit together  Yeah, all you have to do instead of spending 30 bucks on a plastic stand on the toilet seat  No lean forward. Oh if you put your chest towards your knees, it works. Just lean forward. Don't buy a squatty potty  What have we done?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did say at the beginning of the show. It's that we talk about google and whatever the hell else we want to talk about

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we're covered now about a cloud of of of poop odor

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh god, this is martholmes martholmes gotta smell good. Yeah. Anyway nest. Thank you very much

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe they'll do toilets. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  uh  Is there any well, yes, would you like a connected toilet? Here's a story the moto g  Play edition is now out 179 bucks unlocked  google edition nice  Yeah, nice. That's what a price highly recommended

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, there's so little I mean, I just mean really little difference between the play edition and the regular  The regular version is unlocked and contract free

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would prefer to get that one because the moto assist stuff  The few little things motorola the camera the moto assist puts on there are good. I would get them. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so in fact motorola just announced a few new things that you can you can  Uh respond to text messages. I dictated my first text this morning  That makes me go over the edge on wishing I had the moto. That was so awesome big deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it says  The the moto x so this moto assist knows you're driving and by the way, they improved it now  So it uses bluetooth as well as gps  So it really does know you're in the car and it tells you you are and it when a phone call comes in  It will handle it as you tell it to including saying sending a text out saying I'm driving. I can't talk to you, which is great  Um, if a text comes in it will offer to read it to you. Hello in this nice female voice  You have a text from lisa. Would you like me to read it for you?  And I said yes, and then it read the text which was rather humorous in a robot voice  And then it says would you like to respond and I said yes  And then went bling and I and I dictated as a response  It said okay reads the response back  Would you like me to send this? I said yes and it worked. It was great. Got it, right?  Got it right anything wrong. Well, I've gotten good with dictating to uh, google now, you know  I mean, I I pretty much know how to do it. So it's good  Yeah, it's a handy feature  I I think the moto, you know, I you know me I change phones every five minutes  This is i've stayed with this one a few months. It's really good. I love the moto

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and it seems like the x is really becoming sort of google's maybe gina has thoughts about this  But it's becoming google's kind of test platform for new stuff things that can be sort of  You know baked into the thing and and take advantage of all that  Kind of google now stuff and the phone and whatnot  So it's like the leading edge of what you'll see later in other products. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think it's crossing over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Becoming the new nexus basically. I don't know. I don't I think we've been very careful to firewall motorola off. I don't know  Yeah  Yeah, so how so how is that different? How's that voice? How's it different than voice actions?  Doesn't android have built in like a way to respond? It sounds like it's a little better than voice actions  Yes, the answering that being smart about the fact that you're driving and answering and asking  Yeah, yeah, it seems like it just took it took it an extra. In other words

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't do it if i'm just sitting here. It only does it when i'm driving for instance, right?  That's really smart. Yeah, that is really smart when i'm in a meeting which I've talked about this before when i'm in a meeting  It says it'll send out a text unless it's a favorite  There's a lot of I think these are all little motorola things. Maybe they are trials for kind of yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe they're trialing things over using motorola as a test bed. That's actually not a bad the google experience launcher was  Was that moto x?  Only it was right. I think so. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so  Two so we got a trend  To make the trend because they have one more been taking great pains at first

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To not scare off the oem's like samsung htc  Lg, right by saying, oh, they're not getting any special treatment. Look, they didn't get kitkat  Maybe that's not so much

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Moto had the hat with the I love the hat too, right? Yeah  I love that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm telling you jeff you blew it  Hey, I'm a little red hat the red maybe but i'm liking my phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would have felt I would have felt a little bad paying 600 for where I can get it for 340

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's true. I think that that was a little bit of a ripoff  Even you know, even at the time we thought this shouldn't be this expensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, so how do you how's your nexus 7 working on verizon now?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I should have been kept in going more letters in the new year to the fcc  I just got so tired of it. They've been busy with other things. So it's it's working on t-mobile. Thank you very much  And I had a slight problem and tweeted and somebody said well  You should go to the president and indeed the ceo of t-mobile responded to me and I solved my slight problem like that  so t-mobile  hats off  This is the rumor there's a rumor that  From what's his name? What's the name?  that that  Verizon is finally going to add the nexus 7  Without branding to its sales lineup, but it's just a rumor. Don't know anything yet. We don't traffic and rumors here at twig

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, sorry, we called the jarvis option

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, um, yeah  Yeah, I don't have it on I still have it on t-mobile and it's working fine and i'm thinking now  I'm going to use my nexus 7 as my hotspot and get rid of my horizon. Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mifi, does it make sense? Is t-mobile as good as verizon where you are?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, no where I live verizon's a little better, but you know, unless we have sand the super server sandy  I should be sandy sandy. We should be okay  Uh, it's in new york verizon is awful  T-mobile is better t-mobile's great. I've got it here. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's great for me in manhattan and brooklyn

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And here's the here's the real question. So I thought I I went out and I bought I don't think I can return them now  I bought you know 60 dollars worth of refill cards and the sim for my old phone  So when I go to europe, I can take advantage of that wonderful new no roaming charge thing. Well first mistake  Wrong size sim idiot second mistake while the nice lady called me from t-mobile. I said by the way while I got you  How does this thing work with the foreign the the the no roaming charges only works if you have a post-billed?  regular account  uh  And so a prepay doesn't work for that  So I did all this stuff for prepay and the reason to do that was because anyway, it's my fault  I should have looked into it. Um  But yeah, i'm i'm i'm keep on questioning  Do I go ahead and make the shift and the only real difference is that to use?  We only have one landline now in a home, which is for old farts. We still have one  and uh, yeah, we still got one, uh, but like a cord and everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah  That goes to this thing. Whoa

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know now that we have a whole house generator installed. We may not need them very fancy  That's why we have it because when the emergencies yes same reason the power went out no phone  You know well no phone for after after  90 minutes or something the bat that we have our firehouse has a battery to keep the phone alive for a while  But that's that  um, so anyway  I'm trying to use t-mobile out. I know i'm in the boonies. I you know, i'm waiting the boonies  So until they get up here, I may not but at some point just for the case of of ethics. I should switch to t-mobile

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like t-mobile. I have to say but uh,  It really is specific to your region obviously  Yeah, all right. We're gonna lose. Gina. So let us get from gina tripani  Uh-oh a tip

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She doesn't have one because she knew she'd be off by then sign up for think up because i'm busy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm gonna go launch this uh this app. Thank you for letting me talk to you guys about it show it to you  Early and i'm sorry. I gotta take off early, but i'll be back next week

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We love you gina and even if it's just for five minutes. It's worth it. So thank you and congratulations

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice job i'm gonna go do this. All right  Start up hoodie, baby  Take care. Bye. Bye

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about you jeff you got a number? Yeah, I do I do I do let me come up here right here. So, uh, let's do this one  um, there was a story of business insider  Five days ago that a google develop a startup tried to hire a google developer and the developer allegedly blew off of  500,000 salary because he's already making three million dollars at google  Oh  So there's that and then and then it world came along and and asked man or myth  based on this  Three million dollar number and then and went to um class door  And looked up the numbers for compensation self-reported compensation  So it's just self-reported you figure the guy who makes three million dollars ain't going to glass door and put it in there  He's not he doesn't want anybody to know. Yeah, you guys read this is low, but uh, average total compensation  from google software engineers  Is 144 thousand dollars ranging from 78k to 550k  uh  Plus cash bonus that's total compensation average stock bonus ranges from 125 to 200k  Senior that's more what i'd expect frankly. Yeah senior software engineers average 210  range from 80 to 630  630 all right 630k. All right  So that's still a lot so, you know, is it could could there be a couple three million dollar people at at google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's I think it's possible. I think you get to three million by being poached and by saying to your supervisor  Facebook wants me. Okay. What was it going to take to keep you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and then they give you three million. They're going to say you're never kind of having that conversation again  Because nobody's giving you that fella, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, and you have to be pretty darn good, right?  But we've heard we've heard of that happening  Yeah  That's that's not unusual. Yeah  Three million  No, but we've heard no i'm not saying the number is not unusual i'm saying we've heard of people  Oh, oh, uh being protected at google  That google coming to them and saying what is it going to take to keep you? We do not want to lose you  Of course, it could be three million in stock options too, right? It doesn't have is it cash

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, you got also rsus which are the restricted stock units, which you know is as good as cash  Right in a sense. So, you know, I think it's I think it's possible. I don't think as many of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Matthew you got any tip or tool that you'd like to share with us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't have one prepared no need think up is great though

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm with jeena  So this was actually in the news this and that's how I found out about it. There's a  Really cool website code combat.com  That is designed to teach mostly I would say high school kids  But anybody who you know is interested in learning how to program javascript  Uh, it's they say the largest coffee script app out there and they've just went open source  And I immediately signed up and I told my son who wants to learn how to program about it. It's very  Cool. You're playing a game in this case. We're attacking ogres  Using javascript as the programming language, but they also have an arena where you can compete against other people  Um, this is free. It is very cool. They just open sourced it which makes it even more cool. Cool. Cool  I highly recommend it a great little tutorial a lot of fun.
