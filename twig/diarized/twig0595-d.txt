Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  including

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anthony Levandowski

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google angle see we could turn anything into a Google story because Google controls the world

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And because you could always say and I looked it up on Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Levandowski still owes like a hundred forty six million dollars. So that doesn't get erased right? I guess you can't pardon that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you can only pardon for criminal not civil. So you have you have judgments against you. You can't erase them

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was a Google engineer and served any time yet has no no because of kovats

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was a Google engineer who was accused and convicted of stealing secrets from Google and bringing them to uber  He got an 18 month prison sentence on a one count of stealing trade secrets one count of a number of counts  The full pardon means he will avoid a prison cell  He  Didn't go to prison yet because they could wait till kovat 19 was over

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, doesn't void his judge and pray tell why would Donald Trump care about Anthony Lewandowski

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So  We don't know because they don't when they when they release this and I read through the whole we do too  We don't know for sure  Because I read through the you know the stuff and they you know say he mr. Levandowski  Here's here's the pardon quote they mentioned the  Sponsors and then they say mr. Lenin of an ASCII is an American entrepreneur who led Google's effort to create self-driving technology  Mr. Levandowski pled guilty to a single criminal count arriving from civil litigation  Notably his sentencing judge called him a brilliant groundbreaking engineer our country needs  Mr. Levandowski has paid a significant price for his actions  179 million dollars although he did declare bankruptcy  So maybe he hasn't and plans to devote his talents to advance the public good  so Jeff is  Hinting  Might have something to do with the fact that his sponsors in this included Peter teal  Billionaire billionaire who Facebook billionaire he was on first ally and a Trump ally and  Palmer lucky founder of oculus who was also a Trump supporter Michael OVitz is also on the list

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Famous Hollywood super agent disgraced rich guys just gonna hang out together, you know, I guess they all know each other

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  anyway, I  You know, I don't know about the 179 million dollar award  He got 127 million from Google as in payment  So I don't anyway, I don't know

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These were almost all of them were white-collar criminals. There were a lot of rap stars in the list, which is interesting  Anyway, that's that's the Google angle  Not much more to say about that. Actually, there was some disappointment in the  In the internet community that the others like Edward Snowden Julian Assange  Were not pardoned or right forgiven

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why won't color rumor what's her name?  The one reality winner, thank you reality winner  Reality winner would have liked to see her pardoned. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But no pardons for them Trump had made noise about pardoning Snowden. He'd said something about that, but  Apparently did not there was some concern that what I read in the  reports yesterday was that his  there that neither the  Parting of Assange or Snowden would be supported by the GOP and Trump was concerned about keeping them happy  Given that he is being impeached again, and they will be  Trying him in the Senate and so maybe they had something to do with that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you were to take a just a average man's poll average person's poll and say was  Snowden is Snowden a  What am I trying to say spy a bad guy good guy bad guy  Should we just slap his wrist for treason if you were to take a poll would people say yes or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What would you I want to hear your answer first? I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't say treason because he opened the eyes of a lot of people that had no idea about the surveillance  That's going on that they didn't know anything about so yeah, I have no problem with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is it is absolutely a conversation that when when the Snowden event happened we had that conversation a lot around here and  Even among  our viewers who are pretty up-to-date on Snowden and what he  Revealed and so forth we're torn between the idea that he you know look he had a promise  He was an NSA contractor. He had a promise to keep those secret  And those and those who said no no you know he was a whistleblower, and there is some evidence that he tried to  Go through channels, but was ignored and so felt like he had to do what he did  So maybe that gives him a little bit of an out, but I have a couple I'm not as I'm not as sanguine about  Julien Assange  I'm not convinced that his heart is in the right place

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But no I know I agree with that the issue there though is the precedent that gets set if he gets sent to America and tried  On sedition right there's issues for journalists that right nobody likes to eat a song no money

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I said he's that he's that guy who is creepy and weird  But he's gonna be the person who sets your precedent because you got to protect the creepy and weird to yeah, yeah, yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's right, it's it's easy to defend people who are nice  fuzzy and cozy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know it's kind of always been the case. Yeah, I just finished writing part of the book about about  John Willis not booth  Who was a libertine in?  in England and brought about freedom of the press and  the end of general warrants and the ability for the press to report on the Parliament and  The ability to sue government for all kinds of things, but he was a he was a libertine  He was a he was a tremendous jerk in some ways, but it takes those kinds of people to push the lines

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like Hugh Hefner was that who it was no not Hugh Hefner

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well better better a nicer example is  Stand-up comedian help me out here old man. No no no

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, Louis CK. No  Lenny Bruce

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me Bruce. Thank you that yeah, John. It's Lenny. I got that one happy birthday John  I didn't even know yesterday was your birthday, and I did oh I neglected to say happy birthday John  Who is somehow staying a little bit ahead of me? I don't know how he's doing that  At noon Twitter  Kept its promise and transferred the POTUS account to President Biden the FLOTUS account to Vice President Harris

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But and created a new account. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep, and created a new account for  Second gentlemen second gentlemen a new account for second gentlemen dog game hot you know em off  So there was a little cut you know when when this is all new we're making up the rules as we go along  When President Trump got President Obama's account all of I mean Obama's account all of Obama's followers went to President Trump  Twitter decided this time not to do that so  President Biden who had a  Joseph our Biden account which had three million followers that account just turned into at POTUS  And this and kept three point seven million followers did not keep how many did Trump have at the end like 70 million  I was gonna say it was almost 80. Yeah, did not keep all of those  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There I wait wait wait wait wait wait  Joe Biden's account is 25.2 million followers. Oh  POTUS POTUS is not his own is three point seven now. Does that mean that's everybody who signed up today?  Starts it started at zero at noon and then he already got it. No, it wasn't zero at noon when I went there

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought that who was there because I was following him at Joseph Biden and it automatically  Converted the follow to at POTUS. Oh because Joseph Biden was his  Though might have been you know what it might have been president-elect or something it might have been some other

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they switched president-elect became that's what it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So president-elect Biden, okay, so he still has his personal account. Joseph our Biden is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  suspended

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Suspended because it's not him. No, no, it's cuz it's not him

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think it was Joseph our Biden. You were you were following really I was following

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cuz I read Joe Biden for 25.2 million followers right now on the screen active  Not suspended even has a couple tweets within the last four years. Here's from the Twitter blog

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What to expect on inauguration day. It was a little complicated. I admit so  Why it's at White House POTUS VP FLOTUS and press sec  Transitioned from Trump the Trump administration to the Biden administration  so  President-elect Biden prez elect Biden became POTUS Sen Kamala Harris became VP  FLOTUS Biden became FLOTUS press sec PESAKI became press sec and  Transition 46 became White House  So I of course very confusing. However  The  But you know what that makes sense because people weren't following POTUS they were following

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  President Trump. Well, no, that's because remember President Trump got POTUS, but he decided he didn't want to tweet from that  He wanted a tweet from his own, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what? I don't think it'll stay at 3.7 million followers for very long. Although I wouldn't mind  I don't know if you've noticed there was a study watching impose had this that said once they banned President Trump's a crack out  the number of  postings about false false news about election  Fraud went down 73 percent. It was it turned out it was all being kind of ginned up by his own Twitter account

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I don't know but there's a few other factors there  One is it was a terrible headline and then headline got repeated all over  Misinformation fell 73 percent on Twitter when Trump went off. That's just that's just absurd  There's no obvious you can't measure that wasn't miss a shirt. It was it was a leg was one hashtag a less. Okay  Number two the whole world shifted about then too. Yeah, where it wasn't so much about of course election fraud  It was about the coup and it was about everything else. Right and so  You know what? It just wasn't the stuff that they were pumping anyway, so it was it was wildly

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Misinterpreted in stupid media. Oh, wait a minute. I  Take it back. I was following pres elect Biden and  I did not get transferred over. I am not currently following at POTUS. Oh  So that's you're exactly right. I have to add unless I screwed something up, but I have to add that following  So anyway, you know my actually my only point is  It's Twitter who the hell cares and I do hope that  The new president does not use Twitter the same way the old president did. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have to debate this you have to wonder this I wonder I said I do hope that the new president  No, I don't think Twitter is an appropriate place for presidential declarations of war peace

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fireings or hiring. Let's not we're gonna see pictures of his dog

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's already very clearly being handled by a social media expert not by the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter's upset. I always hate that people said Twitter is upset Twitter's upset because he's already broken his first campaign promise, which was  He doesn't have a cat yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Most have a cat by now the internet  Is I have no desire to follow  our new president is just because I'm sure whatever the president says or does or  Happens to the president during their their tenure. I'm going to hear about it one way or another

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no. Oh, no. No, no Jeff Jarvis says you won't know about it unless you follow Twitter and Facebook. You got to follow

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You start early

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Very specifically said we've never known about George Floyd if it weren't for Facebook I could if we only had those instant replay buttons

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We didn't know about living while black  Except when Twitter came along this is going on generation. So don't was it covered. So don't say  Okay, so I'm just I'm quoting you. That's all you're quoting me about about a powerful white man  If you're quoting me about black people that aren't getting covered, you know mainstream

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, you've said that many times if you want to know anyway doesn't matter I'm I am I am being I am being censored

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't talk about Facebook on this show. So I won't no no no, that's not true. Oh, not true  However, I did look whether I couldn't find any Facebook stories. Did you find some I wasn't looking no, but hey

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't look at Google's latest AI ethicist scandal. Oh, yeah, there's another one

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  interesting one because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, so the Union now because it's another woman because I have so many questions following the dismissal of Timnit Gebru last year

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which was you know, very controversial we reported on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody who's still there by the way that she was dismissed or do they still try to say that she was I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's the latest on that but?  Her colleague Margaret Mitchell who did not write Gone with the Wind but is another Margaret Mitchell. She co-leads the ethical AI team  Is in trouble because apparently  She hasn't been fired but her account  Her corporate account at according to Axios at Google has been locked  Because she has been  Exfiltrating she'd been using automated scripts to look through her messages to find examples showing discriminated  discriminatory treatment of Gebru  and  Then exfiltrating it outside Google to other places  So Google said our security systems automatically lock an employee's corporate account  when they detect that the account is at risk of compromise due to credential problems or  And this is this is the or when an automated rule involving the handling of sensitive data has been triggered in this instance yesterday  Our system detected an account had exfiltrated  thousands of files and  Shared them with multiple external accounts  We explained this to the employee earlier today. She's not been fired, but her account was locked in my opinion for a very good reason

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so hold on because people can like those rules can be written very broadly to be  Used as a tool when necessary  So if normal use in practice and Google is to send certain data places  And I don't know if it is but you know  I used to send files from my work computer to my home computer because I was working on things and  It could be that she did that  Over her tenure for various things and then Google is using that now  I mean thousands over 20 10 years or something I understand. Yeah, we just don't know and we don't know if Google like  Applied this like suddenly looked at her account was like, let's see what we can get her for  this I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Axios asked Mitchell for a comment. She did not reply

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Her tweet was pretty terrible from a from a business perspective. Here's her tweet say you have a problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  With consistently alienating black women and have caused serious damage in their lives you could a  Try to undo that damage or B find more black people to like you the tokenism approach. Good luck  That's the tweet you're talking about  Yes, because oh this was what makes you say this this was because this was in response to Senator Pachai meeting with historically black colleges

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, so her boss big her granddaddy boss is meeting with  historically black colleges Oh dog

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you tweet this it is kind of snarky. That was Pavlovian. It was a really was a really weird Pavlovian with a twist  Yeah, no, so or bell triggers the dog of the dog triggers you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm the one who's salivating so I don't understand  So  Yeah, I left out  This is the problem I have with Twitter context  So so that makes no sense unless you see that there is also a link in that tweet  To this story on CNM Google CEO to meet with black college leaders following racism allegations

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the problem with Twitter or the problem with the story that quoted the tweet without the context

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, okay, but the Axios story has the context you just have to read one paragraph up, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, let's see if it doesn't do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who does it's not a picture

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You give you give me crap I'm gonna give you crap that's the way it works you started it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who wrote this tons of amazing stuff in Google research report is that you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it was too much to read but I thought you might be able to look at it quicker than I could to see

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's just it's just huge. They have pictures because otherwise, I don't know if I should  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When I joined Google says longer than a tweet though Leo, so might be a problem here

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is Jeff Dean senior fellow and senior vice president of Google research and health on behalf of the entire  Google research community. I'm exhausted already  when I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a blog post with a table of contents

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're taking over the show. Oh, it's the democracy would I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't know what its pictures here searches for fever here's  Here's some  Spatio temporal graph for modeling covered 19 spread. I'm just looking at the pictures you understand. Here's  either that's a river or a  Biopsy and they assign it a Gleason grade  This is a the green is a Gleason pattern of three yellow is a Gleason pattern of four. So there you go  Well, that's why that was me your reason for I think that's why I had it out. Yeah prostate cancer  Here's a hemoglobin levels. What am I?  Did you read this Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cool accessibility stuff we talked about lookout but the  Really like this, okay, this could be the AI changelog

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the AI

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's tons of neat things about AI that they're doing. Yeah, it's basically just I mean, that's kind of what this is  It's like a changelog for the whole year on AI stuff  So maybe we'll forget about their their BERT model not being as accurate or as fair  Based on the research from the last or we talked about  And we can look at all this other great stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're not get excited about a technique called hydro nets that uses a network of neural models that the neural networks that models a river system

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's interesting all of this  The bottom of it is just like a whole different language to me. I have no idea what they're talking about in that in that section

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You see there's here's the accessibility one. This is like hot dog not hot dog, although  It tells you mustard pickles, so it's called actually you may have used this it's a lookout which is an Android application  Yeah, yeah instead of  You know the one where humans help you  This is actually AI trying to understand but now is this does this still work as people are people using this they haven't they

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if they actually deployed it to many people they released lookout as an Android application

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at oh, it is I'll have to put it on my I am not using  And then translating ASL how fascinating is that that's actually not translating ASL

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's pointing out that someone's using actual sign language, and then you can say hey this person is actually speaking right now  Oh, it doesn't know what it says, but it knows that it's real

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they'll come next month

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that was kind of cool today when she did the Pledge of Allegiance in sign as well as speaking it  I thought that was great  so this detects  Sign language it doesn't understand it, but it detects it yeah, yeah, well first step you know there is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Responsible AI section here

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fly which could be considered this is this is the drosophila which is a fruit fly hemibrain  connectome oh  Wow  connectomes so  This is actually comes from a science or I know about this from a science fiction novel called the fall by Neil  Stevenson in which he says you don't know somebody to be the fly if you're aren't gonna save  You don't really put somebody's brain in a jar that would be dumb  What you do is you put their connectome in in a database?  Which is all the connections that the brain has made because that's the actual  Brain state so that's what this is doing the actual connectome of you know not a big brain  fruit fly brain, but still  That's a lot of data. That's a lot of data the connective. I predict will soon be  Rating out our unused brain space for data storage many ring neurons in the ellipsoid body or visual feature detectors  That would make sense if you're a fruit fly that's important  Compass neurons in the EB and the proto cerebral bridge are key parts of this system

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're not serious. Are you Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm not I was thinking sci-fi

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's kind of cool though. Look at that the connect. Oh, yeah, I thought you had a of the drosophila  Hemibrain  Yeah, you know what this is a neat this is actually a neat report. I mean, this is a lot of stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just there are neat things here, but it is  Remember, this is a marketing exercise

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But so was you know Bell Labs, right?  So we don't have Bell Labs. Well, we have Bell Labs, but we don't really have Bell Labs anymore  So, you know, we gotta have somewhere this stuff happens

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Much of Google's much vaunted  AI and  You know even some of their search stuff has been when deployed in the real world proven less than less than perfect  I shouldn't say much some it is hard to really track  Well  You're right. I'm a journalist darn it and that is my job. So to get back to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Think you've lost that reputation by being here the Margaret Mitchell story  I guess we'll wait and see because she she hasn't been fired  But they cut her off from a Google account for what they consider inappropriate use. She says, you know  You know the firing of Gebru. We've got a we've got a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Collect the information the background information you think that Google would be a little better at reading the room

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't have a problem with her tweet  No, she's just it doesn't she's saying what she feels and granted it  It's gonna be harsh, but it's this a harsh truth if you look at it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google isn't saying anything about the tweet  May be that had to do with it, but that was Axios is you know connection not not Google's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Well, yeah, it's not like Google's gonna be like we didn't like her tweet  There is there is actually his I mean journalists newspapers do this a lot they're like that was not an appropriate tweet  We're taking you offline or we're suspending you so the war between

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google Facebook and Australian news sites is stepping up  Google is apparently admitting to blocking Australian news sites from search results. This is as a test they did a test

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe again not them reading the room, but they did a small test. Yeah, it's like firing a cannon across a shot across the bow

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, by the way, we could do this we get this power, you know, we're  Google spokesperson told told the Sydney morning Harold

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're running a few experiments that will each reach about 1% of Google search users in Australia

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To measure the impacts of news businesses and Google search on each other

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Reaction of a head of a head of a horse in a bed

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's hysterical. We just want to measure the impact. That's all it's not a big deal in case we might do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what is the deal Jeff that?  Australia government has decided that Google and Facebook has to pay these news sources for for the snippets  They use in their search. Is that what right and then both are saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  variations of fu  and  And the fight before was we talked about this a few weeks ago the fight before was that there was only one  side of value that that supposedly  All the value went from the publishers to Google and Google said hey  We're spending these publishers a lot of traffic and they weren't allowed to use that well then  Australia said okay fine use that the negotiation but you must negotiate right and Google and Facebook are saying this is a form of negotiation

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I  Know you don't Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, Google. I'm sorry. I thought Google's always listening. This is not yet a law  Lawmakers haven't voted on okay Google stop

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the this according to the search engine journal this comes across as an attempt to intimidate lawmakers  Into voting against the proposed new rule that would force Google and Facebook to share revenue

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And meanwhile we have Vince surf the grandfather of the net the internet saying that the legislation  Fundamentally threatens the existence of a free and open internet  And I completely agree yeah, because if you're gonna make everybody pay for everything  You can't I can't link to you unless I pay you to link to you that just destroys

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Worth pointing out that vent is in fact Google's chief internet. Yes  It's also the father in the net, but he works for Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then the other story I put in here that I don't know is that the New York Post says that our trade reps are asking  Australia to the lay of the law, but I don't know in these cases whether it's real trade reps or  Mr.. Yesterday's trade reps well

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It wouldn't be I don't think Biden hasn't had a chance to get any trade reps in position

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, are they are they career people or are they purely political people? Yeah? I don't know yeah, I don't know yet either yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Daniel Bajar and Carl Ehlers asked Australia to suspend the plans  All right, so we don't know  Yeah, it seems like a bad idea, but you know Google's just really showing that hey if you do this  We can do what we did in where was it Spain Spain just cut you off well there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There it's a little differently because there what they did was they pulled out Google News right?  That's and you know yeah, it hurts some newspapers  It doesn't really hurt the users that much by what Google's doing here is saying what if we took news out of search results?  Yeah, what Facebook's doing is saying?  Is there threatening to say we're gonna we're gonna forbid both publishers and users from putting news up on Facebook, so this is the  Stakes are up

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to take a little break here, and we will continue with this week in Google boy  It's all Google so far good job everybody  And the crowd goes wow that the crowd is Stacy Higginbotham of Stacy on iot.com Jeff Jarvis  from buzz machine calm and of course Sam Pruitt from hands-on  Photography  Our show today brought you by a new sponsor, but I and I'm dying to get this the company's called Nureva and you are  EVA and  There's something that's near and dear to my heart  They're sound experts or sound engineers how many times and it happens all the time  I still see it on the news all the time you're you're doing a zoom call you're doing a Google meet  You're doing a teams and the person  The worst thing is if it's a big conference room, and it's just a lot of  Noise in the conference room or you know people are off mic  honestly  What we're doing right now social distancing has big app implications for meeting room audio and  Nureva has a really great solution for you  It's good mic coverage while people are distanced in a meeting space  They're sitting six feet apart  But that means at least some of them are sitting six feet away from the microphone  Most conventional audio systems just aren't going to handle that well somebody's going to be too loud somebody's gonna be too quiet  Somebody you're not even gonna be able to hear at all  You can get a beam forming system system, but then you got to have an attend technician come in and adjust it  You got a tabletop system that that's gonna require more mics spread around and then you what do you got to do?  you got to sanitize them in between meetings and  Both may require participants to sit in specific predetermined spots face in a certain direction. It just doesn't work  What if there were a better way to get clear?  Reliable audio so that your team could sit where they want act like they want face the way they want and still  Be heard feel safe and still be heard. That's Nureva audio. It is so cool. I got a demo and I was blown away  It's the first socially distanced mic system  Nureva uses a completely original approach to audio conferencing. They call it microphone mist technology  And it's really cool and you were there we we were talking with them it fills the room with thousands of virtual not real but virtual  microphones using computational audio you get true  Full-room coverage people can be heard from anywhere in the room no matter where they sit no matter how they face no matter  How they're distanced no technician necessary you can install each microphone and speaker bar on the wall all by yourself  But the the smarts in the Nureva technology autumn automatically adapts to the room's configuration  And every time new people come in it automatically adapts to that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And not just a 10 by 10 room any size

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Microphone mist technology has four patents  They've won numerous awards. They just won the top new technology award at ISE 2020. That's for their HDL 200 system from Nureva  It is as you said it doesn't matter what size room they have a full line of systems for small medium and large spaces

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lots of happy customer array by the TV or their multiple arrays

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's one array that thing about that barb about the TV. That's it. That's it  But but see this is where we've come so far in computational audio. It's kind of like computational photography  They can really in and in real time it automatically adjusts as people move around  They use it at HubSpot Jimmy and their principal collaboration engineer at HubSpot says we were so impressed with the sound quality the ease of install  The ease of the use of the HDL 300 was a no-brainer for us to adopt it  So if you've got meeting rooms and you want people to be safe in those meeting rooms  You need Nureva learn how Nureva and you are EVA  Audio is the simple cost-effective way to let your teams distance and meetings and still act and converse  Naturally if you go to Nureva comm slash tweet you can get a demo you can hear it. It's pretty cool  Nureva and you are EVA comm slash

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twit solve a lot of stupid what I didn't get the the safety angle. Oh, yeah  Socially distance and still be heard and you're wearing masks. I mean, I think it's cool without that  Well, you know, yeah, and that's the thing you're not gonna throw it away. You get closer to the mic

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, you'll love it a lot of universities use it now you'll love it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's really I'm thinking exactly for classroom thinking immediately. Yeah, and see, you don't know ahead of time be a hybrid  Some people off some people on so that's really I can see that number one of our classrooms. Yeah, and it's patent

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Didn't mean to interrupt you know, you can always ask I don't you know, that's great  If you're asking that means or tech guy right now listeners are asking and so they want to know  So I thought a really good blog piece. I wanted to share this with you  Not crazy about the name of the blog assassinate you dotnet  It's the blog of the assassin  But it's actually right. Yeah  he's actually a  He or she actually that's a good question, I don't know it's hard to tell with the ninja outfit

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Doesn't say I didn't understand this one on the rundown. I didn't I didn't explain it. So you may remember that github  Took down a very popular open source YouTube downloader YouTube dash DL  But they took it down  For a very interesting reason they got a DMCA complaint now normally from the RIAA the recording industry  Association of America  Normally these DMCA complaints are it's copyright violation  That's not what the DMCA  takedown was  they wanted to take it have it taken down because  Let me see if I can find the exact  phrase  Essentially because it it was bypassing  Copy protection  So  When it happened there were of course a lot of users of YouTube DL who were very upset  the Electronic Frontier Foundation  Weighed in they filed a counter notice  explaining why the RIAA's takedown was itself an abuse of the DMCA and  It was not justified at all  The YouTube  DL code repository had zero zero infringing material  The RIAA claimed that the primary purpose was to infringe copyright of  artists  Represented by the RIAA whose songs were on YouTube. That is not obviously the primary purpose  It's a YouTube downloader. You can use it download this show  The one little mistake they probably made that the project made is they had a they had test code  Which would download snippets of songs from YouTube  That was test code that was not seen by regular users  It was just seen by coders who were working with it was going to test it and the EFF said  Even that is is a form of fair use and allowed  So the EFF's counter notice was necessary  Even when github was doing it, they said we don't want to do this. We're sorry, but we feel like we have to and  so once the EFF filed its  Counter notice it gave github the excuse it. Oh, okay. We're gonna put it back github reinstated the repository and  Importantly when you're this one's complicated if you're a coder you understand what git does github  Which is the software which is the hosting of the software called git  There's other places you can host it  But besides saving the code it saves all this metadata about who uploaded it which code replaces which code  What's more recent than others this metadata is at least as important as the code, you know  Probably other people have the code but that metadata pull requests bug reports  Are vital and so the reinstatement of that was important. Otherwise, it would have been easy for YouTube  Dash to yell to move to git lab or do their own thing or whatever. So his his point is  We were saved it was a bogus pull takedown anyway, but he also said  Folks this is why if you're an open source project you shouldn't just put up on github and think you're done  Because if you do get pulled down and you lose all that metadata that could be disastrous for any open source  project  He writes maintainers who host their projects in a large proprietary platforms like github or git lub git lab should always have a strategy  For such situations. They need to set up mirrors proactively. You've got a backup metadata, which is really really hard  The free software community should prepare themselves better in the future so good news  That it will be of general interest download  the YouTube downloader is safe and is up and thanks to the EFF for doing that but also news a little more of  less interest the general public but an important  Thing to understand is if you are putting stuff on github or git lab or any big public repository  You've got to also have a strategy for keeping that stuff safe in case this happens to you I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like to mention about having some type of contingency plan because it seems like that's why someone would use github is because that's right  how difficult it is to  Back up all of that information. What are  What do you suggest as a contingency? Well, he I don't I'm not an expert on this. He suggests a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  tool called getea or getee  He said that's not necessarily the perfect solution. There's an experimental tool called get bud, but I'm sorry get bug  But his point really is kind of more like a call to the open source community  We got a we got to think about this and figure this out  And and it's you know  No, thanks, but no thanks to the RIA which is just notorious and all this stuff. Yeah, they're not nice people  No, thanks to the EFF for  Solving. They're nice people. They're nice people  and  Yeah, so good news, you know the  People were still able to use you the YouTube  Downloader for in other ways and so forth, but it's good. It's it's still up there  Facebook you want to do some Facebook stuff never  Are you gonna yell at me? Yeah, you know the judge has said  Facebook in the the  United States again versus Facebook lawsuit antitrust lawsuit  March  Is a deadline for  Both parties to have their briefs

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So long bet here  How long did Microsoft antitrust take how long will this one take?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a good question. So here's the time a couple of decades, right? Yeah  Judge Boasberg of the district club you said Facebook has till March 10th to respond to the  States in the FTC complaint and then the states in the FTC have until April 7th to respond  There are two different lawsuits going on there's the FTC and then this what was the 46 states in Guam or whatever  So, I don't know if that gives us an idea of the time frame. That's pretty quick actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's quick but it's gonna go on forever, right? How long did Microsoft go on it started in 98 and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It didn't ever end it ended because Microsoft did it agreed to a consent decree and I think that was  Maybe eight years later. Let me say we should say it could have gone even longer. Yeah, Microsoft kind of said, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. How about this? So my prediction here so long bad  Is that is the Facebook is gonna get replaced in three different ways in the next decade and and it's gonna be even less  An issue. I think people are gonna invent new Facebook's that are better Facebook's  I don't think it's gonna be the force that everybody thinks it is forever

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's the timeline  DOJ in 19 states plus the District of Columbia filed May of 98  went on and on and on until  The settlement was approved in June of 2004  So six years six years  But you're right it would have gone on even longer had this settlement not yeah, oh wait a minute that was page one

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Page two

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can we scroll down to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is page three

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  2011 that was an 11 it took your math again 13 years

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fight over Android and that's been on it going on a decade. Is that is it done? No

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here's my suggestion I think that we can these these small baby steps on these suits  I think we can not should we not worry about those? Okay. I don't think we gotta worry about okay  I'll take those out of the run down  Google antitrust any of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Either an annual update or you should just note them as they happen. They're not that I mean the big moves aren't that  I  Mean this is the tone of the argument

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, I'll do a thing every page. So like in six years. We'll do page two. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like the the Google annual AI  Dog and pony show you'll have the yeah the big tech and here's what happened. Yeah, here's what happened in the lawsuits

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Turkey has slapped an ad ban on Twitter under a new social media law  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter and government's not gonna be friendly right now cuz yeah  So what that did apparently the law in Turkey is that the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twitter periscope and Pinterest have to appoint local representatives  This is a new social media  Law under the law which critics say stifles defense. I mean sorry dissent social media companies that do not appoint such representatives are liable for penalties  Including this one which allows the authorities to say you can't take any more ads  So you you know you can keep tweeting  But it's not over because  Twitter and Pinterest's bandwidth  Is not going to be a problem  But it's not over because  Twitter and Pinterest's bandwidth if they don't comply will be cut 50% in April and  by 90% in May

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my god, that's so wrong. This is gonna slowly squeeze squeeze them  Yeah, and is that because they had they stayed on their infrastructure, yeah, I guess  Oh nationalized internet so deputy transport minister

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sion  Says we are determined to do whatever is necessary to protect the data privacy and rights of our nation  We will never allow digital fascism and the disregard of rules to prevail in Turkey  This is by the way what President Erdogan has also said so he's just you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also very related to this is the Poland story we should do these together Poland

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Says we would never  We would never do what Twitter did I'm trying to find the Poland story so I can give them to the court  But this was was this the president of Poland

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, basically Poland's area said you from taking down us. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Very upset over  What Twitter did to President Trump all I can find is Twitter is Poland's Twitter account  apparently today is World Begos Day one of the  Best known Polish dishes often referred to as a hunter's stew the main ingredients of which are sauerkraut and fresh cabbage

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Poland Guardian Poland plan

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know it's like cabbage and cabbage. That's the main well minutes. There's fermented cabbage and fresh cabbage

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cabbage and cabbage cabbage cabbage there's sauerkraut. There's cabbage cabbage. There's a lot of nuance to cabbage

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want some Begos. Let's have some Begos for dinner

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Guardian Poland plans to make sensory enough social media accounts illegal. That's it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is this really is very similar to what Angela Merkel said in Germany and Emmanuel Macron in France  They just they're they're kind of all stunned by the fact that Twitter could take the elected  I don't want to do any more Trump stories. Can we just not do any more Trump stories and just say

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We can talk about about Poland not Trump. Yeah, I agree with you  I have like a hundred gangs today and I just stopped

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What do anymore but basically that they were shocked that and I think I understand this to be honest with you  Cory Doctorow wrote a very interesting piece  all about this they he was they were shocked that a  A  Private company could basically de platform the elected head of a country and wait wait wait

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you're if they all contend that that the platforms are media, so let's just go with that for a second though  I'm gonna stipulate that I disagree with that, but let's just leave it there, right?  So could somebody walk into Marty Barron's office at the Washington Post and say you must carry no this op-ed by Tom  No, you would never do that. Yeah, right  So now here you have mackerel and and miracle and Poland saying basically we're gonna compel you to carry our speech  Hello, does Europe not remember a few things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah  Basically Cory said the problem really is a failure  To enforce our our antitrust laws for for four decades or more  That's the real problem  He says we have a duopoly of mobile platforms iOS and Android an oligopoly of cloud providers Amazon  AWS  Microsoft and Google a small conspiracy of payment processors, by the way, that's which one shouldn't overlook that  You know that the payment processor

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Parliament of crows. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cory says it can small conspiracy. Yeah, maybe that's his new his group  Group noun for payment process their choices about who  May speak are hugely consequential and a concerted effort by all of them could make some points of view effectively vanish  But I have to point out Ben Thompson's good piece and strategic re in which or no  I'm sorry Mike Masnick on tech dirt who said, you know what? This is the market speaking, you know  The free market a bunch of independent capitalist entities said yeah, we don't want this on our

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Platform our three national newspapers in America decided or three 24-hour news networks in America decided  We're gonna stop putting up people who do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think it's no different Cory would argue the same thing that that's a failure of antitrust as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's a very clever way to get Cory's argument and then Cory's very good at that  But there's a higher level principle here, which is compelled speech is not free speech  The right to choose what you carry is free speech. Absolutely and he agrees with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He says the remedy for this is not  Forcing the platforms to carry objectionable speech. He disagrees with Poland and  Macron and and Merkel he says the remedy though break them up is enforcing not break them up  But enforcing antitrust so that the censorship policies of two app stores don't carry the force of law  And I know I don't completely disagree with him

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't completely disagree either but I think I think it's a it's a it's a specious tie of the two issues and I don't  Really necessarily want to tie them together. That's all  It's far be for me to ever call a Cory doctoral argument specious I don't mean that because he's brilliant but  I'm just cautious about tying those two together

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He says and he solution may not be breaking these things up the solution may be more decentralized platforms  That's exactly right

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's exactly what he supports  For instance, he wrote on the well he says  It's  You know, what should Apple and Google do about parlor?  They should remove it and they should say to users we remove parlor because we think it's a politically odious attempt to foment violence  Our judgment however is subjective and may be wielded against others in future  If you don't like our judgment, you shouldn't use our app store, right at least say that  Yeah, at least say that and then he says that invites a question. Well, okay  How do we switch app stores, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he's right but my fear is it's just like the 230 debate my fear is this is gonna be used as another cudgel  Right without his logic and without his principles to say oh good another way to punish the platforms another rationale  Right, and I agree with you on that. That is not what we want

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it but it is clear that if you have two app stores in the world  Yeah, that's a little bit over concentration of power  It's one of the reasons why I moved off Twitter to  Mastodon and why we have a just you know  Dark twitch social platform is a distributed Twitter and and I think that that's a much better solution. No one  Company controls the content thereof, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the same count when the app stores did not do a good job of controlling bad apps there  They got in trouble. They got trouble control and they get in trouble, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's well no no no, but that's but that but see that would also be solved by Corey's thing because  Again having a choice solves all these problems. The problem really is he says is lack of choice

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unless it's also odious that nobody puts it up and then they're still gonna come well if 20 platforms are odious

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Decide it's odious. That's a little less concerning than if to do right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's that's like saying no no if we go go back to the media thing again stipulated platforms about media, but  You get the right contending that this entire  mess of a hundred newspapers  Won't do something and that there's a hundred choices. There's a hundred newspapers you get them all now  But they're saying they're all liberal and they all  Operate in lockstep and they're all canceling us. So the volume didn't really make any difference in that argument, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Final thought and gets a final foot. Oh, no, I said I think this is the one time I'd rather we talk about tick-tock

Transcript:  You cannot tell me it remains of the day is equivalent to know it's brilliant. It's brilliant

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The writing and the production value, okay. Well, wait a three things the writing the acting and the production value, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Will agree with the head on that BuzzFeed page that says I think we can all admit it that at this point  Tick-tock is full of talent just waiting to be discovered. That is agree. So true waiting to be discovered and still undiscovered  I might add because that's a lot of it is a lot of talented people out there doing some nice content there  Well, it's not always for me, but it is pretty talented to see what they come up with

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you can have lots of talent, but you also have to have luck  You have to be in the right location. You have timing you need success. So  No, I think I think it kind of belies the fact that I  I think this is great in a lot of ways, right? It's like so many people out there have talent, right?  We're all pretty cool that way not all I'm tone-deaf but  And I think that's that's remarkable that we could celebrate that without it becoming this like  Celebrity, I know that that's kind of everybody wants that but I think it's kind of awesome that we can we can all give that  To people for a little bit and then go back to our lives and it takes a lot more than just talent to be  An entertainer as it were I think well you look at Sarah Cooper for example, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And and so she's got that delicate moment where she hit it. She's been trying to be a comedian for years  She hits it big with one stick and now she doesn't want to be known for that stick and how does she you know extend  Her career.

Transcript:  So here's a you know every time we get a new president since I think this goes back to when Obama wanted to  Use his BlackBerry in 2008 and they said no. Yeah  You have to use this crappy Windows phone because it's secure  The latest one is  President Biden has a peloton

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We talked about this at our show

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Presidential peloton, but he's a must be in great shape because apparently every morning he go he used to I guess  he'll have this in the White House now, but you go to his gym where he has a peloton a  Treadmill and weights and works out every morning very impressed  President yeah peloton is an internet connected spin cycle where they have  classes both live and  Recorded that you can participate in on your peloton and it you know  Watches your heart rate and your and how much you're doing and all that stuff  I didn't realize a peloton too and I didn't realize I think in the earliest days of peloton because they they could  You could be in the class they could see you and hear you  Because this tablet which is an Android tablet that's on the peloton and I after I read this article  I said wait a minute  I went in and looked at mine and it does indeed have a camera and a microphone on it  But I've never used that and that's apparently the concern  Cybersecurity experts are concerned that the Chinese or the Russians  Might be listening into the White House gymnasium

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  But

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sure that if they could they could take that Windows CE phone and make it secure they can they can make that the  President's peloton  Peloton can manufacture a special so what I would imagine they put some tape over the camera. That's a pretty good start  Maybe clip the wire that leads to the microphone. I think you're done so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's gonna void the warranty can't do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Apparently I did not know this but  Lauren good in and on the verge mentioned  in her review of peloton that's  somebody close to the company  Told her Michelle Obama had a modified peloton without a camera or a microphone in the White House  So it's not won't even be the first peloton in the White House  Peloton did not realize its machines are prone to risks according to popular mechanics on a security and compliance  Page on the company's website peloton says no matter how much effort we put into system security  There can still be vulnerabilities present. Well, that's true of everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  That's actually a responsible way to treat security. Yeah, we just don't know how it's gonna break yet, but we're looking out for it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right now Biden is swearing in a point. He's in a virtual ceremony and it's not zoom  But it's something similar and God knows what could happen  You can you can  Swear in Bob

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, wouldn't that be weird?  Any in any event I I encourage him to continue his exercise routine, that's a good thing  Bring your peloton. Come on his pick speaking of nominees his pick for the Security and Exchange  Commission head Gary Gensler is an interesting pick because he is a crypto  expert

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't like crypto people I'm worried about that  Like BMW drivers, he's a former

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gensler is a former banker served in the Treasury Department headed the Commodities and Future Trading Commission  In 2018 he joined MIT to teach courses about blockchain  technology and  As an advisor to the Media Labs digital currency initiative  He predicted in his 2018 speech that unlike Bitcoin digital tokens ether and XRP  Exhibit characteristics of a security even though their cases are different. You know, I think it's a very good thing to have the head of the SEC

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At least knowledgeable about these things, but you gotta admit, you know a lot of  Obnoxious crypto bros, right? Oh god. Yes. Yes. That's what I'm saying  Making a point about generalizations. I think a lot of people how about BMW drivers I

Transcript:  We are the enemy he what is what did Pogo say we have met the enemy and he is us

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The the blacklist with  China that that  Peaked my interest a little bit especially with more information from the new Xiaomi phones  And it's just another piece of hardware that will never get over here in the US. Did you see that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Interesting yeah, this is a Trump's Commerce Department. So unknown  you know, obviously  Just because there's a new administration doesn't mean all this stuff gets wound back  But right the Commerce Department added  Xiaomi  to the Chinese military blacklist saying Xiaomi and another  manufacturer of planes Comac were in effect the Chinese military and  So that they're part of a new US investment ban which forces American investors to  Divest their holdings by November 11th of this year  Not sure, you know the Huawei ban the Xiaomi ban  I don't you know, I don't know how much impact they had Xiaomi's a phone company. They don't make 5g infrastructure. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They make a lot of connected devices for the smart home they do make IOT devices, that's right, yeah  And the other thing is like tuya for example in the IOT is the baseline for like a lot of Walmart's connected gear  We haven't seen anything against that but I've talked to vendors who are like, yeah  We're not gonna use to you right now that whole thing with China is a problem. So I feel like I  Don't know what I feel like I feel like going to sleep have you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like we have when we have options out there for especially like the phone geeks out there  They love just getting their hands on the latest greatest phones  We we saw what Samsung could offer from the foldable technology last year in the year before and to this day  I still think the Huawei fold was the the better one that I had my hands on and yet  It's something that I would never be able to get  Right here in the US and then with what's going on with Xiaomi. That's another option of  Flagship devices that's not at that  Flagship pricing of well over a thousand dollars for a phone  It's just something else that we are continuing to miss out on as US consumers

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we had a Xiaomi item on our gift list this year done done done  It was the me smart desk lamp and it was great and so inexpensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you if you go to the new website for Whitehouse gov  It has the changeover has occurred  There's a picture of the new president the new vice president and if as many do because it's a fun thing to do  You view source on the page  You'll notice a comment right up top if you're reading this we need your help building back better  USDS gov  Apply which is a very familiar URL for anybody who watches our shows because of course that's the United States digital service headed by Matt  cuts  Plugs it every time he's on this show and on Twitter and now he's plugging it on the White House website  John you said there's a picture of a crab in there, too. I  Haven't haven't found that yet  What is a crab like an asking crab an ASCII crab somebody said well, I think that's rusts  The rust language is a mess  So but I haven't found that in the source code, but that has become the thing to do by the way  To hide stuff like this in the source code  Because there's something about geeks. We just like to view source  So I don't know if that's you know, but it's clearly a plug for Matt cuts United States digital service. There's the crab  Oh, okay. There is the crab. I don't know if that's a rustation crab

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's cool, I don't know God bless Matt he has he kept his head down and he's I hope he's staying there  Yeah, I hope so too. We need him. Yeah, he can he can fix the darn vaccine signups

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hmm  Well, is there even a federal thing? No, but maybe maybe maybe there were yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's not a federal distribution program. So it wouldn't make sense for the fact that you got to establish that first  Yeah, yeah, Washington State has a a  Phase something checker, but I'm so far. I'm gonna be like the last person to get vaccinated. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It laughed at me when I checked. Oh, I get it. This is on the this is on the USDS  Website the source code on the USDS site  And and actually it's not the rustation crab. It's Molly the crab the unofficial mascot of the United States digital service  It's a crab a crab wielding lightsabers

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Love it I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Love it. That's got to be Matt cuts right there in a nutshell  I'm just mad. You know, we'll get mad on I'll tell you what  Make a note of that Jason  We should see if Matt can come on  Make a note of that Jason we we should see if Matt can come on Twitter anytime soon because I'd love to know  How the transition affects or twig you used to come on twig all the time. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I probably won't be here next week. You can replace me with Matt cuts. What are you gonna be doing? What you doing?  It's a day before my migraine shot. So I'm usually like dying. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It gets worse and worse as you go up come up to it on it  I'm sorry. Let me cheer you up  Brave the browser brave has added support. See I knew this would cheer you up for the interplanetary  file system  IP  Fs  Fs what is I so fs Stacey? Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It powers the distributed web it's just a peer-to-peer  Data sharing storage protocol. So  It's it's like peer-to-peer  We say DNS. I mean it's but it's also has it's not just where to it's where to store stuff where to find stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'll tell you the tell you the dumb dumb urge not her was like bit torrent in some country. Yeah, for instance

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wikipedias blocked right because you might read about Tiananmen Square following gong or something like that, right?  So there is an IPFS version of Wikipedia  That cannot be blocked

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And people can find it if they're running running the application

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, if you're using an IPFS enabled application, you can find it and now brave the brave browser is one of them  So you could enter IPFS  Colon slash slash instead of HTTP colon slash slash and  I guess it would be  Wikipedia org. I'm not sure what follows that so because by the way in Turkey, they're blocking Wikipedia  They have for years. So there'll be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every ten years I get so excited. I'm like now we're gonna have a really distributed web. I  seriously do and so I feel like  I'm cautiously optimistic that this may be the moment. We have both the technology. We have the political impetus  We have tech savvy people maybe out there and we have a backlash against the big platforms  Do we have the business models?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I hope you're right I'm just wondering about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the question I mean you get you get smaller companies trying to differentiate themselves  Do I ever think how does it tip over into the mainstream?  Once you get to the mainstream then it gets kind of corrupted for business models and I and I don't mean I mean  That's that's what happened to the internet itself, right? So then I think you move to something else  So no one uses like Napster or BitTorrent really much anymore  And the reason is because people saw the light and they moved their official content into places that made it more easy  And accessible for people who wanted to get it to get it in a way that was almost what they wanted, right?  They just had to pay but not as much as they used to so I think that kind of always happens but I  Think we're ready for that in a much more wide widely

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would love a far more federated architecture to so many things. Yes. Well, and as it said it's like BitTorrent with BitTorrent

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Many people can host content and you can download it from slices from a bunch of different people  That's exactly how IPFS works. So you don't have to go to wikipedia.org to get your copy of Wikipedia  Many many people may be hosting snapshots of it  And then you can potentially get it faster on your side. It might even be faster  That's you know, certainly BitTorrent. That was the promise  That's how we distributed our shows before we got a CDN before I got cash. Why we used BitTorrent  It's also the hope I have for at Jack's blue sky

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, is that is that you add is it if you like WordPress if you have a an open?  Software layer even an open data layer, then you add value on top of that  That's a better model  That's a better model I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Think you know something like that exists already for Twitter that's mastodon and again  I'll just give a big plug for twit.social  Because it's exactly how it works. It's federated, you know  One of the advantages and disadvantages is anybody can make a mastodon instance. So there's a gab  Mastodon that gab is on mastodon, but I as a host of a mastodon instance can block it  I you know, I don't want any Nazis on my  Using my so my twit.social so I just block it  So you have you every individuals has control over what they see and what they don't see just like Twitter  You can follow anybody on any other mastodon server unless that server is blocked  It's pretty cool. It's pretty cool. It's exactly what  Twitter will never do because the reason you're not gonna see Twitter do that is because it undermines their entire  Advertising business right there is no business anymore if Twitter doesn't control it  So that's why you need a central Twitter  Site as opposed to distributed Twitter sites, so I don't know how committed Jack is to that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you know any more about that Jeff is no, I think he's mentioned again recently and and I think it  More excites me about it isn't just the technical end of it  It's  Relooking at where the value is and this goes to the discussion earlier about Twitter and social media and so on and  Corey  If to my mind the value is not gonna be in hosting people talking that's commodified already right too much of it already, right?  right the value is in finding that which is worth listening to and  You you can you can subscribe to a service that finds you good people  I'm gonna subscribe to a different service that finds me people  And then I'll yell at you that your service isn't good enough because you're still complaining and then the discussion is on a different plane  right, so I'm I'm then paying for the value of  Maybe it's verification. Maybe it's it's it's  of people or facts or things maybe it's  Curation maybe it's it's not unlike David Rennick of the New Yorker finds the good writers who finds the good tweeters  Is there value in that and that to me is where it gets interesting  That's why I asked about the business model piece because once you get it to a federated world, you know WordPress as  What is it a third of the whole web?  But it's just a platform and the value isn't in that  the value is at a higher level of service of  Curation of creation. That's what I want to see is get to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, but as you start doing those things and people become reliant on them they become the next platform that is that is  technology in a nutshell right every layer of abstraction

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gets but but but but but you have the the opportunity don't you Stacy then to have going to Cory and and and  What's his name who's our boss here Leo's point  Me you forgot me already. I forgot you for a sec. Yeah, I try I try  You go to their point earlier of if you had more choices, and so I don't think you end up with one  Chooser of the best of Twitter, I think you had multiple choosers

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But with tech unlike with like choices in like shopping  Think about it  Like if I'm shopping for food and I need I'm making a recipe for something and I need a can of tomatoes  I could buy any number of tomatoes and I think you would like your your platforms to be like that  But in tech what happens is if I'm choosing a recipe  And it comes what happens is I end up choosing and integrating my stuff to other things to make a bigger service or more  value right and then suddenly my tomatoes become linked to the type of cheese I use and all of this because of  This is a really stretched analogy. Yeah, the point is  I'm starting I'm starting it's not as interchangeable in tech because you have to tie so many things together and that here's my argument  I don't think it's text easy. It is  Hold it. Hold it. Hold on. Let me finish my thing. Let me give you a tech analogy  My my blog runs on WordPress my podcast blog runs on WordPress. I  Have a service that I syndicate or that that hosts my podcast and then I use a syndication service that  Pulls my podcast to my blog and then also syndicates it to all the RSS feeders  if I change  Not WordPress well if I change WordPress I have to change a bunch of other things down the line so it's harder  It's less fun to do and if I change maybe one of the many  Podcasts indication or link services on WordPress. I then have to go change it elsewhere in it  It is still very complicated. So the network effects the integrations all make it very hard to switch. It's not  Prohibitive but well it is prohibitive, but it's not the end of the world and I can't do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so let me just look at the other I take your point from the creator end from the public end  Right because I helped start epicurious back in the day. We thought we've got gourmet. We got bone app  We got all the recipes you could possibly want who could possibly compete with this bingo all recipes  You know bingo tons and tons and tons of services because recipes  We thought our gourmet recipes were valuable. We're actually made invaluable was the public coming in and improving them  And the layer of value changed immensely

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's say those recipes are way too complicated. No one wants those all recipes are like double can of soup on some pasta

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Put it in the oven. Well, that's why all recipes succeeded. Yes, exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's actually a really interesting point  so there's an effort right now like recipes are one of those weird places on the web that are incredibly stagnant because  There's not a like an HTML or an XML for recipes, right?  We don't have we don't have a standard for that. So I can only get my  Recipes on like the internet, right?  I can't pull them other places like my fridge or my oven or my even Google Assistant very easily because your June oven, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, right. You weren't here. We talked about that being purchased by

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You think that's a good thing I do the Weber guys built they they've used June OS really well  And they I've met I've met there. Okay, I talked to the Weber folks about what they're doing. So yeah, I'm really actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I really wanted to get your take on that. So I'm glad you mentioned now you have it. Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry  I didn't mean interrupt what I wanted

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was that's the point

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's a picture of Matt cuts in a crab costume  And now  So, what do you okay, I'm really curious because I've been reading a lot and I have again mixed feelings about this  two weeks ago to the to the day  There was as you know an invasion of the US Capitol by a number of demonstrators many of whom were armed  Some of whom were chanting killed the vice president there and can't see Pelosi  There have been many arrests. But one of the things law enforcement has done is put out calls to social media  Help us identify  This person or that person they're using face recognition  They're used you're doing all the things that we've had qualms about in the past. They're using  cell phone geographic location GPS data because of course  If you were in the Capitol building between one and two in the afternoon on  On that Wednesday, well pretty good chance you you were part of that group. So  What do you all think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We know if the FBI is subpoena that geo location data with it. I mean because to say hey  Well, actually no, I guess no who was in this area

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I mean you could presume obviously some people were there innocently or maybe you were

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Reporter they're covering it. No, but you don't want to scoop people up in those that does feel no, but I believe right

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I've been looking through some of the indictments and  It's really interesting. So they don't know how to have all the fun. Remember? Yeah, so much fun. Remember  for a long time police have been looking for  remember one officer was  There's graphic video of him being crushed in a doorway. Yeah, right  They have arrested  Somebody who allegedly was doing that and I was going through the pleading  And it's really interesting because it is laden with pictures from social media  pictures of from YouTube  Selfies that he shot  YouTube videos that he shot and yes, there's a cell phone location information in here that they cite  This is this is the actual video of the officer being crushed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But pulling the stuff from social media that he posted there that features him  I don't think well some of it's not a problem. He posted some of he didn't he's in it. Oh, well still I mean  He's in a public place. He's in a public place committing a crime. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How about putting out the video and saying hey, who's this anybody know I think that's I think that's morally difficult

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We don't have laws against it  I mean, it's kind of like the opposite of revenge porn in some ways, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it well Stacy is it any different from the morning the post office and you have the most wanted?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's kind of similar

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, because it's searchable and it lasts for as long as it lasts on the internet  So I do think there are actually differences there. I've not seen I just put up official

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  subpoenas for this information from the different cell phone carriers out there  I didn't but  Saying hey, can y'all help us out? I don't see anything  Different from like mr. Jarvis said just putting up the wanted pictures up in public. It's the same approach

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So no because they I mean  It's it's like if they went and asked you for your I mean  They asked you for your photos like hey everybody at a high school  There was some murder here during the assembly if anyone has pictures during the assembly  Can you share them? That's different what you're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is what is getting people's if the stuff is already public and and what I'm saying is hey  This is already out there. You know who it is. That's right. That's what I'm saying. I still think that's I still think that's okay. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Think that's okay, too  Using facial recognition on those images on like pulling them against databases like all your like driver's license database that gets a little dicey

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm still iffy on that part of it  The AI but I'm not saying that was done here. I'm just saying that that's that's a little more

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but I tweeted as soon as this happened  Provocatively knowing we would talk about it here that gee I wonder if any attitudes toward facial recognition change after a coup on the country  The other issue obviously is is the misidentification that the screw-ups that's where you're right Stacy that things can be damaging  I just put on the bottom of other  technology review put up a guide to  Ethical online investigation  Ethical toxic oh, that's good. That's really good. Yeah, right. I haven't read it yet  I just I just found it the other thing that's interesting to me is here's here's another you know twist on this  Politico and a political ProPublica took all of the parlor videos and then put them up and  Put them in timelines and locations  Superb job it's so it's somewhere. I don't know what line number it is Leo. It's somewhere in the in the thing  But it's really quite amazing  Now I don't know what the of course we know the circumstance by which the parlor stuff was all scraped because parlor was an idiot about it  Were those things up there for small groups were they up there Republican parlor? I don't know well

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the problem a parlor hadn't really secured it. I think they've got everything which includes. Yeah, whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's that's a that's using a bad platform  That's like when your journalist takes your picture and the geolocation data is on their picture and then the feds find you  Trusting the right platform right there  Insurrection you probably should be on a pretty secure platform

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  idiots  freakin idiots

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Again, we can be very grateful that they were not not very competent. Yeah, exactly exactly  Could have been a lot a lot worse. Amen

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you  Want a light moment here a light moment? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bernie memes. I love these mitten memes now. Where did the mittens come from?

Transcript:  This is actually on the inaugural stand Chris Christie's decided to join him in the beach chair, that's good  That's a reverse beam. That's a reverse one. Yeah, so Stacey you see this is this is where

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Going back to the prior discussion. This is where the unlimited creativity is so wonderful  now, there's no business model behind any of that, but people did it for joy and love and  The question is how do you give credit for that if you wanted to encourage that?  How do you create business models around that? I don't know, but it's it's fun. This is the first

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, we see this it's obviously out there and people are doing it.

So it is no longer  Possible in chromium to use that was unintentionally supported. Yeah  No, I think it was accidental  And it was and it was potentially security hazard  So I don't I think that they discontinued it not because they didn't want people to use it  Because the sink had some potential side effects the Google Play Store has icons now that show you how  the  App is doing on the charts kind of like with a bullet, you know, like and they used to do in the billboard  It's number one with a bullet  See these little these little graphs.

It's more like a malware detector  Apparently they were hacked  using it looks like Office 365  And Azure and  But the bad guys the solar winds hackers did not get anything  But some internal emails and not even that many the fourth major security firm  targeted by the solar winds hackers Microsoft FireEye and CrowdStrike and now  malware bytes  They don't use solar winds. They said it didn't come from solar winds. It came from a  dormant email protection product within its office 365  Wow, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But all we hold dear he's Microsoft's chief legal officer and president, yeah, yeah and  Yeah, I think I think he's probably not wrong  The problem is and the reason I don't think you hear a lot about anymore a lot about it, even though  These bad guys probably the Russian military intelligence  Got into everything, you know many government agencies many private companies is there's not much to do about it except go  Right

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're doing I'm sure we're doing it to them as fast as we can as hard as we can so it is it is an interesting issue  you know I  Don't know maybe I'm incredibly naive let's just not one of the last  Executive orders the president signed on his way out was in fact  to prevent gives the Commerce Department authority to bar transactions with  Foreigners and cloud computing products or services if the foreigner uses it for cyber attacks

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Apple hasn't confirmed it  But I think it's reasonable they've hired a lot of people with podcast backgrounds you basically just read your sub stack  I don't know what you know, and I don't know what it would be  We actually talked about this on Macbreak weekly whether it would be more like an Apple TV plus thing where they hire big-name  Producers and stars to record audio cut to make audio content  I don't think they would be doing shows like this, but who knows you know, I don't know  Anyway, it's a shame. Maybe Apple will give you a call  Yeah, yeah, no, yeah, somehow. I don't think Apple is ever gonna call me about anything  so but it is you know as Spotify and  Amazon and yes Apple and are all investing in podcasting in some way or other  I don't know what's gonna happen to podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's my understanding. Oh really? Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
