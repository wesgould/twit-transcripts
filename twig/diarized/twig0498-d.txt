Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. When do you move out of the house?

Transcript:  April 15th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yikes. So your buyer is so far so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She can't wait to she can't wait to move in. That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, she is excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also joining us. He's in Boston this week. Former TV guide critic Jeff Jarvis.  Oh, poor Jeff. He's the no much more dignified Leonard Tao professor for  journalistic innovation at the Craig Nomar Graduate School of Journalism  at the City University of New York. But MSNBC couldn't fit that in the lower third.  They apparently didn't have the technology we have.  So they called him when he appeared on MSNBC yesterday with Katie Tour,  former TV guide critic, which is about as I mean, and blogger. I mean, that's about as low as you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  can go. And sometimes Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Podcaster. That's as low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, that's true. Bloggers, a step above podcast. Hey, not anymore. Podcasts are hot.  Don't you know that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I put in like four things in the rundown. Podcast news.  Podcasts. There's tons of podcast news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But before we do that, go ahead.  We have a special guest in the studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm so excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The roadie Matic is here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I deserve credit. I think I deserve credit for introducing the roadie Matic to the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is OK to the show. But but I knew about it when you introduced it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She knew about it already. I knew about that.  I beat you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then I brought I brought a video to the show and I tasted the roadies and I told Leo he had

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to try it. This is was this a Kickstarter or something? Because it was it was it seems like  a very odd thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. So the founders, the two founders, they just wanted a way to eat roadies without having to do  it. Like having to make them every day.  The old fashioned way.  The old fashioned way. Because they I mean, it is hard to puff them up properly and whatnot.  Yeah.  I think it's a husband and wife team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of the founders wrote in on LinkedIn his story. He said there there's an automated way to  wash clothes, make bread and wash dishes. Why can't there be one to make roadies?  And that's when this I'm hearing myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How'd you get reverb on?  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was when the spark first lit.  He was doing his Yoda before folks.  He was a mechanical engineer. He worked in robotics. And so he it's actually quite  complicated. If in fact we can.  It is. It's super complicated.  Should we make some roadie?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can you make some naan and some pita too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think any flatbread. Right, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could make any flatbread and they're adapting for different recipes. So it gets constant  updates. Not with new flowers and that sort of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It has an LED on it says starting up and then I open the tray and then the little  roadie medic pusher is getting ready to do its thing. You can see in the top there is a canister  for flour, water and oil. Right. I think that third one is oil and it says set preferences,  tap play. So first thing I have to do is decide.  Play?  Hey, you know, it's a how many roadies do I want to make?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My washing machine says play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Four? All right. We're going to make the maximum number.  It says zero out of four. How do I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, you've got it making four. It just hasn't made it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I get it. So it's going to make four. I can choose the thickness, the roast level,  how much oil and then I press yes, play. Do you want to start making roadie? You bet.  It is now it says I'm learning machine and I'm adapting  during the first few roadies. Your roadie will get even better with time.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  This is so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that means it's sending your data to the cloud. Is it cool, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, my roadie privacy has been reached. Roadie panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Roadie panic. I'm not saying I'm just pointing out.  Everyone's like, oh, that's so cool. I'm like, yeah, but something's lowering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of noisy. Because it's like a 3D printer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go into the like. So when I shot my roadie video, it go into that side thing because  you can actually look in the window. Yeah, look in the little window. You can see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Carol Merrill is opening the door now. And so this is the needing device. So  right now it's mixing together oil, water and flour. They sent us some special  kind of Indian whole wheat that is, I guess, popular for roadie making. And now in a minute  it's going to pop a little ball out. Right? Ball a dough out.  Ball a dough. And it's going to knead it on that thing. It feels like. Is it stuck?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it takes a minute. It's got to warm up and do all kinds of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oops. My side door seems to be open. We just have to put it in the window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it wouldn't like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's because it could fire roadie balls across the room.  That would not be good. Warming up five minutes remaining. Well, we'll come back.  Because I also got something else today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, wait, you should tell people. Do you want to tell people how much it is before they get to it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No. It's a thousand dollars. But it's got to be selling like crazy because  if you go to the roadiematic site, they say how many roadies have been made.  And it's millions. Let's go see what the current roadiematic roadie count is.  Oh, did they stop doing the count? Oh, oh, they.  Oh, they did?  Well, privacy. Maybe I'm not on the.  GDR probably didn't allow it.  Yeah, right. Oh no, here it is. 43,746,079 roadies. And look at.  Yours will be there soon.  It'll be right in there. See how fast it's like a roadie a second is being made right now.  So I figure they've sold a few. Oh, oh, is something happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I saw the video. Yeah, you thought it was real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But as soon as it comes out, we'll we'll we'll cut away to the ball drops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of like I feel like Walter Cronkite. We're on hold with the roadie maker.  But as soon as the roadie comes into the chamber, we will cut away.  To the roadie matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Today is the 30th anniversary of his last television broadcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Today is the 30th anniversary of Uncle Walter's last broadcast.  Is it? Is it?  Graduated from the University of Texas.  Yeah, it's it's funny. It seems like longer ago than 30 years.  That was his last CBS Evening News.  Yes.  With Walter Cronkite. I interviewed him after he retired. He was into sailing.  And he had done a beautiful. I hear something.  Coffee table book of sailing and sailing ships. He was really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All your actions going to be in that side window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That side window. Yeah, Anthony is waiting to to peer in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then after after it gets dough, after it needs the dough,  it's going to pop it into that front area.  So can you open can you have the door open?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What? No, no, you can't.  You have to just enjoy it from afar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because then you get like dirt and stuff.  But you'll be able to like video through the window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So do you think it's home users or I bet you it's it's restaurants mostly that buys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's got to be home users. There's a very strong. I mean,  it's a pretty big limit. No home users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder whether there's a roadie medic at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Oh, that's where you put it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have quite a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They make roadies all the time. I've made roadie. I made roadie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I made non. It's making the cast iron skill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You see, define the difference between the various flatbreads.  Roadie is characterized as what versus a non versus.  I feel like roadies, the generic. It's the roadie is the tortilla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now is like a focaccia. It's a non is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's much thicker. And how what is compare roadie to a chipotti.  Chipotti is a roadie. They are roadies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like a crisp. It's like a tortilla versus a tortilla chip.  So roadie is a tortilla chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Roadie or flatbread then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they're like tortillas. But.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the non that I made, you let it rise.  And so it's puffier.  And you cook it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Watch when the road to medic, it'll actually puff up.  You want your road to puff.  Yes.  So you get some air in lightness in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK. I'm a big non fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I presume I could make non with this.  Or maybe not. Maybe it's got to be flatter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you can. No, I think I think we determined before you can make lots of.  You can make little pizzas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they do. I think it's only flat bread right now.  But it has a thickness setting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can make roadie, poori pizza.  You can make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can make poori style.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Poori, as it says.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those are fried.  Aren't those are what am I thinking of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe. Yeah, no, I think you're right.  Maybe you take it out and fry it.  Maybe just makes the poori.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My favorite Indian product are idlis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, the sad irony is I picked a terrible day to give up carbohydrates.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I forgot about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The sad irony of this is it's going to make something I can't eat, but that's life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can send it to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, as a matter of fact, I have a Federal Express envelope waiting.  Just see if it fits.  To go out. And I'll mail one to you, too, Jeff, if you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I doubt that has any gluten free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll overnight it.  No, there's definitely gluten in this one.  So the other thing I got maybe more germane to twig is the Galaxy S10 Plus has arrived.  I was surprised.  I didn't expect it to get it this soon.  And it came with the buds, which are kind of cute.  And so if you look at it, this is basically a.  Yeah, there you go.  You can see it.  It's basically the same size, a little smaller than the Note 9.  You can see the hole punch for the cameras.  And the thing that's interesting about the S10 has three cameras on the back,  kind of wide, medium and telephoto.  And this, by the way, this is the ceramic back.  So because I thought, well, what if you decide to spend as much money as possible on this thing?  How high could you go?  So this has a terabyte of storage plus I put a card in there.  So more than a terabyte of storage.  It has 12 gigs of RAM.  It's the highest specced Samsung Galaxy 10.  And it has a ceramic back.  They have white and black ceramic backs.  But I'll show you that you want to see the fingerprint reader in action.  So you see it puts a little thing on the front there.  This is not an optical fingerprint reader or capacitive like on the old Samsung phone.  It's a, let's keep it awake.  Actually, I guess I don't have to because you can see the little thing there.  It's ultrasound.  So in theory, whoa, cool.  Is it unlocked?  No match.  No match.  Oh, we're going to have to interrupt this with a very important message from Rody Maddock.  I heard something.  Oh, something going on.  It's happening.  Zoom in on that window.  Zoom in on the window.  Come on, Anthony.  It's moving.  Is a ball?  Is it kneading?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is the ball in there yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  There are so many parts in this thing.  This is so complicated and it sounds frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here it comes.  Yes.  So what happens?  The ball is going to form right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  What's going on?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's spinning around.  There's the flour.  There's your dough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's mixing.  Okay.  So most of that weight was probably just getting the element to heat up so it could cook it.  Right?  So it's mixing the dough.  It's adding now probably the water and oil.  Mixing.  Yeah.  See, there you go.  Now it's going to knead it and it's going to turn into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It spends a lot of time.  It takes a long, not a long time, but it's kind of crazy to watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're going to make four.  But does it have to do this each time?  I guess it does.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does it individually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So really if you had a family of four, you'd be waiting for quite a while for everybody to get a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  roti.  Once it's warmed up, I think it's one roti per minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A roti a minute.  Okay.  I think so.  Okay.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It takes longer than that for me to make waffles in my waffle.  Yeah.  So I'm kind of like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so would you like to have an Indian dinner and then make a fresh roti?  That would be kind of fun, wouldn't it?  And certainly it's an attraction for all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you can make tortillas with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that wasn't on your list, Leo, right?  Tortillas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, yeah, no, but I think now, Anthony, how hard is this to clean?  It's got a special roti cleaning stick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It comes with all the compartments are dishwasher safe.  Oh, so you can take it apart.  You can just to pull them out.  Wash it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry, Anthony, would you like to answer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, look at that.  There's the ball.  We lost a little dough on the side there now.  Oh, okay.  Now go to the front, go to the front.  No, quick switch to the front.  Here it comes.  It's going to come out of the front, Anthony.  Go, go, go, switch to the switch to the switch, the toaster cam.  Uh, Anthony is, Anthony's a perfectionist.  You didn't want to move while we were on him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you got to go down so you can see what's happening.  So it's going to pull this guy up.  This is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't even think MSNBC could give you this kind of coverage.  There.  Oh, there it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that heated?  It's going to hang out there.  It's heating it right now and it's going to, this is the puffing.  This is the puffing.  This is where it's, how does it puff it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it with heat?  It puffs it or?  It's heat.  It's just the heat.  Would you call this?  Yes, it's needing number two as it's, as it's cooking number one.  So that's why it's going to get to one a minute.  Oh, look, it's puffing up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Start puffing.  Yeah.  Oh, there it goes.  And it goes, whoosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this, is this said, you think this is, would this cat categorized as artificial intelligence?  Artificial baking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, because it doesn't learn.  Well, it says it learns actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This isn't actually doing.  Oh my God.  It's beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Puff.  Look at that.  Oh, now it's now.  Now quick before it cools off, we're going to pop it in this federal express.  Wait.  Okay.  Quick.  Give it to the couriers.  Okay.  You'll be getting that tomorrow morning, Stacy.  And I'll do one for Jeff too.  That's fresh.  You can't get any fresher than that.  Sealed.  Fresh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was supposed to, I was supposed to use the tongs.  I apologize, but my hands are clean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's okay.  I'm sure my FedEx truck and.  Okay.  Here comes another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here comes another one.  Another roadie is about to emerge.  So what is, get me a, uh, get me Jerry, would you get me another FedEx bag?  We got to send one to Jeff as well.  And then since we're making four, we'll give our studio audience.  All of you, you get a roadie and you get a roadie and you and you and you and you get a roadie.  Everybody.  It's Oprah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oprah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oprah.  Okay.  There's two people in the audience.  Now you're busted.  Busted.  Okay.  Quick, get me that bag.  This roadie is about to emerge.  It's getting puffed.  It's getting puffed.  I don't want it to get stale.  Oh, here we go.  Okay.  Okay.  We got the FedEx bag.  All right.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do love how it looks like an actual printer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It sounds like a printer.  It sounds like a 3d printer.  This thing has got whirring and clicking and buzzing.  It reminds me when I was a kid and I had a and I wrote there was a book.  Remember this book about do you remember that?  Do you ever read your daughter a book about a donut making machine?  It's like Bartholomew McCubbins or something.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  Very exciting.  Very exciting.  This is yours, Jeff.  That's got your name written all over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it's beautiful.  I think I see the face of Jesus in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say Mary or Jesus.  Oh, Jeff, you got tongs.  You got the tongs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You went up.  All right.  Nice.  Here it is.  Going to the courier.  I think we made FedEx.  Your delivery window.  And then the next two are for you.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, just wheel that off.  We did a taste test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They should ask why they're the second, you know,  because really they should have gotten the first ones  and options really for the next ones that came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, because you're the hosts.  And I wanted you to have the freshest.  Elegant.  Privilege.  There we go.  Anyway, I just got this Samsung,  so I really can't do a review.  The fingerprint, everybody has said,  is not as fast as a capacitive fingerprint,  but it does work.  It also has Face ID, which works.  And, you know, if you really, if it all breaks down,  you can go back to the old Android, you know, dot pattern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it better front or back for the fingerprint, you think, in the end?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I never liked it in the, in, I liked how Pixel did it,  but never liked how Samsung did it.  Because if you look at the, this is a Note 9.  And if you look at where the fingerprint reader is on the Note 9,  it's a little bit better than the Note 8,  which was right next to the camera, but it's close to the camera.  And so it's not, it's not ideal.  And if it's on the charging stand or on its back,  you have to pick it up to try to unlock it.  So I think it's a better spot.  But I think this, the ultrasonic technology is too, it's pretty early.  Nevertheless, beautiful screen.  I mean, you can see that immediately.  Where is it?  There it is.  Beautiful screen.  That is pretty.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that like Louise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I believe it is in beautiful bam.  Okay.  It's very snappy, as you can see.  In fact, yes, it's kind of thing where you just keep hitting stuff until it,  until it calms down a little bit.  It feels pretty fast.  So the next thing I'm going to do is try to fill up a terabyte of storage,  which means I probably can get every audiobook I've ever purchased since the year 2000,  plus every song I own digitized on here, which makes this kind of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What about, why would you not use video?  You could get.  I can also use it.  Should I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we could fill it up faster.  Well, that's been certainly my goal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's probably all security now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I can, actually, I shouldn't do that.  I, it just said, oh, you have an SD card.  You want us to save your video there, but no, I don't because  I've got so much internal storage.  I can save it there.  It's a typical Samsung camera.  Should we do an AR emoji?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ready for the taste test, are we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Should we do?  I can't.  I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you have two people, the studio audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to have to ask Omar and Sarah to taste it.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are they okay giving their opinions on the air?  Did you ask them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you okay giving your opinions on the air?  She's a one woman GDPR.  Do you mind if we share images of your face with the world  in any medium thereafter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They already signed that.  It's too late.  In any universe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm trying to be polite.  No, that's good.  If I were there with my daughter, I would not want her to jump on your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These people are adults and they've already signed away their lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they've already signed away their lives.  So, we're safe.  Remind me not to bring my daughter to the studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, you have to sign for her because she's not, she's not of age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I wouldn't.  So she'd have to like stand at the door looking in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, we're getting this new thing, a new sponsor called Envoy where they have a,  you've done that like, okay, give that to Sarah.  It might be a little hot.  Might be a little hot.  Oh, there's two of them.  Okay.  Omar and Sarah, you get to taste the roti and give us your  professional roti taster opinion.  She has a gluten allergy.  She can't eat it.  Omar, they're all for you.  Can you eat them?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He says I'll eat them.  It's hot.  Careful.  Do you want to give them some butter or something?  No, you eat it dry.  Chutney.  Oh, we want some chutney now.  No, just take it.  Nutella is the way to do it.  Just to taste.  Omar, just to see is this as good as mother's mom's roti.  Better.  Better.  You like it?  Yeah.  It was made by a machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They do have gluten-free flour options.  Your mom is now replaced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you could probably make it with almond flour or one of the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a $1,000 replacement, which is expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But cheaper than mom.  Moms don't come cheap.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  They got their...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Meanwhile, we have a very big story today, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the big story today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Facebook convinced to privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, let's talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we should do that.  And I want to...  The corollary to this is Facebook wants to become a bank.  So let's find that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Both Facebook and Apple actually are starting to look like that.  Apple did a deal with Goldman Sachs to do a credit card,  which I think is a first step towards doing its own bank.  Here is Alex Stamos' Insta reaction.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  To...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the privacy-focused vision for social networking.  I'd log in, but I don't have a Facebook account.  So I haven't read this yet, but maybe, Jeff, you can summarize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's a very big deal.  He's saying that over time, and it's going to take time,  he's going to switch the company pretty much to encrypted messaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The whole thing?  And yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know how much of the old Facebook will remain  or how... This will take time, but he believes that he's listened  and seen the pressure and seen the error of their ways,  though he doesn't go into great confession,  and says that the way people are going to want to communicate going forward  is in control and they're going to want encryption  and they're going to want a lack of permanence  and they're going to want interoperability across the services  and they're going to want to be able to communicate with people  without necessarily knowing the phone number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I will confess, when I heard this, I laughed, and I think others have,  but the proof is in the pudding.  I mean, if he really does this, I think Facebook would be...  I would go back, right?  So here he says, this privacy-focused platform.  So this is really a redesign, right?  This is a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a real pivot.  I mean, this is an honest-to-god pivot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We plan to build this the way we've developed WhatsApp,  focus on the most fundamental and private use case, messaging.  Talk about a pivot.  Say Facebook is now a messaging platform,  make it as secure as possible,  then build more ways for people to interact on top of that,  including calls, video chats, groups, stories, business payments, commerce,  and ultimately a platform for other private services.  You know what?  The model for this is probably Line and WeChat.  Line is used in Japan, WeChat in China,  and they've become dominant platforms.  I mean, very successful.  But they're not encrypted.  This will be.  That's probably smart, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  I mean, there's going to be...  Cops will hate it, and there will be dark things  that happen on these platforms as they do now on WhatsApp,  but they'll happen in a smaller scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here are the principles of this platform.  As you mentioned, private interactions.  People could have simple, intimate places  where they have clear control over who can communicate with them  and confidence that no one else can access what they share.  This begs the question, how are they going to do advertising?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's no mention of the business model to this at all.  My guess is that he makes reference to being able to have connections  with a merchant, with a company.  So I wonder whether enabling connections  becomes a new form of advertising,  which would be really revolutionary in and of itself.  But that is me guessing.  By the way, full disclosure, I raised money for my school from Facebook.  I'm independent of Facebook.  I received no money personally from Facebook.  End of disclosure.  Keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that is kind of interesting because it would be,  from an advertiser's point of view,  if all the interactions on Facebook were opt-in on the user's part.  The advertiser comes to Facebook, let's say it's Pampers, Diapers,  and says, look, we want to have a relationship  with parents who have infants on Facebook.  Facebook says, okay, well, we're going to ask them  if they want to have a relationship with you.  The parents who opt-in, and of course, Pampers would probably say,  well, you get coupons, there's going to be some sort of incentive.  The parents who opt-in are actually the people Pampers most wants to talk to.  People who are buying diapers and who want what Pampers has to offer.  We don't know how they're going to do this.  In a way that's like our model.  That's what our model is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So wait, you guys, before we get all speculative,  I really think that by not including the business model in this,  he missed a real opportunity.  And it's one thing to promise these things and to say these things,  but to not have, this is Silicon Valley's kind of, what is it?  Their weak link is they equate users with success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, build an audience first and then monetize later.  And that's how Facebook started, frankly.  I mean, Facebook didn't monetize very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Stacey, I don't think, the problem is here.  Yeah, I see your point.  But here's the problem.  I don't think any present day merchant,  say perhaps Amazon would understand this.  And so he has to announce it first, figure it out first,  probably doesn't know what the business model is.  And the advertisers, the merchants call them, will follow along much later.  I would guess he has some thoughts.  Proctor and Gamble, they'll say, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He probably has some thoughts.  And I don't blame him for not saying anything yet,  because it's not clear.  And he can, I mean, honestly, they can afford to build this  and not make any money on it for a few years.  They've got, how much money do they have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're publicly traded company though.  So they really have to.  Well, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have a fiduciary responsibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He says in there that some countries will not want this service  and they're fine with not being in those countries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Love it. That's the right answer, right?  If Australia says you can't encrypt, you can't have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe.  So number two, right after private interactions is encryption.  End-to-end encryption prevents anyone, including us,  from seeing what you share.  That's how it should be.  That's Signal.  But that, by the way, is not, I guess Facebook Messenger does use Signal, right?  So they use the Open Whisper platform.  So I guess that's the case with Facebook Messenger,  not with WhatsApp, I don't believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they're talking in their encryption section about working with law enforcement  and how to prevent people from doing, quote,  terrible things like child exploitation, terrorism, and extortion  on these encrypted channels.  So they're talking about how are they going to identify people who are abusing that.  And they're trading algorithms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He does say we had a case where one of our employees was jailed  for not providing access to someone's private information,  even though we couldn't access it because it was encrypted.  Wow. Did we know that?  I don't remember that.  So he says, on balance, I believe working towards implementing end-to-end encryption  for all private communications is the right thing to do.  Messages and calls are some of the most sensitive private conversations people have.  But we have to take the time to build the appropriate safety systems  that stop bad actors as much as we can.  Within the limits of an encrypted service, that begs the question, how much could they?  If they can't see into it, they can't stop it at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. So that's what I was saying is that they're going to use algorithms  to detect those patterns.  What pattern?  He then later talks about patterns of behavior among people  and connections between people.  And he says, on balance, he believes that working towards implementing end-to-end  encryption is the right thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they said, we're going to discuss with experts before fully implementing end-to-end.  So that's the big hedge on that is encryption.  Reducing permanence, you mentioned that.  Of course, that's what Snapchat does.  People should be comfortable being themselves,  should not have to worry about what they share coming back to hurt them later.  That's, I think, one of the big things that keeps under 25s off Facebook.  That and the fact that their parents and grandparents are there,  but they also want impermanence.  They don't want to create a record of their behavior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It makes a point that you can opt out of the opt out.  You can choose to save things.  The stories now go away and you can archive them.  You could archive things.  You could turn off the Mission Impossible tape and it won't self-destruct.  But it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If this is sincere, and I feel like it is, and they do implement this, only Facebook could do this  and this could be huge.  What is the monetization aside, and there are clearly issues there,  there's also issues with encryption, but let's put those aside for a second.  Would this make Facebook less interesting for its current users or more interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it probably broadens the user base and the people who are uncomfortable today  would be more comfortable coming back to the platform or spending time on the platform.  I hope he's sincere in this.  It doesn't address the big issue of people spending time on Facebook and feeling bad  about themselves.  So there's the issues of sharing fake news, sharing bad stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you hear that about messaging apps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You hear that about WhatsApp.  It has been a major factor in disinformation campaigns in Brazil and India.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In India it's been used to create mob violence.  Right.  So there are huge issues still there.  Yeah.  But that's because it's a one to many platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A one to few.  It's a one to not many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But this sounds like more one to one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Although they will have groups.  Absolutely have to.  They've reduced how many hops you can make with it recently to try to get to that.  I think it has the opportunity to pull down and as some are arguing,  it adds friction into the sharing.  How news works with this, I have no effing idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but even apart from this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go ahead, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  They're going to make it much more.  He calls it interoperability, but it's basically, you know,  Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, all of those things.  You're going to be able to message cross platform to people.  I don't know how I feel about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's going to be at your option.  But isn't that what you want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You want a phone that can call anybody, right?  Isn't that what you want?  Well, but I'm calling anybody who's on a Facebook platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I don't want my data shared across different platforms.  My audience on Facebook versus my audience on Instagram might be different.  Well, first Stacey, I don't think it's an audience anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry, my contacts.  And second, part of the point of this is that is someone who you don't want.  Let's say it's a merchant.  You don't want them to know your phone number.  You could have them contact you using the same technology through Facebook, not through SMS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you have more privacy in that sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what Mark's probably thinking is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is it anymore?  It becomes something entirely new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  I just don't trust them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, that's what this all comes down to is how sincere is this?  I think the opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He could be very sincere.  I think it's sincere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He knows he's got a crisis to deal with it.  He's trying to creatively deal with it.  Boy, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll see.  I've been extremely critical of Facebook and left Facebook.  But if what he's describing here, for instance, if this is created,  Facebook would have tools and this is going to be the crux of the matter.  If they have the willingness to use them to keep you from getting spam,  to keep you, you know, to give you control.  This is something the phone companies have been unwilling to do, right?  With robo calls and spam texts.  But if Facebook is sincere about this and in order to make this a good platform,  they'd have to.  And I know Mark is thinking as a technologist, we can figure that part out.  The real challenge.  The real challenge is for them not to get sucked in.  This is what happens, but this is what happened with Google.  It's what happened with Facebook is you start with great intentions  and then you get sucked into the monetization strategy  and you start to give more and more and more to the people who are giving you money.  And so your customers become your product becomes the users,  your customers become the advertisers.  This is a this is a shift to say our customers are our users.  And if they do that properly, that's exactly what they should do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This potentially this potentially is the end of the mass.  It potentially and only again, we're speculating.  We don't know.  But you just you can't imagine how you can amass a million people at once for a message.  And so if that's what they do, then those who want to send messages to us  have to establish a different kind of relationship and value.  That would be way higher value.  Because if you make that connection with somebody, that's way high value.  But if we if this is the first move again, we don't know.  We are speculating.  We are hoping here.  But if it moves away from volume for volume sake, attention for attention,  six clicks for clicks, six and all of that, that is the ill of not only the internet,  but also mass media.  It's the reason we have CNN the way it is.  Then that could be a really revolutionary thing.  But we don't know.  And proof of the pudding.  Yeah, because you're right.  Depends on how we executed.  So yeah, executes it and doesn't whether any merchants are going to find value in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He hasn't exactly earned our trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and he's still not earning it because he doesn't talk about monetization here.  And I agree.  Or I think it's a really interesting point that you brought up about the end of the mass.  And we may even not see it when we talk about firms like WeChat.  Their monetization strategies are very different.  They're actually doing much more of a store centric.  Yes.  Model.  So we could be looking at something like that.  You saw that I think it was last week.  They talked about Facebook doing a digital coin, right for WhatsApp.  So if you look at that, then maybe this is.  Yes, they had to do something.  This is a crisis.  But the cynical side of me is like, well, maybe it's just time.  Maybe we're maturing past crappy advertising.  You know, like we went past crappy banner ads and now we're going to go past crappy invasive ads.  And we're going to move to a different model.  And this may be that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is saying honestly, I mean, again, I can't spout for his sincerity.  But what he's in my opinion saying is we want to be a platform line as a platform.  We chat as a platform.  And just as Microsoft Windows was a platform,  you.  You.  One of the key elements to platform is your platform.  The people build on your platform make more money than you do.  But you make money in aggregate because they all give you the pennies as they make the dollars.  And it's not.  And now and look at Microsoft did.  They pivoted from Windows to the cloud is their platform to Azure.  And I think we all understand platform is extremely powerful.  It's it is make.  This makes a lot of sense if you're if Facebook given the problems Facebook has,  which are at this point almost insurmountable and people are probably leaving in droves.  And more importantly, nobody under 25 is using them.  Here's an opportunity to say, well, we don't need that.  We'll be a platform will be like line and we chat.  If you want to put air book airplane tickets, you'll do it on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you want to pay for your cab, if you want to get pizza, if you want to do anything,  it becomes a transactional insecure transactional platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And given this, the size of their existing user base, and even more importantly,  that that user base is in countries developing nations where there isn't a platform yet.  The opportunity, I think the opportunity is huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And frankly, we have to wait to see what the stock market thinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've we've lost out because we don't have a line or a WeChat in the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Facebook, we also don't have government control that makes it possible.  So your point, Leo, earlier is right.  Facebook's scale that it built the old way is what enables them to potentially build a WeChat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And by the way, and this is the this is the bigger warning than the monetization warning.  They become a quasi governmental operation because as soon as you're paying your water bill through  them and you're buying airplane tickets through them and you're transferring money,  they become more than a bank.  They become a quasi governmental organization.  They become the center of your universe.  And I think Mark also recognizes that.  And that's that that's a huge opportunity.  Isn't really that what Amazon is trying to do?  That's what Amazon's trying to do.  That's what WeChat did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I can see why Mark would say, well, don't worry about monetization.  If we build this platform, if we build it, they will come.  Here's Alex Stamos's reaction.  He's the former chief information security officer who left Facebook disgruntled.  He's a very smart guy, highly respected.  He said, this is not a post I expected to read and I wish he'd written it two years ago.  Two years ago is when Mark when Alex left.  Hopefully the external vision is reflected in internal moves to change product culture.  That's key, right?  That informs thousands of product and engineering decisions per year.  Turning a ship that large is difficult.  And I would agree with that.  And maybe Mark Zuckerberg is the only founder who still has enough control  and enough influence over a massive organization that he could actually do it.  And certainly he thinks he can.  Yeah, much more than Eric and Larry.  He talks about the two factors.  Sergey and Larry.  Sergey, Larry.  What did I say?  Eric and Larry.  Yes, Sergey and Larry.  He says, I totally agree.  Encryption is decentralizing and reduces the chance for centralized access to masses of data.  But making end-to-end encryption and expect the requirement for social networks is a massive  competitive moat.  Of course it is.  Why do you think Mark wants to do it?  Of course.  He talks about interoperability and God bless him.  I hope he does it.  But the ultimate goal of this is just as Amazon's ultimate goal is to get every transaction  going through Amazon's.  Mark's goal would be to have every transaction go through Facebook.  I think he's uniquely positioned to do that, frankly.  Wow, Stamos says.  It's refreshing to see Mark explicitly talk about the downsides of connecting people.  A problem, right?  Facebook never really acknowledged that.  And even using the magic words like terrorism and child exploitation and extortion.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's using those as a reason to not allow end-to-end encryption to hold off on that.  Right.  But he's right.  Those are hard issues.  Yeah.  Those are really difficult and individualized and they don't scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would be a mistake to be to insist on purity at this point anyway.  He might in the long run.  I don't know.  It's really going to also depend on what his customers want ultimately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They want purity.  And the problem here is the laws are going to come in like crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Well, I love it that he says if you don't like it, we'll go somewhere else.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Again, you couldn't do a startup this way.  But given it's a huge pivot, you're right, Jeff.  But given the size of Facebook's audience, and I would bet at least a number,  a good percentage of it would love something like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So can we talk about this in light of the fact that they have been using our phone number for  advertising?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stamos raises that.  He says, to that end, this week's two-factor number authentication screw-up has become  more important for Facebook to address.  While the number of effects is small, this is a clear privacy security win.  And not fixing it is incompatible with his sentiment that he wants to bend the curve  on perception.  So the issue we should tell people is, well, and there you go, Jeremy Burge of Emojipedia  tweeted it.  For years, Facebook claimed adding a phone number to Facebook was for two-factor, for  security.  But it can be searched, and there's no way to disable that.  You can limit it to friends, but it can still be searched, which means it isn't just two-factor.  No, in fact, remember, we reported on this months ago that you could also buy ads by  somebody's two-factor phone number.  So Facebook has been using it to monetize as well.  This is why they have a lot.  They've got a big hole to dig.  You know, they've dug themselves a mess.  I mean, you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I would have fixed that and responded to that before Mark's post today because it  just, I mean, Stacey put two and two together there immediately, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I don't know if they're just assuming that people, not enough of their users, actually  care about two-factor, which is probably a reasonable thing to think.  But I think two-factor is becoming more and more relevant to more and more people today.  And thus, they can't.  This is why I don't trust Facebook.  When everybody, when the whole sky is coming down on them, they will address it.  But when it's just a few people who are admittedly very smart, they're just like,  eh, screw it.  They're kind of like the Republican Party in some ways.  Stamos calls this...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, whoa.  Them shots fired, right?  I'm going to move on now, Stacey.  We'll pretend we didn't hear that.  Stamos calls this a judo move.  Actually, it's very interesting.  He said, right now, Facebook gets crap from the same people for both invading people's  privacy and not policing communications enough.  This, what Mark's just announced, is a judo move.  In a world where everything is encrypted and doesn't last long,  entire classes of scandal are invisible to the media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is true.  Yep.  And it's much better to be like, everything's encrypted in private.  So we don't know what you're doing.  We don't share our data with researchers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, we can't share our data with researchers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me express my concern about this as Mr. Public.  I would lament if we lose the ability to do a couple things.  One is to say something to the world.  Two is to find people like me who I don't know and organize.  Three is to share news and information.  These are things that Facebook is still used for and used effectively.  So is Twitter.  Well, that's what Twitter's for.  Twitter has its weaknesses.  Well, but I think it's a good thing.  Twitter has its weaknesses.  Well, but I think Facebook has some real differences there.  And I would hate to see Twitter become then...  And then everybody's going to go up to Twitter talking about,  you're a monopoly on news now.  They're going to give them crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the problem with Twitter that Facebook immediately fixes,  which is I can't control who's sending me messages and is in my feed.  Anybody can spam me on Twitter.  You know who did that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google Plus.  Google could have had this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They could have had this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This was very close to what Google Plus should have been.  I honestly think Mark said, oh, we're screwed.  We're going to...  If we continue down the path we're going,  I'm going to spend the rest of my life in litigation,  in fighting laws, in going to Congress, testifying in parliament.  This is not a life I want to live.  What can we do?  This is actually, in my opinion, exactly the right thing to do.  I imagine a Facebook where all the communications...  It's really a messaging platform where all the communications that I have  are with people I choose to communicate with.  I don't hear from anybody I don't want to communicate with.  It's all encrypted.  This, by the way, lets them off the hook.  In fact, Stamos says, Zuck has clearly given up on entering China  because these changes make that impossible.  Good.  He also says that a secure data storage section is a massive shot across Apple's bow  because he says, we will not build data centers in countries  that have a track record of violating human rights.  We're not going to be in China.  That's brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I envisioned, Leo, that there was a whiteboard in his fishbowl  and they wrote down every problem they have and stand back and say,  what could solve this?  And it meant changing the essence of what Facebook is.  They had to give up that notion of sharing and connecting  or connect at a much smaller scale.  They had to give up their business model.  I still think the answer to you in part is, they don't know.  But that's very Silicon Valley.  You say, well, let's build it and see if we're right  and then we'll figure that out.  But it's a judo move.  Yeah, Alex is way right.  It's fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He also brings up WeChat.  He says, this is the WeChat play, moving away from ads to intermediating commerce.  How you replace all that ad money is a big question for shareholders.  But I think there's an opportunity here.  WeChat's doing okay.  This is about their, this article in New York Times about their cryptocurrencies.  I don't know if they do cryptocurrencies.  I don't know if they need to.  Maybe they do a token system.  Maybe there's money there too, right?  So he says, the winners in this announcement are encryption advocates,  users in oppressive countries, users who don't like LE getting their chats,  that's law enforcement, EU data protection authorities,  and WeChat because WeChat has China all to itself.  It's a green field now.  Losers, groups who want more content moderation.  Facebook has dodged a bullet because they don't have to moderate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I'll tell you more about that in a minute.  That's where I spent last week was dealing with just that with regulators  and legislators and other people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Other losers, EU law enforcement, US law enforcement and the intelligence community,  smaller competitors who can't afford end-to-end encryption,  and WeChat also loses because it's limited to China.  It'll be boxed out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Brilliant analysis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's a brilliant move.  And you know what?  This kind of reaffirms in my mind Zuckerberg's position as a deep thinker.  I hadn't been getting that impression in the last few years.  I've just got an impression of him as a sweaty apologizer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm about to tweet that Leo Laporte, a late Facebook hater, is loving this announcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he has to live up to it.  You won't see it because you're not on Twitter.  Actually, somehow I am on Twitter.  I have some, you know, this is what's really hard about this throwing these things out  is as soon as you go back, apparently this, I had a cookie stored in this browser.  Now I'm on my old Twitter account, which I thought I deleted.  So I'll delete it again.  Facebook, I did deactivate as well.  Just go with it, Leo.  Go with it.  I use Twitter.  I use a non-personal account, which I don't use to personally tweet as a newsfeed.  And it's a great newsfeed, especially, in fact, I wrote a blog post about it at LeoLaporte.com.  If you use TweetDeck, TweetDeck is awesome because I talked about this before.  I can turn off retweets, which is where all the outrage and heat comes from.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  I just see original tweets and I only see it from journalists because that's who I follow.  Then it's that's Stacey's utopia.  But the thing is for me, it's never true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't actually use it as a newsfeed so much as I use it as a newsfeed.  Well, it is.  But it's a way to continually be exposed to ideas from some of the wonky people.  Yeah, you have conversations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I have conversations.  I still have trouble with conversations on Twitter.  Well, I hate people, so Twitter is good for that.  I can lurk.  Oh, I hate people as much as you do.  Maybe more.  I'm just fighting words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm the grumpiest of us all and I'm the one who likes people.  That's true.  Maybe we need to be grumpier, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People who need people are the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Honestly, most of the time, Twitter is still a lot of junk.  But I do as having it as a newsfeed gives me stories and that's useful.  The one thing I never do is look at at replies and that's why I don't get in conversations  because I can't control the at replies.  And I don't want to see most of the stuff people are tweeting at me.  I'm surprised that you don't get that, but I'm glad you don't.  I think that your mind will be changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I get some of it, but I'm too sensitive.  You get a lot of it.  I'm too sensitive.  Leo, you've been public for years.  You get people who, stupid critics like I used to be on TV Guide,  complaining about people like you who used to be on TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Before Twitter, I was a happy man.  I didn't know what people really thought.  Now I know what people think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think maybe people just are nice to me.  I've had like maybe just a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've looked at your conversations on Twitter and my mind boggles.  It's like, what a nice conversation.  No, what a wonderful...  I was like, I love my people.  She gets nice comments.  People are saying interesting things.  I understand why you like Twitter.  It just hasn't soured for you yet.  And God willing, it never will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe I'm just so nice that people...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought I was nice, but maybe I'm not.  Maybe that's the problem.  Maybe I just think I'm nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So can I tell you about where I was last week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I now want to know what Stacey's going, ooh, about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Someone tweeted me something really interesting.  And I'm like, guys.  What?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Levelhotpantry.com.  Level, the AI magic behind the hot pantry.  I don't even know what this is.  This is so exciting.  What's a hot pantry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is exactly why I'm not on Twitter.  Oh, gosh.  You just got sucked into something that by the end of the hour and a half you spend on it,  you will say, oh, what a waste of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Leo's going to get a hot pantry.  The level hot pantry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, my people are going to eat cold noodles and ramen and roti.  No, they're not even getting roti.  We're sending it back.  They're not getting nothing.  Oh, Stacey.  Oh, it's like a microwave that you...  This is terrible.  It's hot.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is interesting.  It's an oven.  I think it's using steam, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Start a petition among the staff to get one, whatever it is.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is exactly what's wrong with Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, and they restock it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't know, Stacey, because you're young.  But when you get to be my age, you will regret all the crap you're feeding your mind right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no.  My mind is full of all kinds of lovely...  Like the level hot pantry.  Plus I have to feed my child.  This is like literally my job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where do I order?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Karsten wants to buy it.  Revolutionizing the office pantry.  No, I'll tell you what's wrong with this.  You don't even know.  And you can't tell from this page, but I'll tell you exactly what's wrong with this.  The smell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unless this is vented...  My microwave does not smell.  Unless this is vented to the outside, you obviously never worked in an office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People cook all sorts of crap in that microwave.  And the smell all takes one person to cook the leftover fish from last night.  And this place will smell like fish for days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As a wag said in my office once when someone did that,  why don't you just skip a step and scrap and then crap in the microwave?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  I don't want the smell.  Well, these guys provide the snacks.  Maybe they don't provide fish based snacks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Maybe they have a smell standard.  They're in control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, you're going to smell this.  You're going to smell sausage cooking.  You're going to smell all sorts of crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sausage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry.  We got to stop talking about food.  I know just from our microwave.  See, the problem is...  And my office is right next to the microwave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's given up good food.  So now he just doesn't want anybody to enjoy food.  I don't want anybody to enjoy their food.  He's being the ultimate grump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  I'm going to a lovely cocktail party at Bourbon and Branson a little bit.  LastPass is having its party at the RSA conference.  In fact, if you're at RSA, go to the LastPass booth, get the password.  We'll see you at Bourbon and Branson in a couple of hours.  I'm not going to be able to eat anything there.  How was the roti?  Oh, Martin's eating the whole thing?  No, there's leftover roti.  He ate one.  That's like three stars.  That's moderate.  If it was really good, they'd be gone, right?  Yeah.  All right.  I know.  I know.  I'm no fool.  Our show today brought you by...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, you're cranky pants today.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He really is.  I'm not cranky.  I'm honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have some bread.  You'll feel a lot better.  I am not a Pollyanna.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am not a Pollyanna either.  You were so much more credulous on Facebook.  Okay.  Do your ad.  I'm sorry.  Cranky pants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're right.  I was the Pollyanna on Facebook, wasn't I?  I know.  No, I'm hopeful because I feel like this is a...  You're right.  All evidence points to the contrary that Mark will screw this up, that he's not sincere,  blah, blah, blah.  But I do believe he's sincere.  I believe he has the wherewithal to do this.  If he really does this, this will save Facebook for me and I think for itself  and provide a much needed service.  My concern is at the other end where it becomes a monopoly basically.  There's some issues with that or a monopsony.  There's some issues with that because we're going to live in a world frankly  where it's Amazon, Google, Facebook and that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And me because...  King of the podcast.  If I could make a pivot, I would.  There's no pivot left.  I am pivot free.  We're stuck.  We're on this road and we're going...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You and I are too old to pivot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, we are.  We're past the point of pivot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not too late for Stacey to pivot.  But former TV critic, TV guide critic, Jeff Jarvis and former podcaster Leo Laporte.  No pivoting.  There's nowhere left to pivot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No pivot's left.  We are past the last pivot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're not a pivot.  We're a pivot.  Pivot of no return.  Yep.  We're a pivot of no return.  Pivot of no return.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pivot out of your divot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although I am thinking of opening a roadie restaurant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Be very slow.  Once a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could have multiple machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, now you're gonna have it.  Our show today brought to you by On Deck.  If you are a small business owner, let's say you have a nice little roadie shop,  a nice little business going, but you've run up against a little bit of an impediment.  You only have one roadie machine.  That means you can only serve one customer a minute.  You'd like to do two a minute or three a minute.  What do you need?  You need some capital.  You need some cash.  You need On Deck.  On Deck is for the small business with fast, easy, tailored financing.  This is what they do.  And they have done it a lot.

Well, I am glad you brought that up, Jeff,  because I had not really paid any attention to it because it came out this morning.  You're welcome.  I was busy.  I didn't see it.  I'm very excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm really glad we had you.  I'm glad it happened today because I wasn't sure what to think fully,  and I'm still not sure.  But your reaction fascinates me.  So it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I may be misunderstanding it, but my sense of what he's trying to do is I can't.  Well, you know what?  Let's wait till Ben Thompson weighs in with Stritecary.  But I think he'll agree with me that this is a smart move.  Yeah, you got shareholders.  What are we, chopped liver?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, apparently.  We're not Stritecary.  No, no, no, but I'm more positive than you guys.  That's over.  Stacey does not.  Forget it.  Stacey does not.  Well, it does kind of bypass that whole, are you helping publishers or not thing.  That's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but here's the thing.  If you look at Brazil and India and say that WhatsApp has been an incredibly important  vehicle for news, true and false, the news organizations need to figure out how to  propagate news on messaging.  They haven't done crap all about that on the whole.  There've been a few small experiments, but they're going to complain miserably.  But they're old.  This kills for once and for all the old drawn audience to your destination model.  Mass media is dead people.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What about something like what LinkedIn does?  The articles on LinkedIn.  And I say that because I actually do way better posting something on LinkedIn to my very  targeted number.  I mean, I do have quote unquote followers there, but I'm also hashtagging things.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's also your topicality is appropriate for LinkedIn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's to me.  This is the most important thing.  And it's what we learned here in the podcast space is when it is an affinity group, when  you're talking to an affinity group, people who opt into the conversation with you, those  conversations are not only better, they're more valuable.  And I think that's exactly what he's saying is no, I think the whole idea of casting the  wide net and the newsfeed, that's all gone.  This is going to be a conversation network.  And you know, we've been saying this for a while.  This is what we need.  Always should have done.  Always should have been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think this is a function also not just of the regulatory thing, but it's also  a function of maturity.  When you're in college, the idea of having all of your conversations on a public square  is way more exciting than when you're 40 and you realize you have all kinds of different  layers and the person you were in college is not the person you are now and all this  other stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He will soon realize that reminding everybody of birthdays is cruel.  He's getting there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love when people remember my birthday and I still will when I'm 80.  Oh, I hate it.  Oh, Jeff.  No, you won't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I won't be here to collect on that bet, but you won't.  I do.  Even you, Miss Sunshine, will not.  I do think this is also very brave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead.  I should be freaked out.  No.  Why?  About my birthday, but I'm not because I'm a woman.  I'm less valuable as I age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good for you.  You think we're more valuable now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Well, no, you've passed the point of value.  Oh, good.  I peeped him.  We're on our downhill.  Thanks a lot.  We're on the downhill, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, we are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now you're just a former TV critic and a former radio host.  I didn't put the thing up on your lower third.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm a former small time host of a little watched cable channel.  If I ever get on MSNBC again, which I won't, I want that for my lower third.  Former virtual reality barista.  All right.  What else is there to talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me tell you for just a second where I was last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And where you are today.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm in Boston, but that's another matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, tell us why you're in Boston, too.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I can't.  Last week, I was...  Something's going on.  Something's happened, but I can't.  But last week, I was in Ditchley, which is an old estate in the UK near Oxford, Oxfordshire.  And there was a transatlantic working group on content moderation and freedom of expression  that I've joined, organized by former FCC Commissioner Susan Ness.  And she brought in an amazing crew of people there to talk about regulation.  So I thought I'm going to be the only person in the room who's going to be defending the internet.  It was a fascinating discussion.  But all I want...  And I don't want to go into detail.  I better write up some ideas for this shortly.  But you see all the more why Zuckerberg's move is so needed, because the regulation on Facebook,  especially, is coming from every possible quarter.  And last week before I went, I wrote a post about 11 and 13, and then a journalistic report.  And then most of all, there's the Commons Committee that Zuckerberg wouldn't testify before  released its report.  And it is, to my mind, frightening.  And just to give you one...  Two little episodes from it.  One is that they want to go after not just the technology company,  but also the technologists in the company with heavy fines  if they don't do what they want them to do.  So this is a shot across the bow of a programmer inside Facebook.  The second thing that they say is that they want to incorporate, increase PII,  personal information, not just to what GDPR declares,  which is a whole bunch of ridiculous things like your IP address.  They also want it to be inferred data, which to me is a death blow.  No, it's a death blow against machine learning and against knowledge.  No, no, no.  This is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's debate this, because I've been calling for a redefinition of PII  to include more things, including what can be inferred from your metadata  as essential for privacy.  It kills machine learning.  As we connect more devices.  No, it doesn't.  It does not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can't predict the inference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  You cannot include that with other like PII is a bundle of information.  It's not one piece of information.  So if you pull in one piece of information that's relevant from a bunch of people,  so it changes the way you have to assemble your data,  but you can still do machine learning.  Trust me.  Keep going.  Sorry, there were more things, but I got very excited.  I love you anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So anyway, so I just wanted to, I'll write more about all this stuff in the future,  but it was interesting that in a truly multi-stakeholder meeting,  convened under Chatham House, which is why I'm not saying who was there  and not quoting things directly.  It gave me, so I'm going to write about regulatory regimes that I can get behind  that do make sense to me.  And that's a big move for me, just because everything I've seen thus far has been stupid.  But if I can start to get a conversation going about what would be smart,  I'm eager to have that conversation.  So more to come later, but the atmospheric remains rabidly anti-Facebook.  And so the timing of this is fascinating to me.  That was all I wanted to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I just, I'm excited by that, but I am really excited about this PII thing.  So Jeff, send me your post when you're ready.  I want to talk all about it.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The post about the Commons report is up on Medium Now, the one I did before going.  Europe against the net.  And so my summary of the Damien Collins report is the last third of that.  The first third is 11 and 13, which I all the more hate more than ever.  It's terrible.  The middle is very wonky journalistic stuff about a report in the UK,  but the bottom is about the Commons report.  You'll see my bullet points down there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. Yes. I skip over all of your, all of the-  Skip the journal wonky stuff, you won't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the bottom stuff is about the Collins report.  No, yeah, you do, but most people don't, because it should be important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was like, I am a journalist.  That's what my business card even says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm talking about the audience.  The people are formerly known as the audiences, my friend Jeros and so on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, I think this is one of the things that Mark is looking down the road at and just  says, I'm getting, I'm pivoting. I'm getting out of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't blame him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The torpedo came to the U-boat and he just managed to move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So there are a couple of questions, of course,  whether the torpedo is going to keep on coming anyway, because  I mean, these things don't go away because you said I'm pivoting.  So he may still have some explaining to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's going to be n degree harder for him to do this given the lack of trust and given the history,  because everybody's going to do what Stacey did and say, well, I don't trust them.  I don't know. Are they doing this right?  So they've got to, they've got to change the culture too.  So markedly, which Alex makes reference to there, to prove through transparency and through  collaboration with experts outside the company, what they're doing. If they don't do that,  they'll blow it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, you asked about Facebook's stock price. It basically closed up today,  although it's essentially level in the post-bell trading.  This came out after stock closed, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this came after market closed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ah, okay. Well, the after market, after hours trading is pretty flat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because I think the market doesn't know what the F is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's the, they're waiting to see what Jeff Jarvis says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. No, Leo Laporte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  Neither of us, unfortunately.  Stacey Higginbottom.  Yeah. I wonder what they're waiting for. I think ultimately if I were an investor,  I'd say this is good news, but it's going to be a bumpy transition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I find an investor, I'd again wonder about the monetization strategy.  Because I mean, as an investor in Wall Street, you're not usually long-term,  you're shorter term, right? That's the biggest criticism.  Yeah. This is going to be a long-term.  It's like a relaunch though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like a brand new Facebook. The next question is, will Twitter stock go up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's actually what I wondered. I was like, oh, this leaves a lot more,  because Twitter then becomes the way to talk to the mass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The public place. Yeah. No mass. There is no mass, Stacey.  Oh, it is good for Twitter.  Okay, sorry, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you're right. It is good for Twitter. You're right.  It just makes Twitter more of a dumpster fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It would be good for Instagram if it weren't on for a number of months.  Snap? Could this be the last nail in the coffin of Snap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's been on life support for some time, huh?  Do you want to talk about, we talked about it on Twitter, but I thought it might be something  you'd like to talk about. Google refuses to remove an application, a Saudi Arabian application.  But the story is more complicated than you might realize.  After I read more...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Please explain how it is, because this really gave me agita.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so I'll give you the story, which is, Google has been asked to remove  a Saudi app called Absher, which lets men direct where women can travel  and offers them alerts when they're women. And in Saudi Arabia, men are guardians of women,  including their wives, when they use a passport to leave Saudi Arabia.  Members of Congress, including Jackie Speier, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib,  and 11 others, demanded that Apple and Google kill the app.  Both promised to investigate. Apple hasn't said anything yet. Google says,  no, it doesn't violate any rules. We're going to keep it.  If you just say that, that sounds pretty bad. But I'm very glad that I read Hacker News,  because there was a much more nuanced conversation. And it convinced me that Google did the right thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow, you are just Mr. Open-minded today. Grumpy, but open-minded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what was the nuance on Hacker News?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, read the read the comment thread. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  no, you're going to do it for us. I will do it for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The app provides various governmental services, among them a digitized version. And this is  important, a digitized version of the yellow sheet. That yellow sheet exists and has existed  for years in Saudi Arabia. A legal guardian has to fill it out for a woman to be able to leave the  country. But getting rid of the app doesn't get rid of the yellow sheet.  The process, that's a governmental process that is going to continue. And in fact, some activists  in Saudi Arabia say the app actually makes it easier for women to move. A, because part of the  yellow sheet process, the guardian has to go to the government office. You can't just sign it.  You can't write a note and say it's okay for the leave of the country. You have to go in.  And that is a burden. And this app eliminates that. You don't have to get a signature on paper. You  don't have to make a personal appearance. It's very straightforward. So some activists in Saudi  Arabia see value in that kind of app because it makes it easier to get out of the country without  supervision. And getting rid of the app wouldn't in any way change the system.  Now there were people on Hacker News who say, but this doesn't matter. It's an immoral action.  And so Google shouldn't be making an app that allows this.  And I understand that point of view, but I think in balance,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's fascinating. So you come down to balance thinking that they improved it by a skunch.  Yeah. And I read a number of tweets from women in Saudi Arabia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who said, of course it's bad that it exists or need to exist as a bad thing, but this is Saudi law.  And to many of women in Saudi Arabia, scrapping the app would hurt their agency, not help it.  They need male approval to travel either way. And by making it easier to get the app in practice,  in practice gives women more agency by lowering the bureaucratic barriers to travel.  It's like taking down massage parlor things off the ground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like taking down massage parlor things off various online sites, sent sex workers back to the  arms of the pimps who abused them and took away their agency.  Here's the thing. We've got a messed up world and we've got to go back to the core problems we have.  And it's not the technological angle to the story. Saudi's got real problems here that need to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  fixed. And really it's a mistake, I think, to blame Google or to focus on the app when what you  should be doing is talking to the Saudi government. The bigger question is how our government

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  buddies up to a regime that does that. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Well, and I mean, in some ways you attack Google because you can't. Like right now I could  change the world by tweeting. But it feels like you're so I can see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, so I think this is interesting. And, you know, honestly, nuance is a bad thing to introduce  into a show of any kind because really hot takes and anger are much more effective. But no, this is  good. We're trying to keep Jeff from shouting. Anyway, I don't know. I'll let you think about it  if you decide to come back later with a thought. It's more complicated than one might think.  Meanwhile, Google does apparently, at least according to the Intercept,  continue to work on Dragonfly. It's Chinese search engine. But Google then responded.  What I didn't. Oh, here it is. Google responded.  The speculation is inaccurate. So the Intercept, which I think sometimes does get things wrong  in on this stuff. What's your buddy Sam Biddle?  Oh, forget it. I'm sorry, even bright enough. Google says this speculation is inadequate,  inaccurate rather. We have we said for many months we have no plans to watch  search in China. There's no work being undertaken on such a product project.  Team members have moved to new projects. Biddle based it on commits to GitHub in the recent months  what Google said is we're going to let these people finish the thing they were working on  and then move them on. But you know that so that's probably why they were continuing to be commits.  I'm going to give Google a pass. Oh, there we go.  This is once again, the Give Google a Pass show. You know what?  This is another reason why it's great that Mark did what he did. And I hope he continues to pursue  this because it puts the screws to companies like Google. If Facebook says, okay,  we're not going to be in China because we can't encrypt and we're not going to store data there.  It makes it a lot harder for Google to say, well, we want to be in China.  It makes it a lot harder for Apple to do it. Apple's doing it.  Australia is small, so who cares?  Well, I think if one of these big fangs or as I love Amy Webb's term for them, the G-Mafia,  which is Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, IBM, Facebook, and Apple, the G-Mafia, if one of them  says, you know what, we're going to take a principled stand. We're not going to do it.  It really makes it harder for the others to not to do it.  I think. Do you want a Volvo Polestar 2? Sure you do.  Yeah.  It's not, it's got Google, it's got Android in it. It's a Google powered all electric.  It's the first one built in core, native.  Yeah, native. And we're not talking Android auto. I don't think we're talking like  Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Android Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Android, native Android for the car. It's also going to be 45 grand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  40,000 more than the, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's, it's electric. It looks pretty nice, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, wait. This says it's native Android auto. The verge is saying Polestar 2 is doing  hold up native Android auto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. Well.  Yeah. Yeah. That's what they're saying.  Native Android. No, I don't think it's Android auto, a native Android infotainment system.  So understand that Android auto requires a phone with Android on it.  This sounds like it's Android in the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is what they've been trying to sell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Oh yeah. Okay.  Right. It's still, yes, but it's still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's for cars. It's not the same Android I got done on my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry. I was like, that's what, that's the deceit, but I gotcha. I got what you're saying and I got  what I'm saying. I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, and so Waymo just announced today that they're going to be selling their sensors to other car  makers. Interesting that Google becomes a B2B supplier to auto manufacturers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was speculation that that was what Apple was intending, that Apple decided,  we're not going to make cars, but we'll make stuff the car makers need.  But Elon has always said, and I think Tesla has somewhat proven that to make it really work,  you need the data. You need to do it all. You can't buy pieces from vendors. You have to make the  whole thing because the data is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What you're doing is, is as a service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I could see you buying the LIDAR. Yeah. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you could also do self-driving as a service.  Right. Yeah. Okay.  You can access to our data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You still have all the data. Right. The car would just not be a, you know, GM would make a car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It will cause crashes, but we won't go there today because I don't want to yell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it, is that what is going to happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So Jeff, I have to, I have to take us back. Can I take a slightly back?  Take us back.  Oh, no.  Step back.  Are we, are we done?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where are you? Where are you clicking your ruby slippers to go to?  There's no place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I am going to, there's a story.  Actually, I didn't see it on the rundown and I'm sad.  Google is making it easier for AI developers to keep users data private.  And it's actually talking about using differential privacy for machine learning on TensorFlow.  So that's really, that's exactly what we were just talking about.  Jeff, that allows us to pull data in for machine learning without making it.  So even things like PII, without making it a problem in identifying people.  So I just thought that was like really worth bringing up.  And I have many questions that are not answered in the story, but I kind of really,  yes. And differential privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I trust Google to define that. Sorry. I'm getting the.  No differential privacy is what Apple's using.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  No, I think.  The idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. I think it's right. Yes. Yes.  All I'm saying, Stacey, is that I don't trust the government to define that  because they do stupid things like saying every inference is now your property.  That's dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Stacey, what is differential privacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's basically where they take your data and they insert random noise into.  This is me making little sad things.  Insert random noise and data into it.  So it can't be, it's not encrypted.  So it's not saying it's decrypted is the wrong way to think about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The issue with data, of course, is that it's not hard at all to use the data to de-anonymize it,  even if you've so-called anonymized it.  So this is a way of anonymizing data that can't be, or theoretically can't be reversed.  So it can't be traced back to the creator of the data.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Yes. It can't be traced back to the person who's created it.  And in the way they do it is by adding random noise to the user's patterns.  And so when people, and so then they can, that noise becomes filtered out,  though, as they gather more and more data from a wide variety of people.  So basically it's like those mosaics. Think about it like that Bob Marley poster  in your college dorm room that was made of other pictures of Bob Marley.  If all of those are slightly blurred, you can't see that it's Bob Marley in the individual pictures,  but altogether you're like, oh, is that a Rasta Reggae singer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I gotta ask, did you have that poster?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, I did not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that, I would have to rethink my-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had a Monet, I had a Monet Waterlow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's what I thought, yeah, yeah.  I did not have the Klimt, though. I just don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you don't have the Klimt? Oh, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I didn't have that, but I did have, I didn't have the Kiss, but I did have-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have a tapestry version of the Kiss hanging in our entryway. How about that?  There you go.  And next I'm going to get a Bob Marley poster.  There you go.  I have the water lilies in my office though.  So Ulfar Erlingsen, who is a scientist at Google, research scientist, says,  differential privacy with mathematical certainty makes it impossible to trace the data back to  its origin. You have an outcome that is in mathematical certainty. It's proven to work.  You have an outcome that's independent of any one person's data, but it's still a good outcome.  However, by masking outliers, it can sometimes remove relevant or interesting data,  especially in varied data sets.  Bingo.  So there's the problem. Homogenize the data somewhat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So David Weinberger, you know David Weinberger, co-author of The Clutre Manifesto.  He has a new book coming out and I got the galleys coming out in May, but I'll talk about more when  it comes out, but it's brilliant. And as is David always, and it's called Everyday Chaos, pre-order  it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We will, and we'll have them on. Carson, make a note, because I'd love to get them on triangulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But he talks about how what's really happening here is that in a world of machine learning and  A-B testing stuff, the correlations that come along have no explanation. Fit no law, make no  sense. The data just tells you this is how this disorganized crazy world of ours operates in a  way we didn't know before. And that frustrates the hell out of us human beings because we thought  that we could reduce things to laws, laws of nature kind of laws.  Well, it also makes sense if we want a narrative.  Right.  Yeah.  Exactly. I'm reading another book. Oh, this is really interesting.  I see I just happened to have it called, I can't remember what it's called. I can't read.  How History Gets Things Wrong, the Neuroscience of Our Addiction to Stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I saw that book. Yes.  I'll talk about that another day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love that idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is because it says that we have a theory of mind because we want to figure out when the other  person on the savanna is going to get that half an antelope that was eaten by the lion  before the lion gets back. We're figuring out what other people are going to do in this empathetic  way. And that is hardwired into us in ways that he argues as a philosopher of science. The author  is one Alex Rosenberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You mean George Washington didn't chop down the cherry tree?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The problem is we so want narrative. We so want stories. We so want to understand the motives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He says narrative history is always, always wrong. It's not just incomplete or inaccurate,  but deeply wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's fascinating. I'm halfway through so I can't legitimately summarize it yet,  but it's absolutely fascinating. So yes, Stacy, narrative is the root. Storytelling is the root  of our problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, that doesn't go over very well in journals.  It's the root of our disconnect with machine learning or, quote, data-driven everything.  I think we're just telling ourselves a big lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's hard for us to admit this though, because what is our job, Stacy, Jeff, Leo?  To explain everything.  Storytelling. We reduce all of the complexity surrounding us into understandable,  intelligible stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is not a popular stance of mine in a journalism school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is why I don't say I'm a writer, because I think my job is to explain the way things work.  And a lot of times I have a really hard time finding the compelling story. I call it the  dead baby. The dead baby leads and gets the story-wide adoption in the audience.  It makes me sad. So I totally believe this.  Yeah, but wait a minute though. I don't think you're addressing the fundamental issue, which is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  inevitably the story misrepresents the facts because they can't be reduced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I write about. I write about engineering and tech, and I always talk to people,  and I'm explaining the trade-off between this and that. Those are things people don't want to read.  Basically, this is why nobody reads my stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You need to make your stories more compelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do.  I'm wonky. I also got a new history of stereotyping and lithography today at the used bookstore here  in Boston. And what fascinates me about it is you get into a narrative. Oh, that's how it was  invented. It could have been this, then it was that, and this is how it happened. Ooh, that's what we

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  do. Remember that wonderful TV show, Connections? Yes.  Who was the guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is lithography when it's not in semiconductor manufacturing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it was painting on rocks and then pressing the rock on paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, okay. It is what it is in semiconductor manufacturing.  Yeah, it's exactly the same.  I was legitimately...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's silk screening.  It's etching.  It's etching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's etching, yeah. Okay.  It's exactly the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel the need for a commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, good. I actually have the need to do a commercial. But that was the thing. I loved  James Burke and I loved Connections, but it was the thing that kind of always bothered me, which  everything was so pat. It all fit together and oh, wow, and you get this great endorphin rush  because it all makes sense. I think absolutely that's a sign that this story is wrong because  it doesn't all make sense. It's a freaking nightmare. A mishmash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In the world. Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry. If you go to my Medium feed, I don't want you to read the  post, but I wrote a post about media education. There's a block quote in there from David Weinberger.  Be a favor and just go to that block quote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. Can I do it after the ad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then we'll pick up the...  Because the T has a really boring T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stay tuned for our block quote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stay tuned for a block quote. At least it's not Casper Weinberger. At least it's David.  Our show today brought to you by  Cashfly. Give your users the seamless online experience you get.  The other day I was doing a Cashfly ad and somebody said, yeah, it's true. Whenever I want  a podcast, I want a podcast, I'm going to get in the car, I'm going to leave and only have a few  minutes. I always get a twit podcast because it always seems to download like that. Other podcasts,  sometimes I'll be waiting minutes or longer to get it. That's Cashfly. It has nothing to do with us.  We use Cashfly's CDN, Content Delivery Network, to speed content to you. It is the fastest,  up to 10 times faster than just having it on a server. Up to 30% faster than other big name CDNs.  It's our secret weapon, Cashfly. We've been on Cashfly for more than a decade. Every month,  our listeners and viewers download petabytes of data from Cashfly with never a problem.  Because the Cashfly servers are near you, there are many of them. By the way, because there are  many of them, it's got a 100% SLA. Not five nines, not six nines, 100%. They guarantee the best user  experience for all your customers no matter where they are, no matter what device they're on.  You can say a lot of things, but I honestly think one of the keys to success for us has been to make  it easy and fast for you to get the shows. I don't want anything to get in the way.  Cashfly is our secret weapon. Cashfly CDN delivers rich media content, applications, podcasts,  whatever it is. You get the benefit because not only is it faster, you pay less.  Cashfly works with you to get your bill based on yearly usage trends. Spikes don't bother you.  A lot of times people are always logging in their CDN to make sure that they don't exceed the cap  for the month of the week. You don't have to worry about that. No billing spikes. They'll tailor a  plan to your needs based on yearly trends. That's why on average customers who switch to Cashfly  save more than 20%. Faster, less expensive. Right now you can find out exactly how much faster and  how much less expensive would be just for your particular application by going to  www.twit.cashfly.com. They'll give you a detailed analysis of your current bill,  your usage trends, and they'll say exactly how much you could save. No pressure, just great  information. www.twit.cashfly.com. You don't want to get calls at three in the morning,  the servers are down, and you want your customers to say what our customer said in the chat room,  which was great. Yeah, I always download Twitter first because I know it's going to come in plenty  of time for me to go to work. www.twit.cashfly.com. Thank you, Cashfly.  All right. Did you find the Medium post? I can look for it if you didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I found the Medium post. I've got it. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no. I'm asking Carson because I want to show it. I want to show it. I'll go to it here.  You're a better reader than I am. What's the name of the post?  Media Education and Change. I see it right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can't wait to dig into that one, can you? Yeah. So listen first, champion diversity,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  death to the mass. This is really you, Jeff. This is you in a nutshell. Service over product,  service as our ethic, be responsible stewards. That's why I'm in Boston right now.  Reach across disciplines. This is all good. Here's the poll quote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  From David Weinberger. Deep learnings algorithms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I read it in a voice like that? Deep learnings algorithms work because they capture,  better than any human can, the complexity, fluidity, and even beauty of a universe  in which everything affects everything else all at once. As we will see, machine learning is just  one of many tools and strategies that have been increasingly bringing us face to face  with the incomprehensible intricacy. I was doing so good. With the incomprehensible  intricacy of our everyday world. But this benefit comes at a price. We need to give up our insistence  on always understanding our world and how things happen in it. That's scary because that means the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  AI is going to know more than we do. It does. Yes. And it's always been the case. We fooled  ourselves all these years thinking we could tell the story of the universe and we couldn't. We were  wrong. And now the AI is going to prove how we're wrong and we're going to hate it. And moral panic  will ensue. Well, that was a conversation stopper. I'm just going to give up then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what is our role in all this? We're just the dumb humans. No, our role is to look at outcomes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Our role is to say not why, but what is happening. And then when you see outcomes that don't make sense  or are not optimal, recognize that those are coming from a place of either a lack of certain  kinds of data or because your society is fundamentally structured that way. And if you want to change it  and not automate that into the data, you're going to have to go back and address those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll give you an example because there is an actual real world example. There aren't a lot of them yet.  A lot of what's called AI is just a nice program. But AlphaZero is a good example. This is the  final generation of computers designed to play Go. AlphaZero taught itself, by the way, it was  given the rules of the game, but no positions, no instructions, no evaluations. They just said,  here's the rule of Go, Shogi, and chess. Go learn how to play well. In four hours, AlphaZero,  not with any of the rules or stories the humans gave it, see that's the problem. Humans didn't  give it any stories. It made up its own story. It got better than anybody else at these games.  In fact, it beat AlphaGo, the previous world champion of Go that beat Least at all, 128 games  to nothing. But here's the point. Humans look at what AlphaZero does on Go and they're stunned.  They're stunned. This is looking at the outcome, Stacey. They go, that is... Because if you looked  at the outcome of Deep Blue, the chess machine that beat Kasparov, it was very mechanical.  You say, that's ugly. That's an ugly move. But not AlphaZero. You look at that and I don't know Go  well enough to know, but Go Masters, great Go players will look at it and say, that is incredibly  creative. That is a genius move. That is not ugly. That is beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's like... Go ahead, let Stacey go and then you go.  In Ender's game, when Ender realized you could... When fighting in space...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No spoilers. Oh, okay. Yes. Up is down, left is right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. So we have told ourselves a story about moving through the world and he just upended that.  That's kind of the shift that's going to happen as we adapt to having machines...  Won't we just turn it into a different story? Yeah. Well, that's how we perceive the world.  In other words, misunderstand it. That's wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we're wrong. We're like... We're like children who have said, well, because my  mommy disappeared behind her hands, she doesn't exist. Oh, she does. Oh, she doesn't. Oh, she does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're as children. Well, wait, you want to get crazy metaphysical?  Yeah, man. We only understand... Let me get my Marley poster. Go ahead.  I'm just saying, right now, even with AI, what we understand is what's physically happening and  what's visible to us. Those are the problems we're giving it now. But eventually, with better compute  power, with a better understanding of the, let's say, quantum level of the way the world works,  we're going to actually be able to see more. So in a way, we are like kids because we don't have  the tools today to actually look behind us. But, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. And our story is really that. In an ideal world, I agree with...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, I would love to agree with all of that. And I think that you live in a slightly different world  because you don't explain human behavior, you explain machines and how they operate,  which does get you closer to that. But we still live in a world of moral panic. So we have the  Momo story and people will believe it immediately because they have a belief system and they think  it's based on fact and it's not. And the kids aren't having Skittles parties. But there's  this... Kelly Anne Conway was right. There are alternative facts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a picture of Momo. I just...  Momo. I just trigger warning, there's a picture of Momo. Okay, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I'm just saying, so yes, but we'll still misinterpret that. We may have facts. And what  Weimer is saying is we'll be looking for some explanation of the law and it's not there to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  found. People will find what's really happening. There are scientists, there are people who are  engineers. I mean, yes, there are great swathes of the population who do not view the world that  way and do make narratives. But there are people who actually want to understand what's happening.  Great. So only the smart people will be around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, everybody, I mean... And they're going to take advantage of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dumb people. This smacks of elitism is what like this anti elitism or whatever it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is anti elitism. I don't want the machines to become smart and then only a few people on it,  like string theory. Okay, I grant you string theory is not a good story because no one can tell it.  And apparently the five people who understand it make sense to them. But they have, but they,  I've talked to many of them like Michio Kaku, they cannot explain it to a normal human. There's just  no way you get some math. You got to look at the math. Don't understand the math. Well,  sorry for you. Too bad for you. You're out. You're out. Only five of us can. Isn't that nice? So is  that what the world's going to be? Is that there going to be a five people and then artificial  intelligence and the rest of us are just kind of... You're presuming that there'll be five people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Part of what David's kind of saying is that for certain things that are happening, the data will  tell you this is what happens and there is no explanation. And you're going to drive yourself

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  nuts. What is the human role then? What is the human role in that? To make case. That's a good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  question. To make case. I mean, that's a no, no. The human role is to interpret and stand in between  the AI driven outcomes and what we as people decide we want to have happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I've said, which is that our job is to make the rules. Yeah. It's to make the rules.  It's not just to make the rules. But I'm watching that happen and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Europeans are making really bad rules right now and the Americans will next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not loss. Not loss. This is about if you automate something... We have to say what the outcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have to say what outcome we want, right? We say... And we have to tell it to the machine

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in the way that the machine can understand. So just like when you're teaching AlphaZero to play Go,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  all you're saying is these are the rules. This is what winning looks like. Figure it out. Same  thing. We want to cure cancer. Okay. So this is the data we know. This is the goal we want.  We can't figure it out. Can you? And the machine says, yeah. But you have to be really careful

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because right now you could say eliminate cancer cells and the machine may be like,  oh, I could totally do that if I kill a person. That's not... We find it funny,  but it's not in a logical step. No, but we would obviously write a better rule than that.  Well, there's countless examples of people telling computers to do something they think they want.  No, there's actually a Tumblr or a blog that grabs these. There's actually a Google spreadsheet  that has... Oh, that's funny. Have you not seen that spreadsheet? No, what is it? Bad?  It's a spreadsheet of... Add logic? Yeah. It's like when you ask data, you ask an AI to do  something, but you just weren't really clear on what you wanted. And it's quite hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is actually an interesting question because this actually... Harari talks about this in 21  Lessons for the 21st Century. And one of the things he says is this is actually a great  symbiosis. Because we can't understand the massive complexity of the world, but AI perhaps can,  our job will be to set the goals, set the agenda, say this is where we want to go.  And we can argue that. That's politics. That's where you say, no, I want to have clean air,  but I... No, but we should have growth. Whatever. You argue that. Once as a polity, you decide,  okay, these are our rules. Then you give it to the AI. You let the AI do it. But then the question  becomes... And the challenge, the scary part of this is what if AI develops mind? What if AI develops  will? And this is the science fiction thing. And then says, okay, that was a nice idea, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I want to do this instead. It falls apart before that, Leo, when AI tells you to close all  the coal plants and the coal voters get moved up by politicians. Absolutely. And as soon as human

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  beings enter, it's messed up. Absolutely. But the AI can come up with the right answer. And Harari  says, you know, what's interesting is there is no evidence that AI leads to consciousness or mind  or will. We don't even know what causes will or mind. We don't know what love looks like. There's  no functional MRI for love. So you don't... This is kind of a moot question. There's no evidence  that just you're going to make an AI that's smarter and smarter and smarter, and suddenly it's going

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to gain will. No, and AI also can't solve. It can predict. It can find patterns and predict. It  can't solve. I disagree. It can propose things. No, it solves. No, reinforcement learning teaches

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a computer how to solve problems. When you win a go game, you solve the game. Yeah. It is solving

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  problems. The way it does it is... It's complex to us, maybe not to the AI. So weather prediction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's talk about weather. It also depends on the data we've given it. Yeah. But let's talk about

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  weather. Let's talk about weather. It's completely theoretically feasible. Weather is a chaotic system  Yes. So it's hard to understand, and it may not be predictable, but to the degree that it is  predictable, I think maybe chaotic merely means... Well, that's what I just said. It can predict  eventually. So there are chaotic systems. If there are chaotic systems, and I guess there are,  you'll never solve those. But there are plenty of non-chaotic systems, and maybe it turns out  weather is deterministic. It's just we can't get all the data points, and so we don't know.  Humans are always chaotic, thus Weinberger's title. Humans are a problem. Everyday chaos.  Humans are the problem. Yes. I'll grant you that. But here's the good news. The AI is never going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  figure that out. Well, I don't know. Elon's might. Hey, what about the changelog? It's time for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Google changelog.  Bum bum bum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Podcasters, rejoice. The Google Podcast app is getting better. It's maturing into a viable  option for avid listeners, says John Fingus and Engadget. It really has always been pretty  rudimentary. In fact, I didn't realize, but you didn't used to be able to search for individual  episodes. Now you can. So it used to be you could only search for this week in Google.  You couldn't search for Leizungsistreckt episode of Google. Now you can.  So Google will even correct your spelling. I hope so. Yes. Thank goodness. And pronunciation.  Not fully rolled out, but rolling out. So look for a new version on Android of the Google Podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The other thing, if I may throw in on that, Leo, just related, which is relevant to you,  is that Google is also going to start including sound in search results. Yay. No. Yay. Yay. No?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're not auto playing sound? Oh, please. No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. Here's what I want. I want the part of this week in Google where Stacey Higginbotham  said her queso recipe and it searches and it finds it and then it has a little play button  and instead of just a link to it, you can play it. Then you're disaggregated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody listens to the whole show. Wack of Valdita. Can of Rotel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there you go. You might find multiple results.  Yes. And one hopes, and apparently this is planned, podcasts in general search results  because they're not right now. Yes. That would be really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they're not. And that drives me nuts because it means I have to write a whole  story if I want my stuff to be. Yeah, that's right. You need to text adjunct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we never got around to doing that. Google, this is a Stacey. Google Assistant has added  support for smart heaters, air fresheners, and fireplaces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it'll be warm and not Malorious. Oh, good. Oh, that is good. Yes. Air

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  fresheners can be turned on and off. Modes can be adjusted. Fireplaces can be turned on and off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As it starts splitting, it'll spray you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So you're going to start seeing heaters that say they support Google Home. The iFlame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be the home kit version of that. The great house that burns down is going to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  trouble. Yeah. There's a smart air freshener that works with a lot of people. Soon it will work with

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google too. No, I stink. That's exactly. I can fix that. I'm very smart. I can fix anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Huge improvement. One of the first connected air fresheners was actually linked in part of the  Works with Nest program. Procter and Gamble did a Febreeze air freshener device. And it was  tied into Nest. What was it called? Capitalist Conspiracy? To make you go through the product  you don't even need. This was before Madame A had a smart home capability. So this was 2014,  2015. And what it did is actually it was 2015 CES timeframe. And when your air freshener went  and it spit out some air freshener, your Nest could turn on so it would blow it around the house.  I'm not kidding. That is fascinating. And disturbing. But I don't believe in those.  So you have fresh roti for breakfast. So I will tell you, I use the, I tell Madame A to turn on

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  or to preheat my June all the time. Do you? It's wonderful. Yeah. It smells like a big wet dog in  here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Android can now wake you up with YouTube music or Pandora. Spotify was added last year now.  Pandora. And by the way, I want to say peripherally Pandora now has Twitch. So you can in fact wake up  to this week in Google if you wish. You can have Jeff yelling, techno panic. Wake up. Techno panic.  Techno panic. Google Maps has added the blight of a nation, lime scooters to its maps.  Now in 80 cities. Did you read the article? A fascinating article that analyzed how long  these publicly rentable scooters last? And how uneconomical this whole thing is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Guy asked me. Oh, I read something like that. Yeah. I don't know if it was,  and how often they get thrown into lakes. Well, that's another problem. In the lakes. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's a real problem because it pollutes the lake. This is from Quartz. How do you like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Quartz app, by the way? You like that app? I can't figure out if I like it or not. It's going to be  like a social network a little bit. They have been advertising. I use the web for content.  Shared scooters don't last long. Allison Griswold did a data analysis in Louisville. Yeah. Yeah.  So basically she found out the average lifespan of a scooter is 28.8 days.  It costs them $551 to buy the scooter. They also have to spend a significant amount of money  with the city to license the scooter. In fact, there are like $2,000 for probationary license,  additional $1,000 to receive a full license, $50 fee per allotted dockless vehicle, daily $1 fee,  and $100 per designated parking area. So basically here it is. Louisville Scooternomics,  everybody. You've been waiting for this. A scooter generates $3.77 per ride,  deducting per ride costs, charging repairs, credit card fees, customer support insurance. That's  $0.95. So a scooter makes about $3.32 in net revenue a day minus the city's $1 fee. Lime is  making two bucks a day. Unfortunately, the scooter only lasts 28 days. So it generates about $67,  but they're paying $360 for it. So they're losing $293 a scooter.  Math is hard. This does not surprise me at all. No. I mean, we know Uber has lost money for years,  right? Anyway, so I don't know how I got to that from Pandora, but we did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was like, I'm waiting for the story that says how unhealthy people are using scooters rather

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  than just walking. Actually, the big problem with scooters is helmets. And there are quite a few

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  injuries. And that's going to be Austin, all the drunk people run around on their scooters and  holy cow, it is a, it is not good. I almost got hit by them in San Jose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what I do like though, when we were in Santa Monica, we used Uber has bicycles,  electric bicycles. And so it's like city bike, but they're electrified. And that was really cool.  And a little, I feel a little safer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google, are they electric aided or, or they're electric aided. They're electric aided.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't see you imagine you're exercising. Yeah, you get a little exercise.  I love my legs are peddling a little electric bikes. They're the best thing ever.  Google's new Chromebook app hub showcases the best classroom applications and ideas.  They announced it at a South by South by edu, which is going on today. Actually,  Levar Burton was talking a few hours ago. And are you going to South by later?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am good. So that should be my thing is to do my talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you're doing, oh yes. Save it. And that's the Google changelog.  We good news. The save the internet act has been introduced in Congress.  It doesn't have a chance in hell, but at least it kicked past the house of representatives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This legislation also brings the power of the internet to every corner of the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hallelujah. This of course is in response to the FCC eliminating net neutrality last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does it really have provisions in it for expanding broadband?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's good. Read the, read the, you want me to read it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not going to pass to you. Might as well throw it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, no, then, then I'm not going to, I'm not even, I don't cover that anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Three pages that will restore net neutrality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's put it's only three pages. It doesn't do a whole lot.  I thought it was a real bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just the bill on Capitol Hill.  Oh, did you see this? I love this. I'm going to just run through a couple of things and then  we're going to get to your picks of the week. A really interesting question. The Atlantic raised  this. It turns out we can now analyze DNA from old envelopes. When people lick stamps and lick  envelopes, they in effect seal genetic material in that DNA. My heritage soon is going to be  offering DNA testing on old stamps and envelopes. Not cool.  Okay. That's what I was thinking you might say because grandma can't give permission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. You can't give your consent. So you find, you find a thousand year old man

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  coming out of the ice, the defrosted permafrost. And are you allowed to take his DNA?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so that's, so what's interesting here and worth talking about, no, it's not because I'm  hungry and it's almost time for me to go. But is the idea that when we see these law enforcement  officials, you know, grabbing DNA, they're getting it. They're grabbing the DNA from the suspect,  but they're finding the likely candidate based on DNA from their relatives. So I think there was a  stat that says within the next five to 10 years, 90% of white Europeans in the country will be  identifiable based on their relationships with other people. Basically. Wow. That's interesting.  Yeah. It was a New York Times article. New York Times did a lovely story about this because there  was just another case, you know, and so we do know that legally dead people have no rights.  Legally. Right. But again, this is where Jeff gets upset. This is the inference. This is inference

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  based on this. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. But that's not a machine learning case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Knowledge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And finally, I don't know what the status of articles 11 and 13 are, the EU's new intellectual

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  property. Still rolling ahead looking for a likely passage. There is some good defense,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  though, going on from Germany, which says Article 13 violates GDPR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are you going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do anything to say about that? I don't know. If you live in the EU and you want to keep getting  twit, you might want to write your member of parliament and say, please don't pass this  because we would almost certainly have to turn off twit in the EU. I don't know what else we would do.  I just mean, we'd violate the law, I guess. I don't know. I don't know what we would do.  We'd use Facebook. No more cruises for you.  I know. I make all my money off of Europe.  Hey, I got something you can only get in the US right now. Aftershocks special tech bundle.  I love the Trex. Have you seen these? Actually, anybody who exercises will love these. These are  bone conduction headphones. They're super comfortable. They don't go in your ear. That's  why if you're bicycling or running and you want to make sure you hear traffic when you're driving,  you want to hear emergency vehicles, you could still listen. Nice fidelity. They sound great.  You can listen to music. You can tune in without tuning out. Aftershocks. They use a patented bone  conduction technology. I was skeptical. I thought, oh, come on. But then I wore them and I said, wow.  In fact, now I wear them all the time because you can also use them as a Bluetooth headset.  This is the easiest, most comfortable way for me to take calls. I love it. They rest gently outside  your ear and produce sound by sending mini vibrations through your cheekbones to your inner  ear, bypassing your eardrum. They're really comfortable, really lightweight. The band which  holds them in place is lightweight titanium. It's very flexible. It's durable. It's portable.  The phone calls sound great. The music sounds great. I listen to audiobooks all day.  Premium pitch guarantees a premium audio experience with wide dynamic range and rich bass.  Wireless Bluetooth 4.1 connectivity. Multi-point pairing too, which is really nice.  You can pair it to all your phones. I do that because, in fact, I even use this with my Mac.  I'll be sitting at my Mac and I'll do calls like this. They're unobtrusive. They sound great.  People can hear you clearly. They charge fast, one and a half hours and they give you up to  six hours of continuous music and calls on a single charge, 10-day standby time. I keep my  Aftershocks right there next to the computer or in my backpack because they're great for listening  when I'm out and about. They're safer for driving and any outdoor activities because they allow you  to hear what's going on around you. Like, I don't know, emergency vehicles or that car coming up  behind you. We have a very nice deal, but again, it's US only. It's the Aftershocks Tech Bundle.  You get the Trek's Air, a pop socket for your phone, a large portable storage case, a portable  power bank, and a travel tumbler that is an insulator as well. All of that $50 off if you  use the offer code TWIG at twig.aftershocks.com. Aftershocks is spelled with a Z, A-F-T-E-R-S-H-O-K-Z  or Z.com. twig.aftershocks.com. $50 off the Tech Bundle if you're in the US.  But even if you're not in the US, you're going to love these. They sell them worldwide. These  are fantastic. We love, I love my Aftershocks and I use them all the time. And now because she's  hungry, ladies. You know, I got a question for you first. Real quick question. My father is about as

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  deaf as a doornail now and he gets in trouble in the building he lives in because he turns the  TV up too loud, the bozo upstairs. Anyway, bolt induction, from what I'm looking at you're reading,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  he'd hear better. Yeah, it depends what his deafness comes from. What's a new era?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is a PSAP. What's that stand for? Hold on. I'm going to tell you. It's personal sound

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  amplification product device. Oh, these are the IQ buds. Yeah, I tried these. Yeah, I am not a fan.  Those are pretty good. You're good. No, I wear hearing aids though. Understand. So honestly,  the best thing to do is to get your dad hearing aids. I did that. I got some for him. Oh boy,  he has them. Oh, but he doesn't like them. Does he have modern ones? No, no, no. Yeah, he does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bluetooth would be a mile too far, but they're never quite good enough. It's just, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  just going to correct so much. Yeah, well, that's right. Yeah, maybe tri-bone conductance. The  problem is those are Bluetooth and that means they wouldn't be great for watching TV because of  latency, but it might be adequate for him. The way he watches TV, he wouldn't know this.  He wouldn't care. I use my hearing aids to watch TV, but also to listen to books and so forth.  But the sound is not full fidelity. I use these new resounds, which are better than the  older hearing aids. They're really good. They're also really expensive.  Have you tried the Starkey Livio's hearing aids? Yeah, I've had the Livio's and I have now the  resounds, which compete with the Livio's. Livio's do something extra, which is they can do your  heart rate and stuff like that. I think this is going to be- What about the Eargo's? They just

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  got 52 million in funding this week and they were like the- I don't see what this is, is because

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  next year or the year after, I can't remember, you're going to be able to buy hearing aids over  the counter. So all these companies- 2020. Yeah, 2020. All these companies are jumping into this  market. Basically, these are companies that make headphones or headphone-like devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a story coming out in IEEE on this exact topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These are interesting. I asked my audiologist about them. I haven't actually tried the Eargo's.  I tried the IQ buds. He said the real problem is battery life. They don't- because they're so tiny,  they don't have big batteries and so they don't last all that long. But it might be- it's interesting.  Again, these are about a third the cost of real hearing aids, which are extraordinarily expensive.  These are only $2,000. So this is going to be an exploding category next year.  I think probably buying hearing aids now, if you don't need them terribly, would probably be smart  to wait until next year when you can get them over the counter. There'll be a lot of competition.  Like the Livio, they'll be doing a lot more than just amplifying audio. You know what? I'll see if

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Aftershocks will send you one for your dad. Oh, he won't be able to- I have to be there to make it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  work. You'd like them though. There's that. Yeah. Time for Stacey's pick of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I'm just dropping some- so I added an actual pick for you, but then I was like,  hey guys, it's going to be South By and if any of you are going to be in the area,  I have two things, two places if you want to hang out with Stacey. Leo, are you not coming?  No, we were hoping to, but it fell through. Okay. So you won't see Leo, but I am at a party on,  let's see, there's going to be a link. It is the Smart Home VIP cocktail party where I'm hosting a  panel. It is Friday at 5 p.m. and it is at 720 Brazos. Are your fears of Smart Home Tech warranted?  That is a different one. Then if you have a badge, this is the non-party. This is a talk I'm  interviewing the CEO of August, which was bought by Assa Abloy, and we are going to actually have  some hardcore conversations about data usage, business models, and what we really can expect.  Nice. And that is on, no, Tuesday at 1230.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wish I were going. So that's if you want to see me in person. I would really like to see you in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  person. I wish I were going, but I'm not. Thank you, Stacey. Did you want to mention the other

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  stuff too? You can. Okay. My friend Tim Carmody, who was at Wired and The Verge. Yeah, he's got a  new newsletter out. It's the Amazon Chronicles. And it's really good, you guys. There's a free and  then there's a paid version. And it's Tim is, he understands technology, but he actually understands  how people tell stories about themselves and the things they like. Nice. So he, this is all about  everything Amazon. So I highly, if you're into that, check it out. Even if you're not into that,  you should check it out because Amazon is everywhere in your life. And he talks about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they're going to take over the world. Yes. Silently, quietly behind the scenes,  they're taking over the world. Well, you were all worrying about Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, Facebook's our savior now.  They're coming to, they're coming to rescue us from Bezos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So his head, actually his headline on his, this, this week's post there, this newsletter that just  went out is you would like this, Jeff. Amazon is a marketplace for information or how disinformation

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and double dealing ruin what makes Amazon work. Oh, I like it. And I like it. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're going to like it. What's the URL to find it again? amazonchronicles.substack.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay. Jeff, you got a number for us. Yes, I do. 26 is the number. So I met a really interesting  academic from University of British Columbia named Heidi Dvorak, who has a book coming out  about Germany trying to control media through the first and second world wars.  But so happens an article she wrote was used as a basis of a thread that I thought was wonderful by  Icelandic tweeter, Asta Helgadottir, goes through from 1850 on all the times that mainly German  publishers tried to use copyright to protect news. It's so funny. Year by year. That's perfect.  German press publishers wanted copyrighted news because the newly arrived technology,  the telegrams ruining their business model rejected. 1886, they tried to get in burn,  rejected. In 1908, they tried to limit the possibility of reproduction of news rejected.  1908, what a distinction as a creative production and non-creative information  in news regards to copyright rejected. And on and on and on and on until we get to now,  articles 11 and 13, they just keep trying and trying and trying again to hide behind copyright

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for protectionism for their dying industry. How do you say news theft in German?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or in Icelandic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or in Icelandic. That's great. Good thread. 26 the number because there's 26 tweets from Asta Fish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Helgadottir is a former member of the Icelandic parliament.  I think she's a pirate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to say she's pirate party. A-A-A-S-T-A underscore fish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The thread has been translated into German as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to make the the roadiematic be my pick of the week, but that's out.  Maybe I'll make the S10 and the new Galaxy Buds a pick, except I don't know enough about them yet  to say anything. I've just opened the box, but I will have more information about these  in shows to come. I'm sure get a review on Hot Hands on Tech, our review show.  Thank you so much for being here. Stacey Higginbotham, she does a newsletter  on IOT. The eyes of Texas are upon her. I don't know why that's in your lower third.  What is happening here? Stacey on IOT.com. You can also listen to her fine podcast with  about Chromebooks Kevin Toffle. The IOT podcast is available wherever finer podcasts are aggregated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you, Stacey. Oh, that's you know what? I had some feedback from Kevin.  What did he say? He said we need more Chrome  and Chromebooks on this show. We do. I couldn't agree more. We do. In fact,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm having problems lately with mine. So I need a Gina used to solve Jeff's problems. We need  Kevin to be on the show to solve Jeff's problems. Actually, I'm sure you could ask him to come on

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for a segment. One of the big stories is that Microsoft has given up on Edge is going to start  using Chromium as the engine in its Edge browser. And we've already started to get screenshots of  the development version of it. That's a big story for Chrome. I thought it was there was an

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  active security flaw in the wild and you should update your Chrome right now. Is there? I believe

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so. It was on a rundown too, wasn't it? Was it? Oh, I missed it. Well, there you go. Bottom line,  update your Chrome. Why are you listening to us when you could be updating your Chrome?  Yeah. Jeff Jarvis, he is the director of the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism  at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  He's also a Leonard Towne professor for journalistic innovation there. And we are always thrilled to  have him on the show. Of course, a former TV guide critic as well. I love that. And a blogger.
