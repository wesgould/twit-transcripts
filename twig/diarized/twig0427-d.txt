I felt so proud saying I want to talk about cameras  Deal that fits. Yeah, he's really in photography now, isn't he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's traveling the world taking pictures of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We mentioned that because Stacey for years was a giga ohm as was her friend Matthew Ingram who has a new job  He does the CJR which is fan he is he's their media and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well social media media reporter Columbia. He's basically Matthew at CJR. I love it. That's how he should be

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Also here Jeff Jarvis professor of journalism at the City University of New York blogger at buzz machine comm  prolific author and public speaker who's traveling the world

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where are you gonna be next week? You're home. I know it's amazing next week. I'm in Chicago  That's why I can't be on the show cuz I got a  Advising the Christian Century magazine joining an advisory group for them, which is kind of weird  Then I'm going to Salt Lake City for a media thing was it last century the Christian century  Well, that's one of the things I wanted

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We are in the new century now, it's like last year was the American century last century was the American century now  I don't know what?  Pixel 2 oh, I got it by the way. I just wanted to show you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's gonna be here tomorrow you got the little one I got the little one. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the people who ordered the XL I think are not getting theirs for a while

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not getting on the 26th one ships off

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you're soon it's gonna be available in Verizon's my tomorrow isn't shipping till November now

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow, that's when mines coming no mines like Halloween  I think I canceled the reorder like you did so I got a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I did get this. Oh, I got my case

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My case shipped but it won't be here until forever. So so yours look I can it looks great

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got one of those live cases. This is one with my picture on it. Actually, we  Did a show. How's it came out great and  At least see I'm looking it looks like I'm trapped in the phone and then the cameras right there  I think it looks good. I like pretty good, but see at least now I know how big the phone's gonna be I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can practice squeezable? Yeah practice squeezing squeeze it. That's the weird. That's the weirdest feature

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I think you know it as I as I read the reviews because all the reviews got an unembargo yesterday  Yeah, this is what it's gonna look like  It's like it's like a dummy so I can see how big that's nice if it's that's good practice putting my finger on the  Reader all the reviews said that the squeeze actually was a it gives you feedback tactical feedback  It goes which is good and it's surprisingly useful and and  Who was it was a Deeter bone? I think right in the verge who said it's just very natural  I'm reaching into my pocket actually squeeze as I'm pulling it out and the assistance ready by the time I get it  Out the big complaint right now. We talked about this a couple of weeks ago is this screen  It's the same screen as an on the LG V30 LG not known for its OLEDs  You know Samsung makes is gonna make apples OLEDs that make the OLEDs for the note of course and the s8  The LG's apparently have kind of a blotchy grayness when they're turned to low dimness and we've started to see pictures of that come out  now, so  however, everybody's raving about the camera and  Google Google did a funny thing they they kind of  They were they sandbagged us a little bit turns out they didn't even mention this at the launch. There's a custom chip. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I say I told you so you knew that you did we talked about it on the show?  What about it you said I said they must have done something custom here. You're so smart. They didn't announce it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're sure is indeed Wow. It's called the pixel on the show. Yes  It's called the pixel visual core  It's a it's Google's first custom system on a chip for consumer products and its total job is  Camera stuff  Accelerating the HDR plus and so forth and it's not on  When you get your new phone, it will be it's not activated until later in a couple of months  Probably with 8.1 as my guess of Oreo  So well in the way that's cool Jeff because you'll get your phone pictures are gonna look great every image  I've seen so far looks fabulous and at some point it will suddenly get better even more or faster or something  It's an eight core  System on a chip with its own DDR4 RAM  This is crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So people just for that one function. Yeah people of course watch watch it's gonna go on your battery is gonna go you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's interesting they call it an IPU or image processing unit  and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh  Wasn't this gonna be that there was there was there was there was processing for what's their new photo thing called HDR?  Portrait no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no the software  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chat room  I oh and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right now I don't know. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's the it's the photo processing and some of that processing was  gonna happen locally

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Oh you mean for the little camera that they're selling the clip

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Know that there was various  tensor

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's their AI a machine that goes Bing chat room another chat room yet. No chat room help me

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know there was the others. No, you'll know it when you hear it. You'll say oh, that's what Jeff meant  It's not the AI processor  It was it was it was photo functionality that they announced at I oh, it doesn't matter what they name it  Yes, this must be it that was gonna do look and part of what the magic it was gonna do  Was locally processed we couldn't figure out the time. Well, how the hell they couldn't do that. This is how they can do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And whatever that function is whose name I cannot remember one of the reviews I read  Said oh, it's kind of now that's probably why

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  pixel  obviously pixel 2 required for this and  It will enable the pixel pixel visual core as a developer option in the preview of Oreo 8 one  So if you're already, you know as as many of us got on the preview just to get Oreo 8  A little early on our pixel phones if you're still on that stay on it because a one should come out pretty soon  Probably roughly the same time you get your pixel 2  Except for Stacy who's getting hers tomorrow  so  Google also says the HDR plus is only the first application to run on the pixel visual core in time  We should expect to see more imaging and machine learning enhancements added  If I love it Apple's done this to Apple's new phones  Have a lot of extra capability headroom the bionic 11 chip a 11 bionic chip that they put in there is way more powerful than  You need and we've been speculating that that's because their new capabilities come into these phones  They overbuilt them for AR or other stuff. This would could easily be part of an AR engine  So that's good. I love it. That's kind of nice  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Had to do my Eureka yes lens that was lovely

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's just what my memory was that's what happens  Yeah, so tech crunch exciting Google lens still has a long way to go  Is that was gonna do the localized processing of figuring out what the photo was and the photo becomes the search query

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not the funny thing is the tricky part about all that is not the processing it's the data

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Having a new product. I don't understand. Well, I don't understand much

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's the data going back to the cloud a lot of this if it can be processed on the machine remember  They're also doing things like maybe yeah. Well  And I don't know the specs of this chip, but if there's  Generally even on a really tiny chip you can run a little bit of like  Three to five models, which is recognition for three to five things. This is very broadly speaking  This is very generalized, but so with something this is way more powerful  So you could probably do quite a bit, especially with things like  Recognition of a person that can all be stored here on that  And now your dog  I was gonna say your particular dog not just dog in general

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hmm so so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can also go to a pop-up store in New York or Los Angeles  But Verizon will have them now I guess to look at and available for sale on  Thursday

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you have to deal with Verizon and their stupid is a 20 or 35 dollar activation fee  Which is just basically like  Money so yeah, so we can have you pay us money forever

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  course and this phone has no  Headphone jack it also doesn't have wireless charging  But the circuit breaker Vlad Zvav says the real problem with the pixel 2 is that darn screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what's so bad about the screen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I you know I I have to say I'm gonna withhold judgment until I actually have it it may not affect me  I think a lot of times I noticed this on reddit threads and among Android fanatics  When they really start to pay attention to this stuff they go has blotchy  Stuff that you wouldn't notice if you didn't really try to pay attention to it  So the now this is more about a photography the the left is the iPhone  8 plus for those of you watching the video  Yes, what's wrong? What happened? This is poorly screened. I don't know what's going on here  I  don't know  So I guess what they're saying here is that this the iPhone makes the photo look brighter than it actually is  Oh, I see why it looks so weird. They're taking a picture of the screen. Oh  With the polarization. Yeah, and then the pixel 2 looks greener than it looks in real life  See, I know this is a very bad way to judge anything. I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and this is only on the XL so mine will not have this issue. Yeah, cuz you got the baby for me  Yeah, okay. I'm gonna call it the petite phone like the petite fillet because by golly you got actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nothing baby about those bezels. You got the big bezel buddy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm fine with bezels. I am NOT looking at my phone to be a fashion plate. Yeah, it'll be okay. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're gonna you're gonna by the end of the year gonna say god that phone looks like it came from the 50s  Who thought that was a good idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey right now. I'm on an iPhone 6. Oh  Everything will be better when I'm not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everything will be better

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everything my whole world will improve

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's that on the Google pixel. I don't think there's anything much else to say  I thought that that chip though was really an interesting revelation and I don't know why because I love being right. Yeah, you were  You really you really pegged it you nailed it you said they must have a chip in there must have some hardware for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Favis although I did think it was gonna be also in the clip, but apparently

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you think it was image processing hardware or AI hardware? I thought it was something I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think I called it AI for imaging but I think you did I did think that rings a bell. Yeah, okay  So I remember  Yes, I wanted it to be something special because I knew that Google was working on their own chips  They'd hired so many silicon designers and it felt like with what they were talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That they had some special some special sauce somewhere in there really interesting how both Apple and Google see their future  As doing highly customized down to the chip hardware that that it makes total sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to be to control your own destiny both in the features you want to offer and product differentiation  You need to develop your own hardware also with battery life being so important. The other side of that is it allows you to  handle your  Security and upgrade cycles for a longer period of time if you can control those chips. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry, I don't know if that was everything you're gonna say very much so and and actually more than I was gonna say  So thank you. We quoted Paul Thurrock quoted Alan Kay on Windows Weekly  Who said famously people who are really serious about software should make their own hardware and that was  Something Steve Jobs took very seriously  Alan Kay was a is well, I guess he was an Apple fellow  I think he's an Imagineer now, but a brilliant thinker and I think that's kind of the point is yeah  You have to tightly integrate those stacks. It has another advantage though because and this is the thing  I don't like from the point of view of consumer it pushes people into ecosystems into silos  Mm-hmm and  But you got to have a differentiator. I don't mind that at all  I don't I think you would agree Stacy  You don't want to see AI silos and this is the this is a number of people are worried that  Was it I think was on Sunday. We talked about this Google's hiring all the AI people there  You know, they're they're hard custom hardware  TensorFlow all of this is kind of designed to to get all of the stuff in Google's court. Do you agree?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes to a certain extent  TensorFlow is really actually a way to economically do AI in Google's cloud. It's open  Right. It is  Yes, now you can still use just like there's like CUDA for Nvidia stuff and torch and cafe all of those things  You can still you like the other AI frameworks  You can still use on tensorflow the TPUs. Sorry on the the TPUs. So they may not run quite as efficiently  I'm less worried about  The hardware integration on the AI side and maybe I will be proven  Tragically wrong in a couple decades, but I think more problematic is control of the data and  The ability to gather all that data  And limit others people's access to it because that's where right now we're gonna see the rubber meeting the road  so like the Google photos that you put in there they become part of Google's enormous data feds data set that just makes it even  better and  that's  That's gonna make it hard for anyone else to compete. So those are the things I would be looking at

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, what do you do? You say oh Google? I mean I  know  They could they collect this data in the process of their business. I don't know how you can stop them. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't and this is this is where?  This is where well, I see I think we're gonna talk about  In the coming years hopefully and we're already starting how to measure competition in a world where a  Monopoly isn't just being able to charge a lot of money for something  It a monopoly is much more about being able to develop far  Far beyond your capability, I guess far beyond your competition because of the inherent advantages

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Well, it's you know  We've talked before the show about the doctrine being not the gathering of data  but the use of data and in a sense that's what the GDP are the the  General data protection regulations going in effect in Europe and may  Try to do but but but the problem with that is that you can't anticipate  Every use and get permission for every use in the future. We've talked about the show in the past  So it's really yeah, how do you how do you regulate? How do you limit?  Where are the dangers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are open  open data sets so, you know, it would be really interesting if  In Google's not gonna do this but like there there have been efforts around autonomous cars to say look  Here's a data sets or driving in streets and situations and making those open to the community  And I don't know if if there's a way to to create like a friend for data sets, right?  I I'm not sure how that might look or a licensing pool

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Remember those used to be so big your Google you fight that tooth and nail course because that really is their secret sauce  And I don't see why Apple should have Google's data any more than Google should have Apple's data

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Control yeah, that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Giving Google my photos Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That I don't know if people are aware that they're always they're giving Google their photos or how that  How that percolates through the rest of the ecosystem, right?  Like how that gives Google an advantage over, you know, let's  The next hot photo startup. I don't know what that would be. So, I mean people don't think they don't make decisions in terms of  Competition policy. That's not what individual consumers do. That's why we have governments who get involved

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, it's interesting  You should mention that because today at Adobe Max Adobe announced a revamp of its Lightroom program a program photographers use  And one of the things they announced is oh and when you subscribe you're gonna get a terabyte of free storage  In fact, you don't need to keep your photos on your computer anymore. Why don't I just keep them in our cloud?  How about that now? I?  Don't know if that's the plan  It's certainly they should tell us if they're gonna use you know  I think they are because they say and we are gonna be able you're gonna be able to categorize photos now by key  You know  We'll be able to search through your photos for pets and people and keywords very much like Apple does with its photos and Google does  with its photos  photographers, by the way are really up in arms over this good effect  it's such a utter redesign of the of the tool that most pro photographers use to manage their photos that  Adobe's gonna continue to offer their old version as Lightroom classic and  Then which hasn't been updated in a few years and then  Adobe Creative Cloud Adobe Lightroom CC will be a brand new very  Different version and one of the things I you know, I bought it immediately because I wanted to take a look at it  I use Lightroom  Avidly if this is a very good example. This is the preference setting if you look at the preference settings in Lightroom today  It's page after page after page of complicated settings this they don't let you do nothing. It's like very straightforward  This they're very this is cloud this is all well, it's no but it's software on your computer too  They just don't want you can if you if you insist you can keep your originals on your  Computer and pros will a terabytes not enough to store even all of my photos let alone of professionals

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know what I'm asking. Does this work on Chrome? No

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It will with the Android app for AC  No, with the no the whole point of this is that you can then use Adobe Lightroom  mobile  mm-hmm iOS or Android and  Can you can even pick off where you left off editing so you can edit on your desktop and then it will the edits will automatically  Be secret synchronized. This is where we had this makes sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacey's gonna want to make fun of me, but well, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So in that respect it does kind of make sense, but boy photographers who are used to really a very local process  I  Don't know they're gonna kind of I'm a little freaked out and once you  Once you move your catalog over to the new version that's that you're in and it even costs more money so  It's it's interesting. We'll see what we'll see what the reaction they just  clearly  Adobe is  Trying to woo that that Google Photos and Apple Photos crowd  I don't know that's if that's where they their market is but that's that's what they want to do  So  You know what it is a cause I don't is it just my imagination or is it really  Tipped picked up steam this notion of companies really creating verticals and silos  For a while the whole thing was you know, we were hoping it was gonna be more open  You know, you'd be able to use whatever you wanted to use  That's kind of was Microsoft Windows era where you'd buy the platform windows  You'd buy the platform windows  But you'd have all these third party applications that people would write on top of the platform and you could use anybody's  Your data stayed on your computer. It was yours and and now  Everybody Google Apple Microsoft. They're all trying to build silos Adobe  Where if you use their stuff you're gonna eventually get lock-in, you know  And I understand why from a business point of view they do it but boy, sir sure feels bad as a customer  Okay  I'm off my off my soapbox  Let's take a break. We're going to talk more about the Supreme Court  We're going to talk lots of supreme supreme court when it's the what was it second Tuesday in October?  They just they're sitting again. They're accepting cases a number of them apply  Including that Microsoft case keeping email overseas, but I want to welcome right now a new sponsor  To this week in Google and you know what their sponsor because of you Stacey because you said what I  Will quote when I went out and bought the nest IQ cams. Oh you doofus

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was a warm and loving doofus

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I said wait what what should I buy and you said oh you got to check this out. This is the lighthouse and  This is the coolest thing ever now  It's not out yet, but you can go to light house  slash twit  To I think you can you pre-order there? No, just give me your email and you'll get on the list  It'll be out any minute now. I think there were only a short bit away  You'll get 15% off when they ship and a chance to win a free lighthouse plus a year of service  So lighthouse looks like a security camera. It is so much more than a security camera  And by the way number one  The reason the other ones are out of the house in the lighthouse is  The lighthouse turns on only when you're not home if you want you can have it on all the time  And you may want to because it's got  Amazing AI built into this thing  It is you can query it like you would Siri or Google  You could say for instance  I want to see all the time that humans walked by with pets in you know  It knows pets from humans and it will automatically give you all of those videos  So one of the things that this was a must for Lisa  Whenever the owners are home the cameras not on so it doesn't get no  You train it no, I don't think it's training training. I think it's the app but it might not be it's explicit. Yeah  So I think when you come in the house and and either join the Wi-Fi or it sees you via Bluetooth  You know I should find out I'm not sure right right. Sorry. Sorry, but it does

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right right sorry sorry, but it is training. Oh, there's lots of training. Look at this. This is so cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So first of all because we're not home it was on and an alert was triggered. I just got an alert  Can you zoom in? I don't know if you can see that but somebody was walking through the living room  It's actually our assistant, but it but now look at that. I said call 911 or I could say all okay  I can review the video. I'm gonna say all okay now. It says do you want to disarm the home? No, let's stay armed  So this is a live video of our living room I could see a daily recap as  People walk in and out and go through isn't that cool. You see how it outlines people  The oranges pets so I could say for instance, oh, I just want to see all the pet activity  Were there any pets here? These are pets actually that's that's there's the pet  Sometimes people with pets walking through our house  This is amazing  You can see the faces and this is what you were talking  About Stacy I can see it says okay. Here's all the images of you  That and then it says here now. Here's some images are these you  That's me. That's me. That's me. So I'm gonna say yeah. Yep. That's me  Oh, that's not me. So I'm gonna say that's me that's me but this one that's not me. So actually that's that's uncle Joe  But that's fine. So he's it's okay if he's in the house  This has a nightlight night camera. So it's got in, you know, it can see in the dark  But this is the most exciting thing that's different from everything else  Besides the AI it's got a depth sensor a 3d depth sensor  So it has a better sense of why

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What does it do Stacy tell me what it does a  3d depth sensor makes  One of the challenges with cameras and computers is for computer vision. You can spoof things just by showing a picture of your face

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why for instance the nest thought that the mylar balloons were people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did not know it warned me I can talk to that makes sense right the depth sensor just like face recognition on an Apple phone  It just makes it a more accurate recognition

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They use different sensors so the iPhone uses I can't remember a structured light sensor I believe in this uses

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't remember they do but I can't remember brain

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No school. It's so cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then the AI so that's so so that's the camera part so it can see what's going on in the dark  It sees during the day. It has depth sensing so it recognizes people it recognizes pets, but then the AI is  So amazing it's natural language queries so you can say things like what did the kids do when I was out yesterday?  You could say did you see someone with the dog?  Yesterday afternoon while I was out  So what's happening? You can have it you can notify  Lisa when I get home if he says or it can say if you don't see Michael by four o'clock in the afternoon  Let me know if he doesn't come home on time  It will it will ping you. Oh  And then the wave thing is so cool. Do you know about the wave thing Stacey? I do not know about the wave thing. So  if if so  the kids don't have it on their phone they can walk up to the camera and  They wave at the camera and that pings me  It says Michael's waving and you can and you can open on your phone and say they're like that you can say hi Michael  What's up? They open up a two-way talk. Oh  That's awesome. Is that not awesome?  They're basically pinging you  By just waving at the camera  If you have an elderly parent you can say things like if mom doesn't get up by 7 a.m  Let me know if you don't see any motion in the house  It's a 1080p live stream two-way talk night vision. You get a 30-day video history. I  Love the privacy and that that was kind of  Table stakes for Lisa she said I want a camera that's on when we're home  But that's fine. I don't care. I don't want to see what's going on. We're home. I know what's going on  So when we are home it turns off so that you've got real privacy, of course, it's encrypted on the way  They do firmware updates automatically. It's encrypted in place. So you have all the privacy you want you can have  Permission settings you have owners.

So that's pretty impressive  really cool  Scotus bunch of SCOTUS stories here Supreme Court of the United States  They have agreed to review the DOJ versus Microsoft but this goes back to  What is it GDPR?  Your data and if it's in the US or if it's an outside our shores can the DOJ get it?  And Microsoft has data I guess on Irish servers  And this is pretty let me let me get the actual facts of the case  The actual facts of the case this this is this is uh, oh wow  Supreme Court has agreed to hear the cross back here. It's been going on for more than a year  Microsoft says that data concerning non-us persons  That's important non-us persons stored in non-us servers  Should not be subject  to subpoena by the Department of Justice  The DOJ says nope, you're an American company doesn't matter if it's a US person doesn't matter if it's overseas  So  This is a big deal because if you're Microsoft or Apple or Google  You don't want to lose all your overseas customers because the minute they use you  Suddenly, they're subject to US law enforcement  If this if this is an article from extreme tech if scotus declares that the US government can reach into cloud databases  Located on servers in other nations and plug out any information on any private citizen of another country at any time  Then the trust europeans will have in any US provider of cloud or email services will drop to zero real quick  No wonder Microsoft's fighting this one  No wonder Microsoft's fighting this one  No idea how the supreme court will go on this one just it's completely this is so different from any case they've seen before  Any thoughts

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The internet makes us all follow the same rules or but it doesn't  How is that going to work in practice? I mean we're going to need a treaty I guess for this and that's going to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's going to be dangerous  Yes, it is  I heard a politician say in europe. I won't say we're an event off the record event, but I heard a politician say  Cautioning the people in the room  It's we're he said we're ones  A terrorist attack away from legislation to ban anonymity. Yeah, that's probably true  God help us minutes. It's it's it's and the same politician was being  blunt with us saying  You don't want government to do this we don't know what we're talking about  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And yet  You know people the reason we have these rules now is because of 9 11 and people will cry out saying  uh protect us  That's your job protect us

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's an emotional protect us. It's it's you know, what what's this actually going to do? Yeah  um  And and and i'm always concerned about the lowest common denominator of freedom highest common denominator of highest watermark of of  regulation that once the process is set up so that a nation can demand x  Then every nation will demand that including the worst of nations

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The supreme court on monday  Declined to review this is goodness for google  I think a petition asserting that the term google has become too generic and that is not qualified for trademark  protection  google has not is  Has not fallen victim to genericide and that is not so basically. I think that means  Since the judges refused to hear it  that google is  Trademarkable a guy chris golespy had registered 763 domain names with the word google in it google claimed trademark infringement  Forced golespy to forfeit the domains. He sued to invalidate the trademark  A federal appeals court ruled last year  That even though the word google lowercase g has become synonymous for searching the internet the trademark should still be valid  It's not kleenex. It's not xerox  Because google is more than a search engine  Uh  That's the ninth u.s. Circuit court of appeals ruling and uh, and then golespy who must have very deep pockets appealed to the supreme court  Yep, he's done, but he's done  So the lower court the circuit court ruling holds  That's it still works for now that seems fair  Yeah, is kleenex is still a trademark xerox is still a trademark  For the same reason lawyer they spend the fortune with lawyers protecting them. Yeah, it means more than a tissue or a photocopy  It's it's a bigger. It's bigger than just that  That's it for scotus news i think

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think so. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you want to talk about jeff fake news ads?  google served ads  Uh that were that's pretty funny blatantly fake to politifact and snopes a place people go to check  facts  Oops, no melania trump is not leaving the white house. No  Hgtv star joanna gaines is not a bandit her husband and her show. No, joel austin is not leaving his wife. Those were  Fake news

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But is it fake by the way that we have a fake melania

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What have you seen that I saw that you seen that what yeah, what do you mean fake melania?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, let me appreciate it myself, let me just circle this here see this is the ad the rest of the story  This is a google ad  On an article. It says why melania isn't staying at the white house. She's this was old obviously  She stayed in new york. So politifact is talking about that. This is a vogue article right at the top  Obviously somebody anxious to I don't know do what?  So promote this idea so confusion  Bought an ad saying hey, that'd be a good place to buy an ad and google let them but this is the problem with programmatic ad  advice, right? I mean  It's all automatic

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The thing that i've i've been thinking lately about about advertising  I don't know if I said this on the show last week or not if I did stop me but but but  Blogs and the web democratized and opened up the creation of content and bad guys followed  Yes, advertising is also democratized and bad guys followed  Yes, and and we're used to a world where the whole world was edited and the first time somebody used a bad word on the internet  We thought they've schmutz to the whole internet. It's ruined  As if someone put a bad word the new york times same thing on advertising  Somebody put a bad ad online the whole internet is ruined. Well, no, we just have a completely new reality  We got to figure out which means we need new rules and new structures and and that's all true  but  We shouldn't be acting so shocked  That people are gaming these systems

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if it's if it's even gaming if you're gonna buy that ad you're gonna put it on snubs and bullet effect  That's the perfect place to put it  And now you know why people use ad blockers  Uh go they were using google ad since it's automatic you buy the ad you buy the you buy the  The site can you can buy a site directly jeff. I guess you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  um  Depends no usually you buy a word right or a search usually. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's probably what you do  No, you can't buy the site because that would undercut the the direct sales of the site, right?  So when the new york times ran google ads for the first time way way back when and I asked the executives I said  What how can you do that? They said well, no nobody can buy the new york times through this side door  They can only buy keywords. They can only buy certain characteristics. They only buy audience  So yeah, I think if you're if you're clever enough in how you put the ad buy in

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Then you'll end up on fact checking sites by the way google does not like this and they call it tab  They call it tabloid cloaking  buying  Ads for tabloid fake tabloid stories on legitimate news sites  It says google says these types of scammers use timely topics and ads made to look like new website headlines  Google said it suspended more than 1300 advertiser accounts in 2016 for doing it  This month. She's yeah this month google said it had introduced additional controls to help publishers  Filt out sensation filter out sensational or tabloid ads so they put it on the on the publisher to kind of block that stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Could they also deal with the grossly inaccurate health ads because those are everywhere everywhere  they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're actively harmful in yeah, they say they're going after it, but but it hasn't been good enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Facebook's got the same problem. I see those ads all the time on facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean now i'm talking i'm not talking about things like, you know, get rid of belly fat  I'm talking about things like ingest crazy poisons to make your energy levels rise. No, that's not good

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've got to say this. I'm sorry. This is gonna this is gonna sound a little political. It's not but I just i'm just  This is too much. So um  evidently info wars sells  um  some kind of um

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of  Supplement vitamin supplements. Yes. Yes, and they contain sperm damaging lead

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh nice, i'll let you write the jokes nice nice  The chemicals were what was found in info wars caveman paleo formula

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't buy it  I have to say this is a long-standing tradition in radio as well. In fact, one of the things that makes it hard for me. Oh  Kids came notification kids came home. Yeah  One one of the things that makes uh makes this hard, uh  For me to sell my weekend radio shows at many radio stations across the nation no longer have  Programming on the weekends. They sell the entire yes weekend  And and oftentimes it's dubious products  But you buy it, you know, it's very lucrative for the radio stations. It's been  $5,000 for a half hour  And stale supplements, uh, and they sound like real radio ads. So this is this is a long-standing problem  Let the buyer beware. I guess I don't know  Really so so I mean wouldn't the best way to handle this to have the fda regulate anything you put in your mouth  But of course it doesn't because  The supplement makers lobbied the fda saying oh, it's a it's a food. It's not it's not a it's not a medicine  And uh, so they have lower standards that you know  It's too bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if you can't believe

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That you have only one first lady, then what can you so? All right. Tell us what's this? What's there's a there's a  I put it on the rundown fake milania

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, come on. So if you go down if you go down, there's a video there. This is new york magazine

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, I have to tell you this is bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People are looking at that video and saying that's not milania. They're putting pictures of milania  Next to actually, you know, it doesn't look like milania right now. The lips look different. It looks like a wig

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The lips are different. She's wearing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's fake milania. So  people are having too entirely too much fun with this now, so as as uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't that a wig that's a wig?  I don't know. It's not even a good wig

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Women don't have like a gene that don't you have wig radar? I thought you had wig radar  I'm like I own a wig, but I do not know. I mean  Yeah, don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I always ask my wife if somebody's had work done. She seems to know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't yeah, there's I I can't I mean that's that's a skill that's developed over time and  Continual consumption of people and entertainment. We can work done. Oh, yeah, she's had work done. I can't tell look at the lips

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, they are large  That's work  Anyway, I don't yeah the problem and the problem with doing stuff like that. Maybe it's true  I don't know. I don't know what you do with it. But the problem with that is it distracts from much more serious topic

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How's Puerto Rico doing lately by the way? Yeah, exactly. I've been thinking about that all the stuff today about the calls and this and that  News is doing all that. You're right. They're not talking about Puerto Rico. They're not talking about about issues that matter. You're absolutely right  Uh, and they can justify the same recovery in the white house  they are and they need to but huge issues are going but  Uh a twitter account called alex tremboly  Which I think is nicole cliff said if you do not choose to believe in the existence of fake milania  I encourage you to find more room in your heart for joy and whimsy today

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  sometimes we just  Just need it, but there is and I think twitter has exacerbated this there's you know, there's always been gotcha journalism, right?  Uh, and I think it's twitter has brought it to a fine art  Oh, oh, yeah, look at al michaels who I think said one of I don't know  Tell me if i'm wrong the most innocuous thing you could say on sunday night football. He said, uh,  the giants are having a worse week than uh, uh harvey weinstein  And and people were calling on twitter calling for him to be fired fired  Uh, I don't even think that's tasteless maybe it is but it it  There is this kind of very fine and twitter is such an outrage engine that everything rises to this very high pitch  And as a result nothing matters  Right or am I wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's only I mean that's only if you use twitter as your end all be albarometer for what to care about

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the news media does

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I take issue with that some news media may  And they do report on things happening on twitter maybe to a greater extent than they probably should that's our job  You know puerto rico is still in the new york times  Uh cnn is still running stories on these things that matter like health care  and  Ways to figure out what to do after obama or obama trump's canceling subsidies  I mean, these are all stories now that the things people talk about on twitter are obviously going to be  The fun the silly the less nuanced stuff because no one really wants to get in a  Health care debate in 140 characters, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, or 280. Uh, but here's the problem. I see I I know now that newsrooms across the world  Have now full-time jobs called trending editors  I know they do is go in to twitter. They go into twitter, which is leo's point and they say well  We gotta have that too. We gotta have that too. This is news. It's a follow-on to the old seo  And and it's a waste of a resource. It's a waste of of attention  Um, it's not really journalism. Uh, it's what the business model pushes them to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. I mean I remember in at fortune we had we jumped on those stories or they pressed us to jump on those stories  And some of us were like no, but that was that was part of  The business model we had to get that in those traffic those stories did  Good traffic, even though they were utter crap. So you're proving what I just said, which is yes you are whatever reason

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There and I I think you can say some of the stems from twitter  We've become this gotcha nation because it drives traffic and although I I read this quote from george carlin  Yesterday, uh, i'm gonna read it again. I have to find it. It's on. Uh, it's a great instagram  Account called niche  That has great pictures of people and their quotes george carlin says there's one thing you might have noticed  I don't complain about and that's politicians everybody complains about politicians. Everybody says they suck  Well, where do people think these politicians come from?  They don't fall out of the sky. They don't pass through a membrane from another reality  They come from american parents and american families american homes american schools american churches american businesses and american universities  And they are elected by american citizens. This is the best we could do folks. This is what we have to offer  It's what our system produces garbage in garbage out if you have selfish ignorant citizens  You're going to get selfish ignorant leaders term limits ain't going to do any good  You're just going to end up with a brand new bunch of selfish ignorant  Americans so maybe maybe maybe it's not the politicians who suck  Maybe something else sucks around here and i'd say it's not just politicians. It's news. We get the news we deserve  The stuff we read

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true, although  I have written. I mean my whole job for a long time covering things like tech policy was to deliver actual nuanced  news for people and  It it didn't get read that was frustrating and then  I mean, it's true and i'm not saying that i am the best writer because I am certainly that is not  What i'm great at but  The people who did read it it did make its way into places where decisions were made  so  While the mass market may not consume in-depth policy research or deep technically reported stories  You know that there are people who are making decisions that do look at that. So  I I don't there's there's two audiences for  News there's the entertainment kind of quick distractions and then there's people who are actually trying to find out  What's really happening and get real insights and those people are often the people making actual decisions  Yeah, and that's worth thinking about as  As we figure out like what role the media plays and who's paying attention to it  You know, you're absolutely, you know, you've got high integrity. You're absolutely right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've got high integrity, you're absolutely right and but you know, and I and we shouldn't despair  But you you got to admit pumpkin spice is always going to get more clicks  Uh than you know, uh  Tax policy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, sure, but I mean what do you talk about with people you talk about pumpkin spice the challenge is  when we talk about tax policy, we don't currently have a  a report  editorial  Cohort that can actually break those issues down for people and so what happens is maybe a good point. That's jeff's problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's your fault. Jeff  You need to breed better journalists  Go ahead let jeff let jeff respond. Yeah, I can see this when I was in london. I saw a play

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh called ink about rupert burdock and the creation of uh, the sun  uh really well done play and and the the  Motif through to begin the beginning and end  was  starts with with  The five w's who what would wear why?  uh plus how  and  The argument was from the editor murdoch hired to start the sun or the remade sun  Uh was the why is boring why does about it anymore when you get to why the story ends  So the what what we care about now is what next?  And that's what we do right it's this happened and and this is happening next and we can predict what's going to happen and  And it's all just what happened what happened what happened what happened?  It's not moving past and on the way back. I I read a book a little book about um truth  And the complications of figuring out truth by a philosopher bookstore. I picked up in london  and  Truth is hard truth is not easy. I'm not saying truth is relative but but but truth is not absolute  And and truth is difficult and we have this view that we in journalism are here to find the truth and spread the truth  No, I actually think i'm coming more and more to think that our job is to find peace  Is to is to enable society to be able to have conversations  You're right stacy conversations truth because truth is often divisive and angering and causes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  uh  friction not

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Resolution and and we're in this age of emotions  But the emotions we have are the ones that are all charged up by media  Rather than emotions of empathy and understanding and concern  And and and human decent emotions like that  And so, you know, I think journalism's job  Is to feed the public conversation to convene communities in conflict into conversation. Yes information has a role in that. Absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of course it does. It didn't used to be the media's job media's job used to be truth  And the politician's job was to lead  I think you're just this is the problem is there's a vacuum  From the people who are supposed to do their job bringing the nation together to have these tough conversations to come to resolution  To find a solution that works for everybody  They're not doing that  So you're saying the media should take over basically  Well, I mean we're not elected officials. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're we're driven by pop. I mean we're driven by profit. So I I know nobody wants to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love your optimism stacy  I think we're in idiot really i'm the we have actually hit an idiocracy. It's over  Scrut  I'll be the i'll be the i'll be the despair i'll be despair for the day you guys could be uh, you guys could be optimism

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you but if you really believe that that's a very nihilistic way to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know what I think sometimes the truth you have to say this is what is  I mean, i'd like to i'll work against it. I'm not going to just give up i'll work against it  But I think we've hit that and I think that  The and the reason we cover it on this show is because it's just to a great degree because of the rise of social media

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well, well, well  I wouldn't go too overboard there. I'm late even before facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could tell you that you know  I used to work at a business journal and when we had our when we started with the web we would put certain stories  Clicks we got the most clicks about restaurants opening and  You know anything involving a puppy. Yeah, I don't and there's people i'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I quote from the spectator when I go to england I get to actually read things. It's wonderful. Great bookstores there  Uh the leader the editorial and spectator this week  But the web was always going to be no more or less moral or vicious than the people who used it  Right. It's it's back to your back to your george carlin line that it is us. We have met the internet and it is us  It's made of people

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so why?  Actually, I kind of like this twitter  Ted Cruz your your senator  God, I didn't realize this but apparently there was a conspiracy theory that he was the zodiac killer  Which is apparently which is demonstrably false, by the way, he's not  But funny but he likes apparently thought it was funny because look what he tweeted

Transcript:  I I didn't realize I have been subscribing to amazon unlimited for a year. I didn't even realize it  Oh, I didn't  That's like 120 bucks i'll never see again, is it good is it worth it this is the one where I mean  Do they have decent books on unlimited?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so if you like  Airport reading is what I think of it. That's what I think of it too  And that's why I don't think I want it or if you have a kid there's actually some fun kid books  so I yeah, I got it during  Uh the chris they have a special during like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not prime day, but black that's probably when I bought it because I think it's exactly almost exactly a year  That's probably when I bought it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so so they it was like half off. So I subscribed  and  Is there I mean there's there's a lot of older books like there's some michael is it polan  The omnivorous dilemma and all those are on there. Oh, I like him. That's good. All right. I like his stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I use it I end up buying a lot of esoteric stuff. Yeah, the stuff I want is probably not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's a short history of the truth, oh I like it oh julia beguiney truth

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, dear. Did you just buy everything that truth in the name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  another one called post truth  um  What the what?  And then the the brett's a to z of modern manners. I thought that would be a nice little look at civility. Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there are people who read them because they're  They're easy reading they're like we call them bodice rippers for a reason. Yeah, but they're like the lee. What is it?  Reacher jack reacher books like that feels to me like ultimate male fantasy, right?  No, you're right. It's like easy and i'm awesome. Yeah  I am beautiful and some man wants me and they will treat me well and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can we talk about the self-learning ai, I mean can we talk about something fun?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, let's take a break and then we'll talk about that quantum computing  Self-learning ai and why google maps no longer has tiny donuts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And my new job description  Tiny cupcakes. I'm sorry job. I want the job you want the job. I want the job you've got

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  Everybody knows  That a website a podcast  uh movie  The quality of the imagery makes a big difference  We are visual if you need sound effects for your podcast production a video background for your website a hero image on your blog  You're gonna want to go  to the stock video marketplace  I want to make a recommendation a new place. We found called story blocks. It's video blocks by  Story blocks it's at video blocks.com slash twig  Get this  It's an all you can eat plan  All the content royalty free  commercial personal fine you you own it forever forever  115 000  Studio quality hd videos after effects templates motion backgrounds and more new clips all the time. So there's always something fresh to download  We for this we paid hundreds of dollars a month for this in the past  Video blocks by story blocks is 149 dollars a year a year once you pay a year  And you've got this access to this all year long  And you also get exclusive discounts on their marketplace. I love the marketplace  That's where they bring you together  with artists making videos five million additional videos  You pay the artists directly the artist gets 100 percent and because you're a member you get 40 percent off  So video blocks doesn't take a cut of this. This is just they just establish a marketplace  It's just a way to get you even happier about the deal you're getting video blocks.com  Twig 90 000 customers including the best biggest  NBC national geographic the history channel the travel channel  You don't go out, you know, you need to hover a drone footage of the beach  You need helicopter footage of downtown you need explosions and flames  Don't shoot it. It's all there in in beautiful high def quality  Studio quality look at that  Look at that. That's gorgeous  Sure, you could you could go to san diego and put a drone up in the air  But why do that when for 149 dollars a year unlimited access?  And by the way, your rights to use it are yours forever video blocks.com  Twig this is a this is a discovery when we found this it saves us a lot of money from the folks with story blocks  So I really said I didn't get this feature in google maps  Uh, and and now I didn't either I really wanted it. I guess it was a test, right?  So what they you would ask for directions at google maps and it would say if you walked  You would be able to eat this many tiny cupcakes. Did you get it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey, I did not get it. But this is the sort of thing  I  Like i'll just tell everybody I had an eating disorder in high school and college and  What people say about it being triggering as much as i'm kind of like really like my 11 year old is constantly triggered by things  I'm like, okay stop  But there is a very real  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, I want to be very distressing. I have family members who've had eating disorders  I myself have an eating disorder in the sense that I can't stop  Uh eating so I understand I don't mean to make light of eating disorders  So that's one of the reasons they stopped is is the community tried it and said you know what this is  These tiny cupcakes are triggering so you would you would you might have found this triggering when when you were in you were a teenager

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I I don't know  It's actually more like I would find it in triggering as day I would find it  An extra thing to think about yeah  It's it's one extra thing that I don't need. It's not a piece of information  I want to see  And it would force my brain to make calculations and decisions that it probably shouldn't it shouldn't go there

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So stacey, what about what about all the fitness trackers?  So that was it the nomenclature?  Yeah, what what was the so the fitness tracker

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I  I wear one and I I actually have set rules for myself  but that is that is a place I expect to think and that's  That's where I want that information and I look at it when I want that information  And I don't think about it except when i'm doing it if that makes sense. So it's kind of like  Someone popping up in a place that you don't expect and going  I think about your food and eating and calories and you're like, oh, I see. Okay  So here's a tweet here's a tweet from uh, cate bond

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, who's a new zealander, I guess, uh, dr  Kate bond on twitter google maps now includes calorie estimates and I really don't need this kind of judgment right now  The average person burns 56 calories by walking a kilometer. It's kind of so google's, you know, uh,  You know, uh thought was oh this is good because this will let people know that if they walked they would you know  It'd be good for fitness  but um  Okay  I you know, I look  It's not going to be the end of the world if we don't have it and if it bothers some people fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think it's a you know what I can see it being an awesome feature  Like what if I could put in like  Crispy cream donuts  Like at the end of the day google can tell me how many crispy cream donuts and that's like an optional thing  That should be something you choose  Right because there are plenty of things where  You're like, oh crap, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And again, what if they know is it the cupcakes that were bad or was it just the kind of the nannying saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what i'm asking. Yeah. Oh, it's it's the nannying. It's it's the idea that  That you should be thinking about calories all the time. Yeah, you're right. I get it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So somebody who's anorexic for instance is constantly worried  And there's no reason to to they're just looking for directions to say oh by the way  Because that's just that's triggering now. I understand it's you know  The world is going to be triggering. You can't eliminate all triggers, but this doesn't really add that much  Well, it's it's not to the world. This isn't making the world a better place

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, and I it's more  Again, I hate the word triggering. I really do it's it's a loaded word that doesn't  It's just it's making something into a choice that beforehand and that honestly was probably google's intent  Is to make you think about should I walk or should I try all I want is directions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't want to be told how many calories it's going to consume  That isn't what that map is is designed to do if I want a calorie counter i'll install a calorie counter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think anorexia and eating disorders are about control, right? And  When you're this is a reminder that you could control this to an even greater extent

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So why aren't you? Yes, why aren't you walking everywhere? Yeah. No, I completely agree with that and and really more to the point  it's adding it's really it's it's uh  Perpendicular to the purpose of maps it doesn't it's not it's something  It's not what maps is supposed to be doing  So it's not it's not a huge loss

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean it's when it doesn't have the apple watch have that thing trying to make you stand up every  Yeah, and I turned that off because I yeah, it's the hell of me nanny stuff. Yeah, it's stupid

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I I mean I option I have mine on my fitbit. It notifies me

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's what you're wearing a fitbit to do  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, so yeah, I yeah  I mean it's I I understand on the one hand you can't eliminate all the triggers from the world  Uh, you know, uh things are triggering, you know, I have friends who can't go to violent movies  It's very because of ptsd. It's very triggering for them. So they don't go to violent movies  But it's but if you were to thrust a violent movie in their face, that would be a bad thing to do to them  So I understand that  Um, and do we really need tiny cupcakes? In fact, i'm feeling guilty already. I should have walked here today

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I was like, yeah, this is not a hill I would die on but it is still exactly exactly I do that's not exercise

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know it's not you still not use it. Now. We were  Used it. Oh the kids use it. I use it once in a while because it's fun. It's really fun  But yeah, you're right  In fact, I I was tempted by an electric bicycle and I thought no I want the exercise when I ride a bike  I don't want an electric bicycle not that we have huge chills here if we had huge chills, maybe I would  Uh google photos now recognizes your pets as people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we talked about that. Oh, we already did we mentioned that on the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On this show or a previous show just just earlier we just yeah, it was a google photos section

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, because I went to it and it doesn't do it for me yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, oh, no. Oh, I can't use google photos because i'm not on my pixel too. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you can go to photos.google.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can go to photos.google.com and then when you go to  When you go to photos.google.com it shows you  People's you want me to use the web?  What web?  And when you look at people I got a lot of people I have to say this is pretty impressive  Notice that I only care about the first row or two of people  After that, I haven't labeled anybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Holy hannover you have got so many people in your pictures. It's ridiculous

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is ridiculous, I don't even have that you know what I thought if um, I thought oh, you know, what's cool about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, if I got alzheimer's they could use this as like a book now, who's that?  um  All right, and then I could practice

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I don't think that's how alzheimer's works no. Oh, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I I was in a mental hospital once saw somebody doing that. So I just thought that's maybe what you do  Anyway, if you need it, it's here john  Look at the people but I don't have any aminals in there  Actually, there's a picture of my daughter when she was a baby that's pretty good  Oh  Google photos is there anything you can't do?  Wow, and is your cute baby?  It doesn't know the difference between uh, baby abby and grown-up abby

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's really young

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was able so I have a picture of my daughter at the age of like 18 months and it knew that  Or maybe she was a year old it recognized her there to  Well, she's 11. So her face is probably still stacey waiting your daughter's 25 then see  No  Nope doesn't it's not gonna happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And married she will always be 11 and living in montreal then see  I thought you're good  No, not living in your backyard. No, no, no, I was I did the I went the other way with that  Google ai this is the one stacey really wanted to do can create better machine learning code than humans

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That coding class you're taking forget it never mind stop don't do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, yeah that this is a little misleading

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google has a system called auto ml

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Auto, so this wasn't the story. Oh, oh, this is not the one you're talking about. Oh, it's not the story

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that is that is that is that is auto learning to code so that is also related but I was talking about the alpha go zero  Research paper that came out today. I think it's in there. Did I put it in there? I didn't see it there. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no, what if they didn't i'll find alpha goes zero learns on its own. It's under alphabet  Um, it's the last item so well same idea right the same idea is not writing software but uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's able to create knowledge about itself  But isn't that what but but wait a minute isn't that though learning systems do neural networks? That's the whole idea of a neural network

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No  so  If you're doing depending on the type of learning that it's doing  a person a data scientist actually  Helps train the model so it's it's saying it's nudging it. It's like, oh, you know  This is your you're more right here and then it's like it adapts. This is doing it without any human intervention whatsoever  So this is wow, this is like what mine did with um learning how to play video games  You basically give it a goal you say here's what we want you to get to figure out how to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So here's and here's the example that the guardian says previous versions of alpha go learned their moves by training on thousands of games  by strong players  Which you know as you say were fed to it alpha go zero had no such help instead it learned  Purely by playing itself with a logic millions of times over  So it just played go at random and and the goal was to to win by taking over territory  But swiftly improved as it discovered winning strategies  The interesting thing about that is it might learn to play better because humans might have a style of play that's influenced by each other  But it's not necessarily the right style  And so it might be learning from humans that are imperfect instead. It's learning by actual experience  It takes a lot longer and what was kind of fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was kind of fun is that it figured out some really difficult things very quickly and then some very simple things  It took a while. So it's learning in a different way than we learned which  I guess makes sense because it's a computer and we're people but still kind of cool. Yeah, and i'm not sure that the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Replicating the human brain is the goal

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is um, so they use a rating system the elo rating system  Uh, I they use it in chess. I guess they use it in go as well. This is a video of how alpha go  Make a little higher how alpha go learned it started at zero like it knew nothing  No knowledge of the game, but look how fast and it's uh, it's not a straight up  It's up and down up and down  But in the long run it got to a very strong three days it got to uh stronger than the original alpha go  Now it starts to taper off of course because it can't grow as fast in three weeks  It reached the level that defeated the 60 top professionals online and the world champion  Three out of three games last year and now it's better

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's off the charts in 40 days. It's better than all other versions of alpha. How many times did it play to get there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's a great question. It must have been hundreds of millions of games, right?  Because it can play a lot faster if it doesn't actually have to put stones. It puts those 10 000 hours ideas. It's just straight to hell  Now go is go is a very rigorous, uh, you know and rigid structure, right? So  You know for instance I had for years and my kids loved this as a screensaver something called breathe walker, which is a very  popular, um  kind of artificial intelligence thing it was a  four-legged creature  Here i'll show you I show you a video of it at work. It's a four-legged creature  That teaches itself to walk  Uh, but at first doesn't do a very good job  but  Over many iterations it gets better and better and better and eventually walks, but it might take months or even years  Because you start with nothing. I love that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a the best screensaver ever. How does it define but but isn't that all about the goal?  The goal is distance what defines good walking. Oh distance. I see. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it tries different strategies at random with its four  Articulated legs some of them are like this and they don't move anywhere  And until it gets somewhere and it's really interesting to see it  But it's not nearly as of course we can't do as many iterations as fast  So it's not it didn't take 40 days to become the best go player in the world  I think go is so much more structured. It might be a little bit easier. I don't know  It's pretty impressive  So that's very different than a computer that writes its own code  But it's related in this sense and this is the thing that scares humans  And this to me is what the real singularity is, you know often they talk about the singularity being when a computer mind is  Indistinguishable from a human mind. It's as you know, it's as good as or at least can't you can't tell the difference  My singularity is when computers or or artificial intelligences can start designing themselves  Because that's the hockey that's the bend in the hockey stick because we're slow  So as long as we have to write the code or teach the computer to play go  It's going to take longer the minute the computer can just say let me take it from here and do a million moves a second  or write its own code  the  Acceleration of learning just takes off. You've got the the exponential elbow and the hockey stick  That to me is the real singularity and it sounds like we might we might be getting there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Auto ml I think that'll go ahead so  That will be important for times to come because we cannot as people  Generate the code we're going to need in as flawless a manner as we have to so  you know, I I know this is scary in some ways and we should be talking about how to audit things and  you know how to look at outcomes and test stuff, but  We don't  We don't do things by hand anymore. There's so many like we don't we don't hand stitch our clothing anymore  It's ridiculous that we should have to hand write our code  When we're putting so much  Of our lives in tech that was kind of not as eloquent as I wanted it to be but you get where i'm going with this  Yeah, and I don't think that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that there's there's a  I think that there's there uh  the two the two um  Issues are orthogonal. So I think there's the one issue that the computer writing its own code that's separate from the  What you don't want a computer to do is optimize for its success. That's the famous paperclip example, right?  If you build if you build a paperclip machine  That is trained to optimize for building paper clips. That's all it does and success is only  The number of paper clips generates eventually it eats the whole world  Because everything is about making paper clips  That's different in my opinion that's orthogonal from the goal of having computers write their own software. That's two different problems. I hope  You know that example the paperclip

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes machine  Isn't is it writing your own software just an extension of a learning system?  Of a learning network. Yeah sort of  Right, and that's it's i'll use the tools I need to alpha go is writing its own software because it's saying how do I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How do I win?  At uh at go. Yeah, you're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And yeah, because because we we heard this said at io where where you have a system that says here's the goal to  I think I think in the example, it's to correctly identify photos  and  We'll create them but but but they said the software could create its own tests basically its own software to do that  more efficiently and effectively

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That would beat itself the pay it's called the paperclip maximizer. It's the canonical thought experiment  I'm reading from the less wrong wiki, which I like the name of showing how an artificial general intelligence  Even one designed competently and without malice could ultimately destroy humanity  Uh, this was nick bostrom, uh proposed this in 2003  It uh  The goal is to maximize the number of paper clips in its collection if it has been constructed with roughly human level of general  Intelligence the agi might collect paper clips earn money to buy paper clips or begin to manufacture paper clips  More importantly, however, it would undergo an intelligence explosion  The hockey stick it would work to improve its own intelligence where intelligence is understood in the optimization power  The ability to maximize a reward utility function in this case the number of paper clips  So the agi would quickly realize oh collecting paper clips is not the goal is not really how I achieve my goal  I need to improve my intelligence  To help it to help accumulate more paper clips  And it would continue to improve and enhance and eventually it would consume the entire world making paper clips

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then it will go on to make a fake first lady

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is why audit and understanding how these  Looking at outcomes of ai is actually really important  Because we don't understand necessarily how computers are making the decisions or get to their decision

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But well, but eventually we're not going to be black boxes, right? That's what i'm saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why audit and outcomes are important. Yeah, and that  We tend to look a lot at intent  So that'll be kind of an interesting  Way to think about like legal issues and regulations and fun stuff like that  Hey, did any of you get the new google calendar yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, i'm bummed. No, I did not either  anybody in the chat room  Google's this is a massive  Update right new design  You can book conference rooms  See details, you know, I was thinking about this  I have this constant problem where where I'm like, okay, I'm going to go to the conference room

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Constant problem where where I was in europe last week. I get an appointment. I want to put it in new york time  On mobile you can't really find the damn time zone  And and and this is because it's a thing built by a global corporation having global meetings  Most of us aren't that way. Most of us just have our own clock that's with us and I want wherever I am  I wanted a four o'clock. I got the one doesn't think that way. I got the button

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What there's a button up and look in your calendar.google.com use new calendar  A fresh look upgrade now. Oh, there's a button  Where I don't see it show me the button. I don't see my button. I don't have a upper right hand corner. No  No, okay. I'm better than you guys. Haha. I got more paper clips  Updated design makes it even easier for you to manage your time. You can change  Information density is responsive to your screen or compact color set modern or classic. Okay, i'm going to go with the defaults  That's nice, it's pretty should I make a new appointment let's make a new appointment  I can't even figure out how oh there it is. I hate it when they do that red plus in the lower right hand corner  um  This looks similar  I don't know if it's that different find a time. Oh look it just finds a time in my calendar knowing what i've got to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can compare multiple calendars and stuff like that. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cool meetings  Yeah, it's really designed around google, isn't it? I mean, I don't have conference room  I don't have to book conference rooms. Do you have to book conference room stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, we we  Like i'm gonna work in the kitchen. No, i'm gonna work in the kitchen. I'm really happy not to have to book conference rooms

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, so all right. Yeah, it's very you know, that's that's part of the problem you you nailed it  The problem with a lot of google stuff is designed for googleers  Except for the cupcakes  No, tiny no tiny cupcakes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That feels kind of like somebody who like cupcakes thought that would be good googleers. So my new jobs. They're the new donuts. What jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My new job. I want to be a personality designer  I want to design personalities. You can design my personality help me. That's the thing. I need somebody to design mine  I'm a designer personalities google has a job description of personality designers  I I just kind of love that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh for your computer

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In refrigerators, you're going to put it everywhere  everywhere everywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I added that story because I feel like and samsung's falling into this and a lot of companies fall into this  When we decide to add intelligence to products in the home  We are dumb about it. So first we were like, oh we're going to add technology and smarts. That means a screen  Right now we're like that means a voice assistant, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  very good point  Because that's what we know  So what would you do? You see you like this barcode reader in a fridge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the barcode reader was just like getting it online because that is a huge that solves the problem  What I loved about it was this fridge collects like 122 pieces of data and only two of them  Are actually consumer facing the rest goes back to kenmore  Because they want to be able to fix things when they go wrong and have the right parts and that's actually is this yeah  Yeah, is this world changing? Are you going to notice it as a consumer?  Only if your fridge breaks and the person comes with the right part, but isn't that awesome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, because i've had my fridge break  And the problem with fridge breaking is you lose all your food and the longer it goes the worse it gets  And the guy comes and he says well, I think your compressor died  You know after tinkering with it because he didn't he didn't know and then I said well, do you have one?  No  That's not good news

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Computing to make it smart useful. Yeah better. Yeah, so yeah, that was all that was I agree with you  No, that's a very good announcement. I don't want to talk to my fridge  on the other hand if the fridge could buy itself read barcodes and know  What's in it and uh help me order like make a shopping list ahead of time  We're getting there though. A lot of my recipe programs  If I tell it what I have will make a recipe the next step would be for it to know what I have automatically  But I don't want to turn I don't want to turn my house into like a las vegas minibar  Where every time you remove something it goes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or when you remove it it goes to your google maps and tells you how long you have to watch

Transcript:  Here's a oh and go ahead. Oh go. I was just looking at the comments and someone was talking about making a grocery list  Um with a voice-activated fridge, which feels like a great idea, but in today's closed ecosystems. Yeah, it sucks

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had that amazon wand  Yeah, it's still stuck there on my fridge. I never use it  You know you scan the barcodes and you can make up a shopping list never use it  You know why I don't eat food with barcodes on it  In fact, that's leo's new diet  Fewer barcodes  You shouldn't eat foods with this is easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Q no way. Yeah, put a qr code on your cheek qr. Yeah  I think that's uh in preparation for the future

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mm-hmm. Yeah. I for one welcome my new masters

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although a couple of major security issues, uh, one is uh, the infinion chip that's used in a lot of devices to generate  Public keys public and private keys and crypto  Apparently has a major flaw. It's called the roca  flaw  and uh many  devices that like pin chips and  Uh, the worst thing is your tpm chip in your laptop  Um, this is you know, uh, these are the estonian id cards that I was all excited about  Uh, the problem is they're using these infinion chips, which are crackable and so your public key is uh is breakable  estonia's government  Warned that 750 000 digital ids. I i'm really glad I didn't get one issued since 2014 are vulnerable to attack  Because they use this infinion chip many tpm modules and pcs use the infinion chip  So if you were to put a barcode on your head with your public key  Which it seems on the face of it to be a very good idea  And you might you might regret it  You'd have to amend it  The roca does not affect software generated pgp keys. For instance, I checked all my uh,  pgp keys, uh, they were all generated by open gpg and no problem at all. There is a  roca  We talked about this in security now yesterday if you want the you know, high end details and there is a site to test  Whether your keys are flawed  um  See if I can  find that  So I can give you the it was down the other day a key chest dot net  key chest dot net slash roca  So you copy the public key into the clipboard?  And it will tell you if there's an issue it takes x509 certificates ssh keys  rsa pem keys  PGP public keys raw rsa modulus keys or smime keys actually have an smime cube. I should check in there too  The other vulnerabilities really even scarier, although steve talked me off the ledge on the crack attack  Key reinstallation attacks breaking wpa2 by force maddie van hoff  A security researcher discovered this attack  It is uh, it is so let's be I want to be really clear about this is steve schooled me yesterday on security now  This is really an attack  Not on base stations  But on devices that join base stations in other words iot devices are one of the  Places that would be vulnerable any laptop  Vulnerable any phone potentially vulnerable so that you don't necessarily need a patch for your wi-fi access point  Although if you have a mesh router a wi-fi access point that joins other wi-fi access points to share data  Then you would want to get an update euro is working on an update. It's out in beta right now  I imagine all the other mesh routers are doing the same  The real issue is that there are so many iot devices that will never be updated plus many  android devices  The estimate is 41 of all android devices  ironically ios and windows did  improperly implemented  uh the  Wpa2 protocol and are not vulnerable because they blew it  They didn't do it right  Maybe maybe they knew what they were doing. Uh, nevertheless apple is pushing out a fix for that  so um  God this was scary news when it came out on monday. I mean when I read it and I because we have told everybody for years  like 11 years  Uh, don't use web encryption on your wi-fi router. That's broken  But wpa2 especially if you use aes is really safe  That's what you should use everybody should turn it on protect yourself and your router and then to wake up monday morning and find out  No, actually, it's crackable  Is not good. You know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everything's crackable. It's hard to do. It's not an easy thing to do  It's not and you have to be  Because it's using the handshake. Yes, you've got to be near. Um  I will give you just because we've got it. Um, I reached out to a bunch of companies many linux

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Distros have already been updated  Actually, there was a little bit of a confluffle because free bsd knew about this months ago and they updated prematurely and everybody was mad  Because they broke the embargo, but they I think said quite credibly  This is a very long period of time we had to wait and we think people are going to be vulnerable  So we're going to fix it now  It was funny that your voice started cracking when you said everything's crackable

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everything's crackable. Am I am I less cracky now fixed it? Yes, I did

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is was this on your show you did the list of people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We did we we talked to so tomorrow morning you can find out or I can tell you a couple of the big ones here  Because you know why keep information close to the vest. I don't believe in that  Um, so nest is rolling out a patch. Yep. So all of you guys, um  Amazon is looking at it to eventually fix it. All the echoes will have to be patched. Absolutely. Yes  And things like your kindle, although, you know, I don't know if you really care about that data getting sent  You mentioned google so google wi-fi google home all of that stuff  Um, I did also reach out to june and I haven't heard back yet. So I don't know if my june oven is going to get patched

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, how much?  So so so someone could find out what you're cooking

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they'd be like, oh stacy  Imagine how creepy I would totally do this to like prank someone actually stand outside your house and get in there and be like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo, it looks like your chicken's birdie. I wouldn't mind i'd say thank you. Let me go get that  Psa, how are we? It would be worse if you said I noticed you're cooking cupcakes. You might want to take a walk tonight  That I would you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, that would be kind of a jerk move rigor alert

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, we should talk about me too, I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, and and I was I was I woke up in a different time zone and and just saw my feed just completely and horrifyingly  Filled with I think that's a good I know and respect don't you think it was a very good thing  It says we all know people it just shows you and you can't hide it. I mean, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's really important that uh people step forward. They don't have to say the details but just say no, this is this is  ubiquitous

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Some chose to tell horrifying stories and some chose not to just because I called you honey once

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Transcript:  And I guess I imagine there are many men who have them as well. I've seen men on my feet as well. Yes  But I think it was you know is as at this time when  People are blaming everything on social media and blaming everything on twitter and facebook. This is a good thing  This was a powerful powerful message. Yeah, that said people, you know and love and respect have been affected by this  And it's not something that's just happening in hollywood. It's not something that's just happening in the white house  it's something that's happening next door to you and  uh, I think that was I'll be eager to hear stacy's take but I think that it was a powerful way for people to  Say this is bigger than you know, it's closer than you know, and it's not just hollywood. It's not just the white house

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's everywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah  So that's a guy talking. I don't know stacy if you want to talk about it or not, but but it's stacy say something

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't want to talk about it. I  It's a thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's fine. Uh, but I think just just I think it's something we that happened this week that I think we would be remiss if  We didn't note it on the show that was it but well and the reason is I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We talked so much about all the bad things twitter does  But that is an example of how twitter and social media in general can also be a very powerful tool how people can use it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  importantly, yeah  Uh now at the same time twitter enables

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They must just have been joking  Till they come with a gun to investigate  Um, all right moving on new bill would allow hacking victims  To hack back  This is so horrible. Tom gray is republican of georgia  kyrsten sonema democrat of arizona  introduced  ACDC the ACDC act stands for active cyber defense certainty

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Act that's the best they could do  An io for an io

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah  The idea is if it would empower individuals and companies to use new defenses against cyber criminals if somebody hacks you  You could hack them back. It doesn't allow counterattacks to destroy anything other than their own stolen files  And if you're hacking back, you have to notify the FBI cyber investigative joint task force  This is such a bad idea  All right, I assume this is there's just no way this can become a law but I don't know I don't know

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me find the uh, the article. Oh, it's a city council member. That's who it was  So it's municipal. So that's actually kind of fun for like really truly local things  Although I would say citizens don't always understand the impact of their votes. No. Oh, this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This might work in at a at a local level better, right? I don't know

Transcript:  that's I mean i'm kind of like i've been thinking about it because i've  I mean, but then I think about like we just the big local drama for us  One is a giant zoning fight and those are always fun  But then there's also they installed speed humps on a road near me and holy cow  Everyone is very passionate  You know the people who live on the road are like yes speed humps  No one will run over my children and everyone else who drives on the road is like screw you all in your children  You have made our can be our commute so less and so much less convenient so it's kind of  Well, like I would like to see those played out in it out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It would take 51 of the votes to change it, right? I don't know if that's I don't know. I think we should try it  He says he doesn't expect to win. He his goal is just to  Tell people about liquid democracy and to uh to show off this party dot vote, which is open source and free  He says later on he'd like to create a political party that will support any candidate as long as they commit to making decisions  Based on what their citizens want  I think ah, this is the big problem, right?  Democracy isn't perfect  Representative democracy seems like a good idea until you get to the electoral college then you go well  What was that about democracy again? One man one vote one person one vote

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One person one hack one person one hack

Transcript:  So I really like that essential phone  I thought it was pretty I felt bad for andy rubin the creator of android that he had so many stumbles  So many problems couldn't get it out the door then they inadvertently spammed people with other people's addresses and  Now they're getting sued  By kisa  Misa you say kisa a wireless technology company backed by  nest founder tony fidel. Oh  They sued essential on monday saying well, so what happened was we engaged in conversations with essential  In which we divulged to them proprietary technology  about our wireless connectivity a a little  Trick that lets you uh transfer large files by holding two devices side by side

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is the uwb stuff the 60 gigahertz transfer. I guess so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you ever talk to them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I just I felt like we talked about this on essential. Let's see

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, keep talking all of which is protected under an nda non-disclosure agreement  The suit alleges that kisa deployed a team of 20 top engineers and scientists to educate essential  On its proprietary tech sending them thousands of confidential emails hundreds of confidential technical documents dozens of confidential  presentations after 10 months  Essential said nah, never mind. We're gonna use somebody else's chip  But kisa's saying they used our techniques in their phone techniques. They gleaned from our relationship despite the confidentiality  agreement one more blow  To essential but the good news is is only sold 5 000 phones. So  It's actually you know what the all the reviewers knocked the camera this is why I don't do  I hate to do reviews on pre-production stuff  And i'd far prefer to do reviews after a week or two  Essential pushed out a number of updates which fixed the camera. It actually all works really nicely now  It's a beautiful little phone. I wish it had a headphone jack  And I wish they sold more than 5 000 because that means there'll never be any other accessories or you know  That the little connector that they use I think that's the kisa technology is that connector?  Well, nobody's gonna do more of that  I am not saying that they're that kisa's right or essentials right on this but it's just one more thing  Just piling on one more  Problem for andy reubens essential. Do you think they'll do stacy the home hub that they promised?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, that is so true. That's what everybody hates apple. Yeah, and they far prefer to work with amazon amazon's easy  Uh amazon starting to tighten the screws a little bit according to the people I talked to but it's still way way  way easier and  apple is just apple is difficult because  They were trying to create a perfect ecosystem  They took longer they had some technical difficulties early on and then now they just  They want to control more of  the onboarding and access to the app so they want to kind of make it so you don't have to have all these apps on  your phone which  Is awesome for the consumer, but the guys making the stuff are kind of like  Uh, i'm sorry. What do I get out of this? Just selling a whole bunch of hardware because that's not going to work for me  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't know it's a matter of people should listen to stacey on iot or actually subscribe to your newsletter listen to the iot podcast  because this is a this is a  A sector in total flux and you don't want to invest a lot of money in the dead end  I did buy those sylvania those new sylvania bulbs with zigbee in them

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They did it my favorite part of that story  Hold on a second. My favorite part of that story is that another leading candidate for the  name  in the poll was glenn  Because it's this long-standing joke that everyone in  Gothenburg is named glenn

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Glenn's good. Oh those swedes but training mcdrain face one  They're the one and they're doing it the swedes

Transcript:  tweens and teens  But but well i'll use my son 22 as an example  Snapchat and youtube are equal because they're different services snapchat's how he communicates  When he sits down to watch tv, even if he's in the living room, it's youtube

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I guess my daughter doesn't have a phone yet  So all of her friends communicate via google school accounts. So they're on hangouts, but they but I guarantee you watch out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because snapchat's coming how could you not by the way since we're talking about youtube

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's give a plug to our friend. John green whose novel turtles all the way down  Just came out and got a spectacular review in the new york times. Oh nice  And I even I even I bought the audio version because it's it's an excellent by all accounts an excellent  Account of ocd and what it's like to have the thoughts that go on because john himself  um  Is stricken with this and that's what inspired this book. So a youtube friend of all of ours is he has a new book out  Yeah, I was like how does this relate to youtube? Is he my youtube friend?  Oh, well, well he and his brother hank they run vidcon. Oh, oh, yeah  they uh  Do incredible educational videos they do vlog brothers as soon as you say hank. I know they oh now the greens. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The greens. Yeah. Yeah john john and hank green. Oh good for him  Yeah, good for him as long as we're talking books. Can did you note that george sonders won the booker prize the man booker prize for  One of my favorite books lincoln and the bardo man if you haven't listened  It's the best audiobook ever the audible version of it has so many nick offerman and so many people reading it  And it's just I could listen to it again and again and again. It's wow. It's if you haven't read it yet  Did you get the new lacquer?  Not yet talked about last week. Yes, but that is on my list. Yeah, I get two credits in a week  on the  22nd and then I will get it. Hey, my pick is the google advanced protection program  It is now officially available to all  This is but not all will want it. It's we all know there's a big trade-off between uh security and convenience  And if you're willing to give up a lot of convenience  John podesta i'm looking at you  This is really strong security locks locks locks you down  You can only log into your google account with your login password and a physical security key and you have to have two  Because you have one that does bluetooth le i've ordered them  I I have a yuba key which does the usb authentication and then you need a bluetooth le one for ios devices  So i've ordered that that comes tomorrow

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This this isn't one of the ones with the hacked rsa chips, right? No. Well, you won't you know, the key is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do not generate the uh public key on the yuba key, but the good news is you don't this is google does all that  Uh externally  And it's and it's not using public key crypto. Anyway, it's using uh fido utf for the authentication  It also does other things for instance  Uh, it will turn off a lot of apps that use your gmail  So it may prove to be inconvenient. I may for instance find out that I can no longer access gmail with with the  Programs or actually what I do is I get my gmail to another service  I may not be able to do that third-party apps that want access to gmail or drive will no longer have permission  Which I get  Yeah. Oh this makes it secure this if if the dnc had used this  It would be secure, right?  Um, you'll only be able to use the chrome browser to access gmail or photos. You can't use another browser  At least for now, although it's conceivable they could add extensions for other

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can use the um, can you use the inbox app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, i'm sure you can use the inbox app, but you but uh, uh, for instance apple mail won't work context calendar won't work  Uh, you'll have to use gmail inbox. Yes or google calendar apps on ios  So this is quite a sacrifice on the other hand. This is ultimate security  It goes well beyond traditional two-step verification you need to sign into your account with a password and a physical key  Uh, in fact no other way will work anymore. So you can't say oh, I don't have my key. I lost my key  Can I use authenticator? No, can I use sms? No  And if you do lose your key and you need to get into your account, it's a much more stringent  A system of getting you back in because that's of course always been a weakness somebody pretending to be you  And it takes a while. I think it takes a week to get your account back to slow  Well, this is not something everybody will want to do you probably won't want to do it  You probably won't want to do it. But if you are jennifer lawrence  If you are mar a john podesta  if you you know, if if you're a celebrity or a journalist if you're you know, what if you have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A week is too long. You have to have they have to have some sort of rapid response team that can authenticate people

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a great sacrifice for the show. I don't think now we had heard maybe there was a charge for this  I don't think there is a charge  But I don't know yet because I can't go farther until I have my keys  So you have to have two keys. You have to have a usb key and a bluetooth key  Um, I had the usb key, but I ordered a bluetooth key. The one they recommend is out of stock  They recommend one called the fatan  Multipass multipass fido security key. I ended up getting uh one from wasco that does the same thing  It's as long as it's fido utf bluetooth le  That's fine  I'll have a report for you. Maybe not. Yeah next week.
