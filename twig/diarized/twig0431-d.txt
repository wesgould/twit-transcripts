Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are you at a pub where are you right Nick because you also you get the bar in the background

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, he's in a I mean the hotel bar because the Wi-Fi my room is not good. This is good. We're happy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It looks like it looks nice Jeff if you're getting we're getting a little buzzing on you  So if you let's just take care of some of the audio issues here real quickly just I think unplug and replug will probably do it  Oh, I know I had my phone on top of it. Oh, don't put your phone on top  You're using you're rocking as they as the kids will say you're rocking the pixel to excel is that right yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you know the last two phones. I've liked them and  The last pixel I ended up liking his time went on a lot more  I think this would be the same you know is it worth a thousand dollars to switch I'm no cuz I'm an insane person  I like the bigger  It's not completely bezel is but though I like better. I like the fact that it's just slightly bezel. Yeah slightly fizzled

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not too big

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know when you compare it to so this is the iPhone 10, which is the same roughly the same size screen  Let me unlock it  Face ID I've come to the conclusion is an interesting idea, but not 100%  This is the same size screen, but a smaller form factor. Yeah  But what I I have to say I've taken the case off of the iPhone 10 which is of course living  Very dangerously because a it's glass B. It's slippery and see it costs a phenomenal amount of money to fix  And I did not buy AppleCare Plus because I I don't know why I just didn't  But it is such a jewel and you know  This is stainless steel the the screen is easily the best screen on the market even besting the no date  And easily besting the pixel  That it really feels like a work of a jewelry in your hand  But iOS is not nearly as functional and by the way, I did a camera comparison just you know  I think I like the the pixels camera a lot better. Oh  Really? Well, I'll just show you I mean look this is this is not this is far from a scientific survey  But I'll let you pick I have two pictures  Let me turn motion off  So this is this is of our backyard on an overcast day lots of greenery  this is one and  This is two. I guess I don't even have to ask you which you prefer

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, this is the like about the eye doctor. This is the this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so this is the iPhone and this is a problem that the iPhone 10 is exhibited which is blowing out highlights  He does guys all blow. Yeah, you could barely see it  This is the pixel same exact. Yeah, I think the details better  I think the colors better and certainly the highlights the exposure is better

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Going to the camera sensor as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's automatic HDR and so Apple has two sensors and they do use both sensors for things like this  But Google has the weird split pixel, which it could do dual exposures even sought the same pixel  So it's a very tiny distance apart. They are able to do dual exposures and I think that in fact  And I think I'm not alone in this  I think that the the pixel to phone camera is better than the iPhone 10 camera  iPhone 10 is fine. It has some other nice little things  It does like the portrait lighting and stuff Google does do some portrait stuff, but I think I  It disappoints me because I like carrying I like the physical feel of carrying the iPhone 10  But I am less than enamored now. There's another another problem which people  The selfies are too good on the pic on the iPhone 10 there  I need better makeup  And a lot of people are complaining about this because there's just way too much. This is horrible. This is a nightmare  This is like I never looked so bad, but that's exactly what I look like. That's the problem  So you can't have a camera that's too good  This is the iPhone 10 because it's using that, you know that face recognition camera and  God, I hate it portrait mode. See it's blurred in the background. Although it's nice. It gave me a little halo  Which I I do appreciate so thank you iPhone for that  Anyway, I am not Jeff. You're not you have no screen burn in right? No, I don't  It is all I did  I don't if you put this side by side with the note 8 or the iPhone 10  It isn't as good a screen but stand that by itself. It's fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We also did something really stupid on the on the Android launcher on this phone  It has a on the main screen. It throws like a 10% screen over it a fog over it  Yeah, so I looked at the two phones. It's great. I said, oh my god. This is just awful  It wasn't the it wasn't the screen  It was it was the way they design the launcher and then the second problem was that then if you go and look at the at  Tray or or you you swipe right to get the Google News stuff  The now the background is there like 5%  It's a 95% screen and so I thought I had burn in because I'm stupid  And I didn't but it in either case. It's a bad aesthetic. It's a very bad aesthetic. It doesn't let any vibrancy stand out it  It's dumb

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I have to admit I set my back my screen background to pure black

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh that just saves you battery it looks much frankly it looks much better

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It stops all those sort of weird translucency things happening

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, if you if you want a screen to look good  Plus it also hides the fact that you've got these bezels because they're black as well. So it just looks like a contiguous  Yeah, yeah  Yeah, well that it doesn't help you at all with that  I'm another what I guess what I'm saying is despite all the negative  Information about the pixel 2xl. I've been very happy with it. I don't have a problem with the screen  I think it is the best Android out there now the note 8 screen is much better  But I think this is a really I like it. It's big. It's funny. It feels big in the hand compared to the iPhone 10

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But so so then so since I always have to return something about I'm about to cancel the the the pixel buds

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well interesting reviews pro and con. Yeah. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the one thing that bothers me most is I with my headsets  I go back and forth between my tablet my laptop and my phone  Oh, you can't do you have no you can you know?  It only but pairs to one at a time and then you have to go reset it and repair every damn time. That's  incredibly awful  And they didn't tell us that no they didn't tell us that's that's just that's just awful design which bothers me quite a bit  I'm guessing it's because it's the new  G instant easy pairing and they're gonna say it's easy to pair but it's only easy to pair if you have a pixel a  Be what I want to switch over to my so I got you have to put them back in the case  You have to reset according to the reviews you have to repair. Yeah, that's not good. What no way every time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Every time same. Yes, so put them back in the case. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You need a  Design degree to figure out how to get back in the case. They actually have a video

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They include they have a video to show you how to get in the case  Well, and this is the most negative review I read in gizmodo from Adam Clark Estes Google's pixel bugs aren't even close  to being good

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Said that the sound was really good. It's just some of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were just too hard to use. Yeah, and so this is gonna be  That's what the wired review said which puzzled me the wired loved the sound they said is the best sound they'd ever  Heard gizmodo said it was terrible. So part of it is it doesn't they rest on the ear. They don't actually yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't stand it. It's the trade-off. It's do you want isolation or not?  Yeah, I've got I've got Sennheiser ones in which are very isolating at the moment  And that works when I'm doing this if I'm cycling I want the low ice. That's true. So it's a trade-off. That's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although the the wired review I think was the wired review from  David Pierce  Said that they felt like they were falling out all the time, although they were quite secure, but they felt like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that what you're well, that's from I have with every single  pod  I've got to have stick him in or after something goes over the ears an option  Like how weird ears? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm the same mine. I can't use  Lots of the headphones I can't use because they won't they either fall out or they hurt if I wear them too long

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, my pixel buds come on Friday, I'm gonna I can't cancel them because I got a review them  I'll give you my impressions next week. But  Yeah, I think that this is Google's, you know when the pixel came out last year. Everybody said well  Google was rushed the normal two to year cycle of developing a phone. They only had ten months  So wait till the next one that's gonna be the one that really shows off Google's stuff  And I don't I think this is not exactly a great launch for the pixel to or the no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a better device than it is a launch. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean I was thinking about getting them  But if you have to put them back in the case reset them, isn't that ridiculous to pair with a new it's crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's not a Bluetooth requirement. I have my my Apple AirPods are paired to everything  Yeah  Well, I will get them and I can show you the translation and all that stuff and then you can

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Turn another state attorney general going after Google  Joe Josh Holly attorney general, Missouri, although interesting  Looks like Peter Thiel gave him  $300,000 for his campaign  What a coincidence we've seen this happen before  Apparently states attorneys general are easy to sway

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Docker was just a you know, a  Amuse-bouche for teal now. He's gonna go after Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The pockets yeah, but the point is that by

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Effectively we've seen this over and over again  You can effectively bribe state attorneys general by giving them campaign cash  And then they will do your bidding and go after who you want in this case in any trust investigation against Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can do it this guy over. I don't think this guy needed any bribing  Maybe not until I think he sees it as an obvious  Gambit to get publicity. I mean, he's clearly well  It is you know looking to move up. Yeah, it's a very good ride

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You get you get campaign money and you get notoriety. It's a it's a win-win all around, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  he's I mean the idea that Missouri is gonna lead some kind of  Regulatory charge against Google is his farcical, but it doesn't hurt him to launch the bid, right?  Why not then he looks like a good guy. He's he's cites the European Union a case

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Against Google for favoring their own product and search results of course the EU got a massive fine set a massive fine against Google  It his subpoena according to Bloomberg technology is the only publicly disclosed government antitrust probe against Google in the US since the FTC  Picked up then dropped remember that case in 2012. I think yeah 2013. Yeah  Now why why is teal why does teal have it in for Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think it's a good question because you'd think that he'd be a  Silicon Valley is eating itself right now you have  Teal went after Google Parker went after Facebook  Nasty about Facebook and then and then what's his name the investor also went after Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's his name did we talk about Sean Parker yeah, we did last week I think you did well  I can't remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your life you're talking about in a five I know but that's all right. That's all right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a it's part of that larger frightful five conversation that you hate so much

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff but I actually think you know even though Missouri  Go ahead Kevin

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's you know, it's it's the what's shaping what we read conversation. That's that that's that's what father was saying  He was he was reading into that there were a lot of people talking about that in the problems

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He did he did Jeff's favorite moral panic line though  God only knows what it's doing to our children

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sean Parker the mr. Rogers

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think of the children. I thought it was interesting. He was talking about it from the point of view of hacking  Attention and looking at the way that people  Respond and then basically hacking that in order to get people to share things and engage as much as possible

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He said we he said we did it we know we did it we intentionally did it we knew what we were doing right and  It worked and it works and we know that Facebook does this this is in the sure and the axios  everybody does

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Roger Mac to me also went after them. Oh Roger Mac. Well, Roger hates go on Rogers always  Google I put it on the run down  I can't find it out but on on on the Guardian how Facebook and Google threatened public health and democracy. Yeah  Rogers is saying this for years

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Record as regretting investing like he's sure he regret sure he wishes he got his yacht too. Yeah, he made a lot of money on Facebook  Yeah, and I'm sure Sean Parker. It's easy for Sean Parker to criticize what Facebook did now that he's a billionaire. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He says and this is not unfair if we're trying to this is a Roger Mac to me  Who by the way mostly now devotes time to his rock band moon Alice?  Bad yeah  If you're trying to maintain attention if you're fighting for a share of 24 hours in people's lives  The big issue is you have to keep escalating  That's true turns out the way you keep people's attention is either you scare them or you make them angry  That's a little reductionist, but it is true that stirring emotions is a great way to engage

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People you know, but but but okay  So so so Silicon Valley got accused of turning us all into robots and machines and took the humanity out  So now a company comes along that that has humanity in it and now it's accused of just of being terrible and  Emotions are part of relationships. Of course. It has emotions in it being excited being happy laughing  This is what the entirety of Hollywood does that's his emotions. Yeah, that's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I was gonna say that's fine as long as you don't use it with an intent to manipulate  But I guess all storytelling is ultimately manipulation

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and 60 minutes and you know the the entire media industry is built. I just love how media  goes after  Industry that does it better than it does. That's all well and I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's the point though Jeff and we talked about this last week is this is these tools are now weaponized go ahead Kevin  Did you cover James bridle sing previously yes, we did we spent a lot of time last week  Yeah, he's the guy who wrote the medium piece about these weird YouTube videos  That are essentially algorithmically generated to get revenue by and it worked and it worked and by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google's gonna is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, which is because because bridal wrote something  But you know bridal that you know, but it's entire over it is looking at the weird things that computers do  With that with technology and all so he's you know, he was he was primed to find that stuff  But but you know that that piece was genuinely surprising

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was we played some of those videos and they were god-awful it was fascinating because it's it's it's content that's produced  by computers for computers  So it's produced specifically to to tag into specific keywords  It has no there's no it doesn't matter what the content is. It just  T-shirts right search keywords, right?  weird iPhone covers bridal shows those or keep calm and stay racist or you know, it's just  Algorithms produce the content and then human beings consume it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the difference is these were aimed at children who are unmount being not being monitored while they're mashing the next button  little like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Preverbal job. Yeah, which is I have to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some of the cartoons we watched when I was a kid were pretty weird Roadrunner was creepy as hell  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was quite itchy and scratchy but

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All the BBC TV stuff when I was it was definitely never be born drugs it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Come on  Well, I think we can thank LSD for really making the culture  Definitely

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So computers are just recreating yeah, so Mac to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right wrote a opinion piece in the USA Today last actually in August a couple of months ago  He says I invested there's a more recent one. Is there more reason? Yeah, okay the Guardian. Yeah, okay  But it's the same thrust saying I invested early in Google and Facebook now, they terrify me  But I can I can remember Roger  talking about this  Years ago actually he's been talking about he's he's been a little disenchanted with Google for some definitely. Yeah, how much did he make I?  Don't know he remember he was he ran the elevation partners. That was Bono's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Venture fund. Yeah, they lost it. They lost a fortune on Forbes. I think well and remember palm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he was he took a lot of the money that they made and put it into palm right when it tanked

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah bad decision bad bad choice I just put the the new piece in the chat well we all make mistakes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the there is how Facebook same thing threatened public health and democracy  I don't know  This is I mean it seems like this is something that it's been an ongoing conversation for some months now on the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I do think it's interesting that I was gonna say about the Missouri guy  So maybe he's not gonna have an impact  But I think something that Google is probably paying attention to quite closely and probably Facebook is there is a kind of  leakage of EU arguments into the US there's there are a number of groups in the US that are  Deliberately taking the same tack as the EU. There's open markets which used to be part of I think the  New America Foundation or whatever and there was a controversy because they left and  Google may or may not have applied some pressure, but they're the rhetoric is exactly the same as it was in the EU  It's exactly the same as commissioners were using  These companies are too big. They have too much influence. They need to be regulated and I'm sure that there's lots of  Fear in Google and Facebook that some of that is going to have an impact on Congress

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For a moment, let's just visit Kevin Marks childhood  This is called finger bobs. Oh my  This is as weird  That's just wrong  For people listening there's a guy by the way wearing a very artsy scarf  Yeah, making puppets that fit onto his forefinger

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With gloves with gloves. I like the sort of 18th century kind of song style in the background to think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not sure I'd let him in a mall. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is weird, okay  Hello, I did want to mention one thing and and and and I'm gonna find some silver lining in this dark cloud somewhere another  So the Attorney General Missouri Attorney General goes after Google one day later  Our free press in the form of Bloomberg points out that he got three hundred thousand dollars from Peter Thiel  Increasingly, we're seeing this where corruption and there's god-awful amount of it going on is  outed almost right away and and this is of course why people you know, some certain people hate the free press  but why we should be very grateful that we have this free press because they're not I don't I think for the people are not  getting whether it's Harvey Weinstein or  you know a certain other people in the White House, they're not getting away with stuff like they used to right I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Agree, I hope that's the case. We don't know I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's stein I think but anyway, yeah, I don't know what it's right. Who cares Einstein would be  Einstein

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But but but but but pronounce the two things with different balance is it takes less than one news cycle

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for  There there must be and you probably cover this Matthew at CJR, but there must be  Armies now of investigative reporters just as soon as something happens going. All right, where's the money and that's great  I hope so. I love it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But also where Peter Thiel is involved there are  masses of people  Getting on the phone to tell you everything  Yes about some of this is leaking. Yeah  The most hated men right probably in Silicon Valley

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's also let's  Praise the FEC the Federal Election Commission and the and the and the and the transparency laws the sunshine laws in this country that require all  Campaign contributions at least to be publicly recorded if not limited in any way at least we know who give the money

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the good news. That's that's the same organization that everyone wants to regulate  Google and Facebook's election ads, right? Right? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You also have have they have not done right?  Well, and my argument with with Facebook especially and I said this in the show  Prior weeks is that they should be setting an entirely new aggressive standard in transparency  They should go beyond anyone's expectations and transparency and and that's their opportunity. They're still playing defense  They've got to play moral offense

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they're not they're not doing it actually to be fair Facebook has done has done pretty well  They've got a long way  Yeah, yeah, but they had an answer I was surprised they went as far as they did but by the way sometimes Bloomberg literally

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Follows the money. Here's our Secretary of the Treasury. I love this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ben Schwartz

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what do you do a variety of things?  Well, he would so you can buy it turns out who knew that you can buy  Sheets of two dollar bills. Yeah, and so he would actually just carry sometimes carry the sheets and when somebody asks for money  He he'd take a scissors and cut it and give it to them  And then he's legal tender he would say things that were weird  Intentionally hoping that these people would call the Secret Service on him saying he's passing bad money  Then he got him made up into a pad  So he could  All right, let's take a little break we're this is fun I'm having a good time  I hope you are too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pixel book I love my pixel book. Do you well, I'll tell you what's wrong with the pixel book  It's pretty good besides the price, which is absurd  Yeah, I was in dollars for a Chromebook is it's got everything's getting rid of bezels all of a sudden

Forget it. So  Long ago long ago when you couldn't do Google Play on on G suite  So I still have it on my other account  So I have to go to the other account to do Google Play and then Netflix  I got operated on the other account that worked. Okay, but then I can't do Amazon  Video because with Amazon video you got a rear load the Amazon app and it won't let you do that on the pixel book unless you  Go to developer mode  So it's not a full tablet. It's a mess. I'm sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just any apps Leo. I  Have in the past on other Chromebooks, you mean Android apps

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, cuz I thought the pixel book was better for that or that they'd gotten more integrated or pretty much the same as others

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just Chrome OS. Yeah, I think I use one or two apps that I use hip chat because that's a Android app  It's a little easier to use that on as an app

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually dislike going so if New York Times the choice of going to the app or going to  The web version

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All these apps launch in  Android sized page and then if you want to expand it says okay, but I'm have to restart if you want to go to full  screen it's like well  But I guess maybe they'd fix that well, I think from then on right it'll be full screen or I don't know  I it's like that's fresh. None of those happen with me. Yeah, but it's that's frustrating. So  So you're saying it's black because right now the Google Home Mini is 50 bucks  But at 20 bucks and this is gonna be on Black Friday

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, let me put the lights out 20 bucks

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and you get  30 $35 Chromecast  That's a really interesting  Because it talks to the Chromecast you could say hey, you know get a Chromecast  Yeah, if you don't already have one in every TV  Then you can put it  I know I mean I have lying around I bought some  Yeah  Yeah, yeah, that's right  18 years of Netflix coming to me free  After buying all this so $19.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it was five billion in like 15 minutes. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But this was but this was the point this was  The point of me doing this at conferences was it maybe listen really closely they had to make them fit in the space  So I would be I was taking notes, but I was also summarizing at the same time  Which meant I was really engaged with the speakers  This is my way of sort of psyching myself into not getting distracted by the internet where I'm this  And now you can just ramble on and on now I can just like write down whatever they're going  It's like it's not as good. I don't have to edit as much. So I may turn it back to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you turn off 280 characters? There's a chrome extension that won't reduce it funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's funny. Well, no, but this is my code  So I changed 140 to 280 in the code this morning because I was doing a conference and I can see that others did  And it didn't feel as I felt like I missed the constraint. It was weird. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's interesting how fast though all the clients seems seem to have  Updated to accommodate 280 characters. I use Dave whiners radio 3.io to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To well good for you. Do you know about it?  Yeah, I mean, yeah, I'm a big fan of Dave's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of old-school it lets you so basically  that I  Use this now to tweet the links that we're gonna cover on various shows  And so it tweets it it also but so he updated a 280 characters like within a day  So that's nice a lot of the clients have already I noticed I can't stand the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The icon for how full you are. Oh, I hate that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought for the first day

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  An actual number that goes down with I thought was a ticking clock and the Twitter was slow. It's just stupid

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Over design

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of Twitter. I think this is brand new  Twitter now says that it will pull verification from miscreant users. Oh, so they've decided now. It's not verification. It's a reward

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nuts this whole thing is a train wreck. It's a train wreck  But like let's face it verification from the beginning was a train wreck. It shouldn't die reward

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It should be a way of saying if they do it, right the blue check doesn't mean approval  Endorsement it merely means this person is who he says or she says they are  And now they're they're now confirmed that it's a reward by saying well, you know  You're not gonna get to keep it if we don't like you. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mean, unfortunately there they're lying in the bed  They made like that somebody made the decision in the beginning that it was gonna be totally opaque and some people were going to  Get it and other people weren't because they were inefficient. You're right. Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But also they added features that they basically had a bad model of how their system worked  Which was there were important people in their replets and the important people get to be verified and they get the tools  The pledge don't and what actually happens on Twitter is that if you say something interesting it takes off and suddenly you're in  Sorry, you're in hell because  Everything is replying to you  You the system is falling apart and you don't have the tools they built people who have that problem because you're verified  So, you know  if you have it if you're like if you have a tweet that gets retweeted a thousand times and that  Auto-verifies you that would be a good thing or you know, they should separate the two things

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is like is this the person should give you the tools forget about the parody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or should they or is it you know, or can we have tools that restrict us restrict my replies in useful ways and  You know, they basically  Failed at that for so many years. It's not funny. Do they still have tools where I only hear tweets from verified

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, see if that meant you're only gonna hear tweets from people who have taken the time to verify that they're real  I would do it but if it's it's basically saying only people we've decided to reward you've decided for whatever  Unknown reasons

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook did the same thing did they?  Yeah, so Facebook reached out to me Jesus years ago and said would you like to be verified?  I didn't even know they had verification

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  can't you make a good case that if a guy's a Nazi and  Tweeting from his account that a verification is useful because you know that this is not a spoofed account

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's well that was Twitter's argument when they when they verified whoever it was that people got upset about was they were  Verifying that it was him the real Nazi who runs the real

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Especially now of all times when they have all these spoof accounts from that  We don't know who's real and who's not the problem is they've been trying to do two things

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One is has been you're actually who you say you are and the other is we choose who gets the blue check  And you don't know why and you can't have both those two those two things don't work together  So they've been kind of  Sucking and now they're trying to blow you can't do both of them at the same time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I've just learned something today. You can't suck and blow at the same time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a Shakespearean

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wind off sock no wind off blow not both  Let's take a break, you know, let's take a break  Hold on Kevin on that note. Well, hold on. Oh, yeah winds that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good good good  Bloomberg is launching speaking of Twitter a Twitter based news network in December  What  What so I guess okay  The  Project was announced in May Goldman Sachs infinity TD always got advertisers TD Ameritrade  CA Technologies AT&T and CME group each contributing up to three million dollars to the partnership  50 reporters will be dedicated to the site  It's a it's a Twitter feed  That's bizarre

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not sure  It's been you know a ticker-taper supplier for ages so feeling I'd spread them maps to their core competency  The question is are you gonna trade on it? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You think it'll be more finance focused that makes sense. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're the news ticker and the news ticker with back yeah back up links and I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it to be really useful you would have to have a Twitter account where you only followed it  Because otherwise you're gonna people's sandwiches and stuff mixed in with your stuff  Notifications in yeah, I'm sure you made this work. Oh, yeah notifications. Can you do granular notifications and say just notify me when Bloomberg tweets?  I don't yes, you can can you  Specific account that's like the old track feature which it's still there. No, it's still there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have to dig for it, but you can make it notify you when certain people tweet. Ah, all right  I think I'm hoping I have a tool for this as well, which you can run on Android  But it's actually in in the Twitter app really buried now. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think Bloomberg's hoping that you'll leave the player kind of on in your Twitter or your  Stream and so you'll be reading tweets and it'll be in the background kind of like people keep  You know CNN on in the background or it's kind of amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  how  Twitter people are trying to bend Twitter  To all sorts of different things and yet it seems to bend quite it's quite malleable

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well and Twitter is trying to be bent right they're trying to bend right well, they want and they've been right  So that's why they've been approaching live video  Companies to do that sort of thing. Yeah trying to keep people on the platform longer

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see Android distribution numbers for November almost  zero change  To Oreo doesn't seem to be  It's a tiny sliver. It's been out for three months Android 8.1  and the the growth in November point three percent  It was point two percent in October. So hey, that's a big jump  But as you can see from this tiny bar chart  Oreo still represents a fraction of the overall use of  Android what's the biggest slice marshmallow?  Then lollipop then new get and KitKat, but there's still a significant number of gingerbread  Ice-cream sandwich users. They're still out there  God  There's there a slice as big as Oreo actually Oreo  In fact, they're bigger more people you oh now there's that's the headline  More people are using gingerbread Android 2.3 then then the latest version Oreo Android 8.0  That's depressing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But this I mean there's an  They mitigated that to some extent because there's the compatibility library. Yeah, it's still depressing. Well, although it underscores my

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My inclination is say if you're gonna get an Android phone get a pixel phone  Yeah, because you're gonna get you're always gonna be up to date and you will get updated automatically  That's what I like the best about having an access if you have the budget  Yeah, if you have the budget is there a good inexpensive phone that updates regularly?  I guess I'll have to watch all about Android ask them but

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OnePlus was pretty good, but there's some scary

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so one plus previously was attacked because they had a  a  Demon on there that would launch that would automatically phone home with information about you  And they didn't give a way to get rid of it now  It looks like they left the back door on their phones  Engineer mode it's Qualcomm testing  Nice that lets you get this get root-level access to the phone without unlocking the bootloader  Now, of course the bad guy'd have to have probably have to have physical access to your phone  But having done so they could completely own it without you knowing  One plus says they're looking into it and  They'll probably I imagine push a software update that can turn off engineer mode  Let's see, here's the updates from engadget one plus has issued a statement that recaps the nature of engineer mode its threat  Yes, you do need physical access. It's promising to remove it through a future over-the-air update  Qualcomm has looked into engineer mode and says hey, that's not us  There's some Qualcomm code in there, but somebody else wrote it which kind of makes me think one plus took the engineer mode app and  the source code and modified it  After in-depth investigation says Qualcomm we've determined the engineer mode app in question was not authored by Qualcomm  It no longer resembles the original code we provided it was based upon a similarly named testing app that was limited to displaying device information  so  Now remember one plus is a Chinese company. I mean, I think these are the kinds of  Revelations that are that are damaging to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we know that Chinese companies routinely install stuff like that, right? I mean, it's a no that's a known fact

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's yeah, it's it's the classic god mode problem  It's the oh I will build a thing that lets me have complete access to everything right and then you  Secure it back and this is what you know or forget to take it off gung-ho startups do and  A big chunk of China is built on layers of grung-ho startups. We do that kind of thing at that level  It's like three levels down from the from the the uber god mode, but then you do need physical access

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean if you have physical access to someone's phone, you can do almost anything. It's not just that's a good point

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a very good point. There's nothing to think a panic about anyway  The new one plus does come out in 16 hours tomorrow  11 a.m. In Brooklyn 11 a.m. Eastern the one plus 5  T and we're hoping to get a review unit and look at it  We might be able to see it as soon as Saturday on the new screensavers if they're nice photos  Yeah, I really liked I had the first one plus I think the second  One plus two I've had a number of them and I loved him at the original one plus had amazing battery life  It was a very good phone for its time cameras were not ever as good as the top line Sam so that's true  And I don't know it depends wait to how you use the phone  I I pay a lot of attention to the camera, but I notice I don't really use the camera that often  But when you do it's really nice to have a decent camera in your pocket  a  new new app  Called lies  By Michael Saman he was 17 years old when he went to work for Facebook  He'd already launched five apps at the age of 17  He got a full-time engineering gig as the social networks go to teen over the past three years  He helped Facebook try to crack the middle school market with apps like to like the now defunct life stage  This is Josh Constein writing in TechCrunch in August. He switched sides. He went to work for Google  Michael Saman's latest now. He's 21 is a trivia game called lies  Where you try to guess the one true fact about a friend among a ray of fibs  So we've seen these games before where you have you know two lies and a truth and you have to figure out which one  Yeah, the slice that's different that makes it interesting is it's about your friends. I

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  like that and I apparently  You can you can you you need to supply the lies?  In lies you upload your contacts  Then you take a tinder style profile quiz where you swipe yes or no about questions about yourself  Then you're given four choice questions about friends with the goal of correctly guessing which one is true. I  Think this is gonna do well  21 years old Wow  Yeah, he's old now. Yeah, he's old hat. He's slowing down. He said it took a whole two weekends to build the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was at a this media conference in Munich and there was a kid  Involved in the panel that I was on it was 14  from Ireland and he's  Developed taught himself to code and and has developed five or six apps already the one he was talking about  Was I'm trying to remember the name of it, but it was like a tinder for media for news so you swipe  Left on stories that you aren't interested in and it gradually learns  What you're interested in interesting kid

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, this is where we're headed. We had  America one of America's top young scientists  on  The new screensavers on Saturday get angely row.

Transcript:  That's true. I can sell a Rubik's Cube and I was really nice. That's actually impressive. That's the right timing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's really impressed. Of course now kids do it. They're like seeing how fast and look at you now  Yeah, right look what happened to you you're in a bar in the Netherlands  Yeah, everybody wants you the chat room saying please show us the rest of the rest of the bar  Here we go.

Transcript:  So it's very clean in other words

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see what else here Volvo's parent company go ahead. I'm sorry Matthew

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just wondered if you saw I didn't see this in the in the lineup. Did you see the Amazon did a test of its?  cashier list store  I think Bloomberg wrote about it. They were testing the facial recognition. So obviously the store  Recognizes you when you buy things or when you take things off the shelf and then it builds your account automatically  So obviously it has to recognize who you are. So a bunch of employees  Dressed up as Pikachu  so they  Bright yellow Pikachu costumes and you know, whether they they got caught  And it had no problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Didn't fool it  That sounds a little bit like a forget about that  Maybe a little bit of a stage publicity study a little these are called the Amazon go stores and they've been they had one in Seattle  I haven't have you ever anybody ever been to one?  No, so you walk in it knows who you are. You pick up what you want and you leave. That's it  I don't know if you have to check in with a mobile app or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now I think you have to be logged in somehow

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean my I'm always logged in on my Amazon app aren't I I mean  Yeah, it's probably beaconing all the time as I as I wander around who God only knows what it's sending back to the home office  Jeff knows where you are at all times. Yeah, of course he does Bezos not Jarvis  So I thought it was just a test. So there it sounds like they're actually planning

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To know they're close to rolling out. They're starting to hire like actual retail employees

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you work at Whole Foods right now, you got to be terrified

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we talked about this before there's a whole generation of you know, sort of  Early entry jobs like cashier type jobs. They're just gonna go away eventually

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This Bloomberg story does point out that a Whole Foods store  Which is much is like 1800 square feet with a lot more items would be a little bit harder  Yeah make work right now  Right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, the actually Whole Foods are bigger the store the ghost or is 1800 square feet  But the office is huge. Yeah much bigger. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Most of them very very big. Yeah, it's an 1800 square foot. Whole Foods would be tiny

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, let me correct myself on that. You ready for self-driving trucks because everybody's doing them  Elon Musk, I think is it today or tomorrow is gonna show off theirs  Yep, the Tesla and  Apparently  There there are already Robo trucks delivering refrigerators  We've got to move these microwave ovens nice, you know money for nothing and my truck for free  The startup embark has been hauling Frigidares up on the I-10  From El Paso to Palm Springs  There is a human rider in the cab  To monitor but the ultimate goal is to get rid of the human  So this has been going on all this time. Nobody even knew I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just want to grab a clip of you saying the ultimate goal is to get rid of the human

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The ultimate goal is to get rid of the human well  Actually, it would probably say it exactly as I did write it in a natural would sounding  Very good at that almost human voice that part sees humans are inefficient. Yeah  Our goal is to get rid of the human  We'll look forward to finding new work Volvo is just a parent company just bought a flying car startup  Now if you have like was working on one, too. Yeah, but these have to be autonomous  There's no way I'm gonna trust a human to pilot a flying car  He's the lines in the road or anything and they have to have intervehicle communication and they have to you know, I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just Tesla's talking about a sort of vertical takeoff and landing  Kind of vehicle. Yeah, they would sort of pick you up and deposit you on rooftops and whatnot. Yeah, this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is Tara Fuji is TF X it actually looks really cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it looks like I think Boeing was working on one too weren't they Boeing or one of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  plane companies so this is a VTOL or a vertical takeoff and  Landing vehicle looks just like a car but it's got helicopter dual helicopter rotors on it  Which I think they would tilt right? So, yeah  Electric powered and I have to think I have to I pray autonomous  Because otherwise it's just not gonna it's just not gonna work but I'm sure like just as with trucks

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure there's gonna or cabs  I think there's gonna be a human being in there for at least a few years just to sit there  Yeah to to make people feel comfortable. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Encryptions in the news again, of course after you know, I think it's now weekly. We're gonna have  mass shootings in the United States  Do people in Canada and the UK just shake their head are they baffled are they what yes  Yes, of course, I mean we this is what's interesting we had one  Yesterday in Northern California that barely made the news because he only killed five people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Only because of lockdown  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he was trying to get into a school and thank God the administrators were gunshots  Ran to the doors and locked him and he didn't get in because it could have been worse than anything  An elementary school and it but what's interesting is it's so commonplace now in the US it wasn't even that biggest story

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and there's been half a dozen since Las Vegas, which wasn't that long ago. It just just when you think  Well, this is the worst  You know, it just keeps coming. They just keep happening. It's so sad

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and  of course in every case the shooter will have a smartphone and  In every case the Department of Justice will want to get in and in most cases it will be encrypted and locked  so  It's ancient history now, but the Texas shooting of a couple of weeks ago  There is an iPhone  And you know deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein said  When you shoot dozens of innocent American citizens  We want law enforcement to investigate your communications and stored data. There are things you need to know  He said as a matter of fact this might you might want to argue with  No reasonable person questions our right to access the phone  But the company that built it and I think we know now it's Apple claims that it purposely designed the operating system  So the company cannot open the phone even with the order from a federal judge  In addition to costing a great deal of time and money. This is surely going to cost lives. I  Mean of course I  You know if you in in a vacuum you would say well, yeah  Law enforcement should be able to get into that phone in a vacuum  The problem is if it now this is an interesting thing that Steve Gibson said yesterday on security now that might change the conversation  What we've always said is well if there's a backdoor if there's a key to get into it  then what's to stop China or Russia or  Any other country from saying to Apple? Okay? Well, we want to get in these phones too. And so that's problem number one  It's not just the Department of Justice in the United States that would then have access  There's also the larger issue of if you do have a backdoor how you know  We've seen the NSA the CIA and the FBI all be hacked and exploits escape  How long can you keep that a secret? But Steve Gibson said an interesting thing?  He said he believes and I don't know if anybody else has said this or if it's confirmed  That it is possible for Apple to unlock just one phone without providing the means to unlock any other phone that every phone has a  dedicated encryption key  That could be exfiltrated by the company  That would be interesting if that's the case

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really? Because I thought the argument was that you couldn't do that and so that by providing it for one phone  They would effectively just give everybody a key

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't obviate the first argument, which is well if you if you let it be known that you can do that. Here comes China  But it does kind of soften the second argument. It doesn't in fact make all of our phones more at risk  So I've never heard anybody else say this and I don't I don't know if this is the case but Steve says  He it's his understanding and belief that it is possible to do  Unlock and any individual iPhone Apple could mean Steve has forgotten more about this  I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I would certainly take his  Take his word for it. Yeah, I mean they don't have the means today

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, but they could they could have the means and they could actually say  They could have the means and they could actually say  I think this is what he's implying  They could push out an update to any phone that would make that possible in the next filtrate

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's possible that apple doesn't want to admit that they can write that because they would much rather not  Right. So if you say we can't do it without providing it for every phone, right then you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you could do a selective operating system update in effect that is dedicated just to that phone  I'm sure apple wouldn't want to push a system wide operating system update that would make that possible  Because they don't want to get subpoenas from other right places

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the thing once you make it obvious that you can right then everyone is going to start asking you to do it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that I would understand but one of the arguments we always give is well  You know that's going to make all of our phones more vulnerable to bad guys, and I don't know if that's the case  so  You know what? I need to get a have a fuller conversation with steve about that  And maybe he can give me some links  Something to be aware of anyway  um  Of course and we talked about this a little bit yesterday, too  Uh, and your antivirus could be the it could be the biggest hole in your computer system  There's a new flaw called av gator gator not as an alligator but gator as an opening a gate  That takes advantage of your antivirus and many are susceptible to this to get root access to the operating system

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh boy, and actually antivirus like hackers have talked  For a long time about how antivirus is one of the best roots because it gets root access to your system  That's how it protects you from viruses. Exactly. So it's the best possible  introduction

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know medium for a virus and speaking of hacking this one really scared me, uh, the department of homeland security  Was able to hack the new boeing 757 within 48 hours  with a remote  non-cooperative penetration

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nice. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll avoid the harvey weinstein. That's some good work

This is a  older boeing 757 commercial plane purchased by  The dhs for this testing  And the response from experts was oh we've known about that for years

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's reassuring but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In 20 in march of this year at a technical exchange meeting the dhs told seven  airline pilot captains from america and delta  About it  The quote is all seven of them broke their jaw hitting the table when they said  You guys have known about this for years and haven't bothered to let us know because we depend on this stuff to be absolutely  the bible

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow seems like the kind of thing you might want to mention. Yeah  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh wow  I stood so let's see. This is robert hickie aviation program manager within the cyber security division  Of the department of homeland security science and technology directorate. I'm glad we have a science and technology directorate  Sounds a little kafka-esque, but i'm glad we have it  Uh, he says I didn't have anybody touching the airplane. I didn't have an insider threat  I stood off using the typical stuff that could get through security. We were able to establish a presence on the systems of that aircraft  Using rf  And uh, I guess they were what they were able to modify the avionics  They were I don't know. I don't know what exactly they did. They don't say maybe they don't want to say what they could do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They probably shouldn't go into too much detail. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The airlines say it's too expensive to fix  The cost of even more reassuring yeah the cost of changing one line of code on a piece of avionics equipment is  One million dollars and takes a year to implement  Wow, I guess you got to do it right the first time

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, just uh, you know now, you know, so now you know the rest of the story  Senators are now pushing for i'm curious what you guys think of this, uh dumping social security numbers for identification  ever since the equifax hack  um  The senate commerce committee  Had testimony from marissa meyer  Uh, verizon's privacy officer karen zacharra  Zacharia  The both the current and former ceos of equifax  I think bruschneier. This is when bruschneier testified at as as well  They brought up the brazilian system, which is a  System of citizen ids through public key crypto digital certificates  Certificate lasts no more than three years at most  It can be used to issue a digital signature much like a written signature  And very importantly unlike social security numbers or fingerprints it can be the identity accounts can be revoked  And reissued is easily through a national established protocol. I should ask jeff to check this out when he was on his way to brunisaries  The problem is that as soon as you do that in the united states and I don't know if this is an issue in other countries  people scream in horror national identity card  And the conversation immediately ends it is it is it is a hot topic a hot button  In the u.s. Congress, you can't have a national ID card  Nothing to say, okay

You can go back to bed  Thank you for getting up and staying with us. I appreciate it  I want to talk about our sponsor 23andme and then we'll get our picks  Of the week out of the way 23andme is a fabulous  personal genetic  service  That helps you understand what your 23 pairs of chromosomes  Tell you your dna tells you about yourself about your family  It is if nothing else, it's fun  I'm gonna log into my 23andme account because I want to show you all the things I know about myself  I did it a long time ago  I like it because it was easy there. You don't have to go to a clinic to get blood draw  You just spit into a little vial they send you in a kit you mail it back within six to eight weeks  You're going to get your report and the nice thing the report is constantly being updated. So there's always  new information  Since for instance, you know i'm getting messages from people who think they're related to me  That's the dna relatives thing and it's kind of cool you have to give permission obviously and so do they it's not like  But but it will help you it's a relative finder will help you find  relatives  And in fact the relative finder found for me  Somebody who's definitely a cousin because his last name is the same as my grandma's maiden name  So that's cool. Anthony jacobi  He and I share three point four four percent of our uh of our dna  So I could connect with him if I wanted to that's kind of kind of fun  Be careful though. This can also reveal information that maybe you don't want it revealed  Who was it sent me a note saying? Yeah, I found out that my sister wasn't really my sister  Okay, you know  That's not a negative. I think it's kind of interesting to learn this stuff  You could find out also in the reports things like where your family comes from  Uh 10 000 years 100 000 years. This is cool. This is for instance  Here's the here's the maternal haplogroup and it shows the migration  Of my mother's dna line starting 180 000 years ago in africa  Moving north into the middle east 59 000 years ago  Up north from there and then finally into europe 47 000 years ago. That is so cool  You can find out how much neanderthal. This is an example of something that's new  Uh only recently have they realized that the homo sapiens has  Neanderthal ancestry they didn't for a long time  They didn't think that there was any interbreeding  But after they did the the neanderthal genome a few years ago, they were able to show that it's true. In fact  I have 265 neanderthal variants on my dna  Which puts me in seventh place  My family and friends  You get all the scientific details too, so this is a great gift for uh, somebody interested in genetics you can  They have lots of information about this and since genetics is the next big frontier  I think it's a great thing for young people to learn about  I think this would be a fun thing to do for the family and right now they have a special thanksgiving deal, which is fantastic  49 dollars per kit when you buy two or more so get the whole family  Uh involved in 23andme  23andme.com slash twit. That's the number two three a-n-d-m-e.com  slash twit and uh, and then when your family gets together  You know give it to them on thanksgiving and when they get back together for the christmas holiday break, you can all talk about your dna  It's really fun  You can also uh, you can also find out a lot more including traits  things like you know  Hairy backs and waxy ears and things like that. It's chin clefts  My height may be influenced by a neanderthal variant in the lpp gene did you I didn't know that really  23andme.com slash twit  Fascinating a lot of fun and a great way to learn about genetics for the whole family 23andme.com  dot com  Slash twit we can wrap things up  Matthew ingram  great to have you from uh  The new your new job the columbia journalism report cjr  Uh, is that can I read that online? Do I have to subscribe to that? What is the deal with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, you can read it online  Uh certain things that were that are in the magazine don't show up until after  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's uh cjr.org  Yeah, and uh, I I actually love it because i'm reading stuff all the time in it because it's it's really about our our trade here  Which is fascinating?  And lots of good news. Yeah, good interesting news in here. So i'm thrilled that you're there. It's great. Congratulations  Me too. Do you have a pick of the week for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I wanted to mention you probably talked about this on other shows I have not the new firefox browser

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, I just installed quantum i've been using it and what's interesting  People might not have noticed because i'm on a microsoft surface and it looks so much like edge  They might have thought I was using edge

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what's new in quantum one thing I really noticed it's it's fast  Uh, I haven't done a lot of research into the supposedly it's a lot lighter in terms of data usage as well  So ram and so on but it's definitely fast  Uh loading fast switching tabs. Um, I don't know if you open  Routinely like 50 to 100 tabs, but I do and chrome can really get bogged down  Because each tab is a separate memory process. And so you find yourself  Basically running out of ram, uh, I could open fewer tabs  But i'm hoping that firefox will be able to do that better and sort of keep the speed up and so far  It's a it's a nice browser certainly speed wise i'm impressed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is uh, it is you know, it has the plugins I need i'm a big chrome user  But you're right chrome is a pig and also a battery hog on some platforms  And so i've been playing with this and I really like it  And it supports the the at least two extensions. I really need which were last pass and you block origin the ad blocker  But there's a there's a lot more  Uh built into it and you can see all the add-ons in the add-on store and they have I would say  parity  Probably with uh with chrome in terms of extensions. I think they're close. Yeah. Yeah  There might be some things that they don't have the people want but so you so is it the same standard?  Is it can like a chrome extension easily be ported over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I mean basically  It used to be extensions were binaries and weird now the javascript and you just need to wrap them slightly differently  And you need to run them on both. So nice. They've they've done the worst converging. Okay, so as people more and more people and it's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead. It's interesting that firefox. Uh, you can use google as your default search engine  Again, that's a big change. Yeah  Yeah, you couldn't before because they did that big deal with yahoo  um, but they've apparently walked away from that deal and uh,  Very smart, um before it was up like it was a five-year deal, but they walked away before  The deal was up. So now they're back with google

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice well, i'm gonna try it out for a while my firefox quantum. It's firefox 57  free download, uh from firefox, uh, dot com  And uh, i'll tell you one thing. It looks nice. It really is and it does. Yeah, it feels faster  so  Yeah, very nice  How about you mr kevin marks a pick for us

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've got a couple of things. I mean  I'll go with the less obvious one first, which is shortcut  so shortcut, um  Is a tool that was built by a bunch of people I know for this american life  And then what they want to do is get people to share parts of their show. Oh, and we need this  Yeah, no, you like this, um, but it needs transcripts. This is your challenge  You have to have transcripts for this to work. So basically you select some text in the transcript and it constructs  a little movie for you to share on social media

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nice. Oh my gosh  That's super handy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So and now it's open source, which is fantastic, which means you can install it on your own podcast network  But if you have a have a great idea, yeah leo  but  Um, so if you if you go to the second link I put in there  shortcut this american life.org  Um, you can pick the show you can select some text and it constructs this nice little movie from it  Wow  So select some text on that page

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is the transcript  So that's one thing we'd have to have a transcript and then it constructs the video for you  Yeah, it matches the transcript and plays. Oh and it even plays the  The text it's audio only so it's not a it's not a gif of the video because we do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's not so this is this it's a slightly  You know, it's close to your use case if you work on this and talk to the guys, but um,  The point is you it then generates the interest. This is the interesting for me is that sharing audio clips is quite hard  Sharing video clips is easy. So they make a video clip from your audio clip and that's what you share  it's always been a challenge for us

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because  Uh, well and having the text is also good because this could be on a facebook page or a twitter  Feed and people wouldn't have to turn on the audio or anything. They can read it. Yeah  Uh, this has always been an issue for us

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this was you know, they worked with the use case that they had which was this american life actually transcribes all their shows and  They did the work to sync them up  And so which means you can do this but the challenge is for other broadcasters  You've got to do the transcription work. But once you do that, I wish it's nice ability to share it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wish more of them had transcripts  I I find I don't have time to listen to a lot of the podcasts that i'd like to listen to but I  I would read them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know we paid for transcripts for a few of the shows for a long time and no we  Our analytics told us nobody ever looked at them  Really? So we just recently stopped of course. It's expensive to get good transcripts is expensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it is expensive and synchronization is also hard. I mean it that seems like a throw machine learning out of problem to me, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  Well, you've seen you've seen the machine transcripts on youtube and stuff. They're not very they're terrible. They're not very good  But that's a starting point generation

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They haven't thrown the the sort of recurrent neural networks resources mindset, right so  I can see that coming. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, I like it field train  Dot com  And you could find out more about that. You've got an indie webcam coming up in austin

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Austin first one in austin, which is great because austin is a great place to go for conferences  It's coming up in december, which I think is still comfortable there  Oh, i'll send it nice year round.
