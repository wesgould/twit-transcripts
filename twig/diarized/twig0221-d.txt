The show that covers really anything we feel like  covering because we've got a brilliant panel here, myself excluded. And if they want to talk about  it, we'll talk about it starting with Jeff Jarvis over here, professor of journalism,  City University of New York with his cute cat in hand. He's on Google Plus as Jeff Jarvis,  of course, and his book Public Parts is on Amazon along with Gutenberg the Geek. He's Amazon single.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gutenberg the Geek now available in Chinese, German, Italian and Audible. How do you say geek

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in Chinese? Do you know? I have no idea what it is. It's nerd in German. It translated back to geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I translated the cover, translated back to geek. But the Germans didn't like that. And so it was  Gutenberg der Nerde. And the Italian was Gutenberg il geek. Il geek. Il geek. Il geek Corino. I love

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Italians. That's Gina Trapani speaking Italians. She is our favorite Italian. She's our favorite  Italian from thinkup.com where they are now raising. How is the fundraising going over there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's going great. It's going great. Our goal was a thousand subscribers. We're counting or  measuring our success in people rather than money. And we're in the high eight hundreds, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Eight, seven, three. Come on, people. Come on. By the end of the show. Come on, give the address,  Gina. By the end of the show, we got to hit a thousand. Are you geeks or are you mice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  127 more people shouldn't be too hard to get. We're in good shape. We're in good shape. And I'm sure  that's in no small part of the Twitter. And I'm wearing my fangirl gear. I was up at Google this  weekend. Oh, which Google were you up at? I was at the Mountain View, the Plex, the canonical  Google Plex. Yeah, I was at, they had the mentor summit for Google Summer of Code, which is an  open source mentoring program. I was a mentor this summer. I had a great student. And then they  have a conference for the mentors. So I got to spend the weekend and visit the store. And I saw  the Android statues. I posted a picture on my Google+. So it was a lot of fun. I was totally  geeked out about it. I hadn't really spent time. I had never done the campus tour or been in the  store. So it was really, it was fun to be there. Is it anything like the movie The Internship? Well,  it's funny because I really recently saw The Internship and they shot a lot of it in building  43, which is the building with the steps. So I like walked in there and was like, oh, yeah,  this is where the movie is. I mean, it's a lot brighter kind of in the movie. But I got to see,  there was like a plastic bin of those paddles, the yes, no, you know, one side is red. And, you know,  that whole outside area where they're sitting outside and the Google Bikes, of course, the  multicolored bikes, which is kind of sit around campus. So yeah, it did feel a little bit like it  was the movie, except, you know, it was a little overcast at times. Yeah, it wasn't it wasn't as  perfectly lit, of course, as the movie. But it was yeah, it was really, it was a really fun  weekend. I mean, you know, it's an office park. I think I built up in my head, you know, after all  the articles that you read about how amazing it is to work work there. I mean, you know, there's  lots of primary colors, but you know, it's an office park. And yes, there's a slide in one  building from the second floor to the first floor. And there are like random Burning Man, you know,  shark fins, like in the middle of the of the concrete. I mean, there's some quirky stuff here  and there. But it's you know, it's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember going to Intel, I remember going to Intel back in the day when I worked on help worked  on that tablet over there. And the soulless just cubicle after cubicle after cubicle and  billboard land. Google is still different from that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although Andy Grove at the time, the CEO of Intel was quite proud of that he was in a cubicle, not  in a big corner office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're suffering. So I'm suffering.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a great scene in Dave Edgar's circle, which is I haven't finished but so far quite  enjoyable in which the young woman protagonist arrives at her new job at the circle, which is  pretty clearly Google might be Facebook.  The founders in a hoodie. So maybe it's a mix. But she arrives and she's blown away by you know,  there's there's buildings where it's all glass.  So you're working like floating in space.  You look down and you can see the people blow you and stuff.  And then she gets to her cubicle and it's burlap and the chairs broken and she has a CRT  display and she gets really bummed out.  She's like, what?  And then her new boss and old friend laughs and says, cost me a lot of money to get this  thing here. This is not where you're sitting.  It is not in no tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that is that book going to drive me crazy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I heard a lot about that book.  Kate Lassie, who wrote The Boy Kings, says that Edgar's basically completely ripped off  her book.  Oh, interesting.  Well, I have to read that.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a Luddite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a Luddite's point of view, frankly.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She said that he oversimplified and, you know, there's a lot of hyperbole and whatever.  She says that he co-opted her experiences as a young woman and decided to rewrite it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that the person who wrote it?  Stephen Levy quoted?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not sure if Levy quoted it.  I'll have to read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He quoted someone else.  It's a really interesting story that he heard about this Ramona Cleff about Google that  was not published and he asked permission to read it.  And he used some of the atmosphere from that in his book, getting clearance from the author  as to what was real and what was fictional.  But the book never went anywhere.  And now that Edgar's has his book out, she said, well, screw it.  And she pulled it back out.  And this is not now up as an e-book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good.  Oh, hmm.  This might be the same person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to have to read all of these.  Sometimes fiction is the best way to understand what's going on in real life.  I mean, oftentimes I do like your new header image on your Google Plus page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think somebody's headed to Brooklyn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm excited.  Don't take a left at the Midtown tunnel though.  You got to keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I got to stay in the BQE.  Yeah, the BQE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very important.  I love it.  Think up dot com.  Everybody should go there and sign up.  I can't wait.  I'm very excited.  It's going to launch what?  It's January, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  January, January 15th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The hosted version of Jaina's amazing analytics software.  Well, I guess really in some ways, the big story this week is not a Google story.  You're gasping.  It's an Apple story and maybe a Microsoft story, but it's not really a big story.  But we can interpret it in through the Google prism.  How about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's okay.  But you know, one thing that struck me is it was going on and no offense, you do  great coverage, but my God, how many live blogs are the same PR do you need in life?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.  Well, that's why you should watch us so you don't have to, you know, collate all  these different live blogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's true.  And so you don't have to go through all the effort of waiting for the refresh and  all the stuff, you just tell you what's going to go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we make it a little entertaining.  We joke around a little bit, mock people's clothing, things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  You can't take it too seriously.  That's what you got to do.  No, you got to have fun with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What were the cuffs that was it?  Who was wearing those, that silly shirt?  Was it any queue?  He was like wearing a shirt that required cufflinks with no cufflinks.  And it just was, but, but I, and then of course, Tim Cook, instead of saying the  dark night, he's looking at Batman.  He's calls it the black night, which is like from Monty Python, I think.  So, you know, we have fun with it, but I think it's a very, it's a big challenge  for Apple because you have such a successful product that really doesn't  need a lot of updates.  So you're, it's really, it's a, it's a question of putting fins on the car right  now.  And one of the things we've observed, and I think this is, uh, Apple's really  bearing this out is it's now fashion.  It's no longer technology is now fashion and Apple hi there's Eddie Q and his  fashionable whatever.  I see that style that people wear that.  I thought like he was trying to put the cufflinks in and then they said, Eddie,  you're on.  He goes, Oh, screw it and throws them and runs out.  I've done that.  So I kind of, um, I, but I think Apple, you know, they hired their new director of  retail, uh, is, uh, the former CEO of Burberry or soon to be former CEO of  Burberry, um, a fashion, you know, uh, uh, brand.  In fact, somebody who took a stodgy British brand and made it a fashion brand,  um, they've hired, uh, other fashion folks.  Um, and, and you gotta think Johnny Ive, what does he do as much as make beautiful?  I mean, makes great products, but they're beautiful products.  They're about fashion design is somewhat of a fashion thing.  So I think the co I think the technology is taking a backseat now to how it  looks smart observation.  They have, well, it makes sense when you have a mature technology, that's how you  do it.  Detroit learned that nine years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, another way to put it though is fashion is all smoke and mirrors.  I worked in and kind of asked, which is an amazing empire built on just that.  But what makes, you know, a shirt, a shirt is a shirt, but no, no, no, no, no.  But it's, but what makes a Vogue outfit different from a real simple outfit is,  is ether.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if you're thinking, if you're trying to, if you're trying to sell a mature  product and you're most importantly trying to get somebody to take the last  year's product and buy a new one, which isn't much improved.  How do you do it?  You do it with looks, you do it with, oh, we'll flatten the icons.  Oh, we'll make it thinner, lighter.  Um, now having said that, I think the iPad air is significantly lighter.  It goes from 1.4 pounds to one pound.  That's something it needed to do.  It was really kind of a heavy device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think that's what I'm so used to my seven inch tablet.  When I see people on the subway with, with a 10 inch, I think that they've got  the kiddie version or the four perhaps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I should say the Fox news version.  I was just going to say the shepherd, shepherd Smith version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then of course, Apple responded to the Nexus seven, which has a very high  resolution display by making it 7.9 inch tablet, the iPad mini, uh, also now with  retina display, in fact, a couple of dots per inch better than the Nexus seven.  So, I mean that really, but I thank Google cause I think they, Apple could  have done this a year ago, they didn't.  And I think Google put the pressure on them.  And, uh, but one thing that didn't happen was, uh, you didn't see a significant  price drop, but what you did see is Apple continuing to sell the old mini and  oddly enough, the iPad two, which is now three generations old at lower prices.  Um, the iPad two, uh, I think we all agreed was designed at the, to aim  to the education market and, uh, the mini is the lowest price iPad at 2.99.  Coming, I think again, responding to the 2.29 price point for the Nexus seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And for me, the tech, the technology advances are just the small, you know,  the size and the thinness.  Yeah.  Because that is, I mean, that is an engineering feat, right?  To get these things so light and thin, but then they have to do the  chamfered edges and iOS seven, you know, to, to kind of sexy it up for regular  people and do these slow mo videos.  I don't, I, oddly, I would evolve people be most, most susceptible as I would

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  think, I don't feel any urge to buy a new iPad.  Do you?  Yeah, no, it didn't really work on me.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  My iPad's pretty, pretty old.  I have an iPad too now.  It works fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it works fine.  I mean, I'll stop at an Apple store and, and, and hold it though.  Cause I'm curious.  Cause they're good.  They're good at doing those, those videos.  And I think, I don't know, there's something so cute about Johnny Ive, uh,  talking about all the challenges they took on.  Like that works on me.  But yeah, no, I probably, I probably won't buy one.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I probably won't buy one.  I'm pretty embedded in it in the Android verse though.  So I'm not a good, uh, I, I, that plenty of my friends, the iPhone  thing would want a new iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was the last Apple product that surprised you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You really have to think hard.  The Mac pro is surprising.  The new Mac pro is surprising.  That is gorgeous.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that is a 1% product if ever there was one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, I never had one, so I wasn't invested in the Mac pro getting better,  but yeah, that, that is, that is one.  It's pretty though.  Even if you weren't looking computer, even if you weren't a Mac pro customer,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but that's still fashion.  Okay.  That's it.  It's fashion times 10 pure fashion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  But apart from that technology, what was the last in a technological sense, the  last Apple product or announcement that  it's on the iPhone problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh no, the iPad, the iPad was a revolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The iPad.  Okay.  That was it.  That's been how long?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Three years ago.  I remember being surprised by the MacBook air.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the air is definitely still the best laptop out there.  Everybody, everybody in the Intel world is copying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everybody loves the air.  So I, so I've, I've always been tempted by it, but I've never bought an air  because I'm not convinced that it can run Xcode and Eclipse and like all the  things that I need for, like, I'm not, I'm not convinced that it's as powerful as  any of the other things.  Yeah, it does.  It does.  Okay.  I might.  Yeah.  People love the air.  The earliest one wouldn't have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, in fact, a new air is it is great.  The new air would be a very good choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But the, but the, when they first launched the air and they showed somebody  slipping it into a yellow envelope, a manila envelope, that made an impression  on me, that was an incredible, and I thought, you know, people made fun of it  in our circles as the Paris Hilton.  No one wants such a little, it's a great, it's everybody loves it.  So that's function.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's form follows function.  That's a functional improvement that happens to look great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  It was that before or after the iPad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The first year was before the iPad.  For the iPad.  Yeah.  But it's gotten better and better.  The iPad's the last one.  So the iPad be the last one.  Somebody in the chat room said, well, Apple maps was pretty surprising to some people  if you follow their directions.  Well, this is another area where Apple is definitely going after a Google.  And I think maybe has eclipsed Google in some ways now with OS 10 Mavericks,  which is free.  And that, of course, that price point is aimed at Microsoft, not Google.  But we talked about this before the show began.  Apple and Microsoft in a way have a problem when they come up against  Amazon and Google, because Amazon and Google can give away hardware or sell it  close to cost because they make their money on the back end, Google with  advertising, Amazon with sales.  You know, and so that makes it hard to sell hardware because they're  they're taking the profit out of the hardware.  So Apple has responded by giving away software and doing premium priced hardware.  And Microsoft has gotten out of the software business, has gotten into the  hardware business for, I think, looking at Apple saying, yeah, we better start  making our own hardware.  That's why they bought Nokia.  That's why they're making Surface.  This is a big change for Microsoft.  Anyway, here's the here.  This is always 10 Mavericks, a free operating system.  Wow.  And the new maps app is built into this.  This is an Apple Maps app.  But one of the things that's very cool is the new iOS calendar, not iOS,  OS 10 calendar.  When you make an appointment, it will add a map link to it.  This is something Google doesn't do.  It will also add travel time to the appointment, knowing the  travel time from the maps.  And that's something I'd love to see in Google calendar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So when I put a calendar item in, I'm never at the place I'm going to be  going there from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it looks so what?  I don't know.  I haven't played with it.  But what they say is it looks at your previous appointment and your next  appointment looks at the travel time and it and, and moves the next appointment  up by the amount of time extra it's going to take to get there.  Says leave now.  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, Google now it's a Google nowish feature.  Uh, and, and we actually talked about this during the Apple event that Apple  would love to start doing some Google now stuff, but they don't have the  signals, they don't collect the signals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  Same.  The signals of the business man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google's got all your search results and Amazon, your email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amazon can't do it either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but they have some signal.  They have more signals than, than they have in commerce signals for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Which Google would die to have.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, but Google now does do that.  It'll say, Oh, it's going to take you 15 minutes to get to your  appointment.  You should leave now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google now was messing up this week.  I was down at a Google event.  I'll talk about it a little bit.  And, and I was, I went, I went, got there early because just get some  work done breakfast and so on.  Then when I was there, Google said, it's going to take you 37 minutes to get here.  Like Google better than this.  And I was at a Google event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I thought I know.  Google, Google, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just swipe away cards that are off, but yeah, I've, I've gotten anything you  search for.  It'll say like, you know, I searched for a restaurant in San Francisco.  You know, we drove down from Mountain View for dinner and then the next day it  was like, where do three minutes to such and such.  I was like, it's breakfast.  I'm not going back there.  Right.  You know, you know, it's fine.  It's doing its best.  It's doing its best.  You don't want it to be too good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It would be too creepy.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  It's like, you need to remind, it needs to screw up every once in a while.  So you get a reminder of that.  It's just a computer.  Oh man.  Yeah.  Oh, shoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Intra interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, so the one that gets me now is the new place.  25 here has right here.  25 minutes to a new place.  Oh God.  So much new.  The golden crust bakery and grill.  Go there.  You don't know where.  Oh, there now.  Making patties, which I don't, I've tried and they don't like where, why is it  giving this to me?  I don't, I don't know.  I don't get it.  Google.  Do I care about this place?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  Well, that happens to me all the time.  And that's exactly what you click, right?  It says, do you want us to tell you more about this?  And you say no, and it never bothers you again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know, but I don't see the logic of why I picked that.  Why did it start?  It's terribly random.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there you go.  Apple has new iPads.  Apple has new notebooks.  Apple gives away operating systems and software.  I mean, I have to say Apple giving away the iWorks suite for anybody who buys  new, any new Apple stuff is directly into Google Docs and Google Docs.  And, and, uh, we, they were, they took great pains, even though they picked a  very bad example to show how you can collaborate on iWorks docs, which is a  feature that Google docs has had to itself up till now, Google docs has to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  get some more elegance.  It's not pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's not very useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I find that I am so addicted now to the collaboration.  I was working on a grant proposal last week and then when the guy who had to  set it off and had to get it at Microsoft word, it just took away all the  collaboration, it took away everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now doesn't office 365, uh, do collaboration in the cloud?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't have real time collaboration.  Does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Doesn't I, I'm not sure.  I have to say, I agree to Google docs needs some, some jazz and up, but  I spend a lot of time in it.  Um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  did you watch the iCloud, the iWorks demonstration and did that make you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  uh, so this is when they're making the album cover.  I was walking in the bad Eddie Q album.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it was like word art from 1995.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But yeah, I, yeah, no, I mean, I was like, okay, like this is right.  Real time collaboration.  Like we've seen, I've watched things move on a page that my  collaborator we're moving.  You know, I remote, it didn't seem like the most mind blowing thing in the world,  but I was like, oh good.  Like, you know, Apple's getting better at services, right?  That's what they need to get better at.  That's the thing that they generally are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Alex Lindsay was sitting over here and then his company uses Google docs for  that collaboration feature primarily.  And, uh, he was very excited.  He said, Oh, thank God, because I just suffering with the crappy, um, you  know, look and feel of Google docs.  Um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  well, Google docs doesn't have the visual.  So that was, um, right.  How was that?  It wasn't, it wasn't keen.  It wasn't, it was probably pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't remember.  It was pages, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Google doesn't have an equivalent visual.  Like, you know, thing that you would make a poster in.  So I get how that would be exciting for someone who's doing that sort  of that kind of design.  Right.  Uh, there they have drawings.  I never used pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you ever use page?  I never used pages.  I used quark in the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I, I, I, therein lies the problem.  Apple has, uh, you know, a word processor pages.  It has a spreadsheet numbers.  It has a presentation manager keynote and they're still getting clobbered by  office and then on the other end at the high end and at the other end, they're  getting clobbered by Google docs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think I've used keynote once or twice.  I think that's it.  I haven't used any other stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there you go.  Okay.  Nevermind.  Well, no, that's a great test.  It did not, it was aimed at you guys because you both use the collaborative  features of Google docs and neither one of you, your ears pricked up.  It just was like, yeah, well, I don't think I'll ever want to do an album  with Eddie Q.  So I guess not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, there's also, if I were to use those, that software, I'd be assuming  that my collaborator also has access to that software.  I don't have to worry about whether or not somebody has access to a web browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, no, that software works in a web browser.  You can do that in a web browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that was all that was, that was in Safari.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's totally, totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It works in Chrome and it works on a pixel.  It works on a Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it works on Chrome.  Wow.  So, I mean, the lot, the Apple, the event live stream doesn't work in Chrome.  No, for odd reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  They have to have Safari to watch the live stream.  Is that weird?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I just assume that nothing works.  Like not that, that many Apple, you know, web apps would work in Chrome.  So that's great.  That's cool.  I guess that's a little more exciting.  I totally missed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they didn't make that, they didn't make that clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Missed the boat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And also, unfortunately, Apple has such a bad reputation for cloud services.  iCloud and before it mobile me were such abominations that I think people are burned  and they're not even going to even think about it until they hear a hundred of their  friends say, oh no, it's really good now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but again, so then I've got a, you know, some of my friends are on Windows  machine somewhere else where the odds that they're going to think of an Apple  service is not going to happen.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  All right.  Enough.  Let's no more talk about Apple.  Let us banish the thought from our mind.  Let's go back to the future.  Instead, celebrate that Google stock has now reached stratospheric proportions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I thought it would go down with profit taking.  It has not.  $1,031 and 44 cents.  $24 and 45 cents today alone.  And all of this because of its quarterly results last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Boy, you beat this.  Okay.  Beat the street.  See the street must be a masochist.  Cause when you beat the street, it kisses you back.  Yes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I went way too far on that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I realized I'm skipping ahead, but so that their stock hits a thousand dollars  for the first time and they're experimenting with giant bad banner ads and search results.  Oh dear.  I know I saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So explain that one to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was waiting for Jeff.  I kind of wanted Jeff to, I know, you know, I actually have two reactions.  Is there a search?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there an organic search I can do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to see this.  Do we know?  It's only a brands.  So I'm going to search for staples.  It's one of their experiments that they're only running for certain users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So yeah, I tried Southwest and I didn't see it.  You see it.  I'm not seeing it.  No.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's actually, I can't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And actually here, I'm going to get accused of being Google defender here.  It worked graphically.  I was looking for this brand.  It, what it did, Gina, was that it made the Google search result feel more like the  brand's page and don't forget, you know, Google already has all these listings under  the main results so I can go directly to things, the about us page or the buy page,  or this page or that page.  So now it felt more ready.  Look at, look at this, the silliness that, that, that advertisers have done where it  doesn't have the staples, but it happens with other brands where you search on a brand  that's not necessarily a brand that's not necessarily a brand that's not necessarily  a brand, Lufthansa and there's the Lufthansa listing first.  Of course, that's what the Google is.  And then a Google Lufthansa bought the ad above it.  Never made any sense unless they were trying to stop Air France from buying it.  I'm not sure what, but it was a waste of money for the advertiser.  Now when it's the same brand, there you go.  So search for Southwest Airlines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This doesn't bother me either.  I don't know why it should.  No, it doesn't.  Cause it's a live search.  So you're getting it Leo.  No, no, this is from the search engine lens.  Oh, okay.  That's an interesting.  It's not a banner ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's why.  It's not a banner ad.  It's a branding position.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  It looks a lot like a banner ad.  What's the difference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What the hell's the difference between a banner ad and a branding position?  What the hell are you talking about?  It doesn't have a message.  Oh, okay.  It's just a picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a label.  Yeah.  Right.  It's, it's a sign over the store.  And so it kind of, I didn't, I didn't look at it and say, oy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it doesn't say try our $39 fair or anything.  Right.  Southwest.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It feels like Southwest page and I can do my business within Southwest directly from there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't mind this so much.  It does clearly say sponsored.  And you searched for Southwest airlines.  If it did this, if I searched for flights and it did this, I'd be mad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  And that's why it didn't seem out of place to me.  And I saw it happen.  I thought, whoa, I was, I was, I was in the middle of going through something.  And I said, oh, I got to remember that for Twig, which of course I didn't cause I'm old.  But, um, uh, I, I saw that happen and I thought, oh, well actually that kind of looked nice.  And I, I, indeed I was trying to go directly into whatever that brand stuff was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it could, Google could justify it saying, well, we're just doing, we're giving you what  you, uh, a better experience in what you asked for.  This is what you want.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And for the brand, it certainly is better.  Right.  Um, it's what you asked us for.  Chat was it, was it Chad?  Did you find that quote from Marissa in the rundown?  Who did that good work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that was, uh, I was actually, so my co-founder, Anil, who constantly trolls me  about being a Google fan girl, uh, pulled up a blog post from 2005 authored by Marissa  Meyer, uh, and in which she said, there will be no banner ads on the Google homepage or  web search results pages.  There will not be crazy flashy graphical doodads flying and popping up all over the  Google site period ever.  Period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, she should have written not on my watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not on my watch.  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And of course it will happen on her watch on Yahoo.  She'll happily sell that.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'm, I mean, on Yahoo, that is what Yahoo is.  I mean, right?  Yahoo is banner ads and crazy graphical flashy, you know, things, doodads flying all  around.  Um, so, you know, but she inherited that.  I just, it was, you know, it was, it was an interesting quote to pull out.  I, you know, it does toe the line of banner ad and, you know, and I was going back and  forth to the New York cause we constantly have this debate cause, you know, he has the  marketing guy's perspective and I have like the coder guys, you know, coder kind of  perspective.  And so I said to him, Oh, can you imagine the marketing guy?  But they asked for the ad.  It's not evil.  You know, um, and he's like, and he said, yeah, and the coder said, and it's open  cause it's HTML five.  So we were kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's what that tweet meant.  I saw that go by between you and an ill dad.  I didn't understand the context.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what he was saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, what they, the question they should really be asking, and I'm sure that this is  why it's still an experiment is what does, how does this impact the experience somebody  has of Google?  If suddenly you feel like I don't want to Google, that looks like Yahoo.  If suddenly you feel like you have to thread your way through Google results to figure  out what's real and what's not, that's not a good experience.  And it's damaging to Google, uh, regardless of whether it makes some money or even  whether people complain, you don't want to start communicating the experience that you  can't be sure what you're looking at when you get a Google result.  Uh, and I'm sure that's what Marissa Meyer was thinking.  We want Google results to be pure.  So the, and this is how this is where we talked about this last week, where do not evil  came from, we do not want to be, what was it?  Go.com, uh, and put ad results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I type in Southwest airlines in the ad request, it does come up for me on my  research results.  It does.  I get that.  Right.  And so what I see on my first screen, as you see there is Southwest airlines, six  links directly in check flight status, schedules, customer service, special offers,  book award, travel, checking online.  Right.  Those are the links that I do indeed want from Southwest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's always done that the only difference between that and what I'm  getting is there's a picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But here's the funny thing, Leo, it feels cleaner and better to me because before  what would have is that yellowed Southwest ad on top, right.  Two or three layers of that, all kinds of ugly Google text in it.  So it actually is prettier now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would argue way larger, just super graphically larger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know I'll get accused of being a fan boy for that, but I actually don't think  it's a bad experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, you know, Google has been doing a lot of experiments with that upper band,  like across, you know, with image search results and you got the knowledge graph  down the right side.  I like the knowledge graph.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The knowledge graph is not an ad because while it tells me about Southwest  airlines, it also says people also search for American airlines, Delta airlines,  US Airways, JetBlue and Frontier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, here's the thing, Leo, there's no knowledge graph on my search.  Oh, that's not good.  That's not so cool then.  That's not so good because you're right, the knowledge graph is useful in a  non-advertising way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Yes.  If you go to the CEO is when it was founded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you search for Verizon, it should, of course, say Verizon or Schmucks who won't  attach Jeff Jarvis's Nexus 7 still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But remember why people type in.  See, people use the Google search box in lieu of a URL.  They type in navigation.  What's the number one search result on Google?  Last time I was there was Yahoo because they think instead of typing Yahoo dot  com, they type Yahoo and they know that first link, they'll click it.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm getting something in between what you get.  And that's weird.  There's no graph.  Right.  So you don't get this box.  See this box that I have.  It's almost like a card for Southwest Airlines.  Right.  And the knowledge graph is gone.  And the knowledge is gone.  The image that is showing up on search engine land has this box with the banner  above it and you don't have a box at all.  And you get the knowledge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's because this is all an experiment.  Yeah.  So they're trying different things and they're looking at pushback.  A B testing, right.  They're A B C testing.  A B C testing.  A B C D E F G probably.  But I have.  You're right, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the risk.  I was making fun of the QCAT before the show and of this thing, which is URL  space where you click buttons for links.  But that's what Google has become.  That it's a namespace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it is the namespace.  You type it in at the top.  It happened with the elimination of a separate search bar.  Yeah.  I would say most normal users don't type dot com.  We trained them not to type HTTP colon slash slash.  Now they don't even type dot com.  They type the thing they're looking for.  McDonald's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then I'm surprised there isn't a I'm feeling lucky button in the universal  bar, so I would just go straight to McDonald's.  I guess Google doesn't want that.  Sometimes it does like me going to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Am I wrong or does not that sometimes not happen where you, if you type something,  it actually takes it to that page or is that.  No, no, it doesn't.  It always see now to me.  Okay.  So I type McDonald's.  This is the result I want from Google, which is a very nice combination of yes,  links on the left, but I've got a local map for the nearest McDonald's.  I've got the box on the right underneath that that gives me information in a, in  a nonpartisan way.  Yep.  I still get the McDonald's logo.  I mean, I, I'm, I think from the user's point of view, this is exactly the  experience you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I agree.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Filling that, taking that away and filling that page with a picture of Ronald  McDonald would be a backward step.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But, but, but Leo McDonald's didn't buy that ad above the list.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's right.  Google made no money on this.  Yeah.  I go to Verizon, go to Verizon, search for Verizon.  All right.  Not that I want to give them any attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, so now I got the orange ad that you mentioned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now you have that ad, that ugly ad above, right?  Oh, that's weird.  I'm getting, I get the, the, the, the box and you don't so strange.  They're testing like crazy.  Now, if you refresh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Possibly part of this problem is that Verizon is a couple of companies.  So let me type Verizon wireless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you click on Verizon wireless, you'll get the knowledge graph.  But this is a couple of companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there it's disambiguating it when I type wireless and this is exactly, I  tell you from a point of view of a user, this is what I want.  I'm not, I don't, I can live with the ad cause it's clearly an ad.  I wish it weren't so big.  And it's kind of a waste of space because it's the same.  And by the way, when I search for something and then I see an ad and right  below it, as I am here seeing a unadvertised link, if I want to screw  Google, I click the ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if I want to screw Verizon, I click the ad because I want Verizon to pay.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  The other way around.  If I want to, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If I don't want to, if I want to screw Verizon, I click the ad because they  have to pay for that now.  Right.  If I don't, if I don't, or I don't want Google to make any money, I click the  native search link cause nobody pays for that.  Yes.  Why does that choice even exist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's, it's, it's, it's less than an SNH green stamp in cost, but still,  Hey, if everybody did it, that's how you vote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel like they, I mean, if Google didn't show Southwest.com as the top  result and just the ad, and then went to the rest of the results, then it  would look really shady, right?  Like they have to show that that would have been the top result anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're taking the knowledge graph out, which really bugs me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do we know that for sure though?  Do we, does that screenshot, that screenshot is sort of cropped?  Oh, on your page.  On mine it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, on mine.  I'm eventually, I think it's a mistake.  I think I agree, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think the advertisers asks for that and says, look, I don't want  all that, uh, independent stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they shouldn't, they well shouldn't.  That's always been Google's argument is they don't influence the search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I, I actually, and this is something Google added.  I don't know when, but I like this and it's happening here with Verizon.  It gives you deep links into the Verizon page, which is very helpful.  So maybe you want to go to the front page and that link is there, but it  may be, you want to contact them or find a store or choose a plan.  Those deep links are there as well.  That's very useful.  And that is like an ad.  So I think what Google's saying, well, we're already doing this.  If we put a picture there, what's the harm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Except for the size of the brand's homepage, but it's a  prospective search result that guesses where you're going to want to go.  Right there.  And I would imagine it gets more personalized as time goes on.  Does when you searched for variety for, for McDonald's, it presumed you want  to know where the nearest McDonald's is and it gives you a map.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just, does, does paying for that banner picture.  What did you call it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Friend does varying for that brand announcement.  Give them the right to determine what deep links are there then beneath it.  I better not.  It better not.  So that whole thing's not an ad unit, just the picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that should be the case now, whether it is or not, I don't know,  but that should be the case.  If that happens, then that is a violation of the, of the founding principle of  what do they say on the Star Trek of the prime directive of, of Google, which is  advertisers cannot have an impact on search listings.  Full stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, because they're showing Southwest below that whole big, huge box with the  image that makes me think the whole thing's are indeed buying that whole unit  with all the deep links.  Like this is, this really toes the line.  Like the, I'm a little uncomfortable with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Toes the line means that it's okay.  It's on the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, right, right, right.  It's on the line.  It's on the line.  Cross.  I'm saying it's not really on the line.  It's not crossed.  Okay.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fuzz is the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Buzz is the line.  Now, what do you get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're going to have to tell us, Jeff, cause you're the guinea pig.  What do you get when you click the banner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, good question.  Okay.  Here we go.  I should get what I go to the Southwest homepage.  That's it.  Um, period.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they could, Gina, if they took the white listings in their main  directory and sold that well,  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Gina, you may be right on the frigging money.  Cause I'd now notice there is a box around the entirety of the sponsored bug  picture and the, uh, they're white, but there's a box around it.  Ooh.  And it's the thinnest, thinnest hairline rule you could imagine.  And then is it going to show next time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it going to say, Gina Trapani likes Southwest airlines?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I had less resolution than my magnificent pixel, I wouldn't even see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's included in a box, which traditionally means that sponsor  applies to everything.  See the line, but well, wait a minute.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cause that's a separate, the box I think has been there.  Has it?  Okay.  All right.  I mean, I think that's what I was saying with a, with a card earlier and you  don't get the boxes.  What I was saying was each result seems completely different.  Now I, I don't have a sponsored icon on my box.  These deep links I've seen on other search results.  Yes, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, no, I get the same deep links.  I just don't get the box.  Yeah.  And I don't get the ad.  You got an ad.  Is that an ad?  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, uh, yeah, I do get a related ad related to Southwest airline.  I don't get the ad.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I get the box and I get the ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is that flight that you're getting in your knowledge graph?  Is that a flight you've taken?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, that's an upcoming trip.  That's a trip from San Francisco to Orlando.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're getting something different.  You have Disney world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Close.  Dad's going to Disney world.  Minecon.  Close.  Minecraft convention.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Same thing.  Might as well be Disney world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But so that's interesting.  I think that he gets different results because he's got an air, a flight book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It even says only you can see these results over in the corner.  So I don't know if you'd get the knowledge graph or not.  Of course not in your case.  It's not in my case.  I'm streaming it live.  Um, yes.  That's a, that's a Google Now style.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chat room says to search Delta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what if I had signed out?  Do I have to search for Delta airlines or just Delta?  Reinventing aviation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like, it looks like it's an NPR rule where you can only say the tagline.  Now it says sponsored above and the rule goes around the entire thing, including.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what do we vote?  Yes, no, yay, nay, crossing the line under the line, over the line, behind  the line, toe in the line, where is the line?  I don't even get an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't like it.  Do you have an ad?  I can either.  I think you're crosses the line at the, I hope it's just an experiment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I now don't, I never, I'm going to agree with you.  If it was just selling that, that banner position, that, that, that  branding position above, I would be okay with it.  Aesthetically, it actually looks okay.  But if they are selling what look like listings, that's  violating the prime director.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think it causes confusion as to what I'm looking at.  Am I looking at results?  Am I looking at ads?  Uh, don't, don't, I think Marissa nailed it.  Do not put ads in my search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those are, I don't know whether what we're saying is true or not.  They may not be selling that.  That may not be, but, but if the advertiser has control over it,  says sponsor, well, you don't know where the line ends.  Where the box ends.  I don't know.  Well, even if it doesn't, uh, I don't like the big, the caveat there, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  if they are selling white listings, oh, well that would be bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But, but they're not, but let's presume they're not doing that.  Jeff, is it okay then if it's just a big picture?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was just a big picture.  I said earlier, I'm not so bad with it.  Described it to me.  I would have had problems, but given my consumer experience of wanting to go to  something in the Southwest airlines, actually it doesn't, it doesn't offend me.  Well, I'm concerned about the ethical issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if you want Google to be worth more than a thousand dollars a share, then  this is the kind of thing you want.  And this is how you get third quarter results like Google.  God, it was an amazing quarter, an increase of 12% over the third  quarter of 2012 year over year.  Um, an interesting point, the click-through rate went down, the  click-through revenue went down, but advertising revenue went up, uh, because  they're selling a lot more ads.  Google, I mean, Wall Street was very impressed, uh, with, with Google's success.  $13.77 billion in revenue.  Um, just really a big quarter for Google.  And by the way, a lot of profit.  Google is not one of them, oh, we're make 5% on everything we sell.  I don't know what the profit margin is, but it's big.  I can see if I can find that net income was $3 billion.  Unbelievable.  And how to make money.  Billion dollars a month.  So, and that's how you make money.  Now, of course, Google also seems to have licked the mobile issue and  everybody's worried to Facebook and everybody else worried.  How do you make money in mobile?  Google seems to figure that out.  Their mobile ads have done well.  Um, I'm sorry.  I got the revenues wrong.  Revenues were 14.89 billion.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google sites made 9.39 billion.  Google network revenue.  That's partner sites, 3 billion.  1.23 billion from other.  I don't, I don't know how to read a balance sheet.  I should get the other.  Other revenues from the Google segment.  I can't read this crap.  International revenues.  7.67 billion, 56% of their total revenue.  More than half the money they make is from outside the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is probably not taxed here, but that's a method of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's the, that's the double Dutch Irish run around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody said it in the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Double Dutch Irish sandwich.  Irish sandwich or no double Irish Dutch sandwich.  Double Irish Dutch sandwich.  That's it.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've read before the show and I, and I, I think this really, uh, nails this.  A judgment, an interesting judgment from judge learned hand, uh, back in 1947,  uh, IRS was suing somebody, uh, over just kind of this kind of thing, being  overly aggressive and avoiding taxes.  And I will read you this.  I think a salient quote from judge learned hand.  He said in his judgment and commissioner versus Newman, 1947, over and over again,  the courts have said there is nothing sinister and so arranging one's affairs  as to keep taxes as low as possible.  Everybody does so rich and poor and all do right for nobody owes any duty to pay  more tax than the law demands.  Taxes are enforced extractions, not voluntary contributions to demand more  in the name of morals is mere can't.  So for those who criticize Google for taking advantage of the tax law,  that's a pretty good response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I just read today that it is, yes, it is the hundredth anniversary of the  income tax in the United States of America.  October, 2013.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  So it was 1913.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if you go to new port, Rhode Island, you can see what happened before there  was an income tax because the Robert Barron's made so much money.  They could build Versailles like palaces on the ocean front at new port, Rhode  Island, because they got to keep everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, for the first many years of the tax until world war II, I think the story  also said only 4% of Americans paid income tax.  Yeah.  It was the very real, very wealthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's where we've gone wrong.  The 20th amendment.  I just paid a lot of taxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the price we pay to live in this far out, far out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're such a good citizen.  But before you were talking, the show you were talking about with Steve, you're  talking about doing your jury duty.  You're paying your taxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I believe it's, I believe that.  Well, yeah.  And I know this is probably sounds stupid, but I think there's, we have a social  contract and that part of the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought you just hand over all your phone calls to the NSA.  Huh?  I'll save you the trouble.  I'll talk to you about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Another time I just, I was talking to Steve about this, a very interesting,  uh, uh, piece by a security expert named Dan gear in which he said, look, the NSA  and the law enforcement is doing exactly what we wanted them to do because we said,  perhaps not understanding the consequences.  Never again.  We said, secure us.  We said, we don't want another nine 11 ever again.  That's the Patriot act.  Right.  And the natural consequence for those who understand how this stuff works is that  you need total information awareness.  Cause the only way to say never again is to know everything that happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, but that's, but that's, that's a fallacy right there.  Cause cause Diane Feinstein wrote a, an op ed in USA today, extolling, uh,  getting more dots, which of course is funny because it's USA today has a  dot logo now, but anyway, uh, going on about how you have more and more dots.  And I'm going to do a guardian event in two weeks where I'm going to interview a  former Saturday, Senator Bob Carey, former member of the, the nine 11  commission.  And the first question I want to ask is, because the nine 11 commission said  we have to connect more dots.  Does having more dots have any connection to connecting more dots?  Yes.  So we're overloaded with dots.  Now we've got dots, dots coming out there.  We were crazy with dots and, and, and, and, and it becomes an information overload.  It's a, it's a, it's cliche.  Can we put it, it's a filter failure problem now where you have too much  information because you're not being focused because you get this ethos in  the words of Keith Alexander to collect it all.  So now you have unbelievable amounts of data and you can't do anything with it  because it's because you haven't focused too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you need the right dots?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you'd have an argument from the folks who are in the law enforcement  agencies who believe they are in fact, processing these dots effectively.  Uh, or, or believe that, Hey, the look, I'm  looking at Moore's law.  Let's collect it all now.  We'll have enough processing power soon.  Don't worry about that part.  That part we know is going to double every 18 months.  So just save it for later, later.  And they are applying some very sophisticated algorithms to this.  The other thing that gear points out, which I think is true is that, uh, the  content is not what's important.  The metadata is important.  The relationships who's talking to whom that's really where all the value is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And, uh, of course you could never have enough metadata dots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that game.  I am so addicted to that game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a good game.  Isn't it?  Oh, we're talking about, uh, who wrote that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Um, that's a beta works, isn't it?  Laura.  Is it Lauren?  Hey, no, I think it's beta works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It works.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's on Android and it's, uh, just as addictive on Android as it is on iOS.  Um, let's take a break.  We're going to come back with the change log.  See what Google's been up to.  Is there, is there a change log this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina Trapani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google Hangouts for iOS got a massive update rendering lots of Android users  really jealous and sad.  Hey, that's not right.  It's not right.  So the new Hangouts update for iOS gives the users the ability to call numbers  directly from the app itself with no charge for any calls to the US and Canadian  numbers and international calls work too for a fee.  If users have a Google account, Google Voice account, this is what I want.  This is what I want so bad.  It can both make and receive calls without going calls showing your Google  Voice number and incoming calls popping up in the Hangouts app itself.  Also new the visible indicators of who is reachable right now that recently popped  up in the Android version.  I've got inline animated GIF support.  GIF or JIF?  I can't remember.  GIF support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We all fly in the face of the founder who says GIF.  Not JIF.  It's a GIF.  Damn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And now incoming calls don't stop a user's music that you listen to in iOS.  It just pauses it.  So of course, Vik and Dhotra announced this on Google Plus and a lot of Android  users were very upset and Vik said, guys, don't worry, we have a massive investment  in Android.  I promise you will be happy soon.  This is my favorite part.  Don't get upset because we show some love to Google users who use iOS.  There are a lot of them and they are good people.  We like our iOS counterparts.  So waiting for that big Hangouts update for Android.  Very possible that it'll drop with KitKat whenever the Nexus 5 comes out.  I'm waiting.  Which I think will probably be soon.  As we said on All About Android last night, it's perpetually a week away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, October is a week and a day left, so it should happen soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It should happen soon.  You had a provocative promo for All About Android about Nexus 5 conspiracy theories,  Gina. What were those?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We talked about those.  Like all the...  Like why they did...  Yeah, we talked about that, didn't we?  We did?  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Whether this is like, yeah, hapless geeks leaking or purposeful marketing ploys.  Google debuted parental controls for Chrome and Chromebook computers.  They've got a new supervised users feature.  This is now in beta.  And this option is for parents and kids.  And a lot of kids are going to be using Chromebooks, are using Chromebooks, and will  probably continue to be using Chromebooks.  This supervised users feature allows a user, most likely parent, to lock down the  Chrome browser running on their device in order to allow and block access to certain  websites, enable safe search for filtering Google search results, and maintain a  history of the websites visited, among other things.  So I'm so excited that all this is going to be in place once Eda is old enough to  be surfing the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are those the same features that educators can use now that they're just  given to parents?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think, yes, this is the same features.  This is in the beta builds.  And in fact, I don't know if you have this, Jeff, on your pixel yet.  But yeah, I believe that this is the same strain of features.  And I think that this is exactly for that.  It's for Chrome in the classroom and for Chrome at home with kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I may interrupt for a moment, which is what I do here.  Chad, the last item under other, there's a picture there that I've found out is  a Rorschach test for Luddites or geeks.  Oh.  Wait a moment for the picture to go up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's all look at it and we'll see what we think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you see happening in this picture?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  You posted this.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I posted this, right?  Yeah.  So it's a bunch of kids, a teacher in Texas or a tech administrator in Texas put a  picture up of a bunch of kids outside on a bench at a school.  It's recess.  And the majority of them, well, it's something.  Majority of them are on laptops.  This is a one for one Chromebook district.  The reaction was fascinating because people came on and a lot of them said,  they should be throwing frisbees.  They should be doing this.  They should be talking to people.  And I said, remember, they probably are talking to people.  They're just talking, you know, and somebody else said, yeah, they're not talking to  the doofus who's sitting next to them.  We're talking to somebody better.  And the reactions were just polarized as hell.  This is sad.  This is creepy.  No, this is great.  Really?  People thought that was creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That did not strike me as creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Sad, creepy, social misfits, all that, all that meme you'd hear.  Clamp says they're waiting for the Apple store to open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The line goes around the school.  Um, no, and some of them are on the football team.  You see, they're wearing their jerseys, so they're getting exercise.  Unless the football team is like, you know, on, on a Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That could be their chest jerseys.  Leo, it's the chest team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My reaction is like, Oh, I'm so glad they're getting outside while they're  using their computers.  Like, yeah, I have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I've seen, I've seen this exact thing so many times.  It didn't even, I didn't even think anything negative.  It just looks normal to me.  But, oh my God, my kids went to a one-to-one high school and that's what you see.  They still are active.  They still play frisbee and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I will say that there are days when I regret that the physicality of like the  work that we do involves sort of being hunched over, you know, hunched over a  computer.  I mean, I think this is what glass is about, right?  Is like not having everyone sort of.  And I get glasses imperfect and whatever, but, um, I can sort of understand the  reaction a little bit, but my reaction was definitely, I'm glad they're using  computers outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, it's better than getting some bully throwing a dodge ball at you at a  hundred miles an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right?  That stinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  I wish I'd had Chromebooks when I was growing up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that was the interesting thing too.  People in this said, people who are, you know, their twenties said, Oh, I so  wish I'd had laptops then because I would, you know, I just went off and looked  at antisocial in some other way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I sat there doing this, but I didn't have anything in my lap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I locked myself in a computer lab in college most of the time.  So there you go.  Yeah.  In high school, it was an open, it was a spiral notebook.  But yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Were you drawing or writing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, in high school?  Yeah.  Writing mostly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, all right, let's get back to the change log.  This is from the, uh, no, no, that's okay.  From the like, it's really cool.  It can do this, but I don't know when I'd ever use this, uh, category.  Google brings mouse and track pad handwriting support to Gmail in over  50 languages and docs and over 20 languages.  So you basically, if you want to draw, literally draw, uh, characters on  your track pad in very many languages, you can enable input tools and Gmail  or docs, you have to go into settings, general enable input tools, and  then you've got this little button that says, Hey, turn on handwriting support.  And you can draw, uh, characters in many, many, many languages, 50 in  Gmail and docs and 20 and, um, transcribe and it will get entered into your documents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is, this is most useful for non-Roman, uh, uh, languages or, uh,  ideographic languages like Chinese.  Yes.  Where they really, that would be so much better than trying to use a keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's true.  Yeah.  Yep.  That's the use for it.  Absolutely.  And finally, Google plus, uh, discontinuing saved search.  So you used to be able to search, uh, save a search for a keyword.  Now Google's saying, Hey, this is, uh, this is going away.  If you want to save a search, just bookmark, bookmark the page to the search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they thought that was going to take over the world and that we were all  going to have tons of saved searches.  And it was going to be this great thing.  And that's the great Google learns.  And though nobody wants it.  Okay.  Goodbye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Clearly nobody was using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, not nobody, but if you were the 1% that used it, now you're  You can't.  Now you're a past reader.  You've got a lot of bookmarks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my God, I'm a later reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I, is it that hard though to maintain a saved search?  I mean, it seems like, unless absolutely nobody used it.  I mean, really nobody used it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think, I think it was, it was, the problem was it was another feature.  It should have been a follow.  Yeah.  Follow a person.  I should have been able to follow a search.  They already had that grammar there and they tried to make up a new world.  And that's to me the mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, if, and if they had a decent API, people could make clients that would  save searches for them, you know, like there's always this tension with the,  like, well, 1% uses this 99% doesn't.  So we need to take the buttons.  We need to take it out.  Uh, you know, and there's always going to be that, but you know, if you had a decent  API, then people could make power apps that did those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, even in the chat room says, I'm sure Elgin used it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sure, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I used it when it first, when that first came out and then I never used it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I forgot.  Yeah.  I forgot about them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which says something.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's all I got for the change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's the Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you love the, uh, do you love this use of, uh, Google's, uh, auto complete,  um, in this ad campaign?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I saw somebody linked.  I saw somebody linked to this and I thought that's only gonna upset me.  And I didn't look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is upsetting.  These aren't real though.  These are edited.  Uh, these are not the actual problem that bothered me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I made the reference to that.  I think, I think that makes us all look bad because if you, I went to every one of  those searches and I looked at them and yes, half of them were, were yucky and  made me feel bad, but the other half made me feel fine.  And so it, it's a, it's a bit of a falsehood, I think, to try to take it and  only give us the bad of us.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't think it's so, so if I understand correctly, the premise is that  these are Google suggests auto complete phrases for things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Women shouldn't dot, dot, dot.  Women should dot, dot, dot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't think that that's a good measure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If they're faked and if they're faked, which they were, they take some of the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  uh, the power to say that bad attitudes don't exist, but they definitely do.  That's a little, uh, that seems a little sensationalistic to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now I just typed women shouldn't, and I got women shouldn't work.  Women shouldn't be in combat.  Women shouldn't be cops.  Women shouldn't vote.  Women shouldn't go to college.  That's pretty bad.  Oh, geez.  Yeah, that's bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's just like, we've Googled ourselves on this show.  You tweet in your name and of course you'd like divorce.  I know I got the worst stuff.  Right.  Yeah.  Like it's all the bad stuff.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Women should not be in combat.  Women should be in combat.  Women should not preach.  Women should not speak in church.  Women should be seen and not heard.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess, you know what?  Maybe it wasn't so faked.  Um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  those are your actual, those are your actual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is not for the posters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what, Leo?  I swear this has changed since when I looked at it before the show some hours ago.  Cause now, you know, it is definitely more negative.  You're right.  But it wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing.  It feels like that ad or that article is encouraging people to search for those  things, which is just ranking them higher.  So it's like,  it's just ranking them higher.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Women or men should not do autocomplete to figure out stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I, yes.  All right.  Women or men should not use autocomplete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what do you get when you type men shouldn't, men shouldn't wear shorts,  shouldn't wear flip flops.  Men shouldn't marry.  Men shouldn't hit women.  There's a good one.  Men shouldn't wear jewelry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's with the men in shorts thing?  I don't get it.  There's like this whole, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't, I don't, I don't want to see your knees.  No, I agree.  But I think the men shouldn't wear flip flops seems to be a very strong current.  It's like number one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know why that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like a good manly flip flop.  I don't want to have a problem with men in flip flops.  I guess hairy toes, you know,  geeks love to wear shorts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, you know,  show title.  Sorry, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Harry toes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's be clear.  The point of the ad is important that there is far more, um, um, misogyny than  all you have to do is do that autocomplete right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well said.  Yep.  Men and women.  Men and women.  It's kind of a difference.  Um, Tesla is going to add Chrome as well as an Android emulator.  What is that to its big screen?  Yeah.  It seems like such a bad idea.  One of the reasons I didn't get a Tesla is I knew I would be distracted by that  17 inch display.  I know.  It looks like too much fun.  They're going to add Chrome and third party apps to their model S vehicles by the end  of the year, according to Elon Musk.  And they're considering adding an Android emulator to the car so you can literally  run an Android program in a window on the car.  I have to see how that works out.  Okay.  They also chose, I think AT&T for their, uh, LTE access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's a good thing because if it was Verizon, I'd never buy it.  Still nothing on your, uh, next to seven, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, Netflix had a good, uh, good quarter proving its strategies.  Correct.  It crossed 30 million subscribers, making it bigger than HBO 31 million subscribers,  9 million in the rest of the world.  For total of 40 million people paying 7.99 a month for Netflix streaming, uh,  stock market loved that.  Um, and of course some real successes in their Netflix original productions.  They just did a deal with Sony motion pictures, the first major movie  studio to do a deal.  You watched the orange is the new black.  Love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh God.  It was such a great show.  Such a great show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Doing very well by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bigger than I think any other Netflix show so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really more than the house of cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I saw something about it.  In fact, yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it didn't seem like it got half the marketing that that house of cards got  such a great show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, women in prison, you can't go wrong.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Women should go to prison.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The premise of the show.  It's a true story.  The premise of it is that, uh, a white, well-educated, I think she went to Smith,  right or somewhere, a middle-class woman, uh, goes to federal or state prison.  I can't remember for a crime she committed in her youth, like eight years ago.  And the book is her memoir.  She was mule in money.  What's interesting about it is, uh, yeah.  Muelling money for her girlfriend drug, uh, drug lord.  What's interesting about it is, um, uh, that each episode kind of highlights  these other women in prison and there's, their stories are fascinating.  So it's kind of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One of the only shows, I guess I shouldn't say on TV, it's not on TV.  One of the, one of the only shows where all the character, you know, the whole  story focuses around women and their relationship primarily with other women.  Like the one major male character is sort of this like doofy guy.  Cornstache.  Right.  I mean, it's an extremely feminist.  I it's just, it's incredible.  Like, it's so good to see first protagonist and to see, and to see women  presented as people who have problems beyond their boy, like trying to get a  boyfriend.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is that?  Except that they're all criminals in prison, which is not maybe the best.  Yes, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is it?  What is that test that, uh, that you do that if there are female character that  doesn't talk about men or.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  Um, yes.  Remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what?  You know what's surprisingly good.  I thought it would just be given this, uh, network showtime and it's titled  masters of sex.  I thought it would just be a lot of nudity.  It's it's it's surprisingly good.  And it's surprisingly feminist because what it really is about is the repressive  roles that women had to take in the fifties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  It's masters in Johnson.  I heard it was sort of mad men with nudity though.  Is it, it's better nudity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's, uh, but it's about sex.  What do you expect?  Um, but it is, it's a, it's the pre it's the prequel to mad men because madmen  starts where masters of sex leaves off.  And so mad men is all about the kind of unfolding of the sixties and liberation.  This is about how repressive the fifties were.  God, I forgot how bad it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cool.  I'll have to check it out.  I'll check it out.  I was saying to a friend of mine, like, I was like, I love orange is the new  black, cause it's like, there's so many like kind of realistic relationships,  especially lesbian relationships.

Transcript:  They hit it out of the box.  You know, I, I've, I've, this has been Chromecast for me too.  I want my next is seven.  Um, uh, I won't make a Verizon joke.  Uh, I, I, I watch shows.  I'm a spending a fortune watching shows orphan black.  Did you watch that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I started that.  It's interesting.  It's, it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It gets, it gets even better.  I like it.  No, I like it.  It's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a little, sometimes when shows are really nerve wracking, I don't want to  watch them because I like my stomach's in a knot and it's a stomach in a nut show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The vegetable test.  Sorry.  Thank you.  Foo in the chat room.  Be B C H D E L.  Yeah.  I named after Alison Betts, who's an incredible, uh, cartoonist.  Uh, yeah, she's the one who came up with the test.  Like, is there a character in the story who was a woman who's, you know, doesn't  who, who's, you know, story doesn't revolve around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It says the test asks whether a work of fiction features at least two women who  talk to each other about something other than a man.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you'd be amazed at how many movies fail that test.  Like most.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mm hmm.  Mm hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you for my feminist soapboxing of the, no, we're all with you right on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've come a long way, baby.  Yeah.  Now you can smoke cigarettes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No matter what Google auto suggest says, I can smoke cigarettes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, and I don't, I don't know if I want to go into this, but it's when I read  the headline, I thought it was kind of creepy Facebook and beheading videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did an interview on, on BBC about this today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't, this could, by the way, I should warn people that what you were about to  talk to, it could be very triggering.  And if you're at all sensitive, this stuff stopped now, but I do not want to go

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  into any detail on it.  We're not going to show anything.  Don't worry.  Videos are highly offensive.  Um,  uh, highly offensive videos and Facebook's argument in a, in a free speech vein was  that as long as people were putting them up to criticize them, to condemn them,  uh, that it was okay.  The argument then came back.  Well, you then why don't you allow, you know, nursing mothers, naked breasts.  Um, and because we're not condemning nursing.  Well, no, that's not right.  Then even David Cameron, uh, prime minister of the UK condemned the, uh,  Facebook's action.  So Facebook pretty much backed off, took that video down, but still left the open  door to say that, uh, some things could be put up and I, you know, I, there was a  very good column by a columnist in the, in the guardians and once they chose to  edit anything, then they do have a necessity to make a standard and say what  that standard is now at the same time as a news person, uh, you know, I don't want  somebody to come to the news and say, you can't show anything that's going to  offend anyone and it's going to be disgusting.  Uh, you don't want that, but I think you do have to ask where's the harm here and  the harm of showing these horrible things.  Cause you're right.  It's triggers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's genuine harm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this is no one should see this without showing it.  Yeah.  So I agree.  So I, in the end, I agree.  It should not be there though.  I understand the argument or principle isn't as simple as it seems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's difficult.  You know what?  It really comes down to this notion of is a, uh, internet provider, a common  carrier and like the phone company where they're not responsible for anything.  Exactly.  Or if they're responsible for anything at all, then they're  responsible for everything.  There's no middle ground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Reddit creep shots.  You know, there is a middle ground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there a middle ground?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but there's, there's a middle ground.  Sure.  There's a middle ground because, because Facebook can say we're a place where  friends get together to meet and have a nice time and yes, dissidents can use it  to show war and show bad things that happen in war.  Um, you know, if, if Facebook started taking down all the pictures that came  from, from people being killed in Syria, they'd be smashed for that.  And that's disgusting.  That's, that's dead children for God's sakes.  There's nothing more disgusting than that.  There's reason for a purpose.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess it's just, it's hard to come to an agreement about what's  okay and what's not okay.  But I guess it's worth doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  So Facebook and Google try to avoid that.  They try to say, we don't want to, we want to be common carrier.  We don't want to do anything, not really for legal reasons, but just for the,  the hassle and the expense reasons.  They can't too, but they do have, they do have some, uh, I think they have a  right responsibility and, uh, somewhat of an obligation to have a decent environment.  I mean, I learned this about, about trolls and comments.  If you don't kill the, if you let the trolls take it all over, then they will  take over everything.  That's right.  So at some point you have responsibility for, for helping the community.  Cause you have the authority.  You are the one who can kill it.  Nobody else can.  Um, but the other thing I said too is it's not as if BBC tried to say, well, does  this, you know, advertisers is going to run away from Facebook or it's going to  affect their market.  I said, no, you know, Zuckerberg said long ago that no two people in the  world see the same Facebook.  The number of people who see this crap, uh, is, is, is limited.  And I think we, you know, we don't want to overblow it and perhaps, uh, give it  too much attention.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Moving on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, should we talk about this Android, uh, piece?  Yeah.  You want to, you talked about it last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wanted to know your, your, your views on that brought over to this show from  last night show, Gina.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We, we did talk about it last night.  So apologies.  Anyone who watched all, but it's very important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Let's talk about it.  It's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We, yeah, this is Ron Amadio's piece on our technique, uh, Google's iron  Crip grip on Android controlling open source by any means necessary.  And we actually had Ron, the author of the article on all about Android last  night, so, um, and we really got kind of got into it, uh, with him.  It was a really good, good conversation.  Uh, I mean, you know, the, the summary of his article is basically that, you  know, every time Google releases a proprietary Google app, like Gmail or  like Hangouts or like Google photos, which we're going to see in KitKat that  the open source version, just the generic gallery app, the generic messaging app,  uh, the generic email app basically becomes abandoned where, um, that  that Google stops updating that, you know, even though Android is open source,  we all know that Google works on it in private, you know, behind closed doors.  And then when they do a release, they release the source out into the public.  Right.  So it's not a thing that's happening, you know, uh, in public nightly, and  they're not accepting contributions from anyone else.  Um, so this article is basically saying that, you know, that Android in a lot of  ways, and this is actually, I think one of the best arguments I've ever seen for  Android, not really being open, um, that, um, you know, that, that Google is, is.  It lets all, you know, turns all the, the open source Android apps into abandoned  where and replaces them with their own proprietary versions, which are closed  source and which only run on Google experience phones, right.  And there are restrictions that Google, the company puts in place for  a man for manufacturers to, to, to, um, satisfy all the requirements that let  them run all the Google proprietary apps, which is the Play Store and maps  and Gmail and all that, um, you know, they have to make some agreements and.  You know, some of those are backdoor agreements that aren't public and we're  not really sure what they are wrong.  Did a really good job.  Um, he was saying that the open handset Alliance based on information that we've  gotten from, you know, court cases and other snippets here and there, it sounds  as if Google has made every manufacturer in the open handset Alliance basically  promise to not distribute devices unless they're Google experience Android.  So, so in essence, Google is locking out other companies from being able to fork  Android, you know, with the exception of course of Amazon, and we're seeing things  like Sanogen mod now, um, to fork Android and to make that Google's doing everything  it can to make it as difficult as possible for any other company to fork Android and  to make, make their own custom Android build that could compete with Android.  That Android's value is the proprietary closed source layer of Google apps versus  the open source, uh, uh, code.  So it's, you know, it's a great read.  It's something I, um, it's the first time that I've been fully that I've actually  been swayed, you know, I hate these arguments is Android really open.  I've always sort of dismissed those, right?  But this is the first time that I was like, Oh, this is, this is really interesting.  I mean, I think that Google, now that Google has dominant market share, they really  are going out of their way to make it difficult for anyone else to catch up to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you would contrast it to somebody like, let's say Ubuntu, which takes Linux,  doesn't fork it, but enhances it, puts everything back into the open source repository  and all the changes that are made, I believe on Ubuntu are done in public as  opposed to behind closed doors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that would be the other way to handle it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  I mean, the, the, the, the proprietary Google apps, like take example for Hangouts  or Google play music, they're so deeply and closely knitted into Google's web  services, um, or Google now, for example, the Google search app, the open source  one hasn't been updated in a really long time.  It looks really old, but Google now is the new version, you know, that they, that  they, they haven't open sourced those because that's, they're so closely tied  with their services, their cloud services meaning, um, so it feels like it's time  for Google to start letting in third party collaborators who will update the  core generic non-Google web service specific apps, uh, you know, like messaging  and like email and like Google search, uh, you know, just the search bar, um, to  kind of keep those up to date because most, cause those are kind of, those are  abandoned ware, so this spawns companies like Samsung who, you know, write all  their own proprietary apps, right.  To, to replace the Google version.  The thing is that they're never going to be as good as the Google version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're not as good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Um, cause Google had a headstart because Google is an incredible web services  company.  I mean, I mean, it's clear that that Android, Android from day one, we knew  was, it was a platform for Google services, right.  But it just seems like they're being, um, much more of a bully and much more  protective and defensive of their turf.  You know, now that Android has, you know, achieved the dominant  market position that, that it has.  I know.  It's a great read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't, it's not necessarily a negative.  I mean, there is an open version of Android and then it's completely, it's  not inappropriate for Google to make a closed version of Android, but it, it  just shouldn't call it an open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, this is the thing, right?  Like they're closed apps or apps on top of the open layer, right?  So they're not like actually taking,  but Apple does that with Darwin.  For instance, nothing wrong with that.  I've got, I've got, I've got no problem with that whatsoever.  I mean, everybody can build out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just don't call it open source because it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's the, it's the leaving the apps, the original apps, the open  source version, you know, on not updated, concentrating all of their effort into  the proprietary closed layer that lives on top of the open layer and then saying,  Hey, Android's open source, you know, and we've got apps that haven't been touched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Apple will say we're built on open source software.  Darwin is open source.  We contribute stuff back to the Darwin project, but, but the, the sum of OS 10  is much more than Darwin, just as the sum of a Google experience phone is much  more than Android, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But, and so they should say that they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  huh?  Or WordPress.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I'm reckoning with what this would think of, you know, we're going to have  a proprietary system and layer.  And like, this is the thing when you build a business on open source, you  generally don't open source the business value, right?  Like the business value for, for, for, for Google is that people are running  the play store and purchasing them things there and running Google now and using  Google services and making Google part of their lives.  Somebody else who forks, you know, forks Android, whether it's, you know, San  Jan or VUI or Amazon.  Amazon is the classic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Amazon is the clear case.  Yeah.  Gina, let me ask a question though.  Devil's advocate moment here.  The question is what's Google protecting besides the business interest in terms  of brand, if I, if I'm some fly by night, horrible phone manufacturer, and I put  up some or absolutely awful version of Android and I mess it all up, Google's  brand isn't so much hurt, but if somehow I mess up Google mail and Google maps and  Google this and Google that the services that are core to Google's brand that  could hurt Google.  So, so in a way, isn't Google protecting its apps more than it's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, right.  It is protecting its apps.  I mean, that's why they have sort of all these requirements that manufacturers  have to, you know, have to abide by before that they can put Google on the  handset and have the play store on it.  And yeah, they are protecting their apps, but, but this is the thing, like  Android's open source and the idea is like anybody can come along and fork  Android or build on Android and, you know, have a successful operating system too.  It just seems like Google is doing everything they can to kind of make, block,  block that from actually happening.  Right.  So I never really had a problem with the fact that they did a batch release of all  the source code on a given date and worked kind of within Google's doors, you  know, privately behind Google doors during development.  But now I kind of do now that I can see that they're not keeping the, you know,  AOSP up to date with, you know, modern Android design guidelines, for example,  because they're pouring all their energy into the proprietary apps.  Cause that just feels like, well, either iterate in public and let other people  contribute and keep, and keep the operating system up to date, the open  source project up to date or just close the whole thing.  But it feels like, and this is kind of the conclusion we came to on all of it.  Android last night, it's like, yeah, Android is more open than other options,  but it's not quite as open as Google says, you know, like this is the first time  that I was like, oh, so open is a marketing term here, you know, it's not  untrue, but it's not completely true either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they didn't call it open source, but they called it opener.  That opener, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That might be a problem with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the, and correct me if I'm wrong, but the operating system is, and  continues to be open source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That that is right.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we're talking about the application layer on top of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The application layer is, I don't, yeah, I don't, I don't have a complaint with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a lot of apps are not closed or not open source.  In fact, most apps are not open source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's the thing we're not complaining about because we don't use those apps.  Like we use the proprietary Google experience apps.  So we're not using the, the mess that the stock messaging app of the stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we're using the, I often use it on signage and minus one of the reasons I  like Google experience phones, cause they've got it right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, now the second part is the open handset Alliance.  And I think this is where Google, uh, probably, uh, I understand why for business  reasons, but maybe exerts more influence than they should.  The open handset Alliance is the one that strong arms manufacturers says you've  want, if you want our apps, you better do it right.  Right.  And you can make the case that they're, that as Nintendo learned from Atari's  debacle in the gaming world, that you control the games because the, the, the  quality of the games in terms of success of your platform, uh, so you could make  that argument, Google's just protecting the platform by making sure that the  handset makers do quality implementations.  But I think they use it to strong arm them to include the Google apps and to  make sure that they don't mess around with Android.  So, so I think what you have is kind of three States, you have open source  operating system, closed source tabs, but then you have this open handset Alliance  that is putting exerting economic pressure on companies to tow the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, they're, they're Google's trying to make it so that the best Android  experience and really it's been effective because the, the best and really the only  Android experience is the, is the Google experience, the dominant, um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well, and they're winning because God, I hate touch whiz, motor, Motorola's  given up blur, uh, HTC as nice as the HTC sense five is it's still no, no  competitor to the Google experience.  So, um, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, this is such a, there's your proof of the reason to protect.  Right.  Is it even, even when you're authorized and do everything right and add this  layer on top, it's cruft.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, I, you know, I think this is an argument that most of the people who use  Android don't really appreciate and understand, but it's good one for us to have.  What conclusions did you draw on all about Android last night?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Um, pretty much what we know, what we said that this is, you know, that, that  Android maybe isn't as open as, you know, we like we, and I say we like developers  like to think that, that it is, that it is kind of a marketing term, um, that, that  we, you know, celebrate every time Google releases a Google app in the Play Store,  you know, like the keyboard and the camera, you know, like the, the, the, the,  the Google experience apps, but that, and this is Ron's point in the article,  every time that happens, that means that there's an open source app, which has  been abandoned, uh, which, and which development will not continue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Abandoned by Google has no responsibility to, to do that.  That's the open source community.  If it wants that app should continue to support it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But Google doesn't accept, doesn't take code contributions from anyone else.  Only authors of AOSP are Googlers.  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well, they got to change that.  If you're going to, if you're going to do a Google keyboard, then the AOSP  keyboard has to be released to the open source community so they can maintain it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Exactly.  And it is released, it's released in the AOSP code that gets, you know, sort of  batch dropped by Google, you know, whatever it each release, right.  But it's not as far as I, as far as I know, there are no other companies  authoring Android modifications.  And those are getting, those aren't getting accepted back into the canonical  AOSP.  It's a one way street.  It's a one way street.  Yeah.  So that's, you know, that's like open in mostly, you know, mostly in name.  So, so yeah, the conclusion was that, um, it's just a kind of an awareness of,  you know, every time we're like, yay, Google play services is awesome.  It's also like, boo, any app that uses Google play services, ain't going to run  in any other distribution of Android.  And there's lots of other distributions of Android.  It's not just FireOS.  I mean, China, you know, no one in China could use Google services.  They're all, you know, most Chinese users are using some sort of fork of Android  without, without all the Google services on top.  I'd love to know what Steve Kondik thinks of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The, the author, the creator of Cyanogenmod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We, I'd love to get him on the show sometime.  I know he's a busy guy and he's got his new company and all, but, um, we should  try, we should try to get him sometime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Chad or Karsten, let's go for Steve Kondik, K-O-N-D-I-K.  We're going to add him to our list for either triangulation or, uh, twig.  Cause he must have, I mean, he, of anybody, he would be the one who's  really caught in the middle.  He makes the open source version basically, or his co, his, not his  company, but his, his project, Cyanogenmod.  Although there are lots of mods now using open source.  I don't know.  I mean, I think you could argue that it's the best of both worlds.  We have really a very vibrant ecosystem right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  And, and, and Laroman in the chat room, of course, anybody could take the  AOSP source code and modify it and update all those apps and maintain that separately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's right.  That's what Cyanogen does.  It just, you know, it adds another layer of, you know, I would love to see Google  accept that back into the project and have those apps, those stock apps grow and,  and reflect the modern, modern Android design principles, uh, then, then have  another, yet another entity kind of maintaining that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's take a break when we come back.

Now for Gina Trapani's tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'll admit it.  I saved this one from the change log because I just thought it'd be a cool  tip.  Um, new Google search results.  Fun.  If you search for an artist songs, then you'll get a list of their songs.  So I, today I Google Pat Benatar songs.  Really love, love, love my big sister in the eighties.  I thought she was like the coolest woman to ever hold a guitar.  Heck yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So you search for Pat Benatar songs and at the top of your search results,  or there you go, you tried prints.  You get a list, a scrolling list.  So now, so now click on one of the songs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I play one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it'll fill.  Oh dang, try another one.  Oh, so some of them, if there's a YouTube video, there's a video, there's a video.  Then you can click on the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, actually this is on not on YouTube, but on guavaleaf.com.  Well, I think that's good because it shouldn't just be YouTube.  Should it?  It should be whoever's got video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It should be whoever got the video.  Right.  Let's pick one that purple rain's got to be on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is from myvideo.de.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it isn't just, okay.  1999 will be on YouTube.  No, eighties video.tv.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's interesting.  You get a video, you get a video to play with the song.  Now I wish you could play the video in line and search results.  It does make you pop another tab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looks like it's about to do that, but it doesn't.  It doesn't.  Well, I'm kind of glad it doesn't do Vivo or, uh, or YouTube here, but it's,  you know, it's, it's open.  What are you searching for?  Jonathan Colton?  Yeah.  There's YouTube.  So Joko has a full screen YouTube link there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's interesting that the YouTube videos are a larger size than other videos.  Of course they are.  So yeah, I spend all morning.  Of course it's Prince.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Prince doesn't allow his stuff up there.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  That's right.  Right.

And I was on a panel with, um, uh, Chris pool, uh, and Matt Honan about, about  anonymity, uh, but, but Google announced some really important things there.

It announced you proxy, uh, from university of Washington, which allows  users in countries like China to access the internet as seen by a friend in a  different and uncensored country.  They put out, if you go to Leo or Chad, if you go to digital attack map.com,  you see that they have a map of current DDoS attacks going on around the world  from, from and where, uh, so, so they're doing a lot about, about security, uh,  because of people in conflict zones.
