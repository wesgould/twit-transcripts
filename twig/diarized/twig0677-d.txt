I don't know why.  But I am supposed to be usual.  You seem like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've heard of talk of TikTok in pre-show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what it was.  It cheered me up.  See?  Yeah.  We were dancing to ringtones with Mr. Jeff Jarvis, the Lenin Tower Professor for Journalistic  Innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University  of New York.  Do they have a dance like C-U-N-Y?  And our football games.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  The big football.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Big football powers.  CUNY.  The big football power.  CUNY's stickball.  Pickleball.  And here she is, the star of Pickleball Bainbridge.  Stacy Higginbotham and Stacey on IOT.  Pickleball historian.  Pickleball historian Stacey Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nothing to do with Pickleball.  Everything to do with the IOT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're married to Pickleball.  That's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am a Pickleball widow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pickleball widow.  Stacey on IOT.com, the website, the podcast, the IOT podcast with Kevin Toffle and of course  her newsletter, which is highly recommended to all.  Google threw us a big curve yesterday.  They released Android 13.  What?  You were expecting 14?  No, we were expecting September.  Did you introduce Ann?  Yeah.  I started with Ann.  I missed that.  I went from this way.  I usually go that way.  But this time I went this way.  I went left to right instead of right to left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have I mentioned that I have a cold and apparently just zoning in and out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's going to be fun.  It's okay.  Have you waffled up yet?  Pixel, folks, you can now get Android 13.  Roughly a month ahead of schedule, I think.  Usually they release it with the pixel release of the hardware, Pixel 7.  Still don't know when that's going to be.  It's not surprising because Beta 6 came out last week and it was pretty solid.  There are quite a few features.  In fact, Michal Raman, who is a regular on, he works at Asperio, but he's a regular on  all about Android, has his Android 13 change log, which Jeff pointed out is a 169 minute

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  read.  It is a lot of deep thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We could take the rest of the show and then some to talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Holy cow to talk about all this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did not get it yet.  I think it's a rollout.  It will go to other phones, of course, but usually pixels get the newest version of Android  way ahead of everybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you can't go back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, that's a big part of the story.  I don't remember that happening before.  Maybe it did.  Maybe it did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was like, I don't think so, but I'm not an Android historian, so I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you know, you could root the phone and go back, obviously, but Google gives you  no way to roll back.  So should we start with the letter A?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How about we start with the letter P as in performance?  Is this going to run with a ding or should we go to interface user interface?  Is it going to be a craptastic mess as the previous version was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  People on the...  I thought you were not bitter anymore, Ant.  I thought you were happy now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Again, the dag gum hardware is pretty cool.  Android 13 is now officially rolling out for Google Pixel phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stop making noise there.  Thank you.  I'm playing the nine to five Google video with all the features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder how long that is.  That's 23 minutes.  They must move a little faster than Michelle.  But the people who have been using the beta, Ant, to answer your question, and I've been  following this on Reddit, have been pretty happy with it.  They say the battery life is better for the most part.  They say the fingerprint reader works very nicely now.  The biggest thing is, you're absolutely right, is how it looks.  Material design is now throughout and even many apps, all the app icons.  Is that a picture of...  Tim Cook.  That's a picture of Tim Cook.  So whoever this is, Android nine to five Google...  Is a trader.  Is a trader.  Is a trader or trolling?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think he's probably trolling, don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are a few other kind of interesting features according to nine to five Google  at the highest level.  You can...  Smart home controls show up on the lock screen.  I know Stacey will be happy with that.  You don't have to unlock your phone, for instance, to turn off your lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they brought that back because they had said they moved it for security reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.  It's optional.  Users can determine whether it's enabled in the display settings.  Quick settings have been reorganized.  This is a look at the quick settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did it have spatial audio before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think that's new.  In fact, Bluetooth is also...  I thought that was on the Apple, right?  Yeah.  Bluetooth has also been updated.  There's a new Bluetooth audio codec.  There's a lot of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just a lot of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I think...  I don't know.  Did they cover this on All About Android yesterday?  Jason, did you cover it?  I feel like they might not have...  You know, might have just snuck up on them.  Oh, you did?  Okay, they did.  So if you weren't all the details...  Snuck up on me?  I didn't know about it till later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're not watching All About Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have duties at home.  A great show.  I've got to scrub the floors, set the fires up for the next morning, make sure the chamber  pots are clean, that kind of thing.  I'm a busy person at night.  No, I missed it, unfortunately.  I'm sorry to say.  You can now toggle the flashlight quickly, which is great.  Really great.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like that.  That's a simple pleasure for someone that takes their dogs out at night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Android 13 Easter egg.  Google continuing with that tradition.  Go to settings, About Phone, go to the Android version and quickly tap 13 and something magical

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  will happen.  Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think one of the reasons...  I'm curious why they released it, you know, roughly a month early or earlier than anybody  expected.  I think one of the reasons might be tablets.  Remember, Google has been making Android better for tablets, they say.  I'm wondering if they want to announce a tablet or others are going to announce a tablet.  The taskbar has application suggestions in a drawer to access your apps and open them  in split screen mode via drag and drop.  Multi window mode now on by default for all apps.  This is looking a little bit more like the new iPad multi window operating system.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, anyway, surprise, it's here.  Android 13 with the August security patches is live.  You can download Pixel factory images and over the air, although again, not for everybody  all at once.  Get in line, queue up.  Beta program does remain open.  If you are in the beta and you've been using the beta, there will be a chance to test feature  drops as they come up.  They now do those monthly.  After those enrolled in the program get the final release, you could opt out.  If you go to the developer site, google.com slash Android, go to the beta section, you  can opt out and you won't have to wipe your phone again.  Oh, nice.  But do make sure you have the final version before you quit.  You kind of have this window between getting the final version of 13 and then starting  the new betas, the feature drop betas.  AOSP, the open source project will get Android 13, which means that other manufacturers can  start working on vetting it for their platforms, including the Samsung's ASUS HMD, which are  the Nokia phones, Motorola, OnePlus, Oppo, etc.  Xiaomi.  So, for all the deets, I think all about Android's place to go because there's 169 minutes of

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  features.  Can I change my colors to be the colors that I actually want instead of these?  Nope.  It's got to be the wallpaper color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Colors do you want, yeah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're calling orange, which looks like salmon.  It's not the same.  It's just not the same.  They tried to match it up with my image background, which has orange, you know, because it's got  a Clemson picture.  But everything sort of looks like this salmon color and a little bit of magenta.  Not my thing, but had to deal with it because there's no other way to change it.  It's either that or green or some crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So apparently, I didn't realize this, 12L had, I had not upgraded to 12L, but 12L had  some form of spatial audio.  But now they've got head tracking support.  So as you move your head around, spatial audio produces immersive audio that comes from all  around you.  Of course, your media has to be multi-channel.  On Apple's, it's still be Atmos encoding.  I'm not sure what they're using here.  Users with an audio specializer service may have a toggle on Bluetooth settings to enable  spatial audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Have you used spatial audio?  I have.  And how how wowie is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Apple, when they rolled it out, you know, Apple's very good at marketing.  They had a playlist to show you the difference.  And they had one of their DJs from their radio service come on and say, now this is what  mono sounded like.  And then along came stereo and it opened up.  And so you go from mono to stereo.  That's nice.  But now the next wave and they had go to spatial and it's kind of like the difference in mono  and stereo.  Like it the soundstage gets bigger.  But there's a problem with spatial audio, which is you don't really want tubas coming  from behind you.  You know, we're all kind of conditioned to the idea that even at a concert or at a movie  or anywhere you're listening to music, the music is in front of you.  So stereo makes sense because now you have a soundstage in front of you with left and  right spatial.  You know, for instance, when they do spatial audio of classical music, it still comes  from in front of you.  What you get in the spatial stuff is more echoes from the behind you.  You know, it gives you a room, right?  The room feel.  But then there's people with VR that makes sense.  Yeah.  Well, no, even for like you want a concert hall experience.  But the problem is pop music and other music, which is not recorded in a concert hall, they  will put the flutes up in the air or the tubas behind you and stuff.  And it just to me, it's a little gimmicky.  Maybe we're just getting used to it.  They're just learning about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But isn't it more for like the gaming experience?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no.  Apple's pushing all music.  They're pushing all producers produced your music in Dolby Atmos.  Oh, wow.  They've got tools to do it.  So and they're pitching it like NPR podcasting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  People want to use it to share what we are.  The sound of the door creaking can be over here or there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but you know, you can do that with stereo.  You only have two ears and you are able to simulate yourself.  I'm torn between its gimmicky and it's Apple's pitching it as like first there was mono,  then there was stereo.  Now there's spatial.  It's like that big of a jump.  Quadraphonic.  Yeah, we had quadraphonic back in the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe I mean, maybe for I'm just trying to think about things like if you imagine the  metaverse, right?  So if you imagine that you could actually be immersed in the space and look around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you'll need it for games in metaverse.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'm just saying like if everything becomes highly personalized and is in the virtual  environment, then it might make sense to be like, look, every experience is unique.  You can have this experience like everybody is playing literally just for you.  I don't know.  I'm just trying to think about like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't at all question its usefulness in gaming.  They've had it for a long time in gaming or metaverse applications where stuff is all  around you.  I'm thinking for music, it's to me, I think it's probably not as big a leap as mono to  stereo.  It's kind of, you know, if done right, it's okay.  But have you listened to it too?  I mean, are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I haven't.  But I just listening to what you describe, it just makes more sense far as how big the  leap was from mono to stereo, far as music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was huge.  And that's kind of why Apple did this whole thing.  See, here's mono, here's stereo.  Here's spatial.  But it's not.  And, you know, I went out just to try it to get apples.  I got the expensive Apple Max headphones and they are probably max.  But the problem with that is that's Bluetooth and Bluetooth is highly compressed.  So it's not the music is not as good as on good headphones.  So but it does.  I think it works still with regular headphones wired if you do it right.  And you can hear it.  You can hear it in speakers too, by the way.  Don't have to wear headphones to get it.  And it's it's a little more spacious.  There's a better soundstage.  I think if it's used, if it's done properly, it probably is an improvement.  It's to me, it's it's a little it's not gimmicky, but it's a little overhyped, perhaps.  Anyway, for the answer, you can get it.  Yeah, I over answered, but thank you for.  Would you like to hear my 169 minute explanation?  Let's see, there is now screen resolution settings in Android 13.  I think that tells you a little bit about the tablet future.  Lots of stuff, lots of guest profiles, clipboard, editor overlay.  I'm just looking at Michelle's very long list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm curious to see how many more Android tablets will be seen in the wild.  Once this release happens, if it's something that's going to really harness the power of  a tablet's display, will people really decide to get more interested in it  beyond the iPad?  Because right now it's pretty much just the Samsung devices, if that.  But most of the time, it's an iPad you see out there, even at a daggum  gas station, it's an iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe related, maybe an Android tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there's going to be a lot.  And I think Google is going to announce one, honestly.  Google, remember at I.O., they were talking about, you know, how you're going to do  better support. I feel like they're they're angling to announce it.  Not I'm sorry to say, not a Pixelbook.  Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wipe the tears, Mr. Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He already got something.  We can we can stop feeling so sad for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, feel sad for me.  Android police says that the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro, the phones that Google  also teased at Google I.O. may have just passed through the FCC.  So they're they're poised.  They're ready for a launch sometime soon.  I mentioned in the past, Google's announced it ahead of Apple and after Apple.  There is a strong rumor now that Apple's event will be September 7th.  So if Google is going to announce their Pixel 7,  they got a couple of weeks before Apple, they got  a couple of weeks to do that.  If they're going to do it after Apple, well, then they got a lot more.  My Nexus 7.  I missed the Nexus 7.  Wasn't that great? But you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And they've they've they killed the habit of it.  If they if they made that continuously, I'd still have the latest Nexus 7.  But now I agree.  Yeah, but I had life without it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You ran it if it still ran Android 12.  I don't know. That's a different story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yeah, but yeah, yeah.  But the Pixel 7 is probably close to seven inches.  They knew new iPhones could be six point seven inches.  I bet you this is six point seven, six point eight.  So you're getting your seven inch tablet.  It's just a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How big is the Pixel 6?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a good question. I don't know.  I think it's about six point seven inches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, because this doesn't feel like my Nexus 7.  Six point seven inches.  Yeah, yeah. Well, it's still different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's little that point three inches makes all the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, no, it was I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bezels. It had big bezels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, bezels. Yeah, big bezels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so I'm sure that the seven will be at least six point seven.  I don't see why. I don't think it'll get much bigger  because that seems to be the sweet spot.  Six point seven inches.  Anyway, see, we started with Google News.  Yeah.  So the reason just so you know why you can't roll back to 12  is because of a security issue.  Google released Android 13 today.  This is nine to five Google.  It's a permanent upgrade.  This is unusual.  Android updates are usually reversible.  If you site, you could sideload it,  but you will have to reset the phone.  I bet you could still do this,  but maybe you have to root it first.  This is this is Google says where it hosts the factory images.  Warning, the Android 13 update for the Pixel 6, Pixel 6 Pro  and the Pixel 6A contains a bootloader update.  Oh, that increments the anti rollback version.  After flashing an Android 13 build in these devices,  you will not be able to flash older Android 12 builds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that means you can't even sideload it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, sounds like you can't even.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is truly irreversible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google says the bootloader version used previously had a security vulnerability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Michelle Raman, one of the first to bring it to our attention.  Google warning reads, if this is flashed,  you cannot go back to an old Android build.  This is on your current version Android 12.  Your device is running a vulnerable version of the bootloader.  After flashing this build, your device's anti rollback counter  will be incremented to prevent previous vulnerable versions of the bootloader  from being flashed on the device in the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow.  Is the bootloader part of the AOS ASOP  to where we can go to someone outside of Google to investigate  whether this flaw was there or not, or is this just Google saying,  you know what, we're tired of this particular version, we're going to lock it down.  Same way Apple sort of does these types of restrictions  with no rhyme or reason just because they can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The bootloader is vendor proprietary.  OK.  So that's why.  So it's not part of AOSP.  OK. So that's why, for instance, Samsung has done this in the past  with what they call a triangle with a triangle update  to prevent people from flashing routing and flashing alternate firmware on there.  It would have a little triangle that you only had.  I think you can only do it three times.  I can't remember. I dimly remember the details.  But but various manufacturers have have had modified  bootloaders that would prevent you from.  Rooting and roaming.  OK, so it's up to the vendor to do the bootloader.  Now, I don't know if Google provides a reference bootloader.  I bet you they do. That would be pretty common.  So what I'm not sure then is if the security flaw in Google's bootloader  is in other bootloaders as well. Hmm.  That's it. It's an interesting question.  So it sounds like.  Google is doing what Samsung used to do, which is locking down.  Their their pixels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I seem to remember hearing about the lockdown Samsung devices,  and which is why Motorola was really popular amongst the hacker community,  because their bootloader was right pretty much wide open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google has always been agnostic on the idea of rooting your phone.  So, you know, with any operating system, there's an administrative user.  There's a super user in the UNIX world.  It's called Root sometimes.  That root user has all permissions.  They can erase anything. They can do anything.  It's for security reasons.  You you don't usually operate as root user.  And in some situations, you're never given a root user  on both Windows and.  Actually, Windows, I think administrative users are root users.  I'm not sure, but I think, yeah, you do have full access on Macintosh.  You have to explicitly give somebody those permissions on Linux.  You know, you very rarely will use the root.  And by the way, Android is Linux.  You'll very rarely use the root account, except for special things.  So Google's always kind of been agnostic, saying, well,  if the if the vendor wants to allow root, we're fine with that.  Android doesn't have an opinion on that.  But for security reasons, it sounds like that may be changing.  I don't know, Jason, what did you guys talk about that at all yesterday?  All about Android's the authority on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Absolutely. Anyway, I think I know what my Wednesday TV  view on will be.  Yeah, I'm going to watch it and then I'm going to go home and I'm going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to I think I'll put it on there.  Oh, they didn't cover that. Yeah.  I think I'll put it on.  You know what?  If now that you know the bootloader has a security flaw in Android 12,  maybe you should get off of Android 12 and get on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm like, yeah, I feel like I don't like being the first,  you know, to do this, but I'm also like, oh, well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just said in the RSC that I was just going to wait on it to happen.  I wasn't going to force the update, but she's well patching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's interesting.  I don't think Google has said emergency emergency.  Yeah, let me let me I have to look more at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the person has to have physical access.  I think so.  In the case of yes.  OK, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that that is, you know, that's a good point. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I always forget to find where the UI  I check on my see if there's a new version, if it'll download for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  about phone, something like that.  There I'm there.  And system update at the very bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Nope, not there for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the tweet from Flawed World, a warning to AOSP developers  on sixth generation pixels, a.k.a. the Pixel 6.  Ensure you flash Android 13 to both slots, because if you're a third,  there's a there's a the one that you use and then there's kind of a backup  case of something goes wrong with the with the first ROM.  A13 if the A13 fails to boot and falls back to the A12 bootloader,  your phone will be perma.  Son of a mother.  Now, I presume the official update will automatically do that.  Put Android 13 in both hopes of both slots.  But wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Permabricked a formal word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that it's not in Webster's, but it is certainly something.  I've never heard that.  But that is really accurate.  It's a good name. Permabrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Extra bricked.  Well, it's like you could brick it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we had to make up perma brick because initially brick was brick.  Right. If something's if something's bricked, it's a brick.  You can't restore it to anything with it.  But I think there's soft bricking.  And so they really he really want to underscore this is this is a permanent

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  permanent nature of this.  This is a perma brick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess it soft bricking makes sense.  Thinking back to the old Kindle fire days, you could pretty much beat those things up,  but still figure out a way to bring them back to life as long as you could connect to them  physically with the cable.  So, yeah, I guess perma brick is you're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Now, you're done.  Let's let's wait and see what what the rumors and others come up with.  So they were able to get around Samsung's triangle blocking Mr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jarvis. I'm sorry.  It's not about phone system.  It's just scroll down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I always have to go to like four different places.  I'm always like, is the phone?  No. Is it the OS?  No. Is it? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Honestly, I usually just type in.  The little search feature.  Yeah, I just type in.  Can you ask?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can you ask Google?  Can you be like, hey, G.  Can I just put in 30?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just put in UP and it already brought up updates.  Oh, fast. And is it there?  Yeah, well, I didn't check, but it's just if I want to check system updates, it's right.  First thing I'm going to do is go home and try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Mary Jo Foley, who has a Pixel 6 XL, said she hadn't been offered it as of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mine has not been offered.  I just checked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What do we have to do?  Make a Google podcast together?  Peace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You'll get it. Just be patient.  So much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have to burn the appropriate dessert and call on the spirit of Andy Rubin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is the case that that's the people who are getting the warnings, people who, like,  you know, are impatient and going over to the ROMs and downloading and doing it themselves.  Those are the ones like Flawed World who are.  Oops. So don't just let Google do it.  Let go and let Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google knows best. Google knows best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google has 310 results coming up for the words permabricked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there are.  Thank you, Rick Khan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rick Khan's doing the research.  I often think of our IRC chat as kind of our research assistants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  I think more than our research assistants, they're really the people keeping us honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, that too.  Yes, well said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I might point out that a number of those results are for something you can buy  called permabrick for your walls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a different kind of permabrick.  OK, so there is, in fact.  Ballistic walls.  Did I see ballistic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did see ballistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's so people can't, you know, high security facilities can't drive through it.  And yeah, they're crash resistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Next to his Trump's wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The hurricane fence.  No, but look, there's a perma fence, perma sound, perma wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm only getting computer results.  I got nine hundred and seventy six results.  And there are those Google knows you geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's interesting that I got

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  when I search for my related searches are like make boot image.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The number one result for me was classic brick walls.  Permabrick from permacastwalls.com.  Wait a minute. Here's permatint.  The leader in brick staining products.  Ah, but here we go.  Permabrick on XDA forums.  Now slash verb.  This is the real thing.  Describes what a phone or other device has been made totally useless  in a form that is unrecoverable through normal methods.  Yeah, that's what I'm searching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Permabrick.  So I'm searching as a verb.  Oh, that's why.  This permabrick search for the grid is what you get after Brexit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You are permanently British.  You are no chance of coming out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. Yes.  Now I get concrete for you and other exciting.  Yes, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the bill has been signed into law.  Hey, inflation reduction act,  which really doesn't have anything to do with inflation, but, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's really good name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. If the other side can know, because I already have iris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You already have iris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  IRAs. Oh, it is IRAs.  Retirement accounts.  What is the Irish Republican Army?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Joe Biden signed it into law yesterday.  Lots of things  will be impacted.  The White House did get him out a list of electric vehicles  that will be eligible this year for the clean vehicle credit,  including the Ford Mustang Mach-E.  Thank you very much.  The Ford F Series.  That's the Lightning Transit Van Jeeps,  Lincoln's, Lucid's, Nissan's, Rivian's, Volvo's next year.  BMWs, Mercedes, Nissan's.  But EVs that have used up their tax credits.  Shame on you.  The 2022 Chevy Bolt, EUV, the regular Bolt, the Hummer pickup,  the Tesla models, 3S, X and Y.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it's a really weird market intervention here just because.  Yeah. Oh, gee, we rushed and we got out EVs so we can sell to the public.  Oh, well, now you're kind of screwed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are all these rules, though.  You have to have a certain amount of it has to be made in the US or North  America, I guess.  An expansion.  You have to assemble it in North America.  Yeah. Yeah, there's lots of rules.  But I have mixed feelings about, you know, I'm all for battery electric  vehicles and certainly government subsidies early on made it possible.  But really, those were luxury vehicles.  Yeah. So the benefit went to rich people who might have bought these anyway.  I mean, like, what about the Prius?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Every Uber driver or Lyft driver drove a Prius.  Yeah, but that's a hybrid. That's not eligible for the.  These are for what about a leaf?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, wait a minute. Maybe I'm wrong.  Did did hybrids get credits?  Maybe they did. I might be wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, Leo, in this list, it lists only three models have a 2023.  Is that because that's when the new restrictions come in?  I'm confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think it's just because these are the only I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know. 20 model year 20.  Oh, it's just the model year.  These are early 2023 model years. That's all.  You know how the model year begins in like September.  So these these are the ones have been announced and the leaf is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's the Volvo brand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Polestar, is that what you're thinking of?  Yeah, I don't see that.  I don't see no Polestar.  We haven't sold that many.  It's not assembled in North America. Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it assembled in Sweden?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Probably.  So who would you would you rather have a  drunk Swede assemble your vehicle?  I don't think so.  No, I think those Polestar is actually pretty nice.  It's a Swedish brand headquartered outside Gothenburg.  Vehicle production and boy takes place in China.  They're built in China.  I can pretty much guarantee  you're not going to get a credit for a vehicle built in China.  Lots of other things in the IRA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's all I have to say about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are these cars still starting out at like 30 grand?  Oh, more than much more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The only one that's affordable is the Bolt.  I think.  OK.  Elon wanted to make the model three thirty five thousand.  He's not gotten down below forty five thousand as far as I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like a vehicle is just expensive, right?  Like, but they're a lot less expensive because the problem is the battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You want for fifteen to twenty thousand.  It's still a serviceable car for.  Yeah, the battery is a significant part of the cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why. However.  You know, you save money,  a lot of money on gasoline and maintenance and all that.  We got a Chevy Bolt for close to 20 after the federal and state credits.  Oh, nice. Yeah, that's a nice.  It's actually a really nice battery electric vehicle.  Good range. Sure.  A few of them have blown up, but that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's just the risk you have to take, man.  It's just life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Salesman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Eric Duckman says.  The Kia electric looks nice to me.  They're nice. Kia's are very nice.  Yeah, I like them. Nice.  There's also the Ionix.  There's quite a few really nice.  And again, thanks to Elon and Tesla for making that market take off.  I think they really did make that.  And the feds and their subsidies definitely helped.  But there are very many inexpensive  BVs, battery electric vehicles, because of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Would you get a Rivian?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they're cute.  We did a Sam and Bulls Sam or a car guy did a review  comparing the lightning to the Rivian and lightnings, the Ford F-150,  the Rivian is this new R1T  from a company called Rivian, and he liked them both.  There's some you know, Ford's made a lot of trucks in their time, a lot of F-150s.  So he thinks it probably better, a better truck  for a little convenience reasons as much as anything else.  I think he liked the lightning.  But it's good power, gum house with that.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  In theory, any car, any electric vehicle can.  You need an inverter for the battery.  The lightning comes with it built in, but you can always get an inverter  for your battery and plug your electric vehicle and power your house.  In fact, my house is powered by two recycled Tesla batteries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The cheapest electric vehicles out there are indeed the Chevy.  Oh, I keep wanting to say I'm like not the same.  That's 26, five.  And then the Leaf is 28, nine.  And then we get into the leaf.  Still qualifies. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The only reason the Chevy's most is not is because they've sold more than 200,000 of them.  I mean, that's, you know, that's the same thing for the Tesla.  You've sold enough that they're no longer subsidized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And when you get into these mid-range ones, they're kind of terrible.  Like the Mini Cooper for 30,000, it's only goes 114 miles.  That's its range. Yeah.  That's what Lisa drives. Mazda's 100. Yeah.  Yeah, these kind of suck. Pepper. Pepper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She loves it. But we have a longer range vehicle.  Obviously, because that you could barely get to the airport and back.  So it's not ideal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What do you find if you're have you gone on overnight trips and things  where you've got to find some place to charge? No problem. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We went down to Carmel. There's chargers everywhere.  There is an issue. And I think I just saw an article about it.  There is an issue with unfortunately, a lot of the electric chargers are unmonitored.  You know, not like a gas station where there's somebody there.  And so they're in there.  And yeah, they're grumpy, but they're there.  And there are a lot of gas vehicle drivers who don't like electric,  who will these get vandalized and damaged frequently.  And so it's a little disappointing.  You know, you've got a map. It says there's a charger here.  You get there and they're out of commission because somebody's torn them off or something.  But there are everywhere.  We went to Carmel. We found a low, you know, a charge point.  I had to leave the car there overnight.  It wasn't a fast charger, but it's fine.  You know, parked it there.  How far away was it from the hotel? A couple of blocks.  Many hotels now have a destination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, here's another question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sorry. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I was going to say we were in Portland and we could destination charge  at the hotel. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Newark Airport parking has slots.  And let's say you're going away for a week.  Yes. You can't.  You're monopolizing it for a week.  Yeah, they'll charge you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We so there was a there was in Austin.  There was a like a park and ride.  It wasn't a park and ride, but whatever.  They had those slots and you just booked those slots  and you could stay there for the whole time.  That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But like the ones in the parking lot and the long term parking at the airports,  I don't know what you're supposed to do.  Maybe it's for people on an overnight trip.  I don't get it.  Because, yeah, if you're gone a week, you're going to leave it plugged in for a week.  Or do you or does your wife come on, plug it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are you charged for the time it's plugged in or you charge for the electricity

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that you don't? Most of those, they charge you while you're charging for electricity.  Then you get like an hour grace period and then they start charge you for parking there.  Well, wow.  Which is not ideal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, maybe they just charge you at the normal overnight rate there, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't you know, I don't really look into Oakland Airport has them.  The nice thing is they're right by the terminal.  So you could just whiz in, pull in, charge it.  And then but I think it's not right to do that.  By the way, the credit also, I think it's not right.  The credit also applies to used battery electric vehicles.  So there so that's going to be interesting.  That's going to jumpstart that market, so to speak.  And I think that's good.  I think that's good.  All right.  I think we've said enough about the I are actually there's lots more to say, but I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that's the. Oh, do you want to go ahead, Stacey?  I'm super excited because it offers residential tax breaks for residential upgrades for things  like demand response.  And I'm really hopeful we'll see one, the adoption of like more heat pumps and things  like that. But yes, yes, much more intelligence being put into like the end nodes of the grid  so we can start coordinating between those two better.  So I was excited about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Eighty billion in rebates as much as fourteen thousand dollars in money back helping households  pay for green energy upgrades, including efficient heat pumps.  You can get eight thousand dollars back per household, which is great.  I've been wanting to replace my furnaces with a heat pump.  Much more efficient. Right, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So much more efficient.  And like you don't have heating oil deliveries and that's disgusting anyway.  I will tell you, though, you're going to have a fee for decommissioning your heating oil  tank if you formally do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have gas furnaces, natural gas furnaces, so that won't be so difficult.  Electric water heaters, you can get money for that if you have a gas heater and electric

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  cooktops. We've been wanting to buy an induction induction induction, not conduction induction.  I've had it now for. Do you love it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love it. I really do.  Last year, right? Yeah.  Well, was it last year? Early this year, January?  I don't know. Yeah, it's awesome.  Like, yes, I had to relearn how to cook rice on it, but that's OK.  You have to do that for every new stove.  It like you just clean it like a minute after.  Like it doesn't get hot.  And the pots are cleaner, easier to clean.  I don't know about that.  If you've got stainless steel, I mean, you do have to replace all your pots.  It's expensive. But.  It just it's a great cooking experience, and it's so exact.  Oh, I love it. I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Can I recommend online 97?  Hank Green did a really, really good explainer of the IRA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, thank you, Hank Green.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So should we watch the whole thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You could know you can just watch a minute of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think we can watch any of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  As we'll get taken down by Hank Green.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can I can share.  There was a famous last words.  A lovely graphic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We had I put I put eight seconds of Colbert.  Was it Colbert? Who was it?  No, it was. Yeah, it was Colbert in twit.  And pardon me.  It was his severance.  It was a clip of his parody of Severance.  Put this much in it.  And I chickened out at the end because Lisa said, you know,  yeah, we only have maybe 5000 to 7000 downloads of the show on YouTube.  But we're right on the edge of deliverables.  And if you if we lose those 7000, we might have to do make goods  for every ad on which should be a lot of money.  And so I chickened out, even though I know I have every right to do it.  It was commentary, it was transformational.  It didn't it promoted his show.  It didn't cost him a few.  I mean, in every respect, it was, of course, perfectly OK.  It was news coverage.  But I chickened out.  So I'm not playing no Hank Green.  I appreciate that.  I think so nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is that up to each creator as to whether or not they go after you?  Or is that YouTube? No, no, no, it's the creators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Other people can other people, though, can do it on their behalf, can't they?  Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And content ID, you know, Hank Green.  I don't know if Hank Green uses content ID. He might.  I don't know. Do you know he doesn't want to Twitter?  We're going to Twitter and ask him, ask him, Hank.  Can we have permission to show the biggest climate bill of your life?  But what does it do?  No, because we're going to make our own dang content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're not going to.  But our content isn't actually researched like I haven't finished reading the IRA,  even though I am reading it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Homeowners can receive a 30 percent credit for installing solar panels.  There will be substantial tax credits to transition to clean energy.  We mentioned electric vehicles.  It'll make it easy for families to actually make these clean energy changes.  Families who use funding from the bill to switch to greener technology  could save money as well on energy costs up to, according to Rewiring America,  eighteen hundred and forty dollars a year.  So there you go.  You're going to get faster tax refunds because  the IRS is going to hire new agents.  Prescription medication.  We know about that for seniors only.  The rest of you, sorry.  But Medicare is going to get to negotiate  drug prices, which has been huge, a huge issue.  We did, I'm sure, talk about the insulin issue.  Lower prices and other items.  Maybe eventually economists say it's unlikely the Inflation Reduction Act  will reduce inflation, at least anytime soon.  Maybe point one percentage points in about five years, according to Wharton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was still brilliant positioning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a very good name.  But a lot of things that I think, you know, it's really, you know,  it's stuff that is forward thinking,  especially with climate change breathing down our necks.  I think it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hank was quite enthusiastic.  About us playing it.  No, he hasn't answered yet.  He was quite enthusiastic about the he was he was arguing that this is a big deal, folks.  It really is the biggest environment we've had.  It's really going to make an impact.  People have been working really hard.  Finally, we see a little daylight.  I think that's the wrong word.  See, we didn't have to play it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just to summarize, you got my interpretation.  Yeah, hey, summarize it.  Can you do an interpretive dance?  To the tell you what, we'll save that for later.  We'll save that.  I was about to say, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You'll find out.  You'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In tick tock corner.  But hey, hey, hey, you're going to thank me.  I guarantee you, you're going to thank me.  All right. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Popular Houstonian and furniture guru Jim Mattress Mac Mcinvale  is now at a large amount of cash after he bet on the losing team for Super Bowl 56.  And our customers are the losers because we're going to raise prices on everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you're Mattress is older than 10 years old, if you live in Houston, you 100% know  who Mattress Mac.  I can't believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, my God.  Now we're going to get taken down by Mattress.  Back. That's exactly it.  Yeah. You don't trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Dare to. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Dare to dare to just say no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right, let's take a break.  I'll show you all the things kids you probably didn't know about yet, but now you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What happened to the war on drugs?  That's how I learned about a lot of drugs when I was like in fourth grade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did we just lose the war on drugs and give up?  Do we just, you know, walk away like the war on Covid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wasn't that like Nancy Reagan's thing?  She just I thought that was one of her things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. Chuck Norris did some ads for gallery furniture in 1992.  How about that? Am I encouraged in San Francisco?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a new book out about Crazy Eddie.  Oh, crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Mattress Mac was like crazy entity or crazy Eddie.

Transcript:  I can't tell what years of Breaking Bad and then an eight years of Better Call Saul.  15 years making this Heisenberg universe.  Yeah, this is a prequel.  So this is all before. No, no, no, no, it's both.  It's a prequel and a post school.  Oh, I see. It's very confusing.  But the reason I thought about this is because he became famous  for his ads on local Albuquerque TV for Saul Goodman.  He's a lawyer.  Fictionally, yes. Fictionally.  Well, and they were completely a parody of all these other ads.  They were hysterical.  Yeah. Anyway, it's over now.  Beautiful, beautiful show.  So our show today brought to you by Secureworks.  Let me talk about Secureworks a little bit.  If you think about it,  the biggest risk to your company is not knocking on your door.  It's the prowler who's already inside.  Like an intruder in your home who's sneaking around,  eating your food, watching your Netflix,  sleeping in the basement.  Wouldn't that be the worst to have an intruder in your IT infrastructure?  Think of the damage they could do, how many passwords they could compromise,  the documents they could steal, how many systems they could damage or degrade.  Threat actors often hide in plain sight in IT systems  and on average, more than 200 days before they're detected,  six months before they're detected.  And I can tell you story after story.  Remember the hacker who got into the Sony Pictures Entertainment  was there from May through December before Sony noticed.  Meantime, they have to sell trade all the movies, the contracts,  and then they trigger ransomware as just kind of a final farewell.  What happens when stopping at the end point is stopping your ability  to properly defend your infrastructure, then you need secure works  and their TAGES Extended Detection and Response, XDR.  It's great to have a perimeter defense.  But when people get in and they will get in, you need to have more.  You need a comprehensive and effective security posture  with one unified singular point of view, giving you visibility  throughout your entire stack.  TAGES XDR is extensible.  It follows data moving beyond the perimeter.  It helps organizations unify prevention, detection and response  and completely mitigates this issue of siloed security solutions.  Probably what you have right now.  You've got endpoints, you've got perimeters, you've got maybe  you're going through email protection, but that leaves coverage gaps.  And of course, what's going to happen?  Bad guys are going to take advantage of them by organizing  multiple point solutions and creating one unified and clear picture  of your infrastructure.  TAGES XDR helps teams prevent threats effectively,  detects them rapidly and most importantly, respond appropriately quickly.  Secure Works meets customers where they are with managed XDR.  A lot of you might have a big IT team and you can manage it yourself.  But many of us are too small to do that.  Secure Works offers a SaaS solution that can leverage  their own in-house experts 24, 7, 365 days a year.  So they can help you.  They can investigate and respond to threats on your behalf,  which cuts 12 times, decreases operational burden, reduces your cost.  So if you've got a big team, fine, you can manage XDR by yourself.  But there is also a managed XDR solution for you.  And since most companies have a shortage of security talent,  this is something you also want to look at.  Let me give you a number.  Even if you're not a Secure Works customer, write this down,  put it on a Post-it note.  1-800-BREACHED.  Seize it, remember, right?  1-800-BREACHED.  If you're a Secure Works customer, even if you're not,  you can get fast emergency response  with chat, including incident commanders  who will find the root cause while preparing you for future threats.  They leap into action.  It's like 911 for  advanced persistent threats.  When your organization experiences a breach or a cyber attack,  time is of the essence.  You can't fuss around.

Have made a deal to get ratings for Thursday Night Football.  Amazon this year will own NFL's Thursday Night Football.  But traditionally, streamers do not have ratings, right?  In fact, this came up on MacBreak Weekly last week  because Ben Stiller, who created Severance and two of the stars  of another Apple TV show, its most popular, Ted Lasso,  all said we have no idea if anybody's watching.  I find this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I know there's not a third party.  I know there's not a third party audience.  There's no auditing.  And IP addresses.  Apple. Oh, Apple knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's what I think.  They're not telling anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's proprietary.  In this case, Amazon is the one who's asking for ratings when Amazon knows.  Amazon may want to be audited, but Amazon knows exactly how many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, because there's also over the air stations.  There's other it's also viewed on in bars and restaurants.  It's not just streamed.  So it's public place, too.  It's all so. So they so.  And but it is this is a big deal because historically  and we know this Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, they don't want to even Netflix.  They never say numbers.  No, they will never say numbers.  They don't want right for whatever reason.  Jeff, in this case, Amazon is the one asking for it doing the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Amazon could just reveal their number.  I think this is pressure.  From the advertisers would be my guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have a but didn't Nielsen have us pretty much as a solid name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Nielsen's been doing TV measurements since for time immemorial.  There's two companies.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's there's been some kind of scandals around that.  But the weird thing about Nielsen is, is it's a sampling.  Right. So they do people.  Me. Yeah.  Yeah. They have people, meters and that kind of stuff.  So so they only this is this is the problem with small niche things  is the odds that the one person who's sampling in Montana is watching your show.  Speaking for all of Montana, the statistics are pretty low  in a time of abundant choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nielsen said this will be the first time they'll they'll be doing measurements  on both a streaming service and a live streaming program.  I guess you just said the same thing.  Yeah. But that's what I'm reading.  This is tech crunch.  Nielsen said this will be the first time the firm will include a streaming service  and its live streaming program in its national TV measurement service.  I guess it's the first time they've ever done for streaming.  So is Thursday night, I guess, tell me, chat room,  is Thursday night football going to be on TV as well?  Or is it just on Amazon?  It used to all last year was a boat network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it used to only be on NFL network exclusively.  It wasn't something that ESPN would pick up.  It was just the right network.  And then they split it.  They were to be available on prime video.  Right. And NFL network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think NFL's got it anymore.  I think it's just Amazon.  That's what it reads, because remember, Amazon  did this big deal.  They got Al Michaels to come over from broadcast.  Kirk Herbstreet, I believe.  Yeah. And then there was a big, you know,  who's going to be number two with Al Michaels?  And Al had a lot of say in it because he didn't want to work with the doofus.  And I guess Herbstreet was good.  Kirk Herbstreet.  Or Herb Kirkstreet, whoever was just exactly who Al wanted.  Out of home viewing refers to bars, restaurants and hotels.  Anyway, it's interesting.  You're right, Jeff.  I mean, that was my thought is, well, doesn't Amazon already know exactly?  And there's no broadcast TV.  So for some reason.  Oh, okay.  Nielsen streaming TV charts now include Apple TV Plus for the first time.  Okay.  So that started last in October of last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So to answer your earlier question, I'm trying to look up everything that's behind the paywall.  But there were accusations that Nielsen was underreporting viewership numbers,  which is always the complaint.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That can't possibly be that low.  I know more people were watching, which probably means Nielsen was accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you ask me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But if no one believed it, why would they trust them, you know, years later?  Especially if they were getting it wrong.  You're right.  It's the only name in town.  I guess that's the only reason they were trusted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, they've been up for sale more.  I was on the original committee for the Audit Bureau of Circulations.  For magazines.  For magazines.  And they thought that advertisers would want an audit of the total audience of a magazine,  which of course they didn't because no longer did,  was it presumed that one person read the entire magazine and saw every ad.  So all they wanted was an audit of their flight of ads that was served.  And for example, GM in the early days said, very early days of the web said,  you ain't serving our ads, we're serving our ads ourselves so we know what gets served.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's what Amazon said.  Our collaboration with Nielsen will allow us to provide advertisers with familiar  campaign measurements to make Apple to Apple comparisons.  So this is exactly what I thought, which is advertisers saying,  yes, streamers, you tell us how many downloads, how many IP addresses.  But we want to know the same.  We want to know those numbers.  First of all, trust a third party.  Right.  Because we have the same problem in podcasting.  We want to trust a third party and we want those numbers to be the same kind of numbers  we get from the networks.  You know, share and ratings and a dominant area of dominant influence and all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But in a panel podcast could never show up.  Because the odds of a panel member having watched in the period or listened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This was a problem in tech TV because we were on cable and we got ratings.  But the number of people who watched, you know, the number of people who are on a panel  or had people meters, it's a statistical sample, right?  So they only give them to I don't know how many thousand people or something.  And that represents millions of people nationwide.  The problem is when a network audience is so low that one or two people are watching  or two people represent the entire audience in that thousand per person panel.  If one of those people gets sick or goes to the bathroom or dies, your audience just got  cut in half.  So that's the problem.  When you're really small, the ratings are terrible because it's impossible.  It doesn't work.  The whole panel system doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  By the way, update here.  Hank Green responds.  I think you should be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not going on.  I think you should be good.  Doesn't he know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's not a yes or no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Try it and see is what they say.  You gotta trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think you should be good.  I need a yes or no.  I ain't playing it.  Sorry.  You played.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You played the mattress guy.  You won't play Hank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think we'll get taken down because I played mattress Mike?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know.  You played a show about him.  That's what mattress Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mattress Mac.  You're going to get taken down because you just named him.  I don't know if Mattress Mac is on.  He's watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  Here's how they're going to do it.  They're not going to do their.  Nielsen will rely on a panel of 42,000 homes that it uses to measure traditional broadcasting  cable channels.  It's ridiculous.  Initially.  Oh, this is going to be terrible.  Nielsen will primarily measure Amazon viewers on TV sets.  The very fact that they use the phrase TV sets sounds like the 50s.  I am going to go home and watch the game on my TV set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Could you touch those great Amazon rabbit ears we got on that TV?  Boy, just gave us a great set of rabbit ears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it UHF or VHF?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nielsen will also track audiences on mobile phones, tablets and laptops.  Amazon will also provide advertisers with its own viewing data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which will show what BS Nielsen is.  That's going to be interesting.  But what's interesting about this is how much of an advertising company Amazon now is.  Its advertising revenue is bigger than the revenue of the entire magazine industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But think about this.  They spent for Thursday Night Football $1.2 billion a season for 11 seasons.  They spent big bucks.  So they're going to count somewhat on advertising revenue.  I think Amazon probably feels like it's also a benefit to Amazon Prime and so forth.  But I think they want to recoup some of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Can you all a cart stream just the football?  Or are you only for Prime?  Is it free with Prime?  What's the deal?  Oh, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's free with Prime Video.  Excuse me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think you can just buy the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  Exclusively on Prime.  I've watched it on Prime Video and I've not spent anything extra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I came with Prime last year.  But remember they were sharing it with...  Let me see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that's right.  They were sharing it with NFL.  It says included with Prime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Prime Video is the exclusive home of Thursday Night Football beginning in 2022.  15 regular season games.  They spent almost a billion dollars a game starting September 15th.  All are included with Prime and yes, you have...  Yeah, 1.2 billion dollars a year for 11 years.  Right, that doesn't come down to 1.2 billion a game.  Well, 1.2...  Oh, you're right.  Never mind.  I mean, I meant 100 million a game.  You're right.  Leomath.  I didn't divide right.  It's 1.2 billion dollars for 15 games.  So it's like 90 million or something a game.  That's what I think it is though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Those Thursday night games are usually pretty highly rated.  Are they?  Yeah.  They're hardly ever duds of football games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For a while.  I don't know why.  This was the game where they would wear neon uniforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's the thing.  They do the whole colorway uniforms.  Each team would have a special Thursday colorway uniform, but the games are usually pretty  entertaining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ant is like the only normal person in a whole world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he knows who Herb Kirkstreet is and I have to give him credit for that.  Kirkstreet.  I'm going to campaign to get him renamed.  If Al Michaels even once in those 15 games calls him Herb Kirkstreet, I'll be very happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know Herb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Every Thursday football game has multiple broadcasts options.  Well there's a typo right there.  Good job, Amazon.  Multiple broadcasts options to choose from, whether it's the primary broadcast featuring  Al Michaels and Herb Kirkstreet, an alternate stream such as TNF with Dude Perfect or TNF  in Espanol.  Each presentation of TNF on Prime Video offers a different set of alternate streams.  They did that last year too.  Like they would have Peyton Manning and Eli Manning doing the play-by-play of the game.  It was horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Can they have football for dummies too?  Dude Perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think he might be the guy.  He's your guy.  Really?  I don't know who's Dude Perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Dude, I think he's so dude, you don't explain it to me.  Because if you were a dude, you would need a relation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's an American sports and comedy group.  Tyler, Tony, twins Cory and Kobe Cotton, Garrett, Hilbert and Cody Jones, former college roommates  at Texas A&M baby.  That's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a different school.  It's not a school that I'm excited about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not the eyes of Texas are upon you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  No, that's like our arch rival.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, Dude Perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's Aggies for God's sake.  So they do, oh that's right, that's the Aggies.  So they do trick shots.  Yeah.  They're really good on YouTube.  Well that'll be great for hosting.  So this is what they do.  This is what Amazon is doing.  They're trying to get younger people to watch football, right?  So they get these YouTube stars doing it or something.  Yeah, my son probably knows who these guys are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dude Perfect was featured in, I think they were featured in the Super Bowl last year.  Oh really?  In LA, they came out and did an event with, you know how they have those cannons to shoot  t-shirts into the stands.  He has a pickleball racket.  They made another modified cannon that's big enough to shoot up to the top level of the  stadium.  Geez Louise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently you can go on a cruise with them.  That's a sure way to get COVID.  Tell me about it.  Tell me about it.  We should have said that about two months ago.  We did.  Anyway, oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, none of us were excited about cruise thoughts.  None of you thought this would end well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Meta has just decided to do, let's maybe we should turn that switch, flip that switch  on end to end encryption on Messenger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yeah, we did ask that last week.  Someone in Discord asked that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They flipped the switch after of course that horrible story about the mother and daughter  getting busted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's already on?  It's already literally flipped?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I'm logging in.  Okay, can you tell your friends at Condi and ask something for me?  Yeah.  So how many magazines does Condi have?  Quite a few, right?  Fewer now than they used to.  Yeah, there's the New Yorker, there's Vanity Fair, there's Wired.  So I have an account for several of their magazines, New Yorker and Wired.  But every time you log into Wired, which I'm trying to do, it doesn't take you to wired.com,  it takes you to Condi Nast.com.  And so it pops up my password for Condi Nast, which is not the same for Wired Digital.  So it breaks my password manager.  So we tell your friends at Condi to stop it.  Either come up with one subscription for everything.  SSO, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, Leo, I got Hank Green to say you can play the video, but you wouldn't listen  to him.  So why am I going to use your reputation for Condi?  I need your help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In order to sign into my account, I have to select all images with bridges.  You'd be good at this, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I need a trigger warning on that.  Where's a bridge?  Where is that a bridge?  That's an overpass.  That ain't a bridge.  That's an overpass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't see any other bridges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do you see any?  Underneath one, in the one in the middle, in the tic-tac-toe spot.  Is that a bridge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm under an overpass.  You're under an overpass.  What does that count or no?  Let's see.  Nope.  Oh, it was a bridge.  I told you.  Liars.  It wasn't a bridge.  It were both overpasses.  Overpasses.  Finally, I can read you this article.  Mena just...  So can you please talk to your friends at Condi Nast?  Tweet them, won't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No.  I used my poll with Hank.  It wasn't good enough for him.  Tweet him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not doing it.  Tweet him.  Meanwhile, in a move that Mena says is totally unrelated to the story from Nebraska, the  social media giant announced this morning, which was August 11th, so a few mornings ago.  Little behind.  Well, I don't do this show every day.  We haven't had a show since the 10th.  This was a day after the show last week.  The social media giant announced this morning, a week ago, that it is testing, testing expansions  of end-to-end encrypted messaging on Messenger.  Oh, they always test stuff.  Yeah, they get it tested.  They're also testing a secure storage feature for end-to-end encrypted chats so you can  backup your messages securely.  Now, do you think the Secret Service will start using Facebook Messenger?  That might be cool.  The company says a secure backup feature would be the default for end-to-end encrypted chats  on Messenger.  You can lock the backups with a PIN or a generated code.  The feature is designed so Mena will not be able to access the backups.  Honestly, Mena, like every other company, doesn't want to be able to respond to those  subpoenas, right?  Right.  They want to be able to say, oh, sorry.  I don't see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't that plausible deniability?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's one way to put it.  I think mostly, look, I don't know if Mena really doesn't want to help law enforcement  in a case like this.  to, but they don't want the heat that they got from it.  So they'd much prefer just to say, hey, we can't help you.  Mena spokesperson told WIRED, this is not a response to any law enforcement requests.  We've had this date in the diary for months.  But the short notice is because Messenger product teams have been finalizing the tests  that are going live.  These tests will start last Thursday, a week ago.  We want people to hear about these tests from us before they see the changes in the app.  Good.  I mean, it was three years ago, Mark Zuckerberg said, end encryption everywhere.  So they're finally getting around to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're going to become the encryption company, right?  It was the whole thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wasn't that the whole thing?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's take a little break.  expect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes.  Just for Stacey and Andrew.  Yay.  Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, every night Lisa goes to bed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm glad she goes to bed.  I said there's some nights she doesn't.  It shouldn't be news to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But she puts her watch and her iPhone on Nomad's base one charger.  This is an awesome charger.  I actually got it for her because I said, oh, Lisa, this, this was because she, the  watch would fall off her charger.  So now she, this is so awesome.  She puts her phone on the, on the MagSafe charger.  She puts our watch right next to it and boom, they're charging together.  By the way, they now have the limited edition gold version.  I got her the black one because she likes red and black.  But this is one of many great products from Nomad.  Nomad was started as a Kickstarter project many moons ago, but they've always had one  goal in mind to create products that are better made, that are better designed.  Oh, oh, I have, I have my chargers.  I have my chargers right here.  Better made and better designed than the run of the mill stuff.  This is the MagSafe charger.  And as soon as you heft it, you realize, boy, it is the weight.  And this is one of the things I love.  All the Nomad products come with their braided cables.  They got tired of the flimsy charging cables that fall apart every few months.  I'm sure you are too.  So they decided to engineer the most rugged cables around.  They're reinforced, they're braided, which I love, but they're double braided Kevlar  outer shield.  The connector is a strong metal alloy, the housings metal alloy, engineered for extreme  durability, heavy everyday use.  This is a Nomad cable.  This is just, it's the detail, the attention to detail.  How about the Nomad leather cases and Apple watch straps?  I have a wonderful Apple watch strap that's Nomad leather.  Premium wallets, passport holders, all crafted with beautiful Horween leather.  Horween is a tannery in Chicago, more than 100 years old.  Oh, that smells good.  They offer an unparalleled blend of quality and consistency.  And what's nice about these, this is a brand new one, but as you use it, all my Nomad wallets  and everything are like this.  They get patinaed because it's good leather and they're unique.  They're just, they're only you.  But the leather smell does not, does not go away.  It smells so fantastic.  It just feels like luxury.  Rugged and minimalist tools for the 21st century that seamlessly integrate into your everyday  carry.  This is the Nomad stainless steel band for the Apple watch.  Again, heavy.  You can tell its quality.  Solid metal.  It's beautiful.  It's just gorgeous.  They're climate neutral certified brand.  Nomad is and always will be a company that prioritizes design and quality over everything  else.  And for them, one of the most important aspects to Nomad when they're designing new products  is to use the best materials, the longest lasting, the highest quality materials.  And they are not white labeling somebody else's stuff.  They design everything from the ground up.  They always have.  And they manufacture it themselves.  So you know, you're getting really good quality.  Excellent stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just love Nomad goods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I so does Lisa, I have to tell you.  If you want that gold one right now, get head over there.  That's a limited time offer on the base one max.  Beautiful.  Silver, gold or black.  The best stuff.  Go to nomadgoods.com slash twig.  Oh, and by the way, use the promo code TWIG.  You'll get 10% off your first purchase of any Nomad accessory.  That's nomadgoods.com slash twig.  And the promo code is twig.  So limited time offer.  Don't wait.  Love the Nomad goods.  Just really nicely made stuff.  They look good, they feel good and and you will love them.  Thank you Nomad.  Thank you very much for supporting this week in Google.  You support us of course when you use that special address.  Alright and hide your head.  Actually before we do that, I just have a question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Stacey's got to reprieve here from the gallows.  Say more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She was already leaning away from the mic to run.  She's like I'm out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So thank me.  I'm telling you, you're gonna thank me.  Go ahead, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a guy, we've had him on our shows.  He's been around for a long time.  I worked with him in Canada on tech TV.  Darren Kitchen, right?  You know Darren.  Yeah.  He has the Hack 5 show.  He sells, well he sells I think questionable goods in his hacker store.  The pineapple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pen testing stuff.  That's what I remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so that's my question.  They call it pen testing stuff.  It's hackers tools.  So they've just announced the new USB rubber ducky.  This is what The Verge writes.  The beloved hacker tool can now pwn you with its own programming language.  So it looks like a USB key.  But instead of being a USB key when you plug it into a computer, the machine sees it as  a keyboard, which means it can type in any commands.  And here was what Darren Kitchen says.  Pen testing.  It types is trusted to the same degree as the user is trusted.  So it takes advantage of the trust model built in where computers have been taught to trust  a human.  The computer knows that a human typically communicates with it through clicking and  typing.  It can be used to hack machines.  Pen testing.  That's what it is.  Keystroke injection attacks with advanced ducky script.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you have to have physical access to the device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, or you could just leave it lying on the ground outside.  Oh, I'll try this.  Hey, a free USB key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So is there a radio in it that you communicate via the USB?  Oh, that's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good point.  Does it just hack into your machine?  You'd have to retrieve it.  Well, it could actually could run.  It could run a tool that would then.  Yeah, it runs a tool for the vulnerability.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, there's plenty of USB hacks out there that that doesn't seem like a problem.  I'm not sure if it's having an easier one.  If it is indeed easier.  Sure.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm like, it's not I guess it's not illegal, but it's just I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And think about all I mean, like you should never plug an unidentified USB into any machine.  Yeah.  I mean, this is true.  That's that's like in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, he shows it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I get scared plugging into ones from CES when you go to the booths and they're trying to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm always like, it feels like that there's a lot of rationalizing going, well, it's a  pen testing tool.  Oh, yeah.  See, it teaches people not to do this.  I don't know.  I feel like you're selling tools to to hack people.  But you don't think lockpicking tools to give to the bad guys.  There are lockpicking kits are illegal in many jurisdictions.  Are they really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unless you're a locksmith.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I don't know.  I just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So if I were to try to order a lockpicking kit from Amazon right now, would Amazon block  it lockpicking kit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you can buy it, but I wouldn't get caught carrying it around.  I know I thought it was illegal, but you're right here.  Here I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Only the lockpick is not illegal in most states.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK.  Lockpickworld.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's only considered a crime if you use them illegally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you know that?  She's looking at it.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not illegal.  Research.  So this is probably like that.  Most states in the US allow for the purchase and possession of lockpicks in Mississippi.  The possession of lockpicks is illegal, but the concealment of such can be considered  prima facie evidence of intent to commit a crime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you should open carry your lockpicks.  Open carries, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nevada, Ohio, Virginia laws require one to prove otherwise the prima facie event evidence  of intent.  Illinois has a specific provision on lock bumping.  You can't buy a lock bump.  And Tennessee has laws on locksmithing.  So it's not completely illegal.  So I feel like I guess it's kind of like that.  There are legitimate uses for lockpicks, though, right?  Completely legitimate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Aren't there aren't there legitimate uses for penetration testing tools to help the  enterprise that that whatever you don't need a USB rubber ducky to do pen testing?  No, no, no, you don't.  But I'm just saying that's probably just one of the tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just another tool to make it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not my lockpick, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is one of many stories coming out of DEF CON Black Hat besides all the, you know,  hacker summer camp.  John Deere.  Oh, did you see this one?  That's a good one.  A new jailbreak for John Deere tractors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Put up a Cory Doctorow thread on watching it happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Cory was in the audience.  So an Australian hacker named Sick Codes actually was able to break into the tractor  programming interfaces on John Deere tractor.  He's actually Australian, lives in Asia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He broke into their module and he convinced the module that he had he was an authorized  dealer. And basically from there he could reprogram or do whatever he wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So he put a special agricultural version of Doom on it, which Cory quite enjoyed.  I remember he also learned that John Deere is using a fairly ancient version of Linux,  Linux 8.  Linux 8.  We're up to 15 now.  That's common, y'all.  Yeah.  And less common, Windows CE.  Probably not secure and almost certainly a violation of GPL.  He launched the attack and two minutes later a terminal pops up.  I had root access, which is rare in Deerland.  Farmers did not want him to show.  This is interesting.  Farmers hate him because they would hack it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then he would basically let John Deere know, not from farmers, but he would figure  it out.  He would publicize it and then John Deere would fix it.  And they were like, please stop telling them.  This is the only way we can fix our tractors when they break down because John Deere  Exactly.  forces us to go to an authorized repair person and that can take weeks.  Which is impressive.  And by then the crops are dead.  The farmers figured it out before the hackers did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Farmers are like just very mechanically and whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're hackers.  They're mechanically inclined.  Resourceful.  Thank you.  That's the word.  I've never met a farmer who can't figure something out.  All right.  Period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sick Codes after he made his research public last year at DEFCON said, the right to repair  site was a little bit opposed to what I was trying to do.  I heard from some farmers, one guy emailed me and said, you're effing up all our stuff.  But that was last year.  This year his hack was so powerful.  He said, I figured I put my money where my mouth is and actually proved to farmers they  can root the devices.  Once they do, then Deere can't get back into it and take it back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  So I'm sure Deere will try to patch these vulnerabilities, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody's working on that right now.  Have they talked about this on Floss Weekly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually we did, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mr. Jonathan Bennett, our Untitled Linux show host and club twit, he's apparently the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  knows Sick Codes quite well and got a lot of joy out of this.  Today's guest, Dave Tatt, was pretty much up in arms because of the version of Linux  that's being used and how to violate in the GPL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not adhering to the license.  Good.  Try to get Sick Codes on the show.  That would be really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's also interesting in the Cori thread is that when he put it back on, it tried to  send 1.5 gigabytes of data up to Deere.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a lot of data on those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Deere actually created their own custom GPS to address things like the tilt of the earth  and things like that because it needs to be so precision for seeds and that's for planting.  They've actually done quite a bit with sensors and with machine learning on their tractors  so it doesn't surprise me that those things are sending lots of data.  I know we hate Deere but they've built some really cool stuff.  Oh my god, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's super cool.  Machines.  And our food supply relies on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's a little less cool.  So Cori says he discovered that all it took to convince the computer that he was a dealer  was to create an empty text file on its hard drive whose file name was something like  imdealer.txt.  It says, Cori, I didn't write down the exact file name alas, but it's not far off.  Wow.  Right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It makes a great deal of use of free and open source software.  Gravely outer compliance with license terms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John Deere's probably running Nobix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well Cori also figured there were a few Deere people in the audience.  Oh yeah, so yeah, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, their tech people are probably at odds with their business people.  And to some, like, I'm really torn on some of this.  As we use sensors to highly optimize machines with software, it does become much more of an issue  when that software is broken, inadvertently or advertingly, simply because it changes the way  they might operate.  It might create like weird dependencies.  And I'm not trying to defend them for not, it's a really, I don't think Deere's behaving  well, but I do understand like things with tied to like security and regular updates.  We have to come to some sort of middle ground on building this sort of software in tight  software to machine integration and then making it possible to fix things easily and not as  an economically for regular use, I guess.  Because some of the stuff like their emissions stuff, I do think there's probably some that's  not just FUD.  I don't know.  That's just me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a way to do it.  Right.  There's a way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think we should be exploring that.  And that's also why I say with like future business models related to connected devices  are going to have to rely so much on people trusting the company providing those services.  And we're not there yet because everybody is like this weird capitalistic, let's just  gouge as much money out of people as possible.  And that actually isn't sustainable.  And we're going to turn our backs on some really good technology because we understand  that it's going to actively be used against us.  And it's a shame, but I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, read Corey's full post on Pluralistic about this.  And he makes a very strong case about why what John Deere is doing is so very, very  wrong and basically monopolistic.  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Corey's new book, Choke Point Capitalism, how big tech and big content captured creative  labor markets and how we'll win them back.  We're going to get crowdfunding now by you.  Yeah.  Isn't that great?  Kickstarter.  Yeah.  We're going to get I'm going to try to get Corey on to talk about that because you have  a little bit more time, I think, on the Kickstarter.  I'd love to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they've already met their goals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but they should meet their goals and then some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no, the more people who can access this book, the better.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Choke Point Capitalism.  Hearing aids are going over the counter.  Huge news.  The FDA finally moved.  They finalized OTC hearing aids that could be sold without a prescription to people with  mild to moderate hearing loss available as soon as October.  Hearing aids cost around six thousand dollars.  You have to also visit an audiologist to get tested.  There's bought one for my father.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Last week, too, right?  Thirty five hundred dollars for one plus one hundred twenty dollars for the mold.  If you use that kind, you don't have to have the mold unless your hearing is bad enough.  With my father's, if you don't use the mold, the feedback is awful.  Oh, it squeaks.  Yeah.  So the mold is not only makes it easier for him to hear, it also stops us from hearing  all of that.  This was for one hearing aid because his other ear is just a goner.  But what I don't understand about this, Leo, is what who's to say the price is going to  come down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Already and we'll know in October, but already competition should bring the prices down.  Right now, a few companies dominate it.  They they're they dominate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you don't have to go to an audiologist because you require an audiologist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And so they make deals with our audiologist really made a lot of adjustments that were  specialized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you might have seen an ad right after the but deodorant for a thing called Lively Hearing  Aids.  I've already started seeing these ads on MSNBC.  These are thirteen hundred dollars for a pair, a lot less.  And they don't don't use an audiologist.  You have an app on your phone that does the test and then sets the hearing aids.  Now, admittedly, when I got my hearing aids, I went to an audiologist.  They do an extensive hearing test.  They adjust it.  You go back in several times to get them further adjusted.  There's a lot of even psychological adjustment to wearing hearing aids, et cetera, et cetera.  In fact, good article in Wired from Jaypreet Virdi, the unintended consequences of OTC  hearing aids.  He's profoundly deaf from birth, deaf from.  Oh, no, I guess not from birth, but he's 98 percent hearing loss in both years for over  30 years.  He talks about the fact that you're not having audiologists in the mix and all the marketing  that might happen from over the counter hearing aids might mean that people get a worse experience  and then decide not to wear hearing aids.  And so that's that's you know, what needs to change is how we perceive hearing aids  in the first place rather than leaning heavily on the implication hearing aids are inherently  embarrassing.  These devices should be marketed as tools for highlighting the vitality and richness  of deaf experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute.  You're saying this is stigma behind hearing aids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are, because people feel they're old.  It's why a lot of old people don't wear them.  They do not know that.  Oh, yeah.  In fact, I would say let me see here.  About 28 million U.S. adults could benefit from wearing hearing aids, but most choose  not to.  More than half choose not to.  Thirteen percent of the American population has some hearing loss.  That's 28 million.  Because and this is started in the 30s, physicians frame deafness as a worrisome public health  problem.  Yeah.  And that indicates that your old Medicare does not cover hearing aids.  Cost of hearing aids is really outrageous.  Let's see.  According to guidelines presented in October of last year, OTC hearing aids will be available  from any seller over the counter sold at approximately six hundred dollars a pair, about a tenth  what I paid.  The average cost of five thousand more than fourteen thousand dollar a pair, which includes  fittings and follow up services.  But without customized fitting, without those adjustments that your dad got, which mattered

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  greatly.  The audiologist spent 15 minutes, 20 minutes standing out in the hall talking to him, seeing  what sounds didn't work, coming back adjusting.  The other thing that we found out the hard way was when he was in Florida, he bought  one under the Audible brand.  Audible is a subsidiary of Starkey, which makes a lot of hearing aids.  I have Starkey.  There's a lot of places.  But if you buy an Audible, just like the John Deere tractor, they're locked so that no other  audiologist but an Audible brand person can see and change the settings.  I think that's the case.  I had to drive an hour and a half to get his hearing aid adjusted in Pennsylvania because  there was no place here.  That's why we bought a new one, just simply because we couldn't get around the adjustments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the answer to this though is going to be, and I think it's coming from companies  like Apple, making them part of your AirPods experience, your standard kind of headphone  experience, positioning them not as something for old people, but as something that enhances  your hearing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  For the lightly deaf, yes, for the profoundly deaf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Profoundly deaf, you're going to have to get what you're deaf.  Yeah, and that's exactly it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you're super handicapped, if you're super unable to hear, you're going to have to do  with this.  But we've had hearables for a while, which is what these kind of augmented hearing things,  they are going to get better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they'll also reduce stigma, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it'll reduce stigma because you'll see much more innovation, like some of the  innovations from consumer electronics around battery life and Bluetooth connectivity.  I don't know about you, but my mom, when she's trying to connect her hearing aids to her  phone, it's a real nightmare.  So I think we're going to see some good stuff.  And you're right, this isn't going to be for everyone.  The more hearing loss you have, the more you'll have to go to a professional.  But I think instead of starting when you're like 50, maybe you start when you're 70.  And the innovations you see at the bottom end, they're going to be pushed up to the  top end and pricing as well because there'll be more competition.  So I think this is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think ultimately it is.  But I hadn't really thought about the unintended consequences.  So Jaypreet's article is well, I think, well taken.  Definitely, there's a difference between the people who need, like me, who can hear, but  need a little help and people who are profoundly deaf.  And I think the over-the-counter stuff is really more intended for people like me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wish insurance companies, including Medicare, were required to cover hearing aids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unbelievable that Medicare doesn't cover it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, can you for a health savings account, can it count under that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you can do that.  I'm pretty sure.  But still, it's very expensive.  We're talking a lot of money.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's why Medicare doesn't want to cover it.  You got to draw the line somewhere, I guess.  Fair point.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's trying to avoid it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's trying to go around.  He's trying not to do it.  He's desperately trying to find something else to talk about.  But it's just out there waiting to be done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oracle is beginning to audit TikTok's algorithms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's because the Chinese government started calling for social media companies in the  country to audit their algorithms.  That's right.  And it's Project Texas.  Oh, I didn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, that's what it's called because I guess Oracle is in Texas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's based in Texas now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The idea is really not so much.  I think they're doing it to reassure Congress and maybe the American people that the TikTok  US is not an arm of the Chinese Communist Party.  Right?  I had a guy call the last call the radio show this weekend saying, don't you think TikTok  is a Chinese conspiracy and shouldn't we ban it?  I said, well, he said, I know your son is a TikTok star, but shouldn't we ban it?  And I like Jeff and maybe some of you think that it's a great venue for creators just  like YouTube.  Yes.  And I don't think it's a bad thing to have some oversight.  I think maybe this is the way to do it.  By dance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does collect a lot of data.  It does collect a lot of data.  It's collecting your location data.  Like everything else.  Yeah, I'm less worried about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm more worried about what the Chinese are going to do with that.  Yeah.  So they know where I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If they understand, like not necessarily you, Jeff, but let's say you have access.  Let's say you work at a company like, I don't know, Twilio.  They can use that information to target individuals that they might be interested in fishing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And follow Chinese expatriate Chinese dissidents and so forth.  I don't trust China.  I'm not saying I'm not defending China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm just saying the solution to that is to not let people with sensitive jobs have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Tick tock or a smartphone.  I mean, look at everything on your phone.  So maybe they should not carry their phone to work.  I mean, there's got to be some solutions, but it doesn't mean necessarily.  I mean, everything Facebook's tracking you to everybody's tracking you.  I mean, didn't we try to give the leader of the U.S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  a dumb, a dumbish smartphone at one point in time?  I think we still do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we still do.  So Tick Tock said it's been routing all its U.S.  user data, Oracle's cloud infrastructure.  So all this stuff is stored in Texas.  And now they say they're going to establish a partnership with an outside firm to oversee its algorithms.  Because I think that's the secondary concern.  The secondary concern, maybe to me even more important, is that what if the Chinese government  started forcing ByteDance to promote things that are in the interest of the Chinese government  and subtly modify our thinking through Tick Tock?  Is that possible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it possible that that can happen through Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is disinformation on Tick Tock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What if the Chinese government decided, well, this disinformation is OK.  This isn't, you know, we like the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're already deciding that.  They already don't show you people who live in crappy homes or fat people.  Or fat people, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although they got caught and I think they do show you fat people now.  But, you know, that's the thing.  The new arrangement gives Oracle regular vetting and validation of Tick Tock's content recommendation  and moderation models.  So not only they have the data, but Oracle can see the algorithms.  Make you feel better?  You trust Oracle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I guess more than ByteDance, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And again, I think this is not really an attempt to make this, fix this, but just to appease Congress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes, this is 100% a salve to Congress.  Yeah.  Not a...  Oh.  And not just Congress.  I mean, all governments right now are looking at auditing algorithms in some form or fashion.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You mentioned Twilio.  That Twilio breach now more and more looks targeted.  Yeah, it's 100% targeted.  By a nation state who was trying to break into somebody's Signal account.  End-to-end encrypted messaging app Signal says,  attackers access the phone numbers and SMS verification codes for almost 2,000 users.  As part of the breach at Twilio last week,  Twilio provides phone number verification services to Signal.  It sounds like there were some specific two or three accounts that they were looking for.  While it doesn't mean that Signal, the message contents are available to anybody.  They're not.  Nor does it give the attacker access to the message history.  But you could re-register an account and then send and receive signals from that phone number.  And since on Signal you're identified by your phone number, it would allow you to impersonate somebody.  The company says it will unregister signal on all devices that the user is currently using  or an attacker registered them to and will require users to re-register signal with their phone number on their preferred device.  You should also switch on registration lock if you use Signal,  a feature that prevents the account from being re-registered on another device without your security pin.  So I guess Signal thought about this ahead of time.  So 40 million users use Signal.  But it looks like after about 125 specific customers.  So it looks pretty much like a nation-state targeted attack.  Any guesses to which nation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In the speculation?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it could be so many of them.  If you knew a dissident was using Signal, I mean it has a limited use as I said.  You could only pose as them.  You can't read their messages or see who they were talking to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you can set up a meeting and then kill somebody.  Yeah.  That's right.  I read a lot of spy fiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe you should knock that off.  Maybe it's making it a little paranoid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could also impersonate someone, provide documents and misinformation and then help legitimize basically disinfo.  As a journalist, we would be susceptible to that.  Could be.  And Jeff, I think as a journalist, it's your job to understand how people could lie to you or...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm just joking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just had to think.  Geez.  Lay off this spy novel, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you see, and I recommend it if you didn't, Anne Hathaway and Jared Leto in We Crash.  What was it?  I think it was We Crash.  We crashed.  The story of We Work.  And at the end, Adam Newman and his wife, Rebecca Newman, walk off with a pretty substantial billion dollars.  Tons of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Leaving a lot of investors out of pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Newman's second act was investing in real estate.  Well, now he has just raised, he's got a new company called Flow.  And he's just raised significant $350 million from Andreessen Horowitz, who I guess didn't watch that show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, but don't they have to do some type of due diligence as investors?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's their money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's actually not their money.  It's their LP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But how is it, how does this cat continue to just get free money from people?  Flow hasn't even launched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was really good at building up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's a good salesman.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's a great salesman.  Geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He wants to transform the residential real estate market.  He has been buying up properties for the last few years on his own dime.  Flow, which hasn't launched yet, is expected to launch next year.  Mark Andreessen will be on the board.  Newman is also planning to make a sizable personal investment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Flow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's what Andreessen wrote in a post on the Horowitz, Andreessen Horowitz website.  It's often underappreciated that only one person has fundamentally redesigned the office experience  and led a paradigm changing global company in the process, Atom.  Newman has already purchased more than 3,000 apartment units in Miami, Florida, Lauderdale, Atlanta, and Nashville.  He is planning to rethink the housing rental market by creating a branded product with consistent service and community features.  Sounds a lot like we work.  Flow will operate the properties Newman has bought and also offered its services to new developments and other parties.  By the way, we work was originally we live.  It was this, it was intended to be co-housing.  I thought that came after the work part.  I thought that came after we were.  No, according to well, OK, all I saw was a TV show.  So you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But according to the TV show, I read the book and reported on we work.  So let me tell you.  So it was later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wasn't it wasn't before the work space thing?  No.  OK.  Anyway, he's still planning to do it.  He also co-founded a crypto company, Flow Carbon.  And he raised 70 million dollars for that last May from Andreessen Horowitz.  So they're into him for 420 million.  Four hundred twenty.  Keeps coming up. I don't know.  He's in Andreessen says he's interested in flow because the rental real estate market is ripe for disruption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I want some names.  Who are these people that says, you know what, we're going to sign the check.  And I know check is old.  That's not used.  But who are the people that are saying, yep, we trust this person.  We're going to just go ahead and send this money in and have them come to the press and tell why they believe whatever this this person is telling them, considering a track record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, and I saw speculation on on Twitter, you know, take it for what you will.  That the strategy behind this, which is it's Andreessen Horowitz wants to it's not unlike NFTs.  If we invest a whole bunch, other people invest a whole bunch and be worth it.  Right. Look at Clubhouse.  Andreessen Horowitz was key behind Clubhouse and the hype brought the valuation.  You know, we remember what Clubhouse is.  No, we don't.  But they got more investment.  And the other argument that was made was that this is a message to bad boy founders.  Oh, we'll forgive anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've always said that, haven't we?  We've always said failure is celebrated in Silicon Valley.  We fetishize it in America.  Yeah.  And in fact, he said, you know, we love seeing repeat founders build on past successes by growing from lessons learned.  For Newman, he added the successes and lessons are plenty.  While we're on the rich get richer.  That's the rule.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're talking billions, not millions, billions of dollars.  And people are trusting this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not many need to, Ant.  Only a few limited partners need to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I need to find these people.  Hey, let me talk to you.  I don't even need a million.  You know what you need, Ant?

Transcript:  Right. Why not?  Can we get take it down for the no, because there's no content ID, right?  Right. OK, we're good.  So this is a sound up, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You got to go back to the beginning to turn yourself up to get the first joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But OK, well, you know, I don't take it as autoplay and that just takes me off guard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm also thinking of Kramer when he took over a mile of road.  Yeah, these are old. I've seen this before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've seen it before. Never seen this. OK, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, you see, I learned something new every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's nothing new on TikTok. Nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And did you put one in there? Did you put the quiet quitting in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Quiet quitting is the latest workplace trend going viral on TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You don't need to do that. I thought I'd put that in. Now, don't bother with that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we've had quiet quitting. We've had people quiet quit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm quiet quitting right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so terrible. So terrible. No.  No, yes. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's do a changelog. Play that thing that you do so very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The official Android 13 version of Android is out.  Right. We said that already. This is the official statue. It's not a dessert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What is it? Is that a swing set? It needs Lumi, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's like a swing set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It says, this is Android police. Google's official Android 13 statue sure looks like a butt.  It's a swing set in the shape of three.  Of a three triggers all the wrong suggestions.  Well, it's a swing set. Swingsets always look like butts. They have to fit your butt.  That's not anything. This is on the Google campus. I guess they're not doing desserts.  Jason, is there a dessert associated with Android 13? I think there is.  I think there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We used to make that a top story of what's the dessert going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the dessert? I don't care.  Was it Q?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, what's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  QRS? Gosh, I don't even know anymore. Was it T?  Tiramisu?  Yeah, T. Okay. That's good. At least there's a decent dessert.  I don't know why they didn't have a nice little piece of tiramisu in the sculpture park instead of a swing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like a piece of tiramisu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google photo has made a change. I think this is very, very important. I want you all to listen carefully.  They're renaming archive to hidden.  What?  They're renaming... You really want me to repeat it?  Well, I heard you. I don't understand.  That's the change.  Archive, in fact, there is a prompt when you update Google Photos to 6.1 on iOS.  You'll be greeted with, Archive is now called hidden.  So, hey, it's a change. And it's in the changelog.  Google Chrome can now become your default browser on Windows.  Remember, this was... I don't know if you remember this. It was certainly a conversation for... went on for a while on Windows Weekly.  Microsoft really wants you to use their browser edge and had made it for a while very hard to change the default browser.  You know, a lot of buttons to click and so forth.  Well, Google Chrome is now rolling out the ability to become your default browser with one click.  I think Firefox tried this. Microsoft changed it.  But I think it's really Microsoft capitulating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Y'all, did you see that Lorenzo Franceschi...  Bechata... I don't know.  He was a journalist. So the Twilio attack was trying to attack journalists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, at Lorenzo FB is the guy.  On Twitter, I presume.  Yes.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that might match up with your thesis that is an invitation.  Oh, Lorenzo Franceschi Bicchiari.  Yes, a real time historian of late cyber capitalist era at Motherboard.  Oh, he's at Motherboard, which of course makes sense.  They targeted 1900 signal users specifically going after three of them.  I was one of the three and the hackers were able to take over my signal account for 13 hours.  Yeah, I know, of course, his byline. We see it all the time.  Yeah.  That's very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, see, and he's saying to people, if you talk to me during this time frame, someone was impersonating me.  I want to understand who or what.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He probably has sources who use signal.  Expect this to be him.  It could be actually now that makes me think it's more industrial espionage kind of stuff, right?  What is Lorenzo usually write about?  Let's see.  Meet the environmental hacktivist trying to sabotage mining companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, so that could be a government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Head of Ukraine Cyber Security says Russia has committed cyber war crimes.  He writes about security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. InfoSec and surveillance.  All right. Well, there you go.  Sorry, I interrupted your change log, but it felt like no, that's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's good. And that makes a lot of sense.  I knew it was a targeted attack.  I didn't realize it was targeting journalists. That's very interesting.  Hey, guess what? Google Meet now shows how noisy your office is.  Huh? Huh?  Well, you know, you don't want to take a video call in a noisy office.  Google has ambient noise suppression to block out the noise.  But they've revealed in a post on the Google Workspace blog,  there's actually a new visual indicator for when Meet has activated that.  So if you look here, you know, when you're talking, it's got the little waveform,  but you see it'll say reducing noise.  So if you see reducing noise pop out, it means, hey, the dog is barking.  The dog is barking or something like that.  The pop-up will appear as often as once per meeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did you ever try Google Meet instead of Zoom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did we, John? I don't think so. We use it for corporate.  All of our staff meetings and stuff.  And I think our experience is there in form our decision not to use it on the air.  Yeah, I think I would imagine that, yes.  You're going to have to explain this to me, Stacey Higginbotham.  Google is killing off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google is killing its IoT Core link between connected devices and its Google Cloud Platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that a big deal? Sounds like a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they're giving you a year's notice.  And basically it's an indication that Google sucks when it comes to getting IoT devices onto their cloud.  They do have a few customers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are these customers individuals or companies that make IoT devices?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Companies that make IoT devices.  So this is, or specifically it's industrial companies that are sending device data.  So IoT Core is a data ingest off of different devices and modules.  And you knew it wasn't popular because nobody making modules actually supported it.  They were like, yeah, we support Azure and AWS and then crickets if you asked them about Google.  But it's still a big deal from a competition perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Amazon and Microsoft both offer similar features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, Microsoft is Azure IoT Hub and AWS IoT Core.  They are the two names of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google went general availability with their cloud IoT Core service, managed service early 2018.  Unclear how many people used the service ever.  And so they are killing it five years later.  August 16th, 2023, one year from yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I figure, you know, small story, but ties into the don't love anything that Google produces.  It will kill it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the quote for the stack.  Since launching IoT Core, it's become clear that our customers needs could be better served by our network of partners that specialize in IoT applications and services.  Don't use us.  You'll be better served by somebody else.  It's not you. It's us.  Well, you know, good on them.  If something doesn't work well or people aren't using it, then that's completely appropriate.  And that's why we're going to end the Google change log.  We're done.  We'll be back next week with more.  Don't worry.  Let us pause for a moment.  And when we come back, I'm going to put you all back to work with the final thoughts, your picks of the week.  Let's kick off the picks of the week.  And again, no pressure with Stacey's thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My thing this week is not actually a thing.  It's an app.  If you're like wondering, oh, my gosh, should I go for hearables or anything like that with the recent FTC decision?  I'm using I use an app called the Mimi hearing test.  You can get it on Apple and Android, and it keeps a running you to a hearing test, however many times you want.  And it just basically tracks your hearing.  How is your hearing?  My hearing is OK.  I'm losing some high frequencies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, that's because you're getting old.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've used this because I'm really old.  And I agree.  This is really a value where the hearing aids all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I hear well enough.  You know, I got them because I kind of wanted to understand the market.  I wanted to understand.  I was excited about the hearables category, and I went to Starkey and ReSound because both of them seem to be kind of forward thinking that I was very underwhelmed.  It really gave me an insight into hearing aids and how poorly they work.  So I wear my hearing is definitely deteriorating because too many years of headphones for one thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The New York Times just said that that is not a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What?  Hearing earbuds, earbuds, headphones, earbuds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Earbuds don't hurt your hearing, they say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if you don't listen to loud, I've been listen.  Look, I've been wearing headphones for 46 years and probably too loud.  And the thing is, it's a vicious cycle because you start turning them up and then it damages your hearing and then you turn up some more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so you're you know, you're always listening louder and louder and louder.  I think that did you take them on the cruise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The hearing aids?  No, no.  So you don't really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't really.  Well, I did for a while.  Occasionally, if I know I'm going to be in an environment where it's going to be hard to hear, I will wear them.  Does Lisa ever say, damn it Leo, would you wear your hearing aids?  All the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But she mumbles.  Maybe I should take this Mimi hearing test.  So this is free.  What do you get out of this though?  I mean, it's just you just get the knowledge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You get the knowledge.  But like as these things are becoming more like you're going to see a lot more marketing towards people like, oh, can you hear this?  You couldn't.  Oh, my gosh.  You should check out the new Jabra enhanced elite 22s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is just an option that kind of offers you some Android devices offer this kind of hearing test built in like the Samsung phones, which is fantastic because you can say, OK, and now when I play back.  Sound on headphones with his phone.  I want you to adapt it to my equalization.  Yeah.  So it's really that's really good.  I feel like Mimi also had a tinnitus app of some kind, but I guess not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm looking to see tinnitus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I say tinnitus.  You say tinnitus.  Let's call the whole thing off.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't figure out how to say that word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's both.  It's both.  You know, as my audiologist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought that I was was about inflammation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, my audiologist says tinnitus, but I think he said it's OK to say tinnitus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's what does Google say?  That's because we've Americanized it apparently.  Oh, really?  OK, you know, I don't know.  I'm just talking outside of my neck.  Really?  Got a hole there too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, I don't like it and I got it.  And there are apps also that you can use to kind of mask it or figure it out or whatever.  Tonight is pronounced tonight is or tinnitus.  Yeah, both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tinnitus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the National Institutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's British.  Hold on to the American.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tinnitus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, according to the National Institutes of Health, it's pronounced both ways.  And I think that's what my audiologist said as well.  And if when I say tinnitus, which I agree with you, and is the proper pronunciation,  I get corrected so much.  So I just say tonight is now.  Yeah, because that's because that's what people want to hear.  So I tell them what they want to hear.  Even if I can't hear it.  Mimi Health, it's free, right?  On iOS.  It is again.  If you have Android, if you have an Android device, you might look and see.  Certainly, Samsung has this buried deep in the sound settings.  You can.  It's called adapt sound.  You can adjust the sound of the phone to your particular hearing deficiencies.  Jeff, should you buy a books?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's one of my things.  But first I want to mention is we didn't get to one story.  I want to just mention this just so I can say it.  I've been telling you and telling you and telling you.  An Australian court just agreed that Google is not a publisher.  It could not be held liable for liable by just linking to something.  I just want to get that on the record.  That's all I would do that.  This is a YouTube case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, this is another case.  Another case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I just want to mention that for the record.  So I actually have a few questions for you for our wonderful audience.  First, the books.  You know, I had the remarkable and I sent it back because it wasn't the software at the time.  Wasn't working well to fluidly move PDFs that I could mark up back and forth into my drive.  Books is based on Android.  Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if that's a selling point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which version of Android 11?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So these are the idea of these diseases are E Ink notebook applications where you could put documents on and mark them up or write your own notes.  I have the remarkable to and quite like it.  And I have not had the issue that you've had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe the software got better.  Yeah, I just you know, you have an app that moves into the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's pretty good.  I don't know anything about the books.  Anybody know anything about the books?  Be double.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What happens is we mentioned this on the show and then people come to Twitter and tell me what they think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was one having Android could be good.  Of course, it could be.  It could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, it's the tablet.  Right.  Right.  E Ink tablet.  So, you know, I mentioned this a couple times.  I have a few, not very many, very few shares of Twitter so I could get these kinds of notifications.  And I just got the the should I vote now Twitter is saying that you should vote in favor of the Musk purchase.  Oh, as a shareholder.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we knew that the board would recommend it because essentially that's what they said.  Right.  We're going to recommend it.  But they don't really mean it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sure, they do.  They want money.  Their wireless don't get paid.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I think I should vote no.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For my user, I would vote no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yes, Twitter's stock is forty three ninety nine right now.  So you'd be getting almost a ten dollar share premium.  But what is free speech really worth?  By the way, that's interesting because that stock has gone up quite a bit over the last month.  Sure has.  Indicating that the market believes that Elon is either going to have to kick in some money or is going to have to buy it.  I think more likely the former Elliott management, the activist shareholders who were instrumental in getting Jack Dorsey to quit have now sold their entire stake in Twitter.  They're out.  After after really kind of.  Yeah, because they're not stewards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're just people who are like, yeah, I'll do this.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So then finally, I was going to mention that.  So I went back to the classroom today and today was my session on the history of media.  And I do the entirety of media from Gutenberg to today in 45 minutes.  I was going to mention that I put it on YouTube from the last years and you could watch it.  But but then I guess that if I did that, then Leo would fear that I'm going to take down the whole show.  So I won't mention that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not worried about you.  But what about the journalism school?  This is your 43 minute.  Is this is this a lecture?  Yes, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's the entire history of media in 43 minutes.  History of journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you get the whole history of journalism?  43 minutes because I talk really fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I had to listen to it again.  It's like what I turn myself on fast.  I scared myself.  Do you do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting.  So this is now I thought you said you were meeting in person in classes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We did.  But they cut down my time.  So I had to get in the basics by showing them the video again and then we can discuss it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, I think it's a great idea to flip the you know, they call it flipping the class and have the discussion like prep them ahead of time and then have a say watch this tonight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then what the class really is going to be is us talking about what you what you get out of it.  Is that kind of what you did, Jeff?  Yeah, yeah, that's nice.  Good.  So everybody can watch this.  We won't watch all 43 minutes.  Is there a highlight anywhere?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is there a TikTok?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it starts next year.  I'll do 45 TikToks next year.  Is it start with Gutenberg and ends with podcast?  Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think I mentioned podcast though.  What did you mention?  Civil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was so sad that didn't do.  Quibi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you mention Quibi?  No.  Sibyl.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What's Sibyl?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Sibyl.  Sibyl.  Did that fail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That was the blockchain news thing.  No, I did not mention that.  I knew better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't realize it was it was gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lessons from a failed startup.  Civil was launched in 2017.  Maybe basing on blockchain wasn't this.  Yeah, it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was so complicated.  Oh, my Lord.  It was complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we've kind of learned a lesson about blockchain.  It's not everything that's cracked up to be.  Okay, good.  So how do people find this?  It's on your YouTube channel.  You can go to YouTube and search Jeff Jarvis.  So youtube.com slash Jeff Jarvis.  And skip the weird Pixel XL 2 stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go right to the J school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, you put a lot of this on there.  That's really cool.  I have one on business too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's Jarvis Salisbury?  I had to do a talk for somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When I search by Jeff Jarvis, I get you get the jazz player music.  Yes, that's probably better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

And it's all of the legendary photographers and retouchers and processors of Photoshop.  That's going to give you a lot of information and help you get better at using it.  Links in our show notes in this for Photoshop World.  And lastly, just tag me on Instagram.  I'm not going to say follow me on Instagram because you're not going to see it if you follow me.  But just tag me on Instagram with any of your images that you've snapped or something that you found interesting.  It's been cool seeing some of the stuff people tag me in.  A lot of good photographers out there that's not getting recognition.  So tag me, Ant underscore Pruitt.

Transcript:  Last week's episode, that's the first thing that popped up in my feedback and didn't have to touch the horizon.  It was awesome.  And this person has been watching the show for over a year and they are learning.  So we're doing something right.  Yay.  Everybody should watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I will watch your show when you tell me exactly what I need to do.  So Google stops asking me to pick a better shot when I take photos.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It just knows.  How does it know?  Ant Pruitt at twit.tv slash H-O-P.  Hands on photography every week.  You should also, by the way, join our club twit so you can hang with Ant and the gang in our Discord,  which is a wonderful place, a social place to hang out.  Jeff even posts there occasionally, as you can see.  Stacey's got her book club coming up.  We're going to be reading Clara and the Sun.  I can't wait to talk about that.  That's next week, this week.  Actually tomorrow, Alex Lindsay doesn't ask me anything.  Now these are available to everybody in the club, but that's not the only benefit of being a club twit member.  In fact, we thought the whole thing would be about getting ad-free versions of our show.  So seven bucks a month.  All the shows we do ad-free.  You also get access to the Discord and the twit plus feed,  which includes shows that we don't release to the general public because we don't yet have the audience or the advertisers to pay for it.  So club twit members pay for it.  That includes the brand new Hands on Windows with Paul Thropp, Micah Sargent's Hands on Mac,  the untitled Linux show, Jonathan Bennett.  We also have the Giz Fizz, Stacey's book club.  There's a lot of stuff going on in the Discord all the time.  Again, you get individual feeds for all those shows as well, if you're a member.  So go to twit.tv slash club twit.  It really helps us out.  I can't thank you enough, the club twit members.  You've made it so much fun to be in the club, but also it really helps us financially keep things on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I asked yesterday on Twitter, are you part of club twit?  Because I was curious, who that follows me is part of club twit.  And man, that thread is still going.  So thank you all so much for being a part of club twit.  It really does warm my heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People know we're ad-supported, but we only had two ads this week, for instance.  The ads come and ads go.  And times are getting tougher.  During COVID was when we really started to struggle a little bit, and that's when we started club twit.  But it gives us, when we have a surplus, the wherewithal to do additional shows like Hands on Mac, Hands on Windows, and so forth.  Thank you very much for your support at twit.tv slash club twit.  If you want to see this show, you can watch us do it live on Wednesdays, about 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern, 2100 UTC.  The streams, audio and video are at live.twit.tv.  There is a chat room open to all, irc.twit.tv, as well as the club twit discord.  After the fact, we put ad-supported versions of the show on our website, twit.tv slash twig.  There's a YouTube channel dedicated to this week in Google.

Transcript:  Next week I'm joined by Tarek Malek, the editor-in-chief over at space.com  in our new This Week in Space podcast.  Every Friday, Tarek and I take a deep dive into the stories that define the new space age.  What's NASA up to?  When will Americans once again set foot on the moon?  And how about those samples from the Perseverance rover?  When are those coming home?  What the heck has Elon Musk done now?  In addition to all, the latest and greatest in space exploration will take an occasional look  at bits of spaceflight history that you probably never heard of  and all with an eye towards having a good time along the way.  Check us out in your favorite podcatcher.
