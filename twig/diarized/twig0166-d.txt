Little baby's asleep.  Little Etta is sleeping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Etta's sleeping.  Hopefully I don't look too sleep-derived,  and that my baby brain won't affect the show too much.  You look great.  I apologize if I say something completely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jennifer always said that having children reduces your IQ bit by bit.  You transfer the brains over to the baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When she was in the hospital, I would park the car,  and I would go see her, and then I'd go down,  and I would just wander through the parking lot,  because I couldn't remember where I parked the car.  Sleep deprivation.  Or something.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a biological fact.  Anyway, we're so happy for you. Congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank you so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we're so glad you could join us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, me too.  It's great to be kind of back at it a little bit,  although I hope that no one's going to criticize my maternity leave  the way they've been talking about Marissa Meyer's maternity leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, my.  Well, we'll get right on that one in a second,  but first let me introduce the rest of our panel.  Of course, Jeff Jarvis is also here from BuzzMachine.com,  the author of What Would Google Do? and Public Parts.  Hello, Jeff.  Silently.  We're shoulder.  Oh, we had you muted. What?  Are you having...  Am I here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we've got you now.  You're not the first one to mute me in life, I'll tell you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would be nice to have a mute button in general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just impressed that Gina took the towel.  Remember to take the towel off her shoulder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, the spit towel.  Spit up towel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm still learning to get that towel up on there first.  Oh, I'll tell you.  You'll learn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's good to just get cloth diapers for a week  so that you have something because they make the best...  Never mind. We should really stop this now.  Gina, you're with three old dads  because all three of us have grown kids.  So anything you want to know, we vaguely remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I need a lot of help, so I can't hit you up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's a man who's changed his share of diapers, ladies and gentlemen,  from Sparta, Greece, Mike Elgin.  Hey, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, thank you for having me on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looks like you're in the storage cupboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we have a little studio here.  Oh, nice.  And it's quite nice and tiny.  It has a balcony with grapevines all over the place.  It's very Mediterranean and beautiful.  Oh, how nice.  But yeah, it's really, really nice. We're right downtown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So jealous.  Somebody said this...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm even jealous of myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This show is now three and a half dads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good name for it, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't tell you on how many forms I crossed out the word father  and put mother on in the past week.  Yeah.  So I'm happy to identify as a half dad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right on. Right on, right on, right on.  So let's see what's going on in the world around us.  Why don't we start with Marissa Meyer,  since that's a topic near and dear to all of our hearts.  The new CEO of Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On the cover of Fortune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  On the cover of Fortune.  The world's 50 most powerful women.  She doesn't look pregnant there.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When did she do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She had her baby boy on Monday, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  So she went from zero to 60.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I heard she's crowdsourcing the name of the baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that may have been my fault, actually.  I got an email, but it was obviously a gang email.  That's what I saw.  One imagines thousands of people  and saying that we didn't have a name yet  and suggestions welcome.  So I tweeted,  boy, she's crowdsourcing the name of the baby.  That got picked up all over.  I hope I didn't offend her.  No, I love that.  That was kind of great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if they've come up with a name.  Baby boy Meyer was born Sunday night.  And of course, the controversy immediately.  She intends to return to the workplace as soon as possible,  likely in one or two weeks.  Strong lady.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She said she was going to do that all along, right?  Mm-hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, she was pretty clear about that from the beginning.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And certainly, I don't know if her husband's staying home or what.  I mean, I don't think it's anybody's business  what their arrangement is.  But I think you, as a new parent,  understand why it would be nice to stay home  for as long as possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, listen, her kid, she's going to have lots of care.  She's going to have an army of folks taking care,  helping her out and taking care of her and taking care of her kid.  And she's got her husband.  I just, you know, obviously, this is too close to my heart right now.  And it's just interesting to me.  I mean, there just aren't that many dads, you know, who,  new CEOs who were men who would, you know,  that have full articles written about how she, you know,  is doing a disservice to her baby boy by not staying home.  I think there is the issue, though,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that she should probably be very clear,  this is my choice, this is what I'm doing.  This does not mean that this is recommended  or expected behavior of other Yahoo employees.  Mm-hmm.  I'm sure they have a much more generous fraternity leave policy than that.  Right. I mean, yeah, there's that question of the role model question, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like, what kind of example is she setting?  I think that the reality is that she has a lot more money  than most people in the world and that she is going to be,  she's, her son is not going to be neglected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And for all we know, she has a playpen and a crib in her office.  I mean, we don't know what the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that is one rumor that there's an office next door  that will be devoted to the kid coming over,  which I think would be a wonderful thing.  Let's do it that way. What's wrong with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I, you know...  I think it'd be a great thing to have danger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, this does sound horrible and flip, but I don't mean it this way.  But I was in the offices of Boxxy yesterday.  There are two really cute dogs walking around.  You know, you can have kids around the office too.  There's no harm in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The thing is that they didn't hire her for her to use her hands.  Yes. Good point.  Or anything. She's using her mind.  She's not assembling iPhones. Good point.  As Boxxy used to say.  You know, so she's still got her brains at her command.  She's an executive. She's not, you know, she had, like, for example,  I don't think I could do it because I have to type to do my job,  but she doesn't.  She has meetings and she issues edicts, presumably,  and you can do that while you're holding a baby.  I think it's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She should have a baby Bjorn on and just go, you do this, do that.  And that's all she...  Anyway, I think it seems a little sexist to make a big deal out of this.  The only concern would be that there's some sort of unstated expectation now at Yahoo.  Well, Marissa took two weeks. What are you doing?  I don't think they'd do that.  I don't think they would.  Especially here in California.  Not this is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm ever amazed. I talk to people.  Tim Armstrong talked at an Adweek event in New York yesterday  and people asked him about Marissa and her plans, as did I.  When I was visiting Google, I asked about Marissa.  When other people asked about Marissa.  The respect she has across our industry is really, really impressive.  And, you know, we've talked about this on the show a lot  about how just her going to Yahoo gave Yahoo hope.  And that lives.  People are saying that she's done all the right things so far in terms of internal culture.  You know, it's still not clear what her strategy is.  But I think that she keeps the goodwill of the industry still.  And now she has a cute little baby boy without a name.  More to the point. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She commands respect because she works hard.  Yeah.  Right? And that's, you know, I think that's just part of this.  I, you know, when my girl was born, I was like, oh, where am I going to post pictures?  You know, I don't want to be that parent that like floods, you know, Facebook.  Why the hell not? Flood it, flood it, flood it.  Well, I really was like, I want to use a photo sharing app and I don't really want to do Instagram.  So what did you decide?  I went back to Flickr.  Interesting.  Yeah. I said, you know, I talked to my friends and they were like Flickr's for kids.  And, you know, Flickr's really great.  They really had that kind of early Google circles concept.  There's contacts, friends and family.  So most of my baby pictures are marked as family only.  I have a couple of public ones up and, you know, there's not a lot of people there.  But, you know, as a friend of mine said, you know, family will seek out cute pictures of the baby like truffle pigs.  I was like, how am I going to make my family set up Flickr accounts?  It's like they'll do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you set up a at a Tripani or whatever website dot com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I did register her domain name.  She has my wife's last name. Yeah.  So I have her domain name and I have a Twitter handle that I have not started tweeting as her.  She has a Twitter handle.  She does. But I haven't started tweeting as her because I haven't decided whether or not I think that's weird.  I'm kind of on the fence about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you should tweet.  Well, let me think.  You know what I love?  Remember that Gmail ad where they created a Gmail account for the baby and then mailed, you know, moms and dad wrote letters to the baby, sent pictures.  Wouldn't that be cool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that is a really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When I saw that ad, it made me sad that we didn't have Gmail when Henry and Abby were born.  I thought that would have been neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it should be the youngest verified Twitter account ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Make it so, Dick Costello.  We're talking to you here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have to call in a favor because I had to get an underscore on her name.  I wasn't I wasn't thrilled.  I have to call in a favor for my the user name and then the verified checkbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about Miss Edda?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Miss Edda. There's a lot of Eddas on Twitter.  I thought it was a unique name.  It really is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Beautiful name. I love that name.  Thank you.  Edda Rebecca.  Edda Rebecca Bailey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, um.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a great for those who are listening.  We are now observing pictures of Edda Rebecca.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're now looking at pictures of my daughter.  I probably shouldn't do this to listeners for too long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, there she is before she came home.  She was in the hospital.  Oh, she's not.  This is the best.  That's my favorite one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know exactly what she's saying right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can read baby.  She's saying, feed me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She's saying Google dropped Google Maps from Iowa.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's wired.  Where are my Google Maps?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love it.  Oh, is that a cute little munchkin?  So, OK, we're going to stop talking babies.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just I want to see Marissa's baby on Flickr.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think if Marissa's committed, she would post pictures on Flickr of baby Marissa.  We don't know the name yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She doesn't either, according to the last account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you have Edda?  Don't you usually have the name before the baby's born?  We had a working title.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Working title.  Yeah.  I like that.  Working title Jarvis.  My parents were frightened that we were actually going to name Jake Axel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Axel Jarvis.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We had two finalists and decided we want to look at her before we decided.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was kind of hoping you'd name her Betty after Betty and Mad Men.  But OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Betty Bailey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You got a thing for that Betty.  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  January Jones.  January is a kind of cool name.  I saw a picture of January Jones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess she lost a lot of that weight because she looked fantastic.  Fantastic.  I thought that was a fat suit.  I think it was a fat suit.  But how to do the fat face?  Was that prosthetics?  No, that's a good question.  She had a baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean she had a baby.  Oh, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She was pregnant.  Again with the babies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Changing the subject to something much more.  This is now this week in Goo Goo Dada.  Goo Goo Dada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe that's the name of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mitt Romney preparing for the debates tonight went to Chipotle for lunch.  And who is this guy on the left there on his right or his left?  There was some preppered reporter went and talked to him and he says this is the face

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  he does all the time.  This is a new internet meme in the making.  Meme in the making.  Oh, you're right.  Awesome profile picture.  Anyway, I actually I'm hesitant to mention the C word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because the May 11th 20 or something like that a year ago episode of Twig was recently  yesterday pulled from Google from YouTube because we played a Chipotle ad.  Oh, you're effing me.  Oh, a year ago.  They just noticed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We got an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Remember when we played the show?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Remember when we played I you know, I actually had to get our staff.  I think Tony Wang went through it to look at it.  I said, is there really a Chipotle copyright violation?  And he went through it.  And sure enough, I'm tweeting this right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dear Chipotle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me let me give you the the episode number.  I have to launch my mail and get the do you know what it was?  Was it what was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Was it I love it when Jeff trolls Chipotle tweets, which is there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was just pulled for giving you free.  We had back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Remember where they were going through the past pastures and all that stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, that they were saying that the media that they humanely treat their.  Yeah, it was a good ad.  And it was a it was a news story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it was fair use, you know, news coverage.  B, it was a freaking ad for Chipotle.  And they didn't.  By the way, it wasn't just like a ding or anything.  They yanked the video from YouTube.  They had it taken down.  And we got dinged on our copyright violation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  It's tweeted.  Retweet, tweet, army, retweet that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we're going to start talking about Rubio's.  Did you hear that Mitt Romney went to Rubio's for lunch before the debate or somewhere like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Health Max Burritos really good.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we could really get them.  I just this is, you know, I only raise it as an example of the stupidity of the DMC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Another stupid one.  And then run out.  Well, that wasn't there.  Oh, they're constant.  There was another one that run down today of a guy today.  Oh, look, no, his own.  He got pulled from what Google because he had a torrent of his own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. Google deranked him and no, not deranked.  But they said you can't have AdSense on your page because you have links on your page to the torrents at Pirate Bay and other places of your own book.  And of course, it's an automatic thing where they see, you know, the Pirate Bay dot com and and they pull you the AdSense off.  So he interacted with them, took down the links.  I think maybe he says he mentions you could find it on the Pirate Bay.  Still, they won't pull it down.  And it's part of the problem is this is it's this automated system.  You think a human ever did everything right?  Right. You know, he did what they asked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He still they still pull it.  But you know what? As far as I'm concerned, it's a competitive marketplace for customers.  He just needs to go to another ad network.  That's all there is to it.  If they want to if they want, you know, to have people using their ad network, then they need to not do this kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be the way to handle it?  That actually makes a lot of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's bad press for them because a lot of people are talking about it like us, for example.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I get I mean, look at these YouTube information about your video all about Android may have content that is owned or licensed by TV rain roux.  Information about frame rate.  You may have content that is owned or licensed by Press Association.  But most of the times they say it's still available.  This claim is not penalizing TNT three three four content owned or licensed by Futura Networks.  But then so most of the time I just ignore it and go, OK, fine.  This week in Google, one one two losers like us may have content that is owned or licensed by PCT.  So too.  But I got three of them PCTV all at once.  It's like they all of a sudden looked at that video.  Dow Jones PCTV.  Neither of them pulled the site down or penalized us.  But Chipotle did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My argument remains that that and I as Gina says, I'm I'm sympathetic to the scale of the problem that Google and YouTube have here.  And and the other issues that that come upon them, they've got to set up, I think, juries of human peers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's also and I think there's also fraud going on because look at this.  So here's the here's the takedown that this contains content from Chipotle Dow Jones PCTV and TV band that on this of Brazil.  I guarantee you, I guarantee you there's nothing owned by TV band that on this in Brazil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, your shirt.  Part of all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So so what's happening?  I believe it.  I would love to get some confirmation on this, but I think that people are gaming this system because they don't want to take it down.  See TV bandarante's what they probably wanted was fine.  We'll run some ads on it and we'll share in the revenue from this.  And I would suspect that that's what's going on is that if I hey, if I were a company, I would this would be an interesting way to try to make money.  Let's just assert copyright violation, not a ding.  Just say, can we run some ads on there?  Because that's one of the options you get.  You get some options.  You don't have to insist on a takedown.  A chipotle took it down, which is probably pissing off TV bandarante's because they don't get their ads now.  Anyway, it's still down.  We appealed it and it's still down.  So I don't know what the status.  It just seems like this is Google's weak spot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This this idea of like they're not being recourse or not know like human review or lack of customer service.  Like we hear these stories about, you know, AdSense accounts getting shut down or, you know, somebody's Gmail account unreachable and Google just being unreachable.  And it's just being difficult to, you know, have plead a case, you know, in any situation, either a copyright claim or just in general, Google's customer service has not been very purposefully.  It's not been something that they do.  Right.  I mean, can they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Another story, Gina.  Well, I go firstly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it practical?  I mean, how many videos are uploaded every second to YouTube?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  I mean, it's a good question.  I don't know that it is.  But Google deals in problems of scale.  But from very, very beginning, I think I think Steven Levy wrote about this and in the plaques right like the founders of Google's would, you know, they would get email from people complaining about search results.  And he said, don't write people back.  Don't waste our time, you know, emailing users back.  Let's just fix the problem algorithmically on our side.  You know, let's just gather the data, do our magic and fix it like that.  But but that leaves a lot of people I think in the lurch when you're especially when you're when you're publishing content or using services like an ad network.  Well, that's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It might be one thing for search.  I can understand that for search.  You know, people complain about search results.  Hey, look, it's algorithmic.  This is search results were reflecting the web.  We don't have to respond to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But pulling down a YouTube video because of inaccurate content takedowns, accusations, it's almost it's almost libelous to you that you would steal stuff.  Right.  And you're right.  Their reflex is always the algorithmic solution.  I think what what Leo said earlier is that this needs a human solution raises the question of scale.  But I do think it's an opportunity to have some brand.  If somebody goes to like the story, the BitTorrent guy, he's gone through three layers now, clearly a human being.  At some point, he deserves to have a human being to deal with.  I agree.  And and there needs to be a way to do that.  And I still think that this idea of juries appears that you take all of your advertisers and the advertisers who don't want to find Google messed up and, you know, you crowdsource with human beings this job of.  Trying to verify that something just doesn't smell right, which on its face it doesn't.  We put up an ad.  It's commercial.  You want it spread around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's no other thing is the other thing is I think they would save themselves a lot of trouble if they would sort of have the kind of verified sources.  So twit is a known quantity.  There's a lot of media that's discussed and you could go over a history very quickly and determine that this sort of, you know, this sort of thing exists on coming from this news source, from this video source.  And so sort of favor that that source and assume that that source is doing something unless somebody makes a really strong case.  You could go through and actually verify thousands of video sources and basically say, OK, these are OK.  These are legitimate operations that are covering media that are likely to come up with false positives if we treat them like everybody else.  And then you can focus on the random videos coming from miscellaneous uploaders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I suspect they're doing that.  We're just not big enough.  I mean, I bet you ABC and NBC and CBS don't have this problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'll bet you that there is a white list.  Yeah.  And you notice that they don't want to admit to a white list because the white list is anti algorithmic.  How's that for a new structure of philosophy?  Oh, that's that's just not algorithmic.  But but they have to.  They have huge clients.  And and you're right, Leo.  Then you're not big enough to be a huge client to just put on the way of the do not bother list.  If Leo is not big enough, then it's problematic.

Transcript:  The white list just ain't working.  I mean, if they had the concept of verified accounts on Google Plus, it doesn't seem like, you know,  right.  Well, big enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Gina in this case means big enough checks that go back.  That's exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Big enough to want to do a business deal.  Something like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, it's frustrating for me.  Fortunately, it's a year old show.  If had it been last week's show, it would be a costly error.

Transcript:  Quick nation to at Chipotle tweets.  Come on.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You might as well go after TV bandarias in Brazil while you're.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, I'm still bitter that Chipotle has not bought a friggin ad on Twig for all the free publicity.  Well, that's the funny thing.  We give it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What?  Why did they pull it?  Because we played a Chipotle ad on Twitter.  That's why they pulled it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You were eating Chipotle on the air at one point.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway.  OK.  It's just the welcome to the wild world of the web.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a ticket.  Moving along.  Now that I've taken care of my personal issues.  And mine.  And Gina's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't skipped a haircut this long since the 60s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you think?  I like it.  It's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, did you wash your hair last night or did you or not?  Hey.  Did you condition it?  No.  It looks a little tufty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is.  It's just long.  But I'm just trying to go through my personal issues.  OK.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Your turn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't have any.  No, no.  You're smart enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm a smart a drinking olive oil by the gallon.  Oh, yum.  Yum, yum, yum.  It's a good life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll never forget Dean Ornish coming on my radio show, plopping down a bottle of olive  oil saying, would you drink that?  Then why are you putting it in your food?  I think he's backed off on that a little bit now.  Let us move along and talk a little bit about maps, but not a lot.  Just briefly.  Maps are not in iOS 6.  They're not on the iPhone 5.  And Apple had to apologize for that.  And even this must have really made some people at Google's day suggest maybe you should use Bing or Google maps for the time being.  We're sorry we screwed up.  Wow.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, points to Mr. Cook and Apple for just being upfront and somewhat humble.  But yeah, that whole, hey, like, visit their website and then add a link to it on your home screen.  Yikes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Farhad Manju makes a really interesting point in Panda Daily.  He says, actually, since Tim Cook's apology, that's it's this maps debacle has turned into a win for Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that was the most fanboyish logic I have ever seen in my life.  Try to justify absolutely everything that Apple does as a brilliant move.  Brilliant move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Jesus.  He says the headline is Map Gate is over.  Apple won.  Customers won.  Google, not so much.  His point with Google is true, though, that Google must have known.  Certainly we've all known since June.  And really, we had a pretty good idea even long before then that Apple was planning its own mapping app.  They were buying mapping companies.  They even said a year ago when they had a privacy issue with data being stored on the iPhone, they said, well, we're collecting this data for a future app that will include traffic information.  They really have not made this a secret.  So Google certainly knew.  Why didn't they have an app ready?  Because every day that goes by without a Google Maps app is money down the tube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. And no, I honestly come to think that Google is better off for at least a little while of it not being there because people are now saying Apple's not perfect, that they do prefer Google apps.  And where do you get Google apps?  Well, Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Android.  Yeah. OK. But he says, and he quotes Horace Dedue, who's pretty good on this stuff, the company has admitted it makes more in ads on the iPhone than it does on Android devices.  Horace estimated Google makes about six bucks a year on every iPhone compared to two bucks for every Android phone.  After that search.  That's probably a lot of that is search.  They don't charge for the apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody else said today, I think it might have been you.  I don't know who was said that.  I know it was.  Search Engine Watch.  Danny, who said that probably now if there was any thought of pulling Google search off the iPhone, that's not true.  They dare not now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, because it would hurt them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I wonder why Apple didn't slam back up the Google app that existed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because it's an Apple app and it's and it's not.  Now, the other side of the story, I think we talked about this last week, was according to some sources, Google was the one that killed the maps by because Apple said, well, we don't have parity with Android.  You need to give it a turn by turn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure, demands of apples, but there was still another year on the contract.  Right.  So Apple pulled it because they weren't getting what they wanted, which was termed by other directions in the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't like it.  I tell you why.  But why wouldn't Google have a maps app ready?  I understand the schadenfreude and the but this is this is business.  Let's just be let's be good business people.  Yeah, there's a ton of data Google is no longer getting from Apple that is valuable.  There's a real tangible value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I go back to what I said, which is that I was drawn to this device by the services, right?  Not the heart.  Right.  And so the more addicted I am to Google services, the more I become addicted to the Google lifestyle.  So the point that when I stopped at Best Buy today, I stopped by the guy, the poor, very lonely guy who stands there a day and day trying to pitch Chromebooks.  What a lonely job.  And this guy, who did he piss off at Google?  He's wearing a Google shirt.  Best Buy is the coolest guy at Best Buy.  But and I started talking to him and I'm honestly not thinking about a Chromebook because I'm just so into the Google services now and I just use them all.  So I don't know.  I'm not trying to I could sound like the Google version of Farhan if I go too far on this.  Arguing this with Google's brilliant move.  But all I'm actually trying to say is that I think that there is a silver lining for this in Google more than for Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the theory that Google is that Google is withholding and deliberately sort of foregoing revenue and visibility on iOS is inconsistent with what it's done historically with a gazillion other things.  I mean, a lot of things have actually come out.  A lot of Google things have come out on iOS before the Android version.  And for the most part, with the exception of this turn by turn directions thing on maps, which I don't really know the details about that.  But for the most part, it's always been kind of shockingly and refreshingly conspicuous that Google has tried to get everything on both devices.  I think it was even the Google Plus app came out first on iOS.  Right. And then it came out on Android weeks later.  So it's it just doesn't feel right that they would do that.  It's inconsistent with everything else they've done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I use the iPhone and an Android phone, and I've just come to accept that the maps experience on the iPhone is inferior because I was just used to turn by turn on Android.  I mean, I think that that's Google sort of making it's like maps is better on Android.  I think that they're really making that point with this.  But it was interesting. I spent a lot of time in the hospital this past week taking care of my daughter.  And I was overhearing the nurses talking about the new iPhone.  And obviously, people not working didn't work in technology.  And it was fascinating because, you know, I go, Dr. So-and-so got the new iPhone five.  Did you see it? Oh, it's bigger and faster.  And then one of them said, yeah, but I heard Google's not on it.  What am I what am I going to do without Google on my phone?  I can't be without Google on my phone.  This was like word for word.  And I was just I was really surprised, you know, that it was they were conflating maps and Google search.  She was saying, how am I going to get anywhere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's always interesting to hear normal people talk. Oh, fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They were really excited about the iPhone five, like really excited about it.  You know, just like, oh, it's new. You see it.  And, you know, so, you know, this apparently this doctor always had the new toys.  So they was like, oh, has she been through yet? We want to see it.  So excitement, but also just this, you know, I heard Google's not on it.  What does that mean?  So, you know, I think I don't think that Google has a universal policy about which platform they release for first.  I think that they have a very rich company with lots of different teams.  And I think that they just, you know, that those teams make decisions about which platform to launch first on kind of independently.  Also, there's Apple's approval process, which we know can be really protracted, you know, for Google products.  So they might work on iOS app, you know, sooner in some cases and later in others.  Though I have to say, I agree, they should have had a Google Maps app kind of in their back pocket, native app in their back pocket.  I would be surprised if they if they do. And if that isn't what do they make a statement about this that is not going out for next few months?  Is that I haven't said anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Eric Schmidt's been said some fairly opaque things like, well, it's Apple's decision.  What can we do? And we would like to be everywhere.  And of course, Google has said you can always use the Web page.  It works. Just bookmark it onto your home page.  In fact, that's what Tim Cook also said.  I don't know. Google has been pretty opaque about what its plans are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it seems like in the meantime, that story is going to be if you want a great maps experience, you get an Android phone.  And I wouldn't be surprised if that app showed up in the App Store in the next few weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mike, why why haven't they have that?  So what is our consensus? Are they writing one? Have they written one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. Yeah, who knows who knows what they're doing.  But I think that, you know, they they've made a decision and they had some reason for that decision.  They haven't told us about.  Could be that if they told us the decision, we go, that makes a lot of sense.  Could be that we'd be outraged. We don't know about that.  But the larger issue that actually these these doctors and nurses you overheard actually kind of onto something because both Google and Apple and other companies are headed for this world where instead of having all these apps all over the place,  where you individually go and search and browse and and pan around on a map and and and get results on a search engine,  you're going to talk to a Siri like virtual assistant and all these cases, Google now Siri.  Other people are going to have these things and they're just going to give you answers.  So they're kind of all jockeying for position for this new world of having everything.  And they're still going to be using search and maps and, you know, all these other services.  They're just going to be invisible by the service, the surface, just like they are on Siri.  So, for example, Siri uses Google, but not the advertising for Google.  And and Siri uses all these other services that are actually replaceable.  You can you can swap out, you know, if Apple wanted to, they could just toss out Google search, throw in Bing, and you'd still be using Siri.  And so, you know, there's a lot of this kind of jockeying for position for this new world of virtual assistant technology where all the answers are just handed to you.  And people want to own the part of it where they're harvesting personal information.  They're harvesting information about where you are and what you're buying and what you're doing and all this stuff,  because that's really where the money is in in this in this new sort of context, sensitive advertising.  So it's hard to it's hard to parse out which part of this is jockeying for position and which part of it is the thermonuclear war against Google and which part of it is just how it how the chips are falling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  According to Walt Mossberg today in AllThingsD.com, Google will announce Thursday that it is adding Street View to the Web version of Google Maps that you use on the iPhone and the iPad, which to me is Google saying, shoot, quick, fix the Web app.  And then he says, I tested this edition, which displays 360 degree photographic street views of select locations and interior photographic views of certain businesses, ours, using sample links Google sent me.  So Google has gone to Walt Mossberg and say, no, no, look, we're going to add this on Thursday.  He says, Cagely, I also believe Google is working on a new Google Map app for the Apple platform that would be offered as an additional download.  My guess is somebody at Google said that, by the way, the app is coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what it sounds like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep. He does this all in the context of his review of Google Maps on Android, in which he says is mature, powerful.  He loved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's definitely the thing I miss the most with the iPhone for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Interesting. See, I don't use it that much.  And even the the Apple Maps where we are in the Bay Area are just fine.  I mean, it's not it's not they're not inadequate.  But, you know, in some areas, I understand that they are.  And I use other apps like Waze, which I love, which is on both Android and iPhone and is a crowd sourced turn by turn direction system.  That's great. So I don't I don't I'm not sure I miss Google Maps that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I should I should really use Waze more.  I never I always want the turn by turn directions and I just launch maps and then I'm like, oh, I look at this map.  I want to tell me to turn left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a good point, because, of course, when you use Siri on the Google on the iPhone, it immediately launches Apple's maps.  Siri does not have a direct connect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's occurring to me that it's kind of the duck duck go of maps or perhaps duck duck would be a good brand for the new Apple Maps.  Did you see the New Yorker cover remake?  Yes.  It's done by Apple Maps magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mad Magazine did it. Yeah. Yeah.  I hope Mad puts out on the cover of their next issue.  Let me see if I could find it.  But, you know, New York has always done this.  New York has always published, you know, the New Yorker's view of the country and it's always New York and then the rest of the country's kind of over there.  LA. LA. Yeah, right.  So it's all the rundown.  Yeah, it's a slow.  It's a I'll try another link here.  I'm frozen solid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do think it's worth noting that the whole maps debacle did not go the way Apple planned it to go.  Yes, that's clear.  And it's been a horrible PR black eye and really a bad.  It's really a bad thing now within, you know, just coming near the one year anniversary of Steve Jobs death that they seem to be stumbling and fumbling and making a lot of mistakes.  They had some mistakes with some advertising that they did where, you know, they came out with these weird, you know, Apple genius ads that kind of hit with a thud.  They pulled them and then denied that they pulled them because they were horrible.  You know, there's a bunch of stuff like that that just feels like I mean, it doesn't feel like they're a disastrous company.  They feel like an ordinary company lately making these big blunders of the kind that maybe they did and maybe they didn't make before.  But without the reality distortion field to make it all good again, it's really, you know, they're looking like a normal company and a good but normal company that makes wonders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They make mistakes, but they always, you know, there's I could think of hundreds of Apple mistakes.  I don't anybody who thinks Apple doesn't make mistakes is not paying attention from the cube to ping.  We have plenty of examples of Apple stumbling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I successes are so stellar, though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When they do it right, they do it right.  And, you know, those nurses aren't far wrong from a fashion point of view from, you know, that's that.  And I think that's what sells the iPhone at this point.  It's not technological excellence.  It's beautiful.  It's a it's an apple that is not what Apple does.  They do hardware.  It's beautiful.  Oops.  Oh, don't drop it.  Now it's scratch.  It's too thin and light.  That's why you drop it.  Actually, the funny thing is, you know, everybody always raves about how good looking these are and then puts it in a case that makes it look like in 1950s appliance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do my one iOS six.  I haven't got I haven't gotten the iPhone five.  I got I have the four S and I just upgraded to iOS six.  My one sort of gripe about it.  And this is just because I've been taking tons of pictures of the baby.  So I keep getting this iCloud, you know, you're running out of storage upgrade cloud storage prompt like every single time I pick up my phone.  Like I'm trying to take a video of my newborn and I have like a manager set, you know, manager storage settings prompt.  Yeah.  So frustrating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why computers don't belong on TVs, toasters or cameras, because that's what computers do is they annoy you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They annoy you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a smart TV that kept asking me to log into Facebook.  I'm watching TV.  I don't want to log into Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just I don't want smart anything.  No, I don't want my things to be dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're look I'm looking for a complete, you know, backlash and everybody is going to start using Western Electric.  Here's the picture from the New Yorker now using Apple Maps.  And of course, it's it's it's all confused.  They've got the Champs-Elysees going down the middle of Manhattan, then the Sea of Galilee leading to the equator and Kuala Lumpur.  And then the Mississippi River in the middle right there.  Yeah, it's pretty good chat.  It's yeah, this obviously it's not this bad.  But Turkey is next to Las Vegas and Brooklyn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, someone from Brooklyn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's good.  And the Yukon territory is just between Brooklyn and Chad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hope this doesn't affect the wonderful Mad Magazine iOS app on for the iPad.  Fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And by the way, here's an update from Gizmodo.  Apparently, our engineering team just gave me this information.  We recommend that you angle the camera away.  Oh, this is the purple.  This is the purple haze.  Purple flare.  You're holding it wrong.  You're holding it wrong.  Holy cow.  Our engineering team just gave me this information.  We recommend that you angle the camera away from the bright light source when taking pictures.  The purple flare in the image provided is considered normal behavior for iPhone 5's camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We don't want to fix that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple will never get over your holding it wrong.  Never, ever, ever.  All right.  So enough of Farhad and the map.  I think we've done enough of the mapping.  We've said we had to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's find a way out of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's get it.  I know I can't.  How about an ad?  That's the best anchor from which to launch the next topic.  And our ad today from Squarespace.com.  Everything you need to make an exceptional website.  The new Squarespace is here.  Squarespace 6 hit was more than a year in the making because the folks at Squarespace decided to do a total rewrite.  Now, let me first say what Squarespace is.  It's web hosting and the software on top of it tightly integrated.  And that gives you a really much better experience.  One of the reasons Squarespace sites never go down, they've got really great fast responsive sophisticated algorithms to make sure the site never goes down no matter how much traffic you get.  But also you don't have to worry about security because it's automatically patched.  It's always up to date.  Squarespace sites, to my knowledge, I don't know of any Squarespace site ever guiding one of those malware warnings.  We get that all the time.  Even on our site.  It's really kind of amazing exceptional stuff.  When you use a new Squarespace 6, one of the features you're going to get is something that's very hot right now in the web design world is called responsive design.  And it needs to be because it used to be you would have a mobile site distinct from your regular site.  You know, this is for big screens, this for little screens.  But now so many people use your sites on mobile that really the best way is to adapt to have a site that looks great.  Same site on any size screen.  And that's what Squarespace is now doing.  So when you upload an image, for instance, a Squarespace.com, you'll upload one image that they make seven different versions out of one size for every different possible screen from the iPhone to a 27 inch monitor.  When you design your site using the drag and drop or even if you CSS and JavaScript, the design automatically reflows to fit the screen that you're on.  It's just so elegant, so modern.  By the way, their templates, totally modern to take a look at those.  You go to Squarespace.com, take a tour.  And if you'd like, if you'd like to try it free, you can just they have a right on the front page there.  The get started button that will actually start you at the beginning with the templates.  You could select a template.  You could change it.  This is so cool.  They've completely separated content from design.  So that kind of like CSS Zen garden does.  So, you know, you create your design, start loading content and anytime you just click a new design and boom, everything reflows into that design.  I just I just think they've done such a good job.  Try it free for two weeks.  You don't need a credit card.  You don't need any personal information except your email address and you're good to go.  If you decide to buy.  There are two different plans.  There's the basic plan and there's the unlimited plan.  Starts at eight dollars a month when you buy a year.  But, you know, for 16 bucks a month, you get unlimited pages, galleries and blogs, unlimited bandwidth, unlimited storage, unlimited contributors.  They'll give you a custom domain name when you sign up for a year on any or either plan.  So if you want to have at a Rebecca Bailey dot com, you could they wire that up.  They give it to you free and then they wire it up.  That goes right to your Squarespace site.  The form builder, Mailchip sync, complete integration of all the social networks.  Sixteen bucks a month.  Now, here's the deal.  If you decide you go want to do that, I would use the offer code twig10.  T W I G and one zero for the tenth month because that'll give you 10 percent off whatever your first purchase is.  So do the year long purchase so you get the most bang for your buck.  I think Squarespace is fantastic and I know you're going to want to try it.  And it's perfect if you have a newborn or some special event like a newlywed, you know.  Well, I'll give you an example.  Ryan Block of Veronica Belmont just got married and they initially Ryan was telling me on Twitter.  They went to like a site that does wedding, you know, provided as wedding sites and it was terrible.  So so Verona said, let's just do it on Squarespace.  So their block, Mont site was on Squarespace and it's just the easiest thing in the world.  And it's perfect for a one off occasion like that.  Squarespace.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, Leo, one of the things that is least I've become a Squarespace user recently and it's amazing.  It's like super amazing.  One of the things that's least appreciated about it is the way support works in all the web based stuff that I've used in the past.  You click on support and it drops you off into this knowledge base that kind of says, well, good luck.  Maybe you can find it because you'll never find our phone number or email address.  And they always try to make you go through this sort of crucible to get to the actual support.  Even if you know that your question is not going to be in the knowledge base on Squarespace, you hit support and it says, just ask us a question.  And you just send them an email and they send you an answer.  It's amazing. Great. 24 7. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody Squarespace. Try it.  Twig 10. Somebody just told me that Mitt Romney is doing a Google Plus hangout right now.  Pre pre debate or is that is that going to be later?  Really? Somebody mentioned that in the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's doing it from Chipotle, I think.  That's actually one of the interesting things.  I don't know if that's true or not, but one of the interesting things that's happening in this debate is while the debate is going on, other people are going to be I don't want to say heckling, but making commentary live during the debate.  One of them is Gary Johnson, who's the libertarian candidate and sued the organization who's holding the debates for excluding him.  So he feels that he should have been included in the debates and he was not.  So instead of just being silent during the debates, he's actually going to be kind of like a science mystery science theater.  He's going to be sitting there making comments throughout the entire debate.  There's also Reason magazine. I think it's going to do that.  So it's kind of an interesting new world of debates where the whole point of a debate used to be that the candidates that were the anointed candidates of the two parties had a monopoly on the nation's attention.  But now now that we have social media and especially video social media like Google Plus Hangouts, you're going to have other people throwing in their voices and having a critical eye at what's going on in real time.  So it's going to be a really interesting election.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That turns the democratic response upside down. Do it in real time.  So this is, in fact, if you follow Mitt Romney on Google Plus, right there at the top of his feed, Debate Night Hangout.  Now, he's not in there right now, but Romney for America people are.  And I wonder if he might stop by. I mean, he's got some more important things to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But this is also announced a bunch of Twitter handles.  You know, after the debates, you have the idiot structure of the of the spin room where you go and you listen to the two sides spin.  What you just heard is if you can't decide yourself. Well, the spin room is now Twitter.  So Romney's staff to also respond to what Mike was talking about will be putting out their spin on Twitter, as obviously Obama's staff will the same as we'll all we citizens will be all saying the same and we'll get drowned in spin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. What Romney meant to say just there was there have been some great hashtags this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Romney was supposedly off rehearsing zingers and trying to find zingers.  So now Romney zingers a good hashtag. A lot of speculative figures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, on the one hand, I celebrate the fact that there are these unmediated channels for a candidate or a campaign to talk to voters, because I think that's great.  I mean, unmediated is fantastic.  But on the other hand, there is an even better facility now for voters who don't want to hear the other side just to say, well, I'm going to follow this hashtag.  And and then I'll only you know, now I'm in my own spin room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but the echo chamber argument, but I think we know that what happens is you'll find people in that hashtag arguing with people in the opposing hashtag unless you have some sense of that opposing hashtag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And, you know, I, of course, am following both candidates, hoping to see germane tweets from them.  Romney only has I'm kind of surprised 1.2 million followers on Twitter.  What is President Obama has something like 10 million or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think he's a lot and a lot of them are fake. A lot of both candidates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right. That's right.  Remember that. In fact, that's right.  Wasn't that the case that they analyzed that MIT had a huge jump on one day of something like 20,000?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And and most of those people are a big, big percentage of those people had been using Twitter for something like four days and didn't have a profile picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  President Obama's account is 20 million.  And then the White House account has 3.1 million.  Right. It's interesting. They are debating on Twitter or their their proxies are debating on Twitter.  That's very interesting.  Although not as much stuff going well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Interesting. There's a whole list of things that I want to hear on the debate tonight, including, you know, well, Google admit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think you will? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. It would be wouldn't be great if we got some kind of techno savvy moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is a debate drinking game at debate drinking dot com, but I don't see Google in here.  But I should just send a chair. I wouldn't be surprised if this will be a good measure.  Look, this is clearly every, you know, every campaign every four years.  It's more and more influenced by the Internet and digital and technology.  I wouldn't be surprised at all to see some references to certainly you'll see Twitter references.  Right. Yeah.  What an interesting idea in a debate to say what you have to say and say, hey, if you're interested in more, I've got a page with this.  Right. Do you think the candidates might do that? Push people to a URL? Sure.  But yeah, well, remember, who was it? Was it Ralph Nader kept saying his 800?  Exactly. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or, you know, there's other phrases like, well, as I was saying on Twitter, Mr. President, I'll be listening for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think we'll hear that.  I think that this could be well, I was just read what a citizen had to say on Twitter, Mr. President.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I think it was moments like that when they want to want to be cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. We'll be watching for that with great interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's also an interesting thing that CNN is apparently doing that they're going to allow people to spin out clips and then share it on social media in real time, replay things and essentially give people the tools to to spin out memes as they happen.  So in other words, instead of people just talking about what did he just say that?  What did he say? You'll be able to just attach a video and off it goes a link to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I remember four years ago there was a lot of controversy that the networks were putting were not allowing clips of the debates to go up or they were you had to go to their site, which the whole thing.  Boy, that's terrible.  That'd be good. Yeah, it's our future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. You're being allowed to broadcast this debate as a privilege and this doesn't belong to you belongs to the people.  I wonder what Facebook's going to do. I wonder what is it going to be broadcast live on YouTube?  Yes. Yes. First time.  Nice. Wow.  Boy, I tell you everything is now being brought the Olympics are broadcast live on YouTube. The conventions are broadcast live on YouTube. Now the debate broadcast live on YouTube YouTube really is better not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Romney better not mention Chipotle. They're going to pull the whole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow, that's interesting.  Very interesting. I'll have to I'll have to.  I wonder how many more how many people will watch it on YouTube versus watching it on TV. It'll be tiny tiny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think it makes a big statement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know the question, but I think what Mike just said about about the ability to go in and send clips around necklace stuff.  You need that added functionality to beat the convenience of television as a reason to use the media. Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's see.  Google passes Microsoft's market value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Last week was the fifth largest company in the third largest tech company.  And now it's number two tech company.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By merely by rising 1% its its stock market value.  To a seven hundred sixty one dollars a share at the close, giving it a market capitalization at the end of the day yesterday of two hundred fifty billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's interesting to look at the rise of Google's share price because I think it's the you know my my gut feeling is that it's Wall Street's acceptance of the new Larry version of Google.  Yes.  I mean, he's doing a lot of underperforming and peripheral properties.  He's doing all those all those things that he should do.  And it's he's running the company really well.  I think the comparison with Microsoft, though, is loopy.  It doesn't make any sense.  I mean, I guess I'll be honest.  I think.  Well, yeah.  But I mean, whenever I mean, this is kind of like talking about the iPhone three weeks before the iPhone ships.  There's always this dip.  I mean, Microsoft is coming in toward the end of a period where it's got an old operating system, old versions of Office, all that kind of stuff.  And, you know, I think there's a reasonably good chance that after Windows eight ships and after they sort of like, you know, sort of reconstitute themselves as they do occasionally, you know, they could surpass Google again.  And it really if there's no connection really between Microsoft's business and Google's business, you know, being, for example, is not a good business.  Being, for example, is not a significant, significant part of Microsoft's revenue.  No, in fact, it's a drain on revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're huge amount of money they pour into online.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the companies doesn't make any sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Since 2000, Microsoft stock has held pretty much between 20 and 40 bucks is very consistent.  I'm looking at the chart right now.  That much has happened there.  Google has really they are tech companies.  They are different models.  Google really has seen a distributed model that Microsoft couldn't imagine.  And now we have, you know, Microsoft trying to copy Google and doing things like phones and other services.  You know, they're still, I think, struggling to find their place in this world.  And one of the stories in the rundown is that Microsoft is going to start a new news service when it gave up MSNBC and the sale to NBC.  I put that in just for you.  Yeah, now they're done.  Not only do that, one of my former editors, when I worked at advanced publications, Dean Betts is there.  And the way he put it to me was not that they were adding website for news.  He's there to edit news for Windows 8.  They're adding content into the OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they have a great little news tile, actually.  It's actually really nicely done.  And it's by default on the front page of all Windows 8 devices, the tablets, the phones, as well as the desktops.  And it's already beautiful.  And when you use it full screen, it's actually a gorgeous looking newspaper.  That's it. So that's what the news operation is designed for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they're hiring human editors, unlike Google News, and they are licensing full scale content, lawyers and EP and such.  And they're going to try to create a content business again.  They've tried again and again in the past.  And it might be great, but it just kind of I think it indicates, Mike, that that Microsoft is is you could view it two ways of flailing a bit or stagnant a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's so frustrating with Microsoft because they have so many cool things that they could really turn into monsters.  I mean, you look at Connect and all the potential there is in Connect.  Okay, that's the brand exception that everybody raises.  Name two.  Well, okay.  Here's another one.  Microsoft Pixel Sense, which is their gigantic iPad.  You know, this thing has been, you know, they acquired Perceptive Pixel, which was the other big screen, you know, gigantic thing.  And they're kind of doing these.  They're using this technology, which is breathtakingly good for vertical things, for casinos and nightclubs and retail and stuff like that.  We really need big, big, big, bold things out of Microsoft.  Like, for example, coming out with a big Pixel Sense table for consumers, you know, charges charge four thousand or even five thousand dollars for but come out with something that runs Windows eight.  That's a big, gigantic touch table.  I mean, do something really bold like that.  Do something really bold with Connect.  I mean, they're going to have a Connect for for Windows eight for the desktop, which which I think is fantastic.  But they're not quite connecting.  There's some really leading edge technology with the broader consumer marketplace in the way that Apple is so good at doing.  So it's just frustrating that they have all these little things that are great.  I mean, Windows, the Windows phones are great.  The surface looks promising.  But let's let's, you know, start, you know, let's beat it up here, guys.  This is a new world and you can't just like drag your drag your feet for years.  I mean, Ballmer was talking about a consumer version of what was then called the surface now called Pixel Sense.  What was that? Two years ago, he was saying, you know, we're we're on the edge of coming out with a consumer version.  I haven't heard a word. I guess maybe that turned into the surface tablet.  That's probably what I meant. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I think that the news operation is probably considered kind of de minimis for Microsoft.  It's just that while we have the real estate on the screen, why not take advantage of it and give some value back, give some value back.  And I wouldn't be surprised if there's some bigness in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, this goes back to to to my thinking about the Chromebook today.  And I know you both laugh at me because it's it's it's, you know, meant for grandmas.  But but would it be possible to live fully in Google?  What's what's left of my Microsoft life? Just word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that's a good point.  And the only reason I use Word is because my editors insist that I use Word.  It's a legacy. It's become a legacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, although I have to say in accounting, our staff needs Excel and uses Excel.  So the spreadsheet may stay vital in business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But of course, I don't add of a journalist. So I need to do that.  And the other thing I'm about to call my broker and sell my Microsoft to buy Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really? Is that because Facebook's so low?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Why not?  And Microsoft has been stagnant. I've been living at thirty five dollar Microsoft for  and not that I have much folks.  I don't. But just as a way to kind of keep track on the industry, it's a way to make me look it up every day.  And Microsoft's at thirty bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, in the same article, Microsoft also says that it hired a former CBS executive to run a studio generating content for the Xbox.  So, Mike, you might be you might have something there might be that Microsoft is thinking, here's a way to to use our our platforms and get some more value out of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think that what they all should be doing and what some of them are really trying to do, Apple certainly trying to do it is to have the soup to nuts thing through through something.  I cloud or something like it.  And Apple doesn't do content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They sell. They sell other people's content.  I mean, they do a little. OK, there's the iTunes concerts they do in September, but that's about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, they don't do it yet. There's so many of these barriers that are being broken.  You know, Google bought Motorola. You know, there's all these strange things that these these areas that you think, well, that company doesn't do that.  Everybody's like trampling those barriers.  And so, you know, I think Apple will be happy to make content if it makes sense for them.  Google is doing it. Yeah, I don't think I don't think no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google does not doing content.  They're not owning and creating content. They remain a platform for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They would be in channel conflict. Apple would be a no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you're wrong.  They spend one hundred fifty million dollars on YouTube channels, creating contents for YouTube.  And they're going to do another two hundred million in the fall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They don't own them. They don't own them, Leo. They invested in them.  They want to encourage it, which is just that's a very good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And in fact, I was surprised to hear those contract deals do not, in fact, own, give them ownership of the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just like Engie underwriting soap operas or Northern Exposure.  They want more stuff there. They need more stuff there.  And so the way they get it is to invest in it.  But they do not want to find themselves in channel conflict with with the likes of us.  And I think that's right. So I think Apple's in the same boat.  Whereas content has been the strategy of Yahoo.  We'll see if it stays that under Marissa. And it is the sole strategy of AOL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And apparently Microsoft, maybe. Although it could just be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Microsoft has gotten to try to get into it before. You know, they started.  Besides MSNBC, what else? MSN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Slate. Slate.  So this is not new for Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not new. It's always been kind of a, you know, a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a side business. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a sideshow. So I show it's basically somebody says we have all these people who don't change their homepages.  And we have a potential of a quote unquote fire hose.  Whose favorite phrase, right? AOL's too.  And so we were repointed. We got to have something to point at.  Which will benefit us. And so back in the day, I was one of many who did deals with Microsoft or was around them rather for content companies.  We'll point the fire hose at you. What's it worth?  And you want to get wet? Can I not have them pointed at me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How much is that worth?  Google. You talked about Larry Page and spring cleaning. Google is.  We're still waiting to hear about feed burner.  I don't know why there's. They haven't said anything, have they?  But the strong impression people have that feed burner is going to be going away.  Dead man walking. Dead man walking.  And one indicator is that they have killed AdSense for fees feeds, which is pretty much the way feed burner monetizes.  So maybe they will stop feed burn. I don't appeal.  There's a lot of people rely on feed burner to create their feeds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Remember when we all wrote blogs and use feed burner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot of podcasts use feed burner, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true. Yeah, I actually use feed burner too, because I what I do is I automatically publish my Google Plus feed.  Is a newsletter and I use feed burners part of that process because I get a I get an RSS feed from a from a generator.  There's these different companies that will spin out, you know, give you an RSS feed of your Google Plus feed.  But that doesn't work with with MailChimp, which is what I used to send the newsletter.  So I kind of launder it through feed burner.  And so I don't know where else I'll do that. I'm sure there's some other place to do it.  But what I don't understand is why would Google's want to kill this thing?  It doesn't seem like it's a high maintenance service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they've been pointing out at various times they've killed it.  That's not the equation. The equation is, is this business beneficial for Google or not?  And they're killing things that are small and harmless, but they're getting rid of them.  Here's another question. Is this a window onto Dick Costolo's brain?  Right. Because Dick was the CEO of FeedBurner.  I never understood a business model for FeedBurner.  Hmm. Yeah. Dick's the CEO of Twitter. I still don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe Dick Costolo is the problem.  So the evidence that they're going to kill FeedBurner is that there is no longer a FeedBurner Google Plus account.  There is no longer a FeedBurner Twitter account.  And the API feed was taken offline.  And now they've chopped off its ability to monetize.  I have a feeling that this is death by a thousand cuts.  They're slowly cutting it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know what I'm going to do. Do you have any alternatives?  Because that's one of my RSS feed for the blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. Well, here's a call out to Gina and all you programmers.  We need a FeedBurner replacement. Stat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, it's so funny. I use FeedBurner for my blog too, but I just never, I never look at it.  I mean, I guess I'm just going to use the WordPress, you know, whatever.  My CMS is just raw feed. I guess FeedBurner gives you those stats about how many people are subscribed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. But when was the last time you looked, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't remember. Five years, six years.  Yeah. A long time. I mean, a long time.  Remember when the little bug, the FeedBurner bug with how many subscribers that you have was so popular?  My concern is that this means that the Google's kind of doesn't care about RSS as much anymore,  which means that maybe Reader won't be around as much.  You know, I'm just kind of worried like that the old school days of newsreaders and RSS feeds might be over.  Maybe I shouldn't be worried. Maybe that's a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I just.  They've always been kind of hostile about it in Chrome. You go to RSS, most browsers, you just paste in an RSS XML link  and it just shows it to you. In Chrome, it's all, well, you should download a plugin.  Right.  You know, it's like I never understood their hostility to that format. RSS is good.  I just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder what Dave Weiner has to say about this.  Make it four out of four now. We all use FeedBurner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just realized I use FeedBurner on my blog to to make for an email version.  They make an email out of it.  That's right. I forgot that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why they're dragging their tail on actually killing actual.  Yes.  Because they start pulling the thread out of the Internet and it's like everybody's using this thing.  Well, we can't understand. We can't understand you.  I don't know why you're getting a transmission from the Martian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you're back. Yeah.  By the way, this this email subscription to my blog.  Let me see how many subscribers I have. Oh, zero.  I've been doing that for five years and I have zero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you could increase you could increase that by by 300 percent right now if we all know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, don't because who knows how long it'll last.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Leo, that's your tech guy audience, isn't it?  Oh, yes, they'd be more likely to use an email newsletter, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am puzzled.  Zero subscribers, zero reach.  Earn money, it says, from all that traffic.  They still are advertising adsense for feed for feeds, even though they've killed it.  Well, I must be doing something wrong.  That's so I might as well take that block out of my blog.  How funny. What if I subscribe now?  Not that I put anything on my blog anymore, but maybe maybe they killed FeedBurner and no one noticed.  Wouldn't that be funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, what Gina's point was before you're right, though, imagine the day after when you go to you go to reader.  Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. But I'm concerned.  Well, I'm concerned about reader in general.  FeedBurner has to help Google do some really cool stuff with reader, right?  Like some good optimizations and they have data about what's going on with those feeds through FeedBurner.  If they're get rid of FeedBurner, does that mean that they're going to get rid of Google Reader eventually, too?  Like are we kind of is this Google saying we're if this happens, are we in a post RSS world?  Is it all going to be Google Plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that doesn't work for so much stuff. Yeah. Yeah, I know. I know it.  And email email doesn't work. Email is is the brokenest of feeds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How many of you go through a newsreader every day like an I use Flipboard now instead of a newsreader.  OK. Jeff and Mike, do you guys use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I use it for my ego stuff. Uh huh. OK. Right.  Starting off there. What's what's there? I use it for certain feeds.  But I you know, I used to have about 100 feeds.  Now I probably go through half a dozen and you look at it every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You check your feeds every day. OK. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Currents. Anybody use currents?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, when I was at Google, I said something about, you know, I should use currents more.  And nobody said, yes, you should. They all kind of sure.  That's sad. I think they don't know what currents is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a nice little app, but it's not. It looks nice.  Yeah. Feedburner is really not feedburner.  A flipboard is really the thing is nice.  I really like Flipboard and it's kind of like reading your feeds,  except that the feeds coming from Twitter, not from RSS.  Oh, right.  I don't understand, but Gina can probably explain.  Google wants to make your site a little bit faster with its new tag manager.  Yes, please explain. I don't know what the hell that means.  I read it. I still don't understand it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Would you explain it? You know, I read it too.  And this is this is kind of a weird product that I'm not totally sure I understand.  This is what I think it does.  So the idea is that when you run a site, you drop in a bunch of little widgets  and tags for marketing metrics and analytics and ads and things like that.  And Google saying that those things slow down your web page when it when it loads.  So from what I understand, tag manager is and I hope Googlers and people  in chat room correct me if I get this wrong, is it's a way to set up all those tags  through Google and then just put that tag, you know, tag, meaning like the HTML markup  in your page and that route and that routes it through Google and that speeds up your page.  So they're caching. So caching. Yeah.  Yeah, it just provides, you know, makes it faster.  And I think also it means that people in marketing don't have to go to the web developer  to say, hey, can you just drop this new widget onto every page in the site?  But it also just gives a web front end to marketing folks to do that on their own through Google.  That's what I think it does.  I mean, it's not just you, Leo, like the description of the product is is weird, is a little weirdly made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me read it from the Google Tag Manager page.  Why use Google Tag Manager? Google Tag Manager is free and easy, leaving more time  and money to spend on your marketing campaigns.  You manage your tags yourself with easy to use web interface rather than forcing you  or your IT department to write or rewrite site code.  Maybe marketers understand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think it's just a way to say here's we're dropping in code.  This is these are all our marketing analytics tags.  And now our marketing department can just manage them through Google instead of having a message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's some sort of analytics.  And does Google learn all that stuff as it passes through Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, Google gets a lot of information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's what's really interesting about this, right?  It works with services which are non-Google as well.  So, yeah, you're basically routing through Google for other services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess what I don't know is what is a tag? What do they mean when they say tag?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a really weird name.  It's not what we think it is.  It's a snippet of JavaScript or an iframe or, you know, like those little bits of code that we add to the bottom of our pages to do analytics.  I think it's that.  Google Analytics is a tag.  Right, Google Analytics, for example, would be a tag, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do not think that word means what you think it means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was, remember back in the day when there were ping services that had something new on your site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not Apple ping, but you could ping.  You know, we just had this conversation because there's no way to let iTunes know that you've updated the feed anymore.  You used to be able to ping them and say, hey, the feeds knew, would you reload?  You can't do that anymore. They took it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so the problem was that you had all kinds of RSS servers and such.  This is all RSS-worthy. It's very related to the previous topic.  Trying to constantly go to servers.  So instead, there was a creation, Dave Winder was involved in this, where you would ping out and it would ping everybody for you.  And that got bought by, I think, VeriSign back in the day because that was going to be really valuable.  You knew where all the fresh content was.  And Google scaled that by just saying, oh, heck, we'll just check everywhere.  We're at 10 seconds, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're not thinking of ping FM. That's something else.  That was something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This was so that you could update all kinds of feed servers that you had new content.  This is how old I am in this business, children.  I remember ping services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do too. No, that was something we used as podcasters.  When you posted a feed, you would ping all these different places and let them know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sensing the tag things like that.  Yes, Gina, that you ping once to notify many.  Yes.  Because here you tag once to get analytics in many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. One tag on the site and then you can manage those in Google's web interface.  Yeah, I think that it is like that.  But I haven't signed up for it.  It seems like this is more like for marketing departments,  for companies with huge websites that are constantly adding different tags for various services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's the other interesting thing. I wonder about this.  I guess I don't understand tags at all.  Is each tag...  You're not allowed to.  ...putting on a cookie?  Did they do it again?  No.  Oh, in other words, does this unify the cookie too?  Because if each analytics, each tracker, let's say you're on Omniture and Google Analytics and one other, right?  If you're going to unify those three tags,  have you unified the cookies that each of those is placing on the users?  And thus, does Google really have a lot of information coming in?  Is there a privacy issue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a good question. I would think so.  I mean, it sounds like Tag Manager does associate the various tags from different third parties into one, right?  That's the value of the service.  So yeah, it sounds like Google would have a lot more information about your site that you're sending.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would be easier if we just use the word snippet, code snippet, because that's really what it is.  It's a snippet of code that Google is caching on your behalf.  Yeah, I mean, I understand that it's just a piece of HTML.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  The chat room, Mimics, who has a lot of good answers about these questions coming by,  says each tag is a cookie, but Google tags does not unify them.  Okay, I'm going to move on.  I'm confused. I give up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, I thought that I would get clarity out of this now.  I'm even more confused.  It's something to do with SEO.  No. It's about speed.  It's about speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's about speed, but Mimics might be right that maybe it doesn't unify them.  It does sound like you associate the tags, though, all in one place and say this is my site.  So I don't know.  Well, I'm against it.  Cookie tracking industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's my position.  Yeah, I'm against it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what it is, but I'm against it.  Google warns of new state-sponsored cyber attacks.  In fact, if you go to...  Many people, if they go to their inbox on Gmail or your Google homepage or your Chrome browser, you might see this warning.  Warning.  We believe state-sponsored attackers may be attempting to compromise your account or computer.  I had somebody call me on the radio show this weekend saying, what the hell is that?  The company said that since it started alerting users to malicious activity on their computers in June,  it's picked up thousands more instances of cyber attacks than it anticipated.  This must be related to the malware monitoring that they do.  And it turns out that they believe many of these are state-sponsored.  So tens of thousands of users starting Tuesday afternoon have been receiving this warning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How can I get a state sponsor?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that's a sign that you're important.  China's going after you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I think I really do think that they're mostly concerned about China.  They don't want to use the C word and also to a lesser extent Russia.  But they're talking about the Middle East.  That was a denial of service attack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it says that Iran, Qatar, and the UAE and Bahrain have used spyware to monitor citizens and activists overseas.  And then American banks were hit with cyber attacks by hackers claiming Middle Eastern ties last week.  So it's not just DDoSing.  Yeah.  It's hacking.  So if you I haven't seen this warning.  None of us have received this warning.  No.  No.  Your account could be at risk.  Something wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  I'm not important enough.  Huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anybody in the chat room receive receive receive this start pushing on Tuesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, then the next thing is for for hackers to spoof state sponsorship.  All you need is a dot cn address and you're good to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Privacy stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We'll have things advertised soon.  You know, cyber terrorism watch.  We'll keep your children safe and make sure they're never cyber terrorized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  From Matt cuts the word that the plus one does not affect your search rankings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And even some from fairly blunt, honest language about how it's not a very good signal.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He says there's he says in that cuts.  I love that.  I love that.  He was in a hangout power searching with Google Hangout on Air.  Number two.  He said, quote, in the short term, we're still going to have to study and see how good the signal is.  So right now there is not really a direct effect where if you have a lot of plus ones, you'll rank higher.  But there are things like we have an authorship proposal where you can use nice standards to mark up your web page and you'll actually see a picture.  That's we've been doing that.  I've done that certainly.  I don't know if that's XFN or what they're doing, but you see a picture of the author and it turns out if you see a picture of the author, sometimes you have a higher click through and people will say, oh, that looks like a trusted resource.  So there are ways you can participate.  They want somebody else's face.  I am an untrusted resource.  But if you Google Leo Laporte, there will be in the Google results some results that have a picture of me.  Those are the ones that I've said.  These are my pages.  Right.  Right.  So there it is.  It's fantastic.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually convinced all of my editors to implement it.  They're mostly thinking about it anyway on the sites because what was happening was because of the tie in with Google Plus and Google Plus profiles.  The post that I would do to promote my work on other sites was having a higher rank than the destination site.  And because of the author thing and my picture was there and then the actual article is further down with no picture.  And so now that they've implemented that, actually, Google results now puts the destination site on top with my picture.  And it's a beautiful thing.  And, you know, my stuff is easier to find.  But regarding this plus one thing, plus ones are are.  If you plus one something outside of Google Plus, it affects outside of Google Plus.  If you plus one it within Google Plus, of course, it adds it up and you can say, oh, wow, this thing got 100 plus ones.  That means it's better than twice as good as something you got 50.  But the best use of plus ones is actually to save content because everything you plus one is remembered on Google Plus.  And you go to your profile and look at all the things that you've plus one.  So if you want to save something for later, just plus one it and it'll be on the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But if you. So this is one of my gripes.  If I go to my plus ones in on Google Plus, I only see pages that I've plus one off of Google Plus.  I don't see all the Google Plus posts like inside plus that I've plus one.  Right. Right. Right.  Is there a way to get to those?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. And isn't that a strange thing?  What's up with that?  Yeah, it's and of course you have to be logged in when you're elsewhere to plus wanting things for it to remember that.  But yeah, I think they just don't know what to do with it.  I mean, you know, I think they'd like to have it be a search signal, but it would be so easily gamed and it would mess up search.  So I don't know. It's it's it's really a strange phenomenon that nobody quite fully understands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't find the pluses. Oh, there they are. Plus ones.  Yes. You can add that tab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I honestly rarely plus one anything not outside of Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just got plus Leo Laporte as my URL.  Oh, sweet.  One of the things you guys probably already have that, but I just noticed that I have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of the things that happens when you plus one something outside of Google Plus is it opens up a box for you to post it on Google Plus.  Yeah.  And I think that's off putting for people.  I think it kind of trains people that like you just want to click it, you know, and have it have it turn red and move on with your life.  But instead, it opens this thing and sort of like guilt you into like posting something.  And I think I think they'd be better off if they just had it be a more normal thing and work more like the Facebook like button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we've pre approved this URL for your profile.  And then if you agree to the terms of service, you can claim it or you can request a different one.  Maybe I could ask to be Gina Trapani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, no, you can't because I've got that already.  Oh, rats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can only have one custom URL once you claim it.  You can't change or transfer it.  Are you sure you want to be plus sex change operation?  No, I'm going to be Leo Laporte forever more.  Leo Laporte, Leo, not Leah or not Helen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure you guys have talked about this on previous shows, but it works with multiple versions.  So you can do Google dot me slash Leila Port.  And it works the same or Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Isn't it just Google dot com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can do Google dot com slash Leila Port.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google dot me slash plus Leila Port.  Not yet plus.  Yes, that's right.  Plus.  So that's what I'm using on my on my signature for email.  I use Google, Google me plus Mike Elgin.  When no one was looking, I changed everyone's lower third to Google dot com plus their thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, now you can change mine, too.  Well, I didn't do it to yours because I got a floor for until.  Did you just claim it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can refresh.  Let me stop or just do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's Leo Laporte.  Yeah, it'll it'll it'll maybe it hasn't propagated through Google sphere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's interesting is that Google actually puts the case so it like uppercases the G and T in my name.  URLs are case insensitive.  Like I just that rubs me the wrong way.  That rubs me the wrong way.  I have a hard enough time with the plus, which is actually a URL encoded space.  Like the fact that they've sort of repurposed the plots to be like a different namespace.  But they're also making adding uppercase.  Google, I'm doing it.  Google URLs are case insensitive.  Yeah.  I mean, it makes them more readable.  Fine.  Right.  That's fine.  I suppose it makes it better for humans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This damn humans ruining our algorithmic perfection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not very algorithmic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  Google has patented a smartwatch.  Somebody said that the Apple missed a bet by not keeping the nano.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I attempted to buy one before they go off sale so I can have a nano watch.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they'll don't know.  Then Peter Rojas, and I think he's smart of Gadget.com said, oh no, this is all planned.  Next year, they'll introduce the Apple wearable iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Peter is exactly right.  I think he nailed it.  And I think they're going to have a watch.  And I think everybody's going to have a watch.  Apparently Google is.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, that's a future.  That's the watch version of Project Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Because it has a camera and a clear flip up cover that can display augmented reality information.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's not going to be out by Christmas.  I can assure you.  And a tactile user interface.  That's a pretty far fetched, far off project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, Google, you shouldn't have made it so specific.  You should have just patented wearable watches and then you could own everybody.  Dom, from now on, non-specific patents, okay?  New pay for engagement ad form.  I guess this goes along with tag clouds or whatever the hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this is a little bit different.  This is a variation on pay per click.  It's pay for engagement.  You don't pay advertiser unless someone engages with the form.  Wow.  And it's a blow up thing that takes over the screen.  And if you do that, then the advertiser is happy and the advertiser pays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the user is pissed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So.  No, the user supposedly has had a choice and has chosen to engage with this.  So the user is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we're trying to find the close box.  We're not engaging with it.  We're trying to get rid of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's the opposite.  I think, Leo, I think it's just an ad on the page.  But it's a light boxed ad.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does clicking the close button count as interaction?  Yeah, I'm interacting with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll get to your interaction right here.  I'm trying to find an example.  Yeah.  With when creative.  Love this.  This is from the Google Inside AdWords blog.  When creativity and technology work hand in hand, brands can build amazing things online.  Woo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or schmucks have to write that stuff.  Oh, man.  I'm so depressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is really depressing.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's really depressing.  Oh, yeah.  The idea of brands building amazing things online is depressing.  So instead of seeing an ad on a page, you see a light boxed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, basically it's using the light boxing in Google+.  Right.  That's the same look.  Mm-hmm.  Looks like it.  True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  True.  And so just know folks at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When you click around in there, man, people are happy about that.  They're paying big bucks for that engagement.  AOL is now on YouTube?  Yep.  They've put up all their stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, don't forget AOL now is Huffington Post.  Huffington Post is now video.  Video, video, video.  So they want distribution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So is it one of the new YouTube channels or is it an AOL channel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's everything that AOL is.  It has multiple channels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twenty-two branded channels including HuffPost Live, TechCrunch, and Moviefone.  TechCrunch on YouTube.  So I guess they're making so much video now that they can post these.  It's funny because, you know, of course we've got a YouTube channel, but if you're a big  corporation you have to like announce it.  YouTube has a Turkish site.  Well, that's a big deal because...  They're giving the government control.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Turkey has insisted on a .tk site so that it could then tell Google what to take off.  Wow.  Because things that attack at a Turk and such aren't allowed.  And they also want taxation money, but Google says we pay taxes in every country we're in already.  Right.  And Turkey's in the news right now as we go on the air because they've shot back at Syria.  Oh, no.  Really.  So the bomb's going both ways there.  Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's likely that I will be in Turkey in about a month.  Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So will I.  Give us a report.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hopefully the showing isn't going to come back in the other direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what I mean.  I'm scheduling right now a trip to Azerbaijan and then Istanbul.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Our war correspondent, Jeff Jarvis, is on the scene.  Oh, Jesus.  As the bombs are falling.  Jeff, are you there?  Can you hear me?  Facebook wants the like button to be exempt from child privacy laws.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Facebook and Google and Apple and Twitter have all complained to the FTC about the copper regulations.  Facebook in particular has a problem with flake and restrictions on that because because they're saying it's a matter of free speech.  The child has free speech and a child child does not have free speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Child does not have free speech.  Well, it's a marionette about that.  Yeah.  The proposal that the Obama administration is considering to beef up child privacy laws could hamper America's ability to like tweet and share information across.  So what if you're under 13, you don't have a right to like tweet and share information on the Web, do you?  It's 13 year olds.  It's not 18 year olds.  It's 13 year olds.  We're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd like to see them illegalize the use of the word like for 13 year olds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The current rules require verifiable parental consent before collecting personal information from children younger than 13.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, man, I'm keeping Ed off of Facebook as long as I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So Facebook says and of course, the like collects information.  You have to have a Facebook account and be logged in.  But Facebook says you may not have an account if you're under 13.  So I'm confused.  Yeah, I am, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why are they?  You know, first of all, it's weird that this corporation is lecturing the U.S.  government on the First Amendment.  Yeah.  And secondly, they're basically claiming the right of free speech to people who are not authorized to use their service.  I disagree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that we absolutely should be lecturing the FTC and government in these cases on free speech, just as broadcast networks had to lecture the FCC on free speech regularly.  I think it's the case here.  And I also think that what these companies are doing is saying there's precedent here.  And I've talked about this a lot before.  But now there's quite a hubbub going on.  COPPA is seen as a success.  I see it as a failure.  I think children are the worst served sector of society online because we've extended stranger danger to the extent that children shouldn't be aligned at all.  So, I mean, God knows by the time Ed is 13, what's going to be available?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I don't think this is onerous to say that you cannot collect personal information from children younger than 13 does not seem onerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unless you have the parents.  But there also talk there has been talk about extending this to 18.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that I would agree is wrong.  But but do you not agree that requiring parental permission before collecting information?  The problem was that there were these Disney sites that were aimed at five year olds and six year olds and seven year olds that were getting email address phone numbers.  But here's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it's the definition of what PII was personally identified information.  And that's been broadened so much in this that it's anything.  So so when I was on a phone call with the FTC staff attorney on these regulation extensions, when I was part of a group called the Future of Privacy Forum, I think it's called.  Obviously, I'm not a very engaged member if I can't remember the name.  But anyway, and one of the people asked, well, if I had a geography game and I wanted to teach you something about distances and want to make it sensible to you and start with your hometown, could I do that?  No.  Your parents would have to could not through email would have to do it through signing a piece of paper and scanning it in or faxing it or having a video conference with the company to get permission for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but I don't think that breaks the functionality of the site if I can't get your hometown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'm just it's but it's an example of what's wrong as long as there's no other PII associated with it.  The problem is that just having that broad location was defined as PII.  Nothing else you could get.  Nothing else you could do with it.  It's gone overboard there.  And and and that's the problem is there's a presumption that everything associated with kids and online and any information whatsoever is bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Facebook's argument here, they use Khan Academy as an example.  So let's say there's a 12 year old wants to study math.  Khan Academy monetizes by, among other things, putting a like button on there.  OK, quote part of that.  This is Facebook's letter to the is it the FTC?  Yeah, the Federal Trade Commission.  They said, I don't know.  I've lost my place because I scrolled up.  Rolled up.  Part of the issue is.  The the the social functionality widely used by educational sites and apps is dependent on plugins like like like is a plugin in this case and could be threatened by the copper rule that renders plugin providers responsible for the actions and motives of third parties and vice versa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What they're saying is that Khan Academy would take down the like button just on general principles so that so that they don't get in trouble or Twitter would would find them.  Sorry, Facebook would find themselves liable for another site's misuse of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, why doesn't Facebook instead of doing this say we're going to enforce the rule that says you can't be a Facebook member if you're under 13?  That eliminates the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's switch to David Boyd's research on this, which found that in people 12 years old, a majority.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I understand Facebook doesn't enforce it.  They need to enforce it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, wait a second here.  76% of the pair of those sites from underage from children age 12.  That is to say underage on Facebook were created with the help of their parents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So so all Facebook would have to do is say.  By signing up your child for Facebook, you're agreeing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But no, no, no, no.  The parents are helping their children lie.  That's Dana's point.  It's because the FTC rules are so onerous.  If the parent does want you on Facebook for one reason, to be able to talk to grandma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're losing you again.  You're breaking up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, there's always a problem with this kind of thing because kids kids don't vote and their parents do.  And the parents don't like the sound of certain things like, for example, that their kids are being, you know.  Those marginally identifiable information is being being tracked.  There's a larger problem on the on the wider Internet about marketing to children that is borderline predatory because they're using their marketing to kids who don't know what marketing is.  One example is that there's a McDonald's site that allows kids as young as four years old to register for things.  And when they register, they voluntarily give certain types of information.  There are, you know, all the junk food companies, Nesquik and Nestle and McDonald's and Pepsi.  They all have and most of us are not even aware of this.  Most of us who don't have kids of that age, they all have these children's sites that are full of games and downloadable stuff.  And they're just being the heck marketed out of them.  And this is a slightly different idea.  But but the larger problem that I think Congress and the FTC are having to deal with is the fact that there's a lot of like marketing attention at children.  Part of it is personally identifiable information.  But even if they can't personally identify them, they can gather information in an algorithmic way and present information in a way that is very compelling to children who just think that they're playing a game or something like that.  When, in fact, they're being taught to drink Pepsi or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Facebook's point is that it's really technologically unfeasible.  It can't be effectively done.  So what they're saying is they want the Commission to not adopt these new standards and consistent with the existing statute, hold general audience plugin providers, i.e.  Facebook libel under COPPA only when they have actual knowledge that they are collecting personal information from a child under certain conditions.  Right. That's the key.  Because they can't otherwise know.  And it would be too onerous to ask them to figure that out.  I think that's not unfair.  Yeah, I think it's more of a technological.  Yeah, it's a technological limitation.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we should make them I think the government should make them a deal and say that, OK, we'll say that like is free speech.  But so is a mother who posts a picture of herself breastfeeding her baby.  No, no, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not allowed.  Not allowed, Gina.  Not allowed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just flashing on these conversations with Gina in 13 years with Anna, trying to say, well, dear, no, you really shouldn't do that.  Well, did you do that, mom?  It's the equivalent of, yeah, you spoke pot, dad.  Yeah.  How old were you when you got your Facebook account, mom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So let me ask you, Gina, have you thought about this at all?  Have you talked with your partner about this?  What age are you going to let Edda get on Facebook?  Yeah, that's 25.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I'm really hoping to hold out until she's 13 or 14, kind of of age, teenager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I let my kids, it wasn't Facebook, it was MySpace, but I let my kids have MySpace pages when they were underage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, my brother signed my nephews up for Xbox and lied about their age.  Like, that's, you know, that's basically what everybody does.  I'm, you know, I don't know, I'm going to try to hold her off as much as possible right now.  I'm just trying to get the feeding schedule.  Yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just get them to sleep and the rest follows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I need a few.  I have a few years to think about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We want to push you to start now, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Start thinking now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, when she's 34, we're going to take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When we come back, tips, tools and numbers, but first a word from stamps.com.  Why go to the post office when the post office will come to you?  I ask you at stamps.com.

Transcript:  Because they're doing a desktop client for Twitter eventually.  It's in beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  They just, it's called Netbot.  So you go to Tapbots.com, slash software, slash Netbot.  This is an App.net client that's got that whole Tweetbot kind of style and feel.  It cross-posts to Twitter.  Cross-post to Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're kidding.  Oh, I'm getting this right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  It's, it's for IOS only, unfortunately.  And you know, there are tons of App.net clients and Dalton Caldwell service and it's open  source and, and it's got open, open API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's lowered the price on that, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, and he has lowered the price.  It's $36 now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A year or you can do it.  It's five bucks a month, something like that.  I can't remember what it is, but yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But these folks just make really good iOS apps and they've a lot of experience building  a really awesome Twitter client for a long time.  So if this App.net client, if App.net, if you want to use App.net more, which I do,  and I just haven't taken the time to do it, now that you can cross-post to Twitter, this  looks pretty good.  So I'm downloading it now from the, from the, the app store.  It's $4.99.  Interestingly, it's $4.99, whereas Tweetbot is $2.99.  So it's, it's, so App.net in general is a little more expensive.  Huh.  And, but if you're into the kind of the open Twitter alternative, this, this is, this is  really good news for App.net, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am going to now start using this exclusively.  Forget it.  I know you, I'm the good, that's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm going to, I'm going to give it a try.  I'm going to start posting to, to both and see what's going on at App.net.  I think all this really App.net need was a really good client and this looks like it's  it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, there's dozens.  That's what's kind of interesting, including one or two iOS and Android clients.  But, but you get one from a developer like TapBots, which do the best iOS stuff of all.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's great.  Big news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you.  I'm downloading it right now.  String, password and there we go.  Do you have a tip or anything you'd like to share with us, Mr. Michael, Michael Elgin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  I have a general tip for Google Plus because there's a whole bunch of people.  There's this kind of growing subculture of people on Google Plus who are switching from  blogging to blogging on Google Plus and banning their blogs.  Just like you, just like you.  Just like me.  And, and, and Tim O'Reilly is into this as well.  He's a, he's a champion of it.  But it, there's a whole bunch of people who are on the fence.  They just can't bring themselves to move to a kind of generic looking site from their  customized site and all this kind of stuff.  So, so I give people the following advice if you want to do this.  First of all, do it as an experiment.  One month, tell your blog, I'm going to be over blogging on Google Plus.  Here's, here's the URL.  Come check it out for one month.  If it doesn't work out, I'll be back on this blog.  And then, so that way you can sort of like have an out if you don't like the way it happens.  Then when you're on there, don't make the mistake that almost everybody makes, which is that when you post in a link,  there's a little box to put in a link and it gives you the little thumbnail and the little blurb.  It looks like non-compelling.  I was going to say it looks like crap, but that's a little too strong.  It doesn't look like crap.  It just doesn't look.  We live in a visual social web now.  Everything is visual.  If you look at the What's Hot List on Google Plus.  Always a picture.  Look at Pinterest.  Look at the rise of Pinterest.  It's all about pictures.  You have to have compelling visuals with anything you want to be compelling.  So don't use the little box.  Don't use the thumbnails.  Do a full-size picture every single post.  Even if you're sharing things within reason, I mean, some things if you share it, the whole picture will show.  But make sure you have a nice visual.  Do the do real blogging on Google Plus.  Don't blog over there and then just do a link to that blog.  That's not you're never going to get traction that way.  And almost everybody who does blogging on Google Plus sees maybe a tenfold increase in traffic and engagement right away  within two or three weeks.  So I just recommend I can't say that it's a good idea for everybody.  A lot of people need better archiving.  They need curation and stuff like that.  But if you think you might want to try blogging on Google Plus, I just recommend people try it for a month.  Use big pictures.  Do real blogging.  Be active.  Engage.  And a lot of people reporting that it's pretty awesome when they do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Mike, as I said before, we got in the air when I visited with the Google Plus staff, they love you and emphasize that they have had no relationship with you.  They just you're just a super user and amazing user.  I also beat them up every time I have the opportunity to say in line links.  If you look at what Williams did at medium, it's an extremely simple user interface.  You mark a word.  You have five choices.  I just got it again.  Bold, I tell big, little or link.  And, you know, just a simple little thing like that in Google Plus would make it so much more appropriate to the net.  And it's ironic that Google that lives on links and learns from links does not enable links in Google Plus.  And so they've got to just get their act together and do that.  And I think they know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a long, long list of things that they really have to do to improve it as a blogging platform.  But, you know, Google Plus ultimately is supposed to be everything to everyone.  I mean, and so it's a long road to get to that point.  But but for now, it has a lot of flaws.  There are a lot of things missing, a lot of features we'd like to see.  But there's a hardcore user base of people who are super active, very intelligent, very engaged.  And so it's really a great place to build a community if you're a writer or if you have, you know,  any reason to build a community. It's a great place to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And use the special Mike Elgin formatting technique if you really want engagement.  Bold first line headline. New paragraph.  Picture summary. What do you put next?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What I typically do is I try to summarize what the information is.  I make the headline actually a sentence with punctuation.  Not just like that.  Because I ought to post to Twitter and I wanted to look on Twitter also.  And, you know, just write, write really clear language.  Use good style for for the web, which means a lot of a lot of parentheses, a lot, you know, very small paragraphs.  Don't don't don't be too wordy. Have a good picture.  And then just have a lot. Have a great conversation.  I mean, it's it's, you know, the post is just the beginning of it.  So you don't want to just have, you know, this post that's, you know, the final word.  You want to start a conversation, ask questions, crowdsource on every single post or nearly every post.  And and, you know, it's a great way to it's a great way to learn.  I've always believed that the best thing about blogging isn't what I teach.  It's what I learned from from people who engage in the post.  So Google Plus is is is the best place I've found to do that.  It's as Tim O'Reilly said, it's it's like Tumblr, but more social.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Wow. I have to think about this because I don't I you're like there's only you and a few other people there.  Well, you know, I have to admit, it's gotten a little quieter over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it has it hasn't.  What happened is that, you know, you have to keep circling people and you have to keep on circling people because you probably circled like a gazillion.  And they're gone. Some of those wandered off. Right.  But some new ones wandered in and you haven't circled those yet. So I'll send you my Ghostbusters kit.  I have a Ghostbusters kit on how to how to keep the engagement going, how to discover all the great people you have.  You can't be shy about using all the features.  You've got a block. You've got to un-circle.  You've got a circle. You've got a plus one, you know, and if you really use all the features like I have so many people that I'd like to circle that I can't.  I just there's too many people. There are too many great photographers times a hundred.  Right. I mean, they are and people think it's all photographers and tech and stuff like that.  I I dare you to I dare you to search for any topic, any topic at all, the most obscure topic, and you'll find a thriving community.  OK, I'm going to talk home beer brewing, raising rabbits.  I mean, you name it. There's lots of people talking about everything there.  You just have to use search. You have to you have to keep circling and un-circling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. Here's the key thing about Google Plus real quickly, too, is that is that, you know, supposedly, thanks to being on the list, I have one point eight million followers.  But but it's obvious. And the Google people grinned at me when I said this, that everything that I write is not presented.  All of them there. They have an algorithm in the middle that chooses to figure out how to give you relevance in your feed.  No doubt you are not publishing to everybody you think you're publishing to, which is actually OK.  So those who might be interested in me at Google does a good job with that algorithm, because after all, life is an algorithm.  Then they're delivering relevance to those people.  And that's why they come back in the conversation with me. And same for me. I get relevant stuff and not irrelevant crap.  And so that's how Google is very, very, very quietly.  They won't acknowledge it so much, but they are stage managing the conversation through a gigantic conversational algorithm, which is the untold story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think of Google Plus and you and you notice it. Can you tell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can tell that I'm not getting junk replies from from the people, from the people with strange names from other lands or made up names.  Yeah, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I've been tracking plus ones or apply rates over my Google Plus post through think up for a while now.  And every once in a while I get a post that just goes crazy nuts off the map and they must be promoting it.  You know, I must, you know, it must make it into a higher fee.  But yeah, there's definitely there's definitely an algorithm there where they're promoting stuff, showing more stuff.  I don't know if it's content based. I don't know if it's, you know, uptake right away.  But yeah, I think Jeff is absolutely right. And I'd actually love to know more about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They won't say a word. Good luck. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Facebook does that too, right? I mean, Facebook just announced seven bucks.  You can buy a higher position in the newsfeed. Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if that's a good idea. That's kind of a sign of desperation. Seven dollars.  All right. So lonely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Every time you're on mic, you convince me to try it again.  So I go back. Although now I'm using the app that on my tap bots on my iPhone and I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a strong case against app net as well. So I'm sure you do.  The beauty of the beauty of of advertisers supported social networking like Facebook and Google Plus and Twitter is that it's it's it's it's egalitarian and international.  So some there are people for whom the now the five dollar a month thing or whatever app net is charging is a huge amount of money.  And so you end up with a very elite group of people.  And maybe that's a desirable thing. But there's something thrilling to me about being able to talk to the entire world and the advertising and subsidizing it.  Yeah, Google Plus doesn't have advertising in Google Plus, but it is an advertising supported social networks.  Just the ads are somewhere else. Right.  But I really I hope that they open up app net and make it free eventually.  And I would really get behind it if that was the case.  Yeah, I mean, that's that's a really fair point, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I was earlier I called out that net open.  It's obviously it's not open source.  When I said open, it just meant I meant that it provides an open API without restriction.  And there are definitely problems with that.  And the cost being one of them.  But it's interesting to see alternatives and see kind of what takes out.  Yeah, yeah.  Your number, Mr. Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. I'm going to have a fun one about this stuff.  I had run down.  So I Mike Arrington blog this this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love it so much that a Kickstarter project for a book on how to fund Kickstarter projects, of course, failed and didn't get its thirty five thousand dollars to be done.  So I just enjoyed the irony.  And that's how to use Kickstarter.  Not that how we did it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't know anything about using Kickstarter.  We didn't mention it.  And I wish I didn't bring my phone in.  But I see somebody mentioned it in the rundown.  This new Google app, which I find very interesting, called what's it called?  Field trip.  I like it.  But now who wrote that they did it?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Field trip.  I like it.  But now who wrote that they took it out?  I did.  It was too chatty.  The idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, the problem was it wasn't giving me any specific was just saying, hey, we have lists.  Oh, no, no.  You got to come to Petaluma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it depends where you are.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You would think you know, I can't go up a block with that.  And I turned on it telling me because you can say, hey, if I see something, if I walk by something interesting, tell me I can't go a block with that thing.  Over there is where they filmed American Graffiti.  There's the house in Peggy Sue got married across the street.  The last performance of sublime.  It's constant.  Petaluma.  They must have somebody in Petaluma.  Yeah, I like it.  It's beautifully done.  Great idea.  It's free.  There's a story behind it, which I've forgotten about.  It's about its Genesis.  It's it's by it's from a Googler.  Yes.  And it's called Field Trip free for Android.  And the idea is it has a number of sources to tell you about points of interest as you wander your world.  And, you know, one of the one of the sources is a movie location book.  And apparently a lot of movies were filmed in Petaluma.  So that's kind of fun.  It's got architecture, historic places, offers and deals.  You can see why they did this.  Food, drinks and fun movie locations, outdoor art and obscure places of interest.  It has a setting.  So it says you can say, have it announced it out loud as I walk by, which is quite I've had a number of conversations as I'm walking down the street with people.  And my phone starts talking and I say, wait a minute, wait a minute.  And it tells me something and said, OK, we move on.  I should get it anyway.  It's free. It's interesting.  It's different field trip.  And it's the future of all search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that what's going to happen in the future is that there will be constant harvesting of contextual information and there'll just be a screaming feed on the nearest computer of search results going by, even though you never asked a question, never did a search.  There's a company, there's a something that was launched at TechCrunch Disrupt called MindMeld.  It's an iPad app.  And basically what this does is it you do a video conference and the app listens to what everybody is talking about and provides results as you're going by.  You know, you have a conversation.  What was the name of that actress?  It just pops it up.  It'll just put that actress there even if you never even look at the screen.  And it just does it will constant in real time.  I think that's the future of I think that we're getting to the point where we're going to have search results always at our fingertips, whether we search or not.  And that's going to be a good thing.  It's going to be a terrible thing also because children will grow up not knowing how to ask questions because they'll always have answers.  Somebody will be talking to them.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know.  I kind of think it's interesting.  It's Eric Schmidt's pants example, basically.  So I don't know why it doesn't have New York.  It goes off all the time for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll get it to work.  But it goes off with just generic stuff.  So my wife said to kill me if I don't eat dinner soon.  But I just want one little trivia.  Thirty one and Twitter just sent me a link from the verge saying that YouTube is today announcing changes to the policies surrounding its copy ID copyright management protection system.  Well, we'll see what they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then I will cheer.  Maybe we did it all by ourselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Human beings will have final say, says the poll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, well, I hope that's right.  We'll see that that could really change our lives.  Thank you so much, Jeff, for being here.  Go have dinner.  Jeff Jarvis is at Buzz Machine dot com.
