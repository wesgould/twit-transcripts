Let me introduce our panel and then we'll introduce our very special  guest, Ant Pruitt is here from Hands On Photography. Hi, Ant. Hello, sir. Hi, you're in the Stacey  seat today. We'll put you over in Stacey's seat. She's got the day off. Jeff Jarvis is  also here. Should we do the whole rigamarole? Oh, because I'm in mourning Leo. Oh, wow.  You look like a very sad, a Sith Lord. What's the matter? Palpatine, the Chromebook Pixelbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah. Okay. We'll get to that. Yeah. That's just a rumor at this point. No, I think it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  gone. Jeff is the Leonard Tao professor for Journalistic Innovation at the Craig Newmark  Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York. A little late, a little  late, but that's okay. I'm New York. Now, Jeff. Now the important part. You, I want you to  introduce our very special guest. Matt Mullenweg is here. Matt Mullenweg is, you all know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the founder of Automatic, co-founder of WordPress, a genius at social media, savior of various  services including Tumblr and others. And what we'll talk about soon is Matt's vision  and model for how he built the way I think the internet should be built. But first, back

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  to you, Leo. Hey, Matt. Really nice to have you on. I used WordPress in the very earliest  days. Big fan. I think we've talked before on some of our shows, but it's really nice  to welcome you back, especially because you're such a big shot now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you so much for having me. You're very welcome. WordPress.com, WooCommerce, PocketCast

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  recently saved from the jaws of public radio. Simple Note, which has always been great.  These are all automatic holdings. Tumblr, which you saved from the evil dark lords  at Yahoo. Jetpack, which of course has been a long time, a wonderful plugin for WordPress  users as is Akismet, the anti-spam filter. I don't know Happy Tools, but this is on the  list. Newspack, great. Day One, another recent acquisition, a wonderful journaling program  I've used for years on iOS. Long Reads, I didn't know you owned that. And Gravatar,  wow. You're building a publish, I guess a publishing would be the common thing here,  yes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We really love internet infrastructure, so things that make other things go. One nice  thing about automatic, we're about 2,000 people now, which is more bigger than I would  have ever imagined. But 93 countries, I think, we've always been totally distributed from  the beginning because we came out of an open source project. And so you look at a room  of automaticians, you couldn't see more different hairstyles, dress, everything. Everyone's  very different, but really united with this idea of craft and of building the web for  the long term. So very, very different people who have come together to try to, as Stuart  Brand would say, be good ancestors on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess we are all ancestors, I never thought of that. Stuart Wood.  Stuart Wood. When did you start WordPress?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  2003. I was 19.  You were 19.  I'm on my 20th anniversary next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Mike, we should give Mike a little credit as well for starting it with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I commented on my blog and we just started working together and that turned into this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  thing.  Truly an amazing success. What percentage of the internet now runs on WordPress?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think about 42, although I will give the caveat now that that number is about to change  because speaking of things shutting down, like the big book, that number was based on  Alexa data.  Oh, good Lord.  W3Techs would use the top 10 million websites from Alexa and that was the index.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A plugin, right? The people would run on their browser, a search plugin they'd run on their  browser, and that way you could see all the sites they went to. It's still around, isn't  it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And now Amazon's finally shutting it down and the data will be gone. Alexa's now just  a voice assistant, no longer a web ranking kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Before there was Alexa, there was Alexa. Yeah, I installed WordPress in my SQL on my blog  hosting platform probably around 2005.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We used to teach all of our journalism students to install instances of WordPress.  Yeah.  I don't really need to now, but in the time it was a core skill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And WordPress.com then kind of took over as a managed hosting and I would bet at least  half WordPress sites are on WordPress.com now, yes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually under 1% are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What? So it's still a big open source project, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe a couple percent, but like, yeah, the vast majority of WordPresses in the world  are run on different web hosts around the world. You know, Bluehost, WP Engine, Cloud  Services, Digital Ocean, like you can run WordPress, you can run it on a Raspberry Pi.  You can run it pretty much anywhere.  Yeah.  And so pretty resilient.  That's really cool.  Well, we actually have a fun new proposal that I'm very excited about.  What's that?  That came out of, we just had a WordCamp United States last weekend in San Diego. And, you  know, I've been studying and admiring projects that are building for the long term.  And one that I mentioned on stage was SQLite, SQLite, which is this flat file database  that's super fast. And they're designing it to be portable and thinking about it in terms  of decades, like how will this data be accessible? And there's a pretty cool proposal  someone put up to actually have WordPress be able to run on SQLite.  Oh.  So that would be, we might get some core support for that.  I think that would be pretty neat for longevity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  WordCamp Pittsburgh is where we met iJustine for the first time.  Oh really? Cool.  Yeah, we're so impressed by her energy. This was, gosh, early 2000s. I don't remember when  this was, long time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a fun WordCamp in San Diego because we had to cap the attendance at like 650  because of the venue. And so it felt like one of the old ones.  Old fashioned. Yeah. That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So cool.  Jeff has said this a couple weeks ago. I think this was the impetus to get you on,  is that you did it right. Jeff, what did you mean by that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, Matt, here's the premise that I gave. I recalled when the partners at, or a few of them  at Polaris called me many years ago when I was in the car driving. And they said,  this guy, Matt, we like, and we like this WordPress thing, but he has a really weird model  where it's going to be open source and then a company on top of that, and we're just not sure  whether we should invest in that. And I'm proud that I said, God, yes, grab it.  And in the years since, at that time, the wisdom that I saw was in comparison to movable type,  which because it saw a conflict of interest in what it was doing that others who ran movable type  instances as businesses, movable type didn't want it, Sixpart didn't want them to compete too much.  So they throttled it. You, on the other hand, had a completely different model,  not to tell you what you will explain better than I can, but by having the open source base  and then building WordPress.com as the commercial end on top of that, you enabled this huge growth,  you enabled the contributions to that open source base, and you, in essence, almost created a foundation  for creation on the net. And so here's what I argued, is that if we look at, let's say, Twitter,  and since we had that show, Jack Dorsey has said most recently that his mistake was making Twitter a company,  and that he wishes the Twitter were a protocol, and I'm very excited about what I see maybe coming with Blue Sky,  which we talked about a lot, which strikes me as similar, that you end up with a distributed open source base  of speech in that case, and then people can build enterprises on top of that. You can, others, as you demonstrated,  others can too, and many can succeed, and the internet is not then in the control of a few corporations  for good and bad, in terms of outsiders trying to get them to control the internet in turn, governments and so on.  So it really struck me that you had long ago the model, maybe it was just the model of the internet,  but you had a model for how to build out the infrastructure of the net, and so I'm really eager to hear your reaction  to what's happened since, and what should come next. If you're building the next Twitter, if you're building the next something,  how do they follow your example?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's a big topic. We mentioned Stewart Brand earlier, another guy I look up to a lot is Kevin Kelly,  and he has a book called What Technology Wants, and I'm a big believer in this idea of adjacent possibilities,  so that the world wants something to exist, the progress of technological humanity, culture, the culture,  if I didn't, me and Mike didn't make WordPress, I feel like someone else would have made something like it with a different name,  because the world needed an open source operating system for this website layer, and I see that happening other places now.  So one of the projects I'm actually most excited about recently is Stable Diffusion. Are you all familiar with this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, are we excited about that? Yeah, this is the AI, and by the way, open source, so you can run it on your own software,  Art Generator, really fantastic. We've been playing with it.  The novel stuff being done, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so this idea that the work open AI is doing is I think something most ensuring in the world,  and gosh, I would not have predicted that you could type things in and get like just such incredible art, photographs, everything back from Dali,  I think is how you pronounce it, and then, but the world kind of wants an open source version of that too,  and just out of that field, this Stability AI company came and released Stable Diffusion,  and now there's a package you can run it on your Mac and like generate images in 20, 30 seconds.  It's pretty special to look at what's generated. In terms of the news, I saw that a generated image actually won an art contest recently in Colorado.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ben Thompson, as to tech restarted using, I think he's using mid journey to do some of the illustration.  We talked in our editorial conference yesterday, you'll be interested to know, Matt, about using Stable Diffusion for our thumbnails for the podcast.  And I've already said, you know, we got to get a cert, we got to set up a server in here so we can be running it.  So you can start with the photographic thumbnail that you're we're going to use and run it through Stable Diffusion and get some interesting variety on that.  It's amazing, though, that's like three or four weeks ago that they released that. And it's a Cambrian explosion of creativity because it's open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, Matt? I mean, that's what makes it possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and that's what, you know, and cool stuff happens in proprietary companies all the time.  I would say that the the way automatic and myself have done things is definitely a lot more complicated.  It's a lot more work to have a foundation and open source.  And, you know, you can get WordPress from Bluehost or you can get WordPress from us or like it's it's all like a it's not more complicated than if you just, you know, type in say Shopify and you go to Shopify.  You know, there's only one place to get it.  But I think that that user were Cambrian Expression.  I think that's a great analogy.  The evolution that can happen when people can really dig into the engine, see how it works, modify it, customize it and have complete freedom in how they choose to run it is really powerful.  And that's what I want to see more of in the world and certainly more of on the net.  And that's what myself and Mary Band of 2000 friends and colleagues are are working on creating more of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When you started building automatic, you know, I think about how I did twit, which is initially was scratching an itch.  You know, I was a radio broadcaster and radio didn't look like it much of a future.  I thought, you know, I bet we could do this less expensively on our own.  And then it just kind of seemed to fall in place, which I think is that feeling of the other the universe is ready for this.  But I didn't have a great strategic plan.  It was more like a random walk.  Did you think at the beginning what you wanted to do with automatic or was it more that random walk?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I'm honest, in the beginning, I was just hoping that we could figure out a way for myself and a few buddies to get paid for doing what we were doing for fun, which is writing code for WordPress.  Because you loved it.  And and and yeah, you know, far beyond any monetary needs.  Like this is fun for me.  It's what I want to do.  Right.  It's what I hope to spend the rest of my life doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's best if it starts that way instead of, oh, I'm going to make a million bucks.  How can I do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was more like, how can I make enough to keep doing it?  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  But then came the point where you did have to go to the jazz musician and jazz musicians in Houston,  particularly have a long history of having a day gig.  Maybe they teach or saw someone the other day.  He's a researcher at a university like they do things during the day and then at night they come together, make their music, practice their craft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, Matt, culture of people wanting to just start something to get the big buyout down the road.  Yeah, I don't like that.  I'm assuming that was for the exits.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Though if you'd like to buy Twitter, you can.  I thought that would happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think one of my friends was journalist Ohm Malik.  He was like, yeah, if you do this, Yahoo will probably buy you in a few years.  And I thought, well, that'd be great.  But then once it got going, I was like, wow.  I think we could actually build something.  Ohm's kicking himself.  I have a ton of money.  I would want to be doing exactly what we're doing.  So let's just let's keep it rolling and see what we can create as an independent company, which is what we've been doing for the past.  So automatic started in 2005, so 17 years now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you followed Blue Sky and Jack's vision for that?  Do you have any any any opinions about about that as a Twitter as a protocol direction vision for a federated kind of open Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't looked into the technology of it.  I will say that publishing is complicated.  I have you know this in journalism.  I actually have begun as I've aged to appreciate the malleability of our systems, why we have a court system, why we have laws, why we elect people like this whole process that we're trying to enshrine into code with things like blockchains.  Contracts and tokens when we make it too inflexible, it also fires the vision of how it was supposed to work when it started.  And I think one of the beautiful things about human systems like this experiment of American democracy still ongoing is the malleability.  Now, of course, sometimes you find the cracks in that, but also that it can evolve over time.  So I really appreciate the more human driven projects with a room for error.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Of course, you started automatic and created WordPress at the height of blogging popularity, but it's kind of gone through a winter since.  And yet you survived.  How did you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I'm never sure what the temperature is.  People always say blogging is at the height or dying.  It felt like we were pretty late actually because there were so there were dozens and dozens of blogging systems available.  Blogger had already been bought by Google.  By the time we started, Dave Weiner had been doing it for eight or nine years, you know, with scripting.com.  So you should get him on actually.  Oh, we love Dave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's probably listening right now.  He's awesome.  He's such a pioneer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And also I love about Dave and part of his inspiration to me was doing it in public.  Right. So share your thinking, share what you're learning, share your mistakes, share the code you learn, share the project you came across.  He has this incredible archive now going back.  I forget when he started is in the 90s, I think of his kind of daily thoughts and my blog.  I'm not blogging as much as I want to or used to, but it's really neat to be able to go into those archives and see, you know, what I come across.  It's the number one reason I think people should journal a blog.  And I know that that's part of why we bought day one is because journaling day one is basically local encrypted blogging for journaling.  Publishing does have an additional.  What do you call it?  Risk or something like people are more worried to publish than ever because you can have mobs, you can be attacked.  If you mess up, you can get in trouble.  But it is also where the most beauty comes from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's one way the blogging has changed.  The world has changed. You know, a lot of blogs no longer use comments because that's a that's a place you can get rolled.  I think the advent of Twitter, I'll speak for myself, but I think a lot of people stopped blogging.  It ruined me. Yeah, ruined us for blogs.  I could get rid of a thought.  140 character blogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter now has Twitter notes to write the long form.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you think.  And of course, and then and then I've went off and did medium.  And I mean, so there is I think long form.  I like long form, but I think it also looks maybe maybe we're just reading the temperature wrong, but it looks like people aren't willing to spend that much time reading anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do you think long form is a generational kind of thing?  Because everything is such a short attention span nowadays.  I still think long form has a place.  I mean, we still have mediums and stuff like that.  People still subscribe to New Yorker for some reason.  But right. But but I wonder if that's just a generational gap now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, yeah, part of why we we bought long reads and run a magazine called Atavist as well, which only publishes once per month.  Super long pieces, usually 15, 20,000 words or more.  Yeah. So, I mean, when the first came out, people were like, no one's going to create on this.  No one's going to spend time on this.  But it turns out, like, especially as the screens got better, we're always connected.  There's a lot of found time.  And so people do read.  I would say there's probably more reading happening now than ever before.  Video is enticing.  We're doing it now. Some people are watching this right now instead of reading.  So the live interaction short form videos, tick tock, obviously very compelling.  But there's something that sort of ignites your imagination when you read that isn't replicable in any other medium, at least that I've experienced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have not turned this into a plug, but I have a book coming out next year called The Gutenberg Parenthesis.  And so we share an idol in that name.  And at the end of it, I say that I was wrong to think that the book as a form should be updated.  Let the book be the book.  However, as I've thought about other forms of media, I think the other forms of media are largely evanescent, that magazines have their time and then many go away.  I just want to say there are thousands of magazines.  A lot of books are ephemeral as well.  I mean, let's face it.  Right. But as a form, I'm starting to wonder about the magazine as a form.  The newspaper as a form is just is not economically viable anymore to put it in print.  And so you mean exactly.  Yes, exactly.  So I think we tie ourselves too much with presumptions of old forms.  And I still love the book and I still have reading books and I have many around me.  And I think it will continue.  But I think that we go to other forms.  The magazine was started, you know, in the U.S.  They started taking off in 1850 with steam powered presses.  The newspaper, similarly, was steam powered presses.  We got to that mechanization and scale.  So I guess it's my long preamble to a question about people probably presume that in WordPress, people are making, to use old terms, articles or stories or things like that.  What are the exciting uses of the tool you've created that you see to go beyond what we knew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there's an interesting tension right now in the WordPress community because there is, and about actually half the signups we get to WordPress.com are bloggers.  So people blogging, you know, as that is traditionally understood.  And then the other half is people building websites on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The White House was on WordPress for a long time.  Whitehouse.gov.  Yeah, it is today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It still is.  Whitehouse.gov.  And we're actually running that infrastructure, you know, knock on wood.  Wow.  They switched over to our, we have this enterprise service called WPVIP, which is basically like bulletproof WordPress.  Like we can scale it, anything.  And that switched right before the Ukraine war started.  So all the criminal insights went down.  White House stayed up.  I was very happy.  To kind of your original question though, actually I lost it.  What was the question?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, just kind of what I'll do another one.  Let me add to your question.  Let me just try.  Let me just try for one second.  The essay and the novel and the newspaper were invented a century and a half after movable type.  And it was then people said, oh, wow, what can I do with this thing?  So I wonder since you watch the WordPress ecosystem, what you're seeing about creation with it that's exciting you or that you see glimmers of a future that goes beyond the analogs we know of magazines and newspapers and so on.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Question.  So what I'm trying to do actually, funnily enough with our new version of the editor is called Gutenberg.  Yes, I know.  Well, I use it every day.  Sharing the shared idol is actually really neat at the word camp.  I just went to some people brought me some gifts from the Gutenberg Museum, which was really neat.  I never visited there.  So I definitely go.  You must go.  You must go.  What I'm trying to do is right now social networks in particular are forcing people into very generic forms.  You know, you can't have really expressive layouts or be weird.  You know, they kind of make all the profiles look the same.  It's very much like a, I don't know, it feels like a Soviet housing block.  Sometimes people do interesting stuff inside the box, but I want to make it a lot easier for people to do outside the box layout design content creation and and build both sides of it.  So with Gutenberg, we have the editor that allows you to create like really rich widgets, embed maps, layouts, you know, put things left and right.  And actually, I just talked to DMs with Dave Weiner about this other day is I wanted a reader as well that supports these rich formats so that you can have you can follow things and actually read it as the creator intended.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The creator not being the man upstairs, but the person who created the blog.  But you also own Tumblr, which is interesting because Tumblr was created almost as an anti WordPress where it's it's more like the original blogs, Tumblr blogs, you know, and I don't know.  I can't remember.  Did David Karp create Tumblr before WordPress or did you did you create it after WordPress or WordPress after?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It started a little later, maybe 2007 2008.  Yeah, yeah.  Tumblr was our very best competitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, because it was so easy to create a blog.  It was different too.  Yeah.  And it was very quick hit as you can still is, which is interesting.  I'm really glad you acquired it because I think it was in not in good hands.  And I really think it's an important platform for somebody who doesn't want to spend.  I almost don't want to tell people about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like we're having so much fun on Tumblr right now.  It's actually quite quite fun to use.  It's my favorite social network by far.  And I really like Twitter.  It's it's a very generative space.  You know, it's all about art and artists.  Right.  And so you can just go there and kind of put on different identities.  It's almost like the Burning Man of social networks.  You can really kind of be free when you're on Tumblr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Matt, what do you think about the state of the net?  We just had legislation stopped for now in the Senate.  Protection is for newspapers.  We see the California regulations that are going to be very complicated.  We all read Mike Baskin here and he takes us through the complications.  There's a lot of moral panic about the state of the net.  What's your doctor?  What's your prescription for where it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess this also brings us back to ask about blue sky.  You know, running a social network and running Internet is really, really, really hard.  So remember, I refer to that.  You know, it's nice to have the human systems built in.  You know, one of the things we did put a ton of effort into Tumblr once we bought it was cleaning it up.  You know, there was a lot of hate speech on there.  There's a lot of kids, you know, talking about self harm or drugs or other things.  And like, you can't you need to garden the space.  You need to curate it to create a healthy space.  And the tension between that and the legality of freedom of speech and also like the popular understanding of freedom of speech is kind of a beautiful tension.  And I think that we're always going to have companies in there and organizations.  I don't think we'll ever have a technical solution to this because it's fundamentally a human problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, on that point, I know it's still controversial about Tumblr because some people want to do certain things that aren't legit there now.  But I do salute you because I think that, yes, we have to invest in those spaces.  And if we abandon them or leave it to others, then we know what's going to happen.  We can know that well.  What was the investment? What is the what was the investment at the beginning?  What's the ongoing investment just in terms of scale of effort to keep Tumblr sociable and usable and nice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So our big push right now is to get Tumblr to break even because it's burning 40 or 50 million dollars per year.  Yikes. And it's cost to run above what it makes.  And because of this kind of social we've been launching some subscriptions, some products where users can like blaze their posts to promote it.  Just different things to try to get to break even.  But it is growing. It is really popular, especially with youth in America.  And so I think there's a real potential there.  But, gosh, I have so much empathy for the Dorsey's and Zuckerberg's of the world.  Running a social network is darn hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, I can see why you almost don't want to tell people about Tumblr because if the masses invade, then that doubles, you know, quadruples.  Your exploit.  Yeah. Your problems with it. How do you make how do you make money?  Is there advertising or is it paid subscription?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So we have ads on Tumblr.  I would say, you know, advertising is the default social media business model.  So we have that as a base layer.  But what we're trying to do is create something new on top of it.  So we have an upgrade to turn off ads.  We have upgrades where users can promote their own things.  So you can pay 20 bucks and put a picture of your cat in front of 100,000 people.  You can.  There's upgrades to for fun stuff like to put these dancing crabs on your dashboard.  So we're trying to and we're selling like actual physical goods.  The most popular being shoelaces, actually, because there's a long standing Tumblr shoelaces.  You ask about the shoelaces and you say, oh, I stole them from the president or something.  And the shoelaces, we have not been able to keep them on the shelf.  So for a combination of like merchandise, retail, digital goods, physical goods, we are.  Yeah, really grinding to get Tumblr back into profitability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'm going to pay for it now.  Five bucks a month or 40 bucks a year.  I'm paying for it right now.  Yeah, I've always had a little chime in your office.  I've always I've had a real soft spot for Tumblr.  And the reason I brought it up is because it is kind of I also have a WordPress account.  I also have a blog.  I actually have a self-hosted static blog on Hugo.  I've gone through so many blogging platforms, but I never write anymore.  And I feel like Tumblr is kind of the antithesis of the long form.  It's like just it's fun. It's quick.  It's a lot more in a way like Reddit.  I want to see Tumblr succeed.  I'm so glad you guys bought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a treadmill than Instagram, too.  Right.  I've got to get more. I've got to be bigger.  No, this is my I love what I love about blog so much is that it's the ability to have my place and the ability to use that however you want.  Then rather than and I like social media, I love Twitter.  I I deal with Facebook.  But there's what I miss about blogging.  I teach students this every every year is it was that first moment when I had a blog post and somebody linked to me and I look back to them and I said, it's a conversation.  Yeah.  And somebody else used their space to talk with me and I use my space to talk with them.  And that changed my entire view of media, my entire view of journalism, my career, my life.  Everything was the link in the blog.  Well, that yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To that to that end, I mean, we used to have all of that.  Why do you feel about Web mentions, Web hooks, things like that?  Some of the newer stuff that people like Kevin Marks are doing.  Love it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Kevin Marks, Tontek, Chellick, Simon Willis and yeah, Eric Meyer.  These these sort of web builders are good folks to follow to see what could be around the corner.  Alex Russell, another good person to follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because that's what we want to get back to is this kind of community, right?  No matter what platform you're using.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, I have a big project for it.  Working on the rest of the year is to see what we can do to reinvigorate comments.  Oh, boy.  Making it really easy to log in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A lot of people have turned off comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what do you think that takes then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To do it well.  I think there's two things.  One, you need to have a really smooth flow for like logging in and commenting.  I love that WordPress has moderation by default so that it's a curated space.  And then on the other end, you need the feedback loop.  So notifications.  So knowing when notifying the blogger when someone comments, notifying the commenter when someone replies to their comment, you know, that you just have to close that whole interaction loop.  And I think it could be pretty exciting because if you look at what's happening on like Discord, Reddit, like so much on the web, people want to talk to each other.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mm hmm.  We're not really happy with Facebook.  There needs to be a better way than Facebook.  I guess what I'm saying.  You're being very diplomatic, Matt.  So I won't press that.  I actually like Facebook.  Yeah.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  There you go.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's one among us.  No, there's two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's two.  Facebook ads have gotten so good.  They are hyper-targeting me now.  It's like scary.  It's like the exact artists that I like.  They're promoting the art to me and like, you know, I can spend more.  And like, so it's actually like, it's kind of crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had to stop doing Instagram.  I'd spend money every night about four in the morning.  I'd look at Instagram and buy whatever the first thing was that I saw.  I was completely vulnerable to it.  You mentioned Tumblr being a social network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I never really saw it as a social network.  I just see it as a platform.  But everything you're describing sounds just like a social network.  Do you feel like Tumblr is in competition with the likes of Twitter or Facebook and  working to try to draw more people in?  Or do you just feel like, okay, we're still just a platform where people can create  content regardless of whatever is going on in the social media space?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's interesting because there's actually kind of orders of magnitude.  So like Facebook's three billion, Twitter's 300 million, Tumblr's like,  30 million.  So it's like one tenth the size of Twitter.  But with like one 80th or something, the number of employees is 200 people working on  Tumblr right now.  It's totally a social network.  And the thing is, it's a social network that you really have to work at for it to be good.  So that's what we're trying to fix because you just sign up for it.  You really have to curate who you're following and follow tags and kind of prune things.  It takes a little bit to learn how to use.  But then once you become a pro user, I think one of the stats we track is like how many  people log in six out of seven days.  Hundreds and hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions of folks are like really totally  into the service and superpower users of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why I think it's, what mentions and all of it are very important because the  Internet's like space.  It's big, really big.  And there's plenty of room for all of this.  But you don't want silos.  You'd like the, I like the Fediverse.  I like Macedon because you'd like some porosity in these things so that people who use Tumblr  can interact with people who use Facebook, can interact with people who use Twitter.  I feel like that's kind of, that's what people want, but it's not what corporations want.  How can we make it more what people want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think people are very quick to trade off freedom for convenience.  So I think the challenge to all of us who are trying to create this more open, federated,  democratic, free web is to make the user experience so compelling that people will choose it.  They don't have to care about the plumbing underneath being free or not free.  But if we can make the free version better, then I think we'll win.  And that was really the thing I realized very early on because I kind of started off being like,  oh, I'm just going to preach open source.  And once people understand open source, they will definitely choose WordPress.  Yeah, it'll be obvious. Yeah.  And then I very quickly learned, like, no, they don't really care.  Like they say, you don't want to drill, you want to hole in the wall.  They're just trying to solve some problem.  They're trying to have a presence on the web.  That's not even a problem.  They're probably trying to get more people in their restaurants or more like readers to their writing or something.  And so I was like, well, if we want the web to go more open, we just have to we're going to have to get really,  really good at making user experience.  So that's been our focus still is today.  You still open source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  100% Yeah.  Promoter. Yeah. Good.  Because I think really that is open source is really my last word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is the thing that will. That's the model.  It feels like, you know, we're stewarding this for the next generation.  Like, while I'm alive and able to type and my mind works, I'm going to try to build as much open source stuff as possible.  And that'll pass on to the next generation.  And that's I think what's accelerating humanity's progress.  God's work, sir. God's work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I completely agree. Yeah.  I'm curious what because you've always had interesting interests besides besides making as much open source as you can and running tons of companies and working on all this.  What are your interests outside of automatic these days?  What's what are you following?  I'm just curious personally what you what you'd like to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, we just had a really fun thing at Burning Man that I helped fund.  It's called the Sonic Sphere.  So there's this crazy guy.  I know he has actually founded a company called Memrise.  His name's Ed Cook.  And he was reading an old book and came across the concept of what's called a Kugel Auditorium.  K-U-G-E-L.  And the idea is that it's a 360 degree sphere of sound.  So the speakers all around you and, you know, the team actually built this at Burning Man.  So what you could do is you could climb up to it.  It was like maybe 15, 20 meters tall.  There'd be a net inside this kind of like buckyball looking structure.  Maybe.  Yeah, I kind of like that.  Yeah, there you go.  There's some early prototypes.  If you scroll down, maybe they'll have the Burning Man one.  These are all the different prototypes.  Oh, yeah, there it is.  Which one?  This one?  Oh, they don't have the photo yet.  The one on the right.  This is what they built.  They ended up building.  Oh, so you'd be suspended in this net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh my God, how awesome.  So you're in the middle of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's two individually adjustable speakers.  And so sound would literally move around you.  And they had all sorts of different sonic experiences.  So there was, they had one where you were like the Apollo 11 launch, the audio from that.  Cool.  Different music.  Some music that had been composed specifically for this.  It's essentially like an instrument, these 52 speakers.  Pretty amazing experience.  And also just to see the team that worked on that, really, it was their life for half the year to bring it together.  And then for this, for that, we can have a Burning Man was pretty special.  So that's really fun.  Just art.  You got to feed your soul as well.  I just went to the Rothko Chapel earlier.  If you're ever in Houston or passing through, highly, highly recommended.  It's a Mark Rothko, the color field painter.  One of his last works was this purpose built space.  17 Rothko paintings on the walls.  Open every single day of the year, nine to five, free admission.  You just walk in and it's kind of like a meditative space.  It's just these paintings around you, kind of like an octagon.  And there's some benches and cushions in the middle.  And nothing like it anywhere else in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's been a place in San Francisco, I always think of it as an old hippie place called the Audium, which is sort of a similar idea.  That's so good.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Audium, I think, still runs on tapes.  Wouldn't be surprised.  It's from the 50s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think they built it in 1967, but it's still there in San Francisco.  You can still go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I need to ask.  I don't want to hook up the Audium folks with the Sonic Seferus folks.  The musician who I would love to play this instrument is Jacob Collier.  I don't know if y'all follow him at all.  I think he's probably one of the greatest musicians alive right now.  Just otherworldly.  And he started as like a YouTube.  Yeah, he does it on YouTube.  Record every single track.  Check out his Don't You Worry About a Thing cover.  The Steven Wendler cover.  Yeah.  If he doesn't take us down, I'll play a little bit of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's one of these guys on YouTube who just overdubs, overdubs, overdubs, overdubs until you get this amazing chorus environment where it's all him.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we were talking about this some time ago.  Yeah, I loved it.  Wouldn't he be amazing on that sphere?  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He posts some videos that are, even if you're not a musician, just fascinating to watch.  He did a recording of Moon River.  It has literally hundreds of individual tracks.  And he walks through showing how he built it and like, you know, just screen sharing his kind of audio thing.  And it's just, it's fun to see a creator like someone in their element at the top of the game, one of the best in the world, sharing their passion.  And so actually showing how the sausage gets made is pretty incredible.  I think I watched like two hours of this, even though I'm never going to like do what he does.  I was just so fascinated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You give me a lot of hope, because Jeff and I are old hippies.  And this was what we had hoped the world would be like.  And in fact, even at the beginning of the Internet, this is what we hoped the Internet would bring us.  And sometimes I don't know about you, Jeff, but I get discouraged by, you know, the most obvious surface of the Internet.  But it's great.  Thank you, Matt, for reminding me that amongst all that, there are plenty of people like Jacob Collier who are using these media to do amazing things, maybe more than ever before.  But there's just so much of it now.  It's easy to be.  That's where all the hope is, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is.  I'm saying it again.  One hundred fifty years after Movable Type, after Gutenberg, to come up with a novel with Cervantes and the essay with Montaigne and the newspaper and the printed market for plays.  There's so much that can be done.  Clay Shirky says that the tools don't become interesting until they become boring.  People accept them.  They know what they are.  And then the question becomes not the tool, but what you do with it.  Well, and that's what I see exciting about everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And history and time have a way of separating the wheat from the chaff.  There probably was just as much chaff.  Oh, witchcraft.  A lot of crap out there.  But the stuff that survived is a Sistine Chapel.  And so, you know, we're in the midst of all of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Culture is what you remember.  Yeah.  And that's where it is.  Matt, I've got to ask you, since you art, one word reaction.  NFT.  What's your reaction?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's too political and diplomatic to say anything bad.  I'm trying.  Let me ask you this.  Are you making the Web3 version of WordPress?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We do have someone in Automatic who is working on, just focused on creating bridges between  WordPress and Web3 stuff and WooCommerce.  You know, we have this open source shop called WooCommerce that's doing quite, quite well.  I think 30 billion of transactions last year went through WooCommerce.  Wow. That's amazing.  You know, I think it's a distorted market.  So, you know, markets are free and open, but we forget how easy it is to distort them.  So if you look at basically the impact of one actor, which is like Saudi Arabia plus  SoftBank on technology over the past five years, valuations and everything like that,  it completely distorted this market.  So we have this myth of efficient markets in reality.  And I think the distortion in the crypto market is one you had such incredible riches created  for early adopters, you know, people with thousands of bitcoins or Ethereum.  And they, to, you know, essentially sustain their original lottery ticket,  will put money into every single thing that could be, that will invest into everything that's on the network.  And so that distorts the economics a little bit.  The other thing is that because you have this such rapid accumulation of wealth,  both in paper and in reality, there is this kind of this distortion where if you're creating something  in the crypto space, I think it's tough to know whether you truly have product market fit,  like you've created something that users really resonate with, or if people are, you know,  trying to get in early on the token, so it goes up.  And like whether you have like long-term investors or short-term investors,  essentially, people looking to make a quick buck or who are really actually using your product and service.  And I guess this goes all the way back to blue sky.  Like, what was that? What was that crypto Twitter thing?  They ranked everyone and you could buy and sell tokens for everyone you followed.  That was short-lived, wasn't it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I remember we talked about it and then it was gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's still there.  And they built a distributed Twitter.  That was kind of the cool thing about it.  Interesting.  But there's a... Yeah.  They... I think it shows... I don't know what that shows.  I think it shows that just because something like the tokens got super valuable or you get a huge run-up,  it doesn't necessarily mean that you have the long-term usage that is ultimately the lifeblood of any product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are you looking... What frontiers are next for you?  The next open source you want to build, the next things you want to play with, exploit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess I should also say that I'm super into all the crypto stuff as well.  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Technology.  Stipulated, Your Honor.  And particularly like zero-knowledge proofs, Zcash, Monero, the stuff that's happening with Ethereum.  I think it's some of the most interesting open source in the world that's happening right now.  And so I can't wait to see what it does.  I just... I don't think... Kind of like this whole metaverse stuff.  I feel like sometimes people try to create a trend where there isn't one.  And we should just actually look at what's being used.  What am I excited about?  I'm really excited about creating more canvas and paint brushes and colors for people to paint with.  Nice. Bravo.  That's really the calling of folks at Automatic is we make the tools.  And it's so rewarding to see what people do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you get to code anymore, Matt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A little bit, yeah.  Nice.  I can be dangerous every now and then.  It was actually one of my big regrets was prior to Burning Man, I was hoping to do some LED programming for the Sonic Sphere.  And I just wasn't able to get to it because there was so much work to take that week off.  I had to do a ton of work beforehand and we had a board meeting right after.  So I wasn't able to get to it.  But if I had a few months off, I think probably what I'd play with is LED programming, actually.  And you're probably not doing that in PHP, I'm thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's that?  Not doing that in PHP, I'm thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, there's a lot of...  There's actually some cool open source stuff there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What do you code in when you get a chance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I actually write a lot of weird stuff in PHP.  Like all of my email actually runs through a PHP script, kind of a WordPress plugin, actually.  It all gets piped to that, it classifies it based on whether I emailed the person, how they're set in a database and everything.  That's part of how my email system works.  I do some scripting.  I really love systems administration.  I love networking, Unify stuff.  Awesome.  Ubiquity is just so much fun to play with.  And they've got their access control now so you can have the NFC cards, the cameras, everything.  That stuff's really fun.  I actually have been planning to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a Ubiquity house I've been thinking about doing.  Yeah, a Ubiquity house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm kind of enjoying the realm of technology, moving from bits to atoms.  I like it.  I definitely appreciate being in the bit world where you can copy things instantly.  There's abundance and everything.  But I like as technology is starting to bleed into the real world, just improve it.  Just little things like can you walk in the room and the lights turn on?  Is it a pleasing color and tone?  What's it called?  Home Assistant is the open source home automation thing.  Pretty cool.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Matt Mallowick is at Photomat on Twitter.  I guess that's probably the best place to keep up with what's going on with you.  Tumblr, Tumblr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, what am I saying?  What's your Tumblr?  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's your Tumblr?  Is it Photomat?  Yeah, of course.  I do tweet a lot.  I've got to follow you.  I'm ma.tt on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's my blog.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Matt on Tumblr.  Thank you for following me.  Yeah, of course.  Now that I'm paying for Tumblr, I've got to follow somebody.  By the way, I said ATT was Verizon was the evil empire that acquired Tumblr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was Yahoo, which had merged with AOL.  And then Verizon bought Oaks, which was the Verizon, Yahoo AOL thing.  That became Verizon Media.  And I think they spun it back out again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's now like another company.  Yes.  Oh, it's ridiculous.  Matt, can I take you back to the beginning just for one second?  Because I'm always curious.  After I spoke with Polaris, they ended up investing in you.  What were the conversations like with those first investors when you needed the capital  and went for it and you were such a different way to do things?  How did that work to convince them this was a wise way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Man, it was a strong filter.  Most investors said no.  Also, remember, I was a little pipsqueak.  I was like 20 years old.  I couldn't even drink.  And I wanted to create a virtual currency.  I wanted to do all these sorts of things.  So I had very, very broad ambitions.  And yeah, that just filtered out a lot of people.  But the ones who ended up investing, I think, could understand the broader vision.  And one really nice thing we've been able to do as Automatic is now a longer tenured company  is we take our fiduciary responsibility shareholders very seriously.  So over the years, we've been able to essentially bring in new investors to buy out old investors.  So for whatever reason, for example, I don't think Polaris owns any automatic stock anymore.  Whatever their timeline or their...  When they invested in Automatic, I think the valuation was $3 or $4 million.  They put in like a 1.1 on a 3.3 was the rounds or Series A.  So at that point, when you go revenue and everything like that, they can have an amazing return.  And the new investors can come in and say, wow, you're going to grow at this compound annual growth rate for the past five years.  And looks like you're going to do it for the next five years.  Sign me up for that.  So there's just different classes of investors.  And it's all about finding the right partners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I wish you nothing but the best.  You've been such a boon to everybody who wants to publish or create on the Internet.  Your portfolio of companies shows that you've saved some of the best companies in the world from a fate worse than death.  You created the, I think, the best blogging platform ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're trying to make a Berkshire Hathaway of the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I like it.  Wow, nice.  We'll call you the Wizard of...  Where do you live?  Houston.  Mr. Houston.  All right. I like it.  Matt, thank you for spending some time with us.  Thank you so much.  Thank you for everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think anybody who's watching...  It's really great to see you all.  Yeah.  And don't be a stranger.  Have to come on any time.  OK.  I'll take you up on that.  Watch out.  Watch out.  I'm a big Pixelbook fan.  OK.  I thought my mom was Pixelbook.  I love Pixelbooks.  I'm so sad.  I'm so sad, Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I really appreciate your time.  Matt Mullenweg, photo Matt on Twitter.  Sorry, Tumblr.  Automatic.  And WordPress.com.  A legend and such a nice young man.  Such a clean cut nice young man.  Thank you, Matt.  I appreciate your time.  Thanks, Matt.  It's great to see you.  Thank you, Jeff, for suggesting that.  Oh, thank you for doing that.  That was just such a pleasure.  What a great guy.  An honor to be able to talk to Matt.  I just think the world of him.  Yeah.  I'm really grateful you did that.  Yeah.  Truly.  You know, I'm a big Pixelbook fan.  I'm a big Pixelbook fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's pretty nice.  He's so soft spoken.  So.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I didn't see much Jackassery in him at all.  No, very little.  No, not a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not a molecule.  Not hair.

Transcript:  All right.  Get your candle back.  We're going to do a little morning when we come back.  As I mentioned, Stacey, as we go.  Right.  Wow.  We'll bring him back.  You know, it'd be fun.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  I know you want to get David Weinberger on.  Yep.  You know, just some of the heroes of the early days of open source and the internet who are  still doing a whole lot of work.  The people who have been doing the work.  Yeah.  I know you want to get David Weinberger on.  Yep.  You know, just some of the some of the heroes of the early days of open source and the internet  who are still doing amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the funny thing is, Matt is a hero of the early days of the internet.  He's still young.  He's a kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, he started when he was 19.  Like Dave Carp.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Our show today brought to you by IRL, which is an original podcast from Mozilla.  You know what IRL stands for in real life.  But this is interesting because it's a show for people who build AI and people who develop  tech policy.  Bridget Todd does such a good job hosting it.  And there's a new season.  This season IRL looks at AI in real life.  Who can AI help?  Who can it harm?  We really are, as we were talking about, going through a Cambrian explosion with AI right  now.  This is the time to start thinking about what it means.  Season six of IRL features fascinating conversations with people who are working to build more  trustworthy AI.  For example, there's an episode about how the world is being mapped with AI.  The data that's missing from those maps tells as much of a story as the maps themselves.  You know, all about the people who are working to fill in those gaps and take control of  the data.  There's another episode about gig workers who use apps for their livelihood and how  they're pushing back against algorithms that control everything, how much they're paid.  They're looking for new ways to gain power over data to create better working conditions  for political junkies.  There's an episode about the role AI plays when it comes to the spread of misinformation  and hate speech around elections.  Obviously, that's a big concern right now.  That's a really interesting show about one of the most important topics in technology  today.  IRL, hosted by Bridget Todd.  It's from Mozilla.  And you can find it by just going to our show notes.  We'll put a link there or search for IRL in your podcast player.  Use Pocket Casts.  That's Matt's podcast player.  Great one too.  We thank IRL so much for their support of this week in Google.  IRL, who has power over AI?  Who?  I think about Instagram and I think about Flickr and all the places I want to post photos.  I want to hang with people.  There's just so many places.  We have our own social networks.  We have the Twit community and the Twit Mastodon.  But it all feels very fragmented.  I think that's one thing we would like to do a show about maybe is the open web.  Kevin, whenever he's on, talks a lot about that of course.  But I feel like there's a solution there somewhere.  Maybe it lies in open source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When I taught a course last term with Doug Rushkoff, who I think you're familiar with.  Douglas.  He told us.  Douglas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do not call him Doug.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Douglas for his mother's sake.  So Douglas Rushkoff.  We taught a course in redesigning the internet.  And one of the big lessons to me was that the students who are masters students, they're  a little bit older, but they all came alive in the internet when it was already corporate.  It was already past those early, heady, hopeful days that we had.  And what I love too is to try to recap.  There were mistakes made in the early net, the early web.  We were too optimistic.  We didn't build in guardrails.  We didn't think of the impact.  All that's true.  But there was also, I want to recapture what that notion of hope was.  And for Matt at the end to say, he just wants to make canvases and paint brushes for people.  And to have the faith in that creativity is exactly what we want to recapture.  And the same with Dave Weiner.  I love how much Matt respects Dave and stays in touch with Dave and takes advice from Dave  because Dave is always generous to give it and has a vision and has ideas and that's  wonderful.  But his vision for the early web, and then you go to like David Weinberger and philosophically,  he had a philosophical perspective on what it could be and what it shouldn't be that  he's had in his book since.  And I don't want to just go to the old farts, and I'll include that in the old fart list  right now, but I think there is something to learn from playing the tape back and asking  what we did right and wrong.  I put myself in a broadly, I didn't do anything, but the early days of the net, what hopes  were right, what hopes have been lost, what hopes can be recaptured.  I think that's so important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You might say, oh, Matt's just a wide-eyed optimist or maybe you're a wide-eyed optimist.  I don't know, I'm accused of that often.  But I think that if we don't do that, then we are stuck with the dystopia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll never get anything that's slightly less worse than what we have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, Jeff, light the candle, put on the hood, it's time to mourn.  Now I should point out that this is a rumor.  And consider the source, the most ugly website you've ever seen, The Verge.  Do you see The New Verge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, they just redesigned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hell is this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay.  We said that about the first version of it too, though.  Yeah, I guess.  This is one hell of a logo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The shtick is it's the incomplete internet, the incomplete logo.  So I kind of like that I did the internet.  Is that what they say?  They have a whole page.  I put it in the rundown.  You don't ever look at my part of the rundown anymore.  I haven't gotten there yet.  A line 67 is their design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh look, something went wrong.  This isn't your link.  I'm clicking the link on their site, Neelai Patel's article.  Welcome to The New Verge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's wrong with that script?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See if line...  Well it's a redesign, that's okay.  But I don't understand the thinking behind this at all.  And the other thing I wanted, and I pointed this out to Mary Jo Foley, if you go to ZDnet,  they did a redesign too where they're doing, see the slash?  When you go to read an article, it has the breadcrumbs via slashes.  Go to The Verge.  Notice the slash, the breadcrumbs.  It's a little weird.  But I think that they kind of cribbed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I like the ZDnet version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah I like, the ZDnet is a little bit anyway.  And then what's this thing?  Today's story stream, like they're doing a little Twitter thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some design company man.  Twitter widget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A lot of energy on a lot of nothing if you ask me.  But anyway, that's not what we're here for.  It is only a rumor that the Pixelbook is dead.  So don't mourn too hard yet, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My candle of hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google according to Alex Heath and David Pierce, who I must say are very well connected at  The Verge, has canceled the next version of the Pixelbook laptop and to add insult to  injury dissolved the team responsible for building it.  That's the thing that tells me that there's no going back.  The device was far along in development and expected to debut next year according to a  person familiar with the matter, but cut as part of recent cost cutting measures inside  of Google.  What was Google's revenue last quarter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not enough apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What could this have cost?  So it is possible because aren't they doing a tablet?  Didn't they say we're doing a tablet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, that's true.  And the whole foldable approach as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So maybe it's maybe that they just feel like that's and I presume a tablet would run.  Well maybe no, it's an Android tablet though.  Android, not Chrome OS.  Yeah, it's not Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Chrome OS is what I love.  I was wondering what if this was like a play Google did several years ago with the HTC  partnership.  They could go third party and say, hey, you handle all of this hardware and then just,  you know, we're going to give you some specs, but y'all handle it and take a little bit  of the stress off of us and then we'll provide the software and you just dump it into place  for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess one could be positive and say, well, but it's so mature.  The market is so mature now that we don't need to show the way anymore.  But there was still, when I was looking for the last machine, what did I end up getting?  The last Google Chromebook.  The Pixelbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pixelbook was always more expensive than anybody else's, but it was also higher end.  It was worth it usually.  I still have a couple of them.  I really like them.  But they're also by the way, out of date now, right?  You know, they're old.  You don't get updates.  They are old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You do know that.  People are willing to spend more on those other proprietary brands though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, there's plenty.  My Pixelbook is also in black today and morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are plenty of Chromebooks out there.  Acer, Asus, Lenovo, so HP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My friend Craig Newmark called me last week just thinking he needs to get new one and  ask me what I've done.  And I said, I love my Pixelbook Go.  It's a really nice machine, but it's two years out of date now.  And I got a CX-9 and hated it.  That was the Acer Net.  Oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I remember you getting that, not being thrilled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought I was dying to get it.  I couldn't get it.  I was dying to get it.  I kept my hands on it.  When I did, I just felt like it was the same as buying Google Glass.  I felt like a schmuck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.  That's the bad news.  Now all good news.  Blow out the candle.  Morning is over.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Moving on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Ministry Journal says they have learned that Twitter shareholders plan to approve  the $44 billion takeover by Elon Musk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Already passed you.  It already passed?  It passed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It passed.  The vote was scheduled for Tuesday, 1 p.m. Eastern.  And so the vote is in and it's passed.  Not that that makes any difference.  Overwhelmingly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I voted against it.  I took my few shares and I voted against it.  Not in my economic self-interest, but in the self-interest of democracy and freedom of  speech and a free world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And because you want to stick it to Elon.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I voted for four of the other things.  There were three things on the ballot.  One was paying the executives.  I said, okay, fine, pay him.  I forgot what the other one was, but then I voted against the merger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's pretty clear after all of the revelations in this, the court case will be October 17th  in the Delaware Court of Chancery.  It's pretty clear that Elon really only wanted to buy it for about five minutes and then  immediately got cold feet because almost within a week he asked his lawyer, can we  put this off because World War III is about to happen.  Yeah.  I want to buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not to mention he had to try to find the cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I wonder, I guess it could be that that's what soured him on it is realizing how much  in hawk he was going to be.  Anyway, it's pretty clear he's looking for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's, Leo, that you used the phrase the other day and I kept the last couple of shows  when there's an external event, material adverse event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you for the three is the material adverse event.  It's just hilarious.  This is the one thing that does get them off the hook.  Even though he stipulated he's going to buy Twitter as is if there is a material adverse  event, everybody quits or the company loses a trillion dollars or something that is really  significant that wasn't foreseen, then he can say reasonably, oh yeah, well now I don't  want to and he's out.  And I don't know, maybe he'd still have the billion dollar breakup fee.  He'd be willing to take that at this point, I'm sure.  But that's what he's looking for.  He's also saying that paying much the former security director, Peter Zatko, seven point  seven five million dollars in his termination contract is a material adverse effect.  He's saying World War Three is material adverse effect.  He's saying the bots are whatever he can find.  So we shall see.  We'll continue to follow the story as we get closer to court time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is the court?  Do you remember what it is?  October 17th.  Seventeenth.  What day of the week is that?  Should we, you know, do you want to watch it live?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Special.  We can do a breaking news, a special event.  It's a Monday.  But it's going to go on for a week.  I'm sure.  At least, you know, they're going to talk to everybody and so forth and so on.  Let's see.  Evan Spiegel, the CEO of Snap, when asked at the code conference about TikTok said  the secret to first of all, he admitted TikTok is eating snaps lunch.  I think everybody knows that.  Along with everybody else's.  Yeah.  Although if you follow Salt Hank on TikTok, it'll be a mighty tasty lunch.  He's on Inside Hollywood again.  I don't know if they'll let me play this or not.  They tweeted it.  It feels like they should allow me to.  I don't know.  I don't know what I can play anymore.  I guess I'll just err on the side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We haven't been taken down for TikTok videos.  Why should I say taken down?  We haven't been slapped on the wrist about TikTok.  This isn't a TikTok video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the Inside Hollywood Mario Lopez with my son on the right, Hank's French dip  versus Owen Hans.  Of course he did.  Yeah.  Owen beat my son last time.  So this is a rematch.  Henry is going to make a French dip that is.  Oh my God.  Broil it.  Would you eat that ant?  Please and thank you.  So I won't tell you who won, but do watch Access Hollywood for the exciting, thrilling,  gripping conclusion.  So TikTok is eating Snap's delicious lunch, but he says the reason is, and this is kind  of interesting, the Chinese government is pouring billions into TikTok.  You know, they can't lose because they are so well funded.  The strongest criticism of TikTok, this is from Forbes at Code, came from Matthias Döpfner,  who is as you know, who as you know is the CEO of Axel Springer, which is a big, they  the big German publisher, right?  And by the way, they're big in America.  They own Insider Politico and Protocol.  I didn't know that.  He says TikTok should be banned in every democracy.  I think it's silly.  We can't have a China with Facebook, Google, Amazon, so why should we allow them in our  free market economy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So then my least favorite media personality, Scott Galloway, who will do anything to get  attention, also said it should be banned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I still find him hilarious.  I'm sorry, Professor Galloway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's a little bit of a, how should we say it?  That's the word, attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He said, it feels like they're kicking the poop out of everybody at the Code conference.  By the way, billions and billions of dollars, that's what it takes to grow like TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But TikTok is to me right now, again, the most innovative platform because it gave people,  to use Matt's words, a new canvas and new paintbrushes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, why isn't the likes of Snap or Instagram getting more support the way TikTok is?  Government support?  Well, no, not government support, just financial support because we have investors out there  investing in all kinds of things that former WeWork guy put up.  Aren't those people smart enough to look at something like Instagram?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well they were early on in Snap.  I don't remember what Snap's raise was.  Snap's is awful right now.  Yeah, but as soon as Snap started tanking, I'm sure it became harder.  Where's the nearest door?  You know what I'm saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why not throw money at it to help bring them back up and dethrone the likes of TikTok?  Is this just a lost hope?  It's like, this is TikTok's game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If their strategy is just to copy other, innovation elsewhere, which is what Facebook has been  doing and what Snap's been doing, then I would say they're not a good investment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To answer your question, when Snap was beginning and big, by the way, it was seven years ago,  the TikTok of the world, right?  It was taking over.  Their Series D round of funding, $485 million.  Their Series E, $200 but up to $500 million.  Their Series F, $1.8 billion.  So Snap got started with billions and billions of dollars.  Exactly the same.  So it's a little funny of them to say, well, it's no fair.  Snap when they were hot was raising money like crazy.  The problem is that they're faltering because of competition.  You know, he's saying, I mean, it's not wrong.  He says, TikTok got this really great lead early on by aggressively expanding, spending  a huge amount of money to do that like somebody else.  So that people can train the algorithm and ultimately end up with a much more personalized  feed that's harder to get a new service.  That is true.  There's a barrier to entry just as there is with Google, just as there was with any Microsoft,  any massively successful company.  So TikTok has this algorithm that's going to be hard to compete with unless you have  the network effect.  Well, we'll compete with TikTok by focusing on connections with family and friends rather  than strangers.  But I think we've talked about this.  There was a flip in what social media did.  At first it was family and friends.  Now it's creators.  And I think that Evan's wrong when he thinks that somehow they're going to come back by  doing family and friends.  I think that's why they failed, frankly, is they didn't have creators.  They tried and they couldn't get creators to put stuff on Snap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I also think we'll go overboard on creators too.  Maybe then they'll be the next thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  As usual, what do you mean by that, Mr. Jarvis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just mean that now everything is creators.  Every dollar goes into creators.  Everything is creators.  Everything is content.  And we're losing the connections, I think, that people did value between them.  So I think what we always do is we always go overboard.  In media we do that.  In the technology we do that.  It's not just that the creator only pivots the same direction and marches together only  discover that there's too many people there.  In the early days of print.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mr. Jarvis, they have reach.  Is it not logical to go towards someone that has a bigger reach to help push your product?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not sure I understand what you're saying there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The creators have a reach.  They have more of a reach than DACOMCBS in some instances.  Well, you're right, Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've always said that.  That's why we're big on host red ads here at the Twitter network.  I completely agree with you.  I think when you see in an older Ed McMahon feeding Alpo to a dog on the Johnny Carson  show or Paul Harvey flogging Bose wave radios, that's very, very effective.  That's not a new phenomenon.  That's been since Arthur Godfrey.  That's always been that way.  Milton Berle was sponsored.  Who sponsored the Milton Berle show?  Buick?  Remember that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was like, Grandpa, I don't know.  Come on, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You remember the Milton Berle show.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's overrated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what I remember.  But the point being the creators have always driven ad sales.  But I don't think that necessarily means that social media will always be driven by creators.  I think that's Jeff's point.  Yeah, advertisers may like it.  But I don't know.  What would replace creators, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, well, I think collaboration is one.  I think that's where it's where it's where it's where it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I think we like stories.  I think that's what Facebook found out.  That's what everybody found out is.  Yeah, it's nice to see what Aunt Maude's up to.  But really, tell me a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there the key is if you get authentic stories, I think the one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Texaco, Texaco, then Buick.  Thank you, Swamp Rat.  OK, bro.  Texaco Star Theater.  Now, don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't ask him who Milton Berle was.  Please don't ask him anybody.  Uncle Minty.  Where are you?  I lost it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ah, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did it.  I knew I could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well done, sir.  We were talking about creators.  I was going to do Goopberg.  No, don't mention Goopberg.  We're talking about story and how people like story.  And so, you know, Facebook thought at first it would really be about your friends and family connection.  Remember, Mark always said, life's better when you connect.  And he's still saying it, by the way, with this new metaverse thing.  No, we want stories.  Remember, briefly, there was this thought that you would build your own movies or build your own books and choose your own adventure.  And then everybody realized nobody wants to do that.  I just want to sit back.  Tell me a story, daddy.  That's all it's been ever since Homer was telling people about the Trojan War around the campfire.  I trumped your Gutenberg and brought in Homer.  I just want to point out.  Because you're even older than I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm even older.  But I also told our journalism students yesterday, beware the power of the story.  When we in journalism take over somebody else's story, we think it's our story now.  We exploit it.  We extract it.  There's a power relationship there that I'd be careful of.  And I think that when companies also create a place where we're going to use your stories and make money on it,  it's going to come off being false because then people start making up stuff to have a hotter story or a hotter take or whatever.  And I think it's authenticity is what's going to matter.  And I think that's going to come in different forms and different ways.  That people feel they have their own space in their own way and that we believe them as themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think they're orthogonal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fancy word. Good. You got to use that fancy word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't ask me what it means.  Hold on. Let me look that one up.  That we like story because it's how we make sense of the world.  Really, the world is a horrific, chaotic place with no sense, rhyme or reason.  But we survive by making a story out of it.  And that's how we understand things as we tell a story about it.  The authenticity, I mean, story or not, the authenticity is, yes, we love that.  But I think that's not the same thing as why we tell stories.  Yeah, I guess it'd be better if the storytelling was done by somebody who's got authentic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, stories can be authentic and stories can also be propaganda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think you can lie in stories.  I think a lot of the stories we tell.  Oh, absolutely. That's what fiction is.  Yeah, in fact, the most compelling stories are lies, probably.  Just look at QAnon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wrote a post about two years ago and used this in the Gutenberg book.  There's a book called How History Gets Things Wrong,  The Science of Our Addiction to Stories.  And it's an academic book, but it argues that, I mean, the author says,  I like stories as much as the next person, but we make this presumption about how they turn out.  And I think in the media age, we presume that everything had a beginning and an end  and everything was neatly contained in the Gutenberg argument here.  And so the story is myth.  What's truer to real life is, I think, what we now think of as a stream.  Yeah, but I would submit we don't want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely. That's more accurate.  But we don't, I would submit we don't want that.  We want fairy tales. We want myth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Streams are working pretty well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you had a choice on a YouTube video with a beginning, middle and end  or one that was just slice of life, sometimes we'll watch a movie or TV show  Manchester by the Sea was an example, which I thought was a beautiful movie, but doesn't end.  It's a slice of, it's what we call a slice of life fiction, right?  It's just a piece of life without a beginning, middle and end.  Lisa said, that's it?  I said, well, yeah, it's just a slice of life.  It's just, there's no end.  She said, what happened?  No, no, it's just a slice.  She says, no, but what happened?  Right? We want a beginning, middle and end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We prefer it, but then again, a blog has to begin with a beginning.  I think it depends on who the person is or the subject of that slice of life.  Nystat, all he did was slice of life stuff and just totally blew up with it,  even more than his TV show did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was pure authenticity, wasn't it?  That was authenticity winning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's going down the streets of New York with a camera  and people looking at him like he's a damn fool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think it's as long lived though as a good story.  I think Shakespeare is going to last longer than Casey Nystat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, stories are passed down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Let's put this in granite.  I think Shakespeare is going to last longer than Casey Nystat.  Yeah, you'll report futurists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because authenticity only gets you so far.  Do you care if Shakespeare was an authentic guy?  Do you care?  Oh, that Shakespeare, he was a hell of a guy.  No, the stories survive.  In fact, Shakespeare disappeared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I care that Cervantes had an amazing life  and used that life in his fiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Most people read Don Coyote and have no idea what Cervantes' life was like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, only because you realize that it's good.  The reason it's good is because he used his life.  He had a good life.  Well, okay, whatever it is, whatever fuel you use to feed your storytelling,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that's nice.  That's why I say authenticity is orthogonal  because it's nice, but it's not the same axis as storytelling.  Storytelling lives on as a long-term compelling value.  And Casey Nystat, that's great.  He's very authentic.  You like him.  But no YouTube celebrity has...  I mean, where's PewDiePie now, right?  They don't last.  We move on, don't we?  Don't we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Again, it depends on the person.  Yeah.  Yeah, PewDiePie is sort of forgotten,  but Nystat is still doing his thing  and still at all of the film festivals  because of his name recognition and so forth.  He's not on YouTube though, right?  He doesn't do YouTube anymore.  He's still on YouTube.  He's still on YouTube.  I just watched his latest video.  Oh, did you?  Okay, I thought he kind of slowed down on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Why did you watch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, why are you watching that stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's an interesting creator  and I love the fact that he's someone that just...  Oh, Nystat, I thought you meant PewDiePie.  No, not PewDiePie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who did you just watch?  Oh, okay.  I like Casey too.  I saw this video,  which is him saying,  I miss being a YouTuber,  and I took that to mean...  He turned the camera like this.  He doesn't do YouTube that much anymore,  but I guess he does.  Yeah, he's still going.  I don't know.  Yeah, I mean, he got a million views on his last...  What happened to his whole big company

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and big studio and big all everything?  Is that still around?  No, it's still around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, Beam,  that was the last company I remember.  That was the little social network app  and then there was another like a creator academy thing  that he was working on in New York,  but I don't know much about it.  Trust me, I'm not down...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look, I'm not telling a story.  I live on personality, right?  I mean, and I'm nowhere near as successful as Nystat,  but I mean, I'm on that axis,  absolutely on the personality axis.  But I think ultimately the stuff that really lives  and lasts is storytelling,  and that's why...  I agree.  Well, I mean, you have to have a creator to tell a story,  but I think the most successful storytellers,  creators will be storytellers, I guess,  is what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I also think what...  Part of what I do in the book,  and I can't even give you a pre-order page yet to plug,  so wait till I get that, man.  I'm really going to be bad.  But I talk about conversation over content.  I think that media were in their early days  truly conversational,  and that ended when it became mass and scale.  And I think what the internet allows us to do  is recapture that.  And we're doing a rotten job of it.  We're out of practice for 500 years.  We don't know how to do it in society,  but I think there's value in what we're doing right now.  We're not really telling stories right now.  No, we're telling...  We're having conversations.  Conversing, yeah, and I think that has value.  Oh, yeah, I'm not saying that.  It's orthogonal to nothing.  I'm not saying it doesn't have value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, the problem with storytelling  is you become passive consumers.  You just sit back and listen to stories.  Yes, exactly.  Audios.  And I think we do crave, as human beings,  we crave that kind of communication.  So we definitely need that.  But I think it's a different scale.  Again, it's orthogonal.  It's like...  It doesn't mean that...  It's not important or that creators and authenticity...  They're separate...  They're right angles to one another.  You know, they're not...  It's not either or.  And I actually wonder where we go with conversation.  Because, I mean, look at Facebook.  Look at most social media sites.  They've become content sites, not...  Not communications sites.  But we still have Discord, right?  I really love our Discord.  I love the conversations we have in there.  So I don't know.  I mean, I think we need that as humans.  We need both.  It's both.  I mean, the Homer, to go back to you,  would come in town and recite the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, but then people would talk about it.  It would give them something to talk about.  Right.  And then they would go back to the...  They would go back to the...  Story, yes, but then people would talk about it.  It would give them something to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got it.  I got it.  Story's mass consumption.  Communication is at a small scale.  It's personal scale, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think so, yeah.  I think the mistake...  I think Siva Varayanathan would argue that the mistake  was thinking that connecting the whole world would work.  It's not what we wanted.  Well, it's not a question whether we wanted it or not.  We didn't have the norms and the structures  and the guardrails to understand how to do it well.  There was no definition of well.  Right.  But having said that,  I love my conversations with you guys.  I love the conversations I have on Twitter.  I love a lot of conversations I still have on Facebook.  But you're right, Leo.  You're either broadcasting or not.  When you were gone last week, by the way,  I'm eager to hear how the concert was,  and I'm glad you still have your hearing.  We talked about a consent decree that expired last month  that prevented studios from owning movie theaters.  That's gone now.  That's why we have so much streaming going on.  And this was explained in a thread we talked about last week.  As I thought about that more and more,  the fact that NBC is rumored to be giving up its 10 o'clock hour,  what I think we come to is an end of broadcast writ large.  And what we have now on social media is everybody's trying  to be a broadcaster, right?  Everybody's trying to broadcast everything they have to say  to a lot of people.  And because all we valued was scale.  All we valued was huge.  But if you go back before the steam-powered press,  sorry, guys, the average circulation of a daily newspaper  in America before the steam-powered press,  you want to guess how much?  It was a substack newsletter.  The average newspaper.  I think that's right.  And scale changed everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  In fact, that's kind of what we were talking about earlier  with Matt.  It's OK for Tumblr to be a tenth the size of Twitter,  which is a tenth the size of Facebook.  Yeah, which is great.  It's OK.  In fact, we need a lot of small spaces.  That's a better way to socialize.  That's what we really want.  I think that's one of the reasons Discord is so cool.  The Twit Discord is a small group.  I mean, it's 3,000, give or take,  but a relatively small group of people who know each other,  have a common interest, and we hang out together.  It's human scale.  But it doesn't scale well.  I couldn't make this a 300 million person Discord.  No one would want to be in it.  Twitter, in some ways, was at its best.  In some ways, was at its best  when it was in the early days, right?  Or was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It depends on who you ask.  If you're asking a person who's wanting to have community,  they would say, yes, it was way better back in the day.  Well, in a way, you make your own community

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  by how you create who you follow and stuff.  So you can't make a sub-community within the Twitter.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's, I guess, the stuff.  And now they have this whole, what is it, circles?  Yeah, I guess that's really the best thing about Twitter.  So they're trying to get back to that aspect of it now.  But again, if you ask a broadcaster,  they're going to tell you, oh, Twitter's great now.  It stunk in the beginning because nobody was there.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, that was what I was thinking about Tumblr is,  oh, yeah, fine, I guess I'll post stuff there,  but nobody will see it.  There is a certain critical mass.  I look at our Mastinon instance, Twitter Social,  which I really like, but it's just not big enough.  They don't have enough people in it  for conversations to really get started.  We're just right on the edge of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, because it's trying to mimic Twitter,  and it can't be Twitter, so it needs to be something else.  Yeah.  I think that's, same thing,  what I was writing last week about the TV stuff.  I looked back at VidCon and a picture I had from 2000,  I don't know what it was, in 17, 18,  and the ads from YouTube were all trying to create series  because YouTube wanted to be TV.  No, YouTube should be YouTube.  Right.  Marshall McLuhan says that every medium,  the content of every medium is the medium that came before,  and so they first try to be what was before  before they invent what they are.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ultimately, you have to find your voice.  Every medium has to find its unique style and voice,  and that's why you don't post the same thing on Facebook,  or you shouldn't post the same thing on Facebook,  you post on Instagram, you post on Twitter.  Right.  Different audiences.  It's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What Snap did so well with media companies

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  was they said you cannot repurpose,  you cannot just take your stuff,  you've got to be doing what's native to Snap,  which was smart while it lasted.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, well, we solved that problem.  Yeah, we solved that problem.  I don't know what we accomplished.  You know what this also made me think about though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The whole discussion we had several weeks ago  about Instagram and photographers,  and everything just sort of being more video-centric.  Right.  You've seen the rebirth, if you will, of Vero.  Have you gone into Vero?  V-E-R-O?  Yes, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is a, it says,  a social media platform and mobile app for photographers?  Yes, sir.  Ah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So we've seen the Vero rebirth.  I was looking at VSCO, V-S-C-O,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  which was the old school Vero.  Oh yeah, I did Vero for a week.  Yeah, right.  I remember Vero.  Yeah, I did it for a week.  Right.  But did you download Vero 2.0?  Oh no, what's new with 2.0?  I don't know.  Voice and video calls.  Okay, I rest my case.  Yeah, yeah.  Everybody does what everybody does.  Oh yeah, well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Everyone was saying that,  all right, I'm done with Instagram because it's not promoting my images, yada, yada, yada.  And well, actually, they were saying,  I'm not getting any engagement.  There's no community inside of Instagram anymore.  What they were really saying is it's not promoting my images.  So they're going over to the likes of Vero.  And I'm wondering if people are going to just sort of bail out on it again  because this isn't Vero's first run.  Yeah, look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is a pivot.  This is Vero trying to save itself by trying everything.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, there is no orthogonality.  You collect bookmarks.  Everybody is doing what everybody else is doing.  You do voice and video calls.  They're all trying to go in the same direction.  You do music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You post links to articles in there.  Yeah, you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Beyond Features, a culture to support creators.  You post your photos.  Okay, I could tell you right now, that's a failure.  Instantly.  Because what is it?  Is it a music playing app?  Is it a bookmark app?  Is it a photo app?  Is it a video app?  Whatever you want it to be, Leo.  We'll be everything you want it to be.  Just love us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a failure.  Don't you think that that's not going to go anywhere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because this is total desperation.  Yeah, yeah.  Total desperation.  Pick something.  I'm curious to see what's going to happen with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I still have my account in there and I'll post to it here and there.  But I don't use these platforms for the same reason that other photographers use it.  Did you ever use a VSCO?  Did you ever use VSCO?  I used to use, I would use the editing tool in it.  Well, this is why I like VSCO.  So it is a very clean photo site with very nice built-in editing tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I started posting there thinking this might be my Instagram replacement, but there's  no one there.  There's no one there.  So there's no one there.  So there's also that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you're one in community, you're still going to want some people there.  But if you're someone that's broadcasting like I tend to do, I definitely need someone  there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you're posting photos, well, I guess there's two reasons you could post photos.  One is Facebook style.  You want to show your family and friends.  The other is Ant Pruitt style, which is you want an audience.  You want to show people what you're doing.  Yep.  Yeah.  You want a home for it.  Yeah.  Whatever happened to 500 pixels?  Is that still around?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Still there, but I believe most of that crowd is turned towards Flickr because the community  aspect of 500 PS tend to get a little bit tarnished with all of these snobbery back  in the days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And now they have an NFT vault.  So, you know, they're on their way.  Yeah, it's sad.  I think Flickr's kind of history, don't you?  Well, Flickr is one of those that got ruined.  But then they got bought by the wonderful folks at Smug Mug.  I'm going to log into my Flickr.  I still use Flickr.  We use it for the tech guy.  We use it for our photo assignments.  Chris Markwart.  You know, we put photos up there.  We have a tech, we have actually a pretty big tech guy group.  I think there's, let me see that.  I think there's like 13,000 people in it.  Yeah, 13,926 members.  So, yeah, we're using it.  But I don't feel like, yeah, I don't feel like this is on the up swing either.  But I don't go there for community aspect, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm using it more so for an easy way to share photos and an easy way to back up stuff.  But if I want engagement and interaction, I'm going to Twitter and Instagram because  that's where my audiences are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I recently had a photo on the Explore page on Flickr, which at one time was the thing,  right?  You get a photo on the Explore page and you're going to get hundreds of thousands of views.  Gosh, I love that shot, man.  I know, it's a great shot.  Gosh, I love that one.  Yeah.  So yeah, I was very honored I got that on the Explore page.  Didn't really, nothing much happened.  123 faves.  So yeah, I think Flickr, I mean, that's an indicator Flickr is not exactly, yeah.  Taken off either.  I don't know.  You know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I saw a thread a while back about this whole photographers being pissed off and the thread  basically said, look, yeah, you want more engagement, but the problem is those other  platforms that you're going to because you're thinking you can get more engagement, they're  not promoting to people outside of the world of photography.  You know, I mean, I think that's the problem.  So when you go to Vero, you're pretty much you're looking at just other photographers  and those other photographers are not as engaging as the person that's just in there to look  at pretty pictures in general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's all gotten much more fragmented, but I, you know, I kind of agree with Matt.  That's OK.  Let a thousand flowers bloom.  Oh, absolutely.  And we'll have our own individual, you know, you just have to find your own individual  Go where your crowd is.  Go with your audiences.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, an amazing story.  Just in the New York Times, people are going crazy over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you know the Patagonia label?  This just went up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Patagonia is probably one of the best selling outdoors, outdoors clothing company.  They sell, you know, you've seen that it's all the same.  You've seen that.  It's all the startup guys were Patagonia puffy jackets and Patagonia fleeces.  Right.  If you go to Allen and Co, it's all Patagonia all the time.  Very successful company.  The founder, who's now 83, he was, you know, just some guy who really liked mountain climbing  who started in 1973, Yvonne Choynaur, has announced they're going to give the entire  company away effective immediately.  A hundred percent of Patagonia's earnings will not be reinvested, but will be distributed  to the Holdfast Collective, which will use them to help fight the environmental crisis.  One hundred percent of profits from now on, which is roughly a hundred million dollars  a year.  Paul Newman got mad.  Isn't that great?  Yeah, it is.  You know, if you're an outdoorsman, you're going to be able to get a hundred percent  of the profits.  If you're an outdoorsman, here he is in his youth just before he started Patagonia, ready  to climb some rock, clearly, you know, and you want to sell outdoor goods.  Maybe, yeah, maybe donate.  For a long time, they donated a portion of the proceeds, now donating one hundred percent  to ending the climate catastrophe.  They're down in Ventura, California.  Nice story.  This is from Outside Magazine.  Let's take a little break.  I kind of miss Stacey.  Nobody is slapping me around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You miss getting slapped around?  Oh, OK.  If you want to be slapped around, I can do this.  No problem.  All right.  I appreciate it.  Call Madame Matt and Madame Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Thank you to Mr. Jason Howell, who took over kind of last minute last week when I ran the hell out of here to go see Joan Jett, Poison, Motley Crue, and Def Leppard.  All bands.  You're getting young anymore, but you can try to be.  I had no idea.  I didn't know anything about these bands, but Lisa loves them.  And she danced nonstop for six hours.  Got 27,000 steps.  Wow.  Had that show.  Mostly just boing, boing, boing.  It was really fun.  It was really fun.  So thank you.  And I hope it went well without me.  How long did it go?  Six hours.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Four bands.  Started at about 4.30 in the afternoon and ended at about 11.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  That was a pooped puppy, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I just sat there and nodded off.  I just went, let me know when Leppard's...  I had fun.  I had fun.  What else should we talk about today?  I thought this was kind of interesting.  When Queen Elizabeth passed, traditionally, you know, London Bridge is down, the code word.  The plans call for the BBC, channels one, two, and four, to interrupt all programming,  briefly shift to a display of the network's famous logo,  and then broadcasting a unified message saying the Queen has passed quietly, and so forth, so on.  And then, you know, we actually saw it on TV.  They put a poster up on the palace gates and all that.  Not this year.  The death of the Queen preceded the BBC announcement by several minutes  thanks to the Twitter account of the royal family.  They were so anxious, they tweeted it, and then the BBC got to do its thing.  I don't know if it's a breach of protocol, but it just shows...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The BBC had already gone to a black banner on top.  No, no, according to Quartz, the news of the death broke first on social media

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  with a post from the Twitter account, and then two minutes...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, I know that, but part of this thing is the BBC has a red logo banner on top.  And before the death was announced, they switched to black, because the doctors were very concerned.  So everybody knew it was imminent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what that said, is it okay? Why is it a problem that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, no, it's a sign of the times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just a sign of the times.  It's not a problem, it's a sign of the times. You tweet it before you beep it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's so title.  They are orthogonal.  Orthogonal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They might be orthogonal.  Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's kind of interesting, isn't it?  I mean, this obviously was with the cooperation of the BBC and the royal family and everybody.  This probably was in the write-up in London Bridge where you haven't seen the secret plans,  but I just think it's fascinating that they decided, you know, the first announcement shouldn't be a placard on the gates of the palace,  shouldn't be on the...that was the old...that was the way they did it for hundreds of years, right?  Then along comes television, oh, we're going to do it on radio probably first.  Oh, we'll do it on radio first. Announce it to the country.  Now it's on Twitter.  Is that a credit to Her Royal Highness?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not sure of a proper way to address the Queen.  Okay, you're American. You don't need to worry about it.  But wasn't that a credit to her as she was a bit more on the technological advancements of things over time?  No, she didn't even have a smartphone.  No, but I mean, as far as being someone that leaned into the available tech, I want to say Mr. Ian Thompson wrote something up.  Oh, did he? Oh, did he? Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's, you know, they call it the firm, you know, the family business.  And I think the family business is more savvy. Absolutely.  Or younger.  Yeah.  You know, well, and also just kind of more cognizant of what's going on.  You know, I have to ask Ian.  You know, it's funny because there are a lot of people who are not royalists,  who are not, you know, saying, why are we making such a big deal about this?  But Ian is very much as long as I've known him, he's always kind of real soft spot for Queen Elizabeth.  So, yeah, I'll look at the article. I didn't see it.  I missed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, Leon, curious. How did the story next to the rundown end up in there?  What's the connection?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. I just put it there.  You know what? Here's the connection.  We talk a lot about supply chain, right?  OK.  And I didn't know this, but this has a lot to do with supply chain.  Before COVID, if you wanted to buy an entire container,  let's say you have 100,000 Cupid dolls you want to ship from Shanghai to San Francisco,  before, right before COVID, that would have cost you about $1,500.  Not bad.  Not bad.  Not bad.  You get those Cupid dolls in, that's one of the reasons Chinese goods are cheap, right?  But as soon as COVID hit, that price skyrocketed to $20,000 by August 2021.  So this is really a direct contributor to supply chain.  We talk a lot about, oh, they're not enough trucks.  There's, you know, you can't get enough container ships in the ports, et cetera, et cetera.  It's simply cost.  No, that's not inflation.  Going from $1,500 to $20,000.  $20,000 in a year?  What has the impact on?  Oh, yes, yes, yes.  Absolutely.  It's back down, by the way.  It's right now, it's about $6,000, but still nothing.  And what's going to happen any day now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Rail strike.  Yes.  Yes.  That'll be interesting.  I am old enough to remember, but you probably are too, Jeff.  Yeah.  When, who was it?  Said there shall be no, was it Johnson?  Was it Eisenhower?  Or maybe Eisenhower.  I don't know.  Who said the feds in?  The feds in.  Said no, no, no, no, railroad strike.  The nation runs on the railroads.  And Biden kind of hinted at that when he said, no, no, it's too important to allow a strike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Especially before the midterms.  Yeah.  I don't know.  But would we notice?  Honestly.  That's what I was thinking too.  Well, the supply chain would.  The trucks, trucks don't carry so much.  Right.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It could derail critical deliveries of chlorine to wastewater plants.  See, it's weird.  The things that are delivered by train.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  Maybe because it's a dangerous chemical.  You can't do that in truck.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Anyway, I thought that, no, that's why I put that in there.  Because I thought, well, that's really interesting.  It got to the point right towards the end of the COVID where Walmart was charting,  they were charting their own vessels just to get enough goods into their stores.  Well, speaking of inflation.  But then, oh, wait a minute, there's a sequel to this.  Because then as a result, they had too many goods in the stores.  So, I mean, it's just difficult to handle, I guess.  The party is over, says Jonathan Roach, container shipping analyst at London-based Bremer.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Meanwhile, Amazon, which I think has had a huge impact on wages in America,  thus inflation, but for good cause to get people's wages up higher  because they paid everybody $15 an hour.  They're now going to spend more on wages so they can hold on to staff  and deliver through the holidays.  Yeah.  And so that's going to have another impact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's fine and dandy, but you still can't be ridiculous with your employment practices.  Have they gotten out of trouble with all of the bathroom policies and stuff like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they're making changes there too, yep.  I forget what I saw.  I saw something about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Starbucks has an interesting angle on anti-unionization.  They offer benefits to employees who have not joined the union  like a new student loan repayment tool and a savings account program.  Don't join the union, we'll take care of you.  Join the union.  Some say it's illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Which state is that legal in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're doing it.  It must be legal everywhere.  I don't know.  I mean, you could just say, no, no, we figured the union guys,  they got their own representation.  So we're going to take care of the people who want any unions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I can't say too much terrible about Starbucks.  I don't go there to get coffee or anything,  but Hardhead works for them and they take care of them.  Yeah, because they don't want them to vote for a union, you bet.  He's been totally fine between going to college  and transferring up there without a hitch and coming back.  I'm not against that.  I think the threat of the union,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  if it makes an employer behave better, that's fine too, right?  Yeah, good.  Right?  Good.  Yeah.  Our son is in the grocery workers union.  Local lake, Golden State, baby.  Interesting.  Yeah.  He was a little surprised  because they ding him 60 bucks a month.  Oh, yeah.  That's the price you pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm in the professional services,  Congress, whatever it's called.  As a professor, are you in a union?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  I'm a SAG-AFTRA man myself.  Of course, that's right.  And I do pay, I pay at least that much in dues.  I have a couple hundred, what is it?  I don't remember, but it's like maybe 700 a year.  And boy, do I get a lot from that.  Google, oh, we got a Google story.  Not a good one for the goog.  But for that, we have to go back to the urge.  Why did you take parts of the letters out?  Paul Therod said they took exactly enough out  so that you can still read it, but no more, right?  No excess.  Very weird.  Google has lost its appeal over illegal Android bundling.  The fine, which was originally 4.3 billion euros,  was slightly reduced,  but the EU general court did largely confirm the ruling.  The ruling, the company imposed unlawful restrictions  on Android phone manufacturers  in order to promote its search engine on mobile devices.  This is big, 4.1 billion euros.  That's a lot of money.  That's no slap on the wrist.  Yep.  The ruling by the general court today  upheld the vast majority of the commission's original charges.  The court did find, this is from the urge,  that Google's revenue sharing schemes with manufacturers  did not constitute an abuse of Google's market power  so adjusted the fine by 5% to 4.1 billion euros.  I think it's the largest fine ever.  Google has to wait two months and ten days  before it can appeal once more,  so it can't appeal to the highest court.  There's one more appeal left, the court of justice.  In a statement, Google said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we're disappointed  that the court did not annul the decision in full.  Android has created more choice for everyone, not less.  Which is true, actually.  And supports thousands of successful businesses  in Europe and around the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I kind of think Google's getting the bad in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is like EU and Microsoft all over again.  And the difference is Android is open source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so the deal was if you want to sell  the Google version of Android, not AOSP,  you had to agree not to sell phones.  If you want your phones for your,  if you want official Google for your high-end phones,  you have to agree not to sell your low-end phones  with the open source AOSP.  Which makes some sense from a branding perspective for Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is, am I getting a good Android phone or a bad Android phone  from this company?  But you also have to install Google Search

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and Chrome alongside the Google Play Store.  Which also makes sense for consumers

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because I got a Google phone, where's Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean...  They just want to go after them, and they have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know where I stand on this.  I mean, it isn't like there's a whole bunch of other choices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right?  Mr. Jarvis, if...  Yes, sir?  If you walk up to someone on the street or what have you,  just the average person and ask them about their Android phone,  are they going to call it a Google phone  or are they just going to call it, oh, it's a Samsung?  Right?  Do they even get that this is...  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I never hear them say a Google phone.  I hear them say a Samsung phone or an Android phone.  I hear people say Android, but I don't hear Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I never hear Google throwing in the conversation.  It's always, oh, it's a droid.  I even hear that, it's a droid.  Or I hear them mention something about Samsung  as if they were in control of it.  So that's what I was like, I don't even know if that matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're going bonkers for Mr. Beast in New Jersey.  Everybody wants a Beast burger.  Mr. Beast, who is a YouTube phenom,  I think chiefly by giving away millions of dollars, right?  Here he is at the mall where the Mr. Beast burger joint...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At the actual store because Mr. Beast is a,  what do you call those?  The ghost kitchen.  Yeah, ghost kitchen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they're not...  So people waited in line for as much as 10 hours  to get a Mr. Beast smash burger.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Boy, that is YouTube celebrity.  Good grief.  That is mind boggling.  And not nearly as good, I think,  as a nice au jus French dip sandwich made by Salt Hank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm just saying.  Come on, make that happen, Salt Hank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Set up that store.  YouTube's teaming up with Shake Shack  for some new menu items.  This is from the YouTube series, The Hot Ones.  Isn't that the guys where they sit around  and interview people and make them eat hot sauce?  Yep.  They get some of the biggest names.  If I had known that the secret to getting great interviews  was to torture your subject,  I would have installed an electric chair in here  a long time ago.  Electric chair?  Yeah, just zap him a little bit.  Nope, that's not the answer I was looking for.  Make him jump, put Elon in there.  They get the biggest celebrities  to eat their hot, hot, hot wings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Anyway...  That show is still pretty good, sir.  Yeah, because people are laughing at these celebrities

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  because they're in pain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what TV was invented for,  was to laugh at people and not be seen doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And some of those folks, they let go.  Some of the celebrities let go  when they're watching TV.  Because they're eating really hot food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that it?  Here's Margot Robbie stripping down  so she can eat some hot sauce.  That's not bad for ratings.  We used to watch that pretty regularly here in the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just wish I'd thought of this sooner.  Well, you could still implement it.  If you had told me,  oh, yeah, you could interview celebrities  as long as you hurt them.  They love it.  I don't get it.  That sounds a little like iJustine.  Where did I go wrong?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Is that iJustine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, that's Margot Robbie.  That's a world famous movie star, Margot Robbie.  It was definitely in pain.  So what was it like?  I'm going to put in a little small...  Not a lethal electric chair.  Just a little make you jump electric chair.  Just a little zap.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just a little zap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, it's what Stacy wants to do to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe I should just do that.  Yeah.  I should just do that.  Anyway, now I'm just jealous  because now Shake Shack  has some hot ones for menu items  so you can hurt yourself.  Shake Shack hot ones.  Can you handle the heat?  I swear to God, if you just told me  that I had to hurt people,  I would have done something about it.  I could have done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Imagine what you could have done with Dvorak.  With torture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People would have loved that.  Yeah, exactly.  Love that.  You know, it's just impossible these days  to get into Fashion Week parties  because of TikTokers.  They're just crowding the whole place.  I hate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's an hilarious story  where they're going on about,  why is this so crowded?  It took me two hours to try to get in.  Isn't there a mistake being made?  I'm on the list.  But the truth is, what's really happening  and I thought Stacy was here  so we'd talk fashion,  that's why I put these in here,  was that Vogue is not the determiner of style anymore.  TikTok is.  The people are the determiners of style.  Which I think is way cool,  but boy, do the old people hate it.  Except Vogue then threw a whole event  to try to be cooler than cool  and make downtown, in the meat packing district in New York,  they're all trying to be TikTok cool now  because they've lost their cool to TikTok.  Isn't that amazing?  Got to embrace it.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I can't get too unhappy about it,  to be honest.  No, I can't either.  Hey, speaking of menus,  Chipotle gets a lot of people  Speaking of menus,  Chipotle, guess who added this story?  Chipotle has added a new dish inspired by  TikTok?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's the wrong link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you gave me the wrong link.  This is Shakshuka.  I guarantee you,  Chipotle is not selling Shakshuka.  Sorry about that.  Judge allows McFlurry machine repair  lawsuit to proceed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a Cory Doctorow cause.  Kitsch, K-Y-T-C-H,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  was a company that reverse engineered the McFlurry machine  so that they could be easier to maintain  and break down less.  The company that makes the McFlurry machine,  Taylor,  has been engaged in a long running legal dispute  about whether Taylor could prevent Kitsch devices.  It's not the whole machine,  it's just a device you put on the machine  to keep it from breaking,  could be used,  could be used.  You know, the conspiracy theory is  Taylor makes a lot of money on these repairs,  but if you've ever tried to get a McFlurry,  you know that the machines are broken a lot.  Before Kitsch came along,  Taylor had a repair monopoly on the McFlurry machine.  If you didn't clean it just right,  the machine had shut down,  and only a certified Taylor technician  could get it going again.  So Kitsch figured out,  had a created device that allows  McDonald's franchise owners  to do basic repairs on the machine  and get them running.  Taylor didn't like that,  saying, well, you could hurt yourself.  Ironically, it was Kitsch  that claimed Taylor stole Kitsch's trade secrets  because Taylor began selling a device  very similar.  Oh, that's interesting.  So the court granted a restraining order  against Taylor.  Then Kitsch went further,  filed a complaint,  a first amend complaint,  whatever that is.  Taylor filed a demur,  and then the fisticuffs began.  In a court document filed  a couple of weeks ago,  a judge allowed Kitsch's restraining order to proceed.  Kitsch alleged 10 different claims against Taylor,  including that it had falsely advertised his product  and engaged in unfair competition.  So the shoe's on the other foot now.  Kitsch has the upper hand.  The judge agreed with Kitsch on seven counts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is all good for the repair it movement.  Yeah.  Right to repair.  Right to repair, yeah.  A story I didn't put in the rundown,  or actually I just did,  which I didn't know.  John Deere is also at the center of all this  because they put out these tractors  and the farmers can't repair them  and can't do anything.  Same thing.  So 10% of their revenue by 2030  come from software fees.  Oh.  And the margin on those software fees  I want to ask for this 85% versus 25% for equipment sales.  So they're not going to be let loose  of locking down your tractor  or your softie machine.  I like your stories this week, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's from IonDesign at aiga.org.  We spoke with the last person standing  in the floppy disk business.  There is somebody still selling  floppy disks.  His name is Tom Persky.  He's the founder of floppydisk.com,  a US company that sells and recycles floppy disks.  They will also, by the way,  transfer your data off of a floppy disk  if you need that.  Because you have no means to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here he is with his little floppy disk factory.  Wild.  Well, he actually buys them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He buys them very sourcy  because they've stopped someone making them.  So it's a diminishing resource that he has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was in these.  Yeah, he says,  20 years ago I was actually  in the floppy disk duplication business.  Not in a million years did I think  I would ever sell blank floppy disks.  Duplicating disks in the 1980s  and early 1990s was as good as printing money.  It was unbelievably profitable.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Who knew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who knew?  Again, hot sauce to celebrities  or duplicating disks.  My paths were many,  but I failed in every case to follow them.  He was a tax lawyer in Washington, DC.  Left his practice with Price Waterhouse,  moved to California,  and started doing floppy disk duplication.  And there they are.  There's the duplication machines.  They're kind of ratty.  They're getting a little worse for the wearer.  They are getting a little ratty.  So AIGA asks him,  so where does this focus on floppy disks come from?  Why not work with another medium?  Well, anyway, it's a fascinating...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just like the last,  the story is about the last typewriter repairman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you know.  And there are probably places  with brand new floppy disks.  He says the most in demand  is the standard 1.44 megabyte  3.5 inch blank floppy.  I would say the most valuable  are currently the 720 kilobyte double density disks.  Of course, there are especially 8 inch disks  for which there is a very small demand  and of which we have only a small inventory.  They're absolutely irreplaceable.  The same could be said about quad density 5.25.  God, I threw out boxes of these things.  I could have sold them to the guy.  I wonder if the same thing,  like 78 records went through the same kind of long tail.  Long, long tail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just read a book from the 40s,  or from the 60s,  The View from the 40th Floor by Theodore White,  who became famous for having written later  The Making of the President in 1960.  This is a Rowana Clay  about the folding of Collier's magazine.  You would say Collier, but I'll say Collier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would say it.  Mullen would say Collier.  Yes, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So at the end,  a spoiler since you're never going to read it,  the magazine is full.  And the newsroom does black bunting  in the newsroom using typewriter ribbons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Those are inky though.  You get your ink on your hands.  Well, they're leaving the place.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can I mention one story here?  Yeah, I'm looking at your list.  You have a great list.  Oh, Amy, Amy, Amy.  So her bill,  which was a protectionist bill  for the middle part of the newspaper,  to give them money,  to force the platforms rather,  to give them money,  to force them to carry their content,  not allow them to leave news,  which is First Amendment nightmare.  It was headed for,  it was in hearings,  and then Ted Cruz,  and as usual, it's Republicans and conservatives  ganging up on the Internet companies.  Then Ted Cruz put in an amendment  that kind of made no sense,  but basically was,  if any of you were going to try to moderate our content  and take our content off,  then all the game's off,  and Klobuchar said,  well, that ruined the bill,  so then the bill stopped,  and then it's supposed to go to markup tomorrow,  but probably will not.  And so it's almost dead,  but it's not dead.  It's going to come back,  and it's terrible, terrible legislation,  and it aims to force the platforms  to enter into negotiations  and make offers.  They have to make at least two offers for content,  which they say we don't want,  and we don't need,  and we shouldn't pay for,  and they can't use their own value  that they bring to this equation  in terms of audience in those negotiations,  and they must carry the content,  which I think, again,  is a violation of the First Amendment like crazy.  And any business that has more than 1,500 employees is out,  so it's going to be a disaster.  It's going to be a disaster.  Any business that has more than 1,500 employees is out,  so it's not the New York Times,  but the fear is what's going to happen  is these hedge funds will just cut employees  down in every newspaper to below 1,500,  and there you go.  And unless you have 100,000 revenue,  you can't get in the deal,  so small local weekly newspapers and sites  can't get in it.  And so it's this horrible,  horrible piece of legislation  that's just her trying to punish the platforms  for the protectionist's sake of the newspaper lobbyists.  So I ding-dong, I dance on the grave for now,  but I'm afraid it's going to come back,  so I think it's worth mentioning.  It's just nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is.  Let's do the, Benito, if you would, the Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ah, some nice new additions to Google Photos,  some collage editing.  Look at these cute collages.  I really like them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Collage or collage?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Collier, collier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Collier, collage.  Am I saying it wrong?  Collage?  You say collage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I say collage.  But you're French.  But I'm also a Southerner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you might know better.  Let me just look it up in the dictionary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pronounce, just say pronounce collage.  Collage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Collage.  Collage.  You ready?  Collage.  Collage.  Oh, but wait a minute.  Alternate pronunciation, collage.  Oh, all right.  For alternate people.  So both are correct.  Collage.  I said both are correct.  Google is rolling out a collage editor.  This looks kind of cool.  They look more like cards, right?  These are updates to memories.  Advanced collage editor.  And you can also make more videos.  You can trim long ones to the most meaningful moments.  Still images will feature a subtle zoom in and out.  Kind of like a new, you know.  Ken Burns.  Ken Burns effect.  Yeah, look, see it's zooming in.  That's nice.  It really does make it, it still kind of come alive.  So zooming in and out, zooming in and out.  And they add the music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was it like to create a visual cliche that gets named after you?  Ken Burns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  So it'd be, you know, the Ken Burns effect, which we first saw in the Civil War, right?  And it really solved a problem because there's no video from the Civil War.  There's no movies.  So he had a lot of still pictures.  So he said, we'll pan and zoom on these.  So you zoom in, but you pan across them.  And so they come to life.  But then Apple said, oh, we're going to build, oh, that's neat.  We'll build that into iMovie.  And they called it the Ken Burns effect without asking him.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Didn't know that.  Very famously.  And he called.  They said, what the hell, Apple?  That's my name.  You can't just name something the Ken Burns effect.  So they negotiated.  I think you got a bunch of friends.  I think he got a bunch of free max or something, but eventually he was satisfied with it.  But yeah, I don't think he was that happy about it.  It's called pan and scan is the technical term for it.  So yeah, I don't think he was that happy that he became so associated with this.  That's so funny.  Cliche.  It's cliched now.  When he did Civil War, it was pretty cool.  And he also, I never liked that.  You've got David McCullough to not narrate it.  You know, Shelby Foot didn't.  I thought it was pretty good.  All right.  All right.  Let's see.  Here is cinematic memories are rolling out that transform multiple still photos into  an end to end.  Oh, we just saw this.  This is cinematic.  No, this is a different one.  Spotlight on Anna.  Wow.  They're even doing like perspective.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do they call that when the one thing stays still, the things otherwise move?  What's that called?  What's happening?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Call that rotoscoping.  No perspective.  It's a perspective shift.  Yeah.  But I don't know.  I'm sure Alex Lindsay would have a name.  I don't know what the technical name is for.  Yeah.  Chowram.  What do you call that?  The foreground moves at different speeds in the back.  Parallax.  It's kind of like parallax shift.  Parallax.  Yeah.  I remember that.  Yeah.  But that's hard.  I mean, they obviously doing it computationally because this is a still photo.  So that's, I don't know how they're doing that.  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm enjoying the little memories.  Oh, I love them.  And these little updates coming from Google.  I don't necessarily share them out or anything like that, but it's nice when I get the little  reminders.  Look at this from seven years ago and the stuff that I've totally forgotten about.  And it just takes you away from those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's funny because Apple, you know, as usual with Apple, oh, iOS 16, we're going to have  this great new thing that lets you share a photo album with other people and they can  add to it and you can add to it.  It's going to be so great.  We'll call it, I think, shared memories.  Something Google Photos has been doing for as long as I can remember.  And then now they announce, oh, you know, it's so hard to do.  We're going to put that off.  It won't be coming out with the new iOS 16.  We'll do that.  You'll get that later this year.  It's like, dude, Google's been doing this since 2015.  What are you smoking over there at Cupertino?  All right.  Let's see.  What else?  I'm back to Shakshuka somehow.  Why were we?  Oh, this is like he's using Robin's eggs to make Shakshuka or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this guy, to me, this is Salt Hank with a posh accent.  Oh, I see.  His name is Julius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, look at his little grill.  Oh, yeah.  No, it's quite posh.  It's quite, it's too precious.  No, I think Salt Hank with the fast edits, the fast cuts, the chop, the loud noise.  That's what the accent is very much like.  But the accent is very, very Oxbridge.  His received pronunciation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Couple of cloves of garlic.  Give them a smash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, he's just like Salt Hank.  And then just roughly chop.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's a young, good-looking gentleman cooking.  Exactly.  Which drives the ladies crazy because they don't have to cook anymore.  Google has jumped on the iOS 16 bandwagon with their own widgets for Gmail, Maps and  more.  iOS just got this feature on the lock screen.  So Google, being Google, not laughing like Samsung would do, not mocking them, has decided  to make some stuff.  That's nice.  I actually love these new lock screens.  You want to see what I'm doing now with the lock screen?  You have the shoulder, do you?  Let me find it.  Here it is.  So one of the things you can do with a lock screen is you can have every time you unlock  it, it gives you a new picture.  So I put an album of, you know, I said all the pictures I have of Lisa.  So every time I, you can't see it, but it's all right.  You can see it this way.  Every time it locks, I get a new picture of my wife, which I think is, you know, I think  that's really, and it's random.  It's just for my photo album.  So that's kind of cool.  You could put pets in there or you could put pets and your wife or you could.  It's the purple flashing thing.  That's the sensor.  Wow.  The cameras pick that up, don't they?  I don't see it in real life.  Wow.  No, you won't see it, but the cameras do.  That's the depth sensor.  Oh really?  Oh, that's fascinating.  Where's your face, Leo?  Where's your face?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you put your phone up to your camera, Mr. Jarvis, you'll see it too.  Wow, that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.  Yeah.  And see, every picture is different.  So that's nice.  Even it's pretty cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It says, Android have a depth sensor.  Yeah.  Light art.  Whatever they call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Get more done.  Yeah, they have a black screen though, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dark mode.  No, I don't like that ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Show us that screen again.  That's interesting.  So you have a hole punch on there.  Is it like a dynamic island?  Does it grow and shrink?  Does it do anything?  It just sits there like a hole.  Just like a hole.  Okay.  Get more done.  Fun.  With new Android features.  What's this?  Where can I shock Leo?  All right.  It just sits there like a hole.  Okay.  Interesting choice.  Nearby share.  We've been promised this forever.  I think it's using Bluetooth LE.  I don't know.  But somehow, Apple would do it with the UWB chip.  It's similar.  But you can share somebody nearby.  Transfer.  Oh, I guess it's just AirDrop.  Google Workspace apps.  Upgraded Google Drive widgets.  New emojis.  There's a whole bunch of stuff.  Gboard lets you emojify your messages.  Type your message, then hit the emojify button.  And actual words are replaced by inscrutable pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does emojify a verb that you have used in the past?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Never before.  But notice how trippingly it flowed off my tongue.  Yes, you did.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Unlike collage.

Transcript:  Collage.  You can do the emoji kitchen lets you make mashed potatoes out of your emojis.  Actually, that was cool.  They took the hundred and the Canadian maple leaf, smushed them together to make a maple leaf.  Something.  A hundred.  Okay.  You can instantly co-watch YouTube videos and play classic games together with up to a hundred friends and family members at a time in Google Meet.  I think we mentioned this before, new features in Google Meet.  So Google, I think, you know, they did this right at the Apple event.  This might be a value to deaf people.  Design in partnership with deaf and hard of hearing community.  Sound notifications within live transcribing notifications can detect critical household sounds like fire alarms, running water, door knocks, and it will tell you on your phone or watch in text when they occur.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  With custom sound notifications on Android, you can train your device to recognize, detect, and label specific household sounds.  It's easy to miss an alert because you didn't hear it.  That's why Google Research partnered with deaf and hard of hearing communities to detect and label custom sounds.  You'll automatically receive alerts for comments in your home.  Like when the doorbell rings, if the baby starts crying, and if there's a siren on your street.  But you can also train your device to recognize specifics.  Just tap and hold to start recording, add a label, and edit anytime.  And you can even personalize how you want to be notified.  So you can see a flash when someone's knocking at the door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So see, it's okay if Google's always listening to you.  It's for your own good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's exactly what they're wanting you to say.  I'm sure it's all done.  Like in a situation where you could miss a sound.  So you can get a notification when you're wearing noise canceling headphones or even when your phone is in the other room.  So now you can access your alerts on time and on your own terms.  I think that's a nice feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they should...  No, not that I know of.  They should say, I'm going to assume it's done all on-device.  Because otherwise you would literally be sending everything going on all around you back to the Google servers.  And ain't nobody going to want to do that.  But that's a great idea.  Now if they can only give me a new name for Hey You Know Who, I would really be happy.  There's some new features for Wear OS.  That actually is a feature that you can use on the watch.  Google, as you know, October 6th is expected to announce their new Pixel Watch, which looks pretty sweet.  You can use a keep tile to dictate a note or checklist on the watch and send it to the phone.  Bitmoji is coming to Wear OS.  Oh, hallelujah.  Oh boy.  So, yeah.  It's as if Google had...  This is kind of like the Apple event, but in a blog post.  It's very cool.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  September 8th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Android 13, QPR 1 Beta 1 is out.  There's a whole list of new features.  Thank you.  9 to 5. Google, if you want to check it out.  Spatial audio, interesting for Google.  Honestly, it's a back and forth thing.  Apple steals from Google to Google steals from Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was thinking about this the other day.  Remember when they were suing the bejesus out of each other?  Yeah, that was stupid.  Or any little thing.  That's all gone now because they just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's cross-pollinization and everybody knows that's how flowers grow.  So it's good.  There's actually some interesting things going on, I think, with hearing aids on both platforms.  Next month, the FCC or FTC?  FDA.  FDA is scheduled to announce over-the-counter hearing aids.  You won't have to go to an audiologist to buy expensive hearing aids.  You'll be able to buy them over the counter.  I think both Apple and Google are watching with great interest.  Google has some hearing aid features in its new phone,  including the ability to amplify sounds coming into the microphone of the phone.  You can do that via your headphones.  Apple is expected to do that also with their new AirPods, too.  In fact, it's thought they may have some hearing aid features in the AirPods, too.  They didn't want to announce until next month because they are hearing aid style features.  What would a hearing aid feature be?  I use hearing aids sometimes.  One of the problems with normal hearing aids is they're not full fidelity.  They're designed to improve voices.  Of course, AirPods 2 is full fidelity.  One of the things you can already do with the AirPods is  if you have an audiologist test or take an audio test on your iPhone,  drag it into the profile on your AirPods  and that will now adjust the AirPods frequency response for your hearing.  You can also use the iPhone camera to map the inside of your ear  and send that to the AirPods, which aids in the creation of spatial sound.  There's some speculation.  There's a speaker now on the AirPods charger.  There's some speculation that it may be a microphone,  but they haven't announced it because that will be the kind of thing  you would put on a podium while Jeff is lecturing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or in my father's old folks' home.  You put it on the table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like a television coil so you can hear the TV  or you put it on the table during dinner.  So there are a lot of new features that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It just confuses my father. It doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, this is an interesting one.  The AirPods also can automatically improve speech  so they can change the curve to hear speech.  But they also announced this.  If you go buy something that's very loud like they showed a jackhammer or a siren,  the noise cancellation will adjust to cancel out those very loud noises  to protect your hearing.  So Apple and Apple are moving towards this idea  that their in-ear buds are going to be kind of hearing aids

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  without having the stigma of hearing.  that even if you're not hard of hearing,  we'll see people wearing them all the time even more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You bet. I think that's the intent.  They showed at the Apple event a woman in a subway  and it's tuning out the subway noise and getting out of the subway.  There's a jackhammer tuning that out, going into a cafe.  It is. The impression you get is, yeah.  Oh, and they also announced, I think,  I can't remember the length, but much longer battery life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hope it doesn't tune out the honking bus that's about to hit you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, let's hope not. I don't think it would.  Pixel 6A September update is coming out with  same old, same old fingerprint sensor improvements.  Geez, they still can't get it right.  Oh, Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That update we mentioned last week with the battery life,  it didn't do a thing.  It did not get any better, unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How fast is your fingerprint reader now?  It's fine.  Loyal listeners will know that Ant finally gave up on his Pixel 6 XL  and traded in it, and his new one is fine,  including the speed of the fingerprint reader.  Glad to hear that.  I never had trouble, and so I thought maybe that was specific to that.  Let's see the phone.  Google is also previewing Android's new emoji ahead of the December launch,  including an animated collection that looks like a ghostly happy face.  You want to see some of the new emoji on their way?  There's a hair pick.  There's a hand saying, talk to the hand.  There's maracas.  There's ginger root.  Peas, chocolate chip cookies, donkeys, fans.  We've talked, I think, about these before, but they're coming in December.  And dancing emotes.  Emotes?  Emotes they're calling these, not emojis.  So you emotify or you emojify?  The first, say hello to our first set of animations.  Scan the collection, download in your preferred file format,  and watch them dance like this little guy here,  the John Travolta emoji.  This looks very appellate to me.  Color font support.  Oh, look, you can really make your duck be very colorful.  Customized emotes.  No lime emoji, no problem.  Bring the green heart and the yellow lemon together,  and you'll get a green lime.  Make it a yellow rose with a yellow heart.  Feeling goth?  Put some black heart on your lipstick.  Go Cardinals, turn the Twitter bird from blue to red.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why not just give me those?  Instead of making me make them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because we want you in the kitchen.  That's where you belong, Ant.  And that's the Google changelog.  My, my, my.  Oh my, oh my.  This was fun.  What a great guy.  Thank you, Matt.  Let's finish up, though, with our picks of the week.  So we'll start with you, Ant Pruitt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right.  For mine, I just want to say thank you to Google  because I got an alert yesterday.  Oh, yes.  And I got to tell you, this Southern man, that was some weird stuff.  Was that your first quake?  That was my first earthquake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it was a very mild quake, I must say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what's funny.  I was like, that was nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's what it looked like on my phone.  We were in a restaurant and the whole restaurant came alive with a  beep, beep.  Earthquake detected. Drop, cover, hold on.  Protect yourself.  USGS shake alert.  And I didn't feel it, but Lisa felt it.  She said it was about a second or two.  So it wasn't before the earthquake.  It was a little bit earlier than the earthquake.  But we were right on the epicenter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It happened right...  My alert went off right as the house started shaking.  It was simultaneously.  I think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do we have the video from All About Android?  Because they were in studio when it happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, they were doing a show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They felt it though, right?  I think that...  I believe Jason said he did.  I think you could see it even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know where I could find that.  It's pretty crazy.  I think it was a bad one.  It's funny because at the time...  Oh, this is nothing.  It was 4.4, dude.  Queen Prue was rehearsing as usual.  And so I thought it was her just sort of coming down the hallway because we were both upstairs.  I thought it was just her walking down the hallway, stomping and dancing.  And it got louder.  And all of my gear in here started shaking.  And then she was like, uh-oh.  And I said, earthquake.  And the phone was screaming and whatnot.  It was just very, very weird.  I'm glad that Google at least put that alert out there.  I never thought I'd see it, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's the All About Android video right after your plug to subscribe to Hands On Photography.  Thank you.  Oh, wait a minute.  No, no, you gave me the...  Oh, is it on the bloopers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, you can hear it.  Oh, earthquake.  Uh, drop, cover, hold on, protect yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm getting the alert.  There's the sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Earthquake detected.  Drop, cover, hold on.  Protect yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do I drop, cover, hold on?  I don't know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What do I do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that was a little bit of a shake there.  I didn't feel it at all.  Did you?  How did you guys stay on the run?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm on a platform, sorry.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we couldn't see it.  You should have been a little bit...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I think so.  Oh, there it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's still going.  Look at the monitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we can kind of see it on the Zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it wasn't bad.  It really was very mild.  Wait till you get a real earthquake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You will then enjoy...  I was a bit beside myself.  It's like, wow, the world is moving and I'm sitting here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, wait till you get a real one.  Then it really is very much like that.  This earth should not move like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In all my time in San Francisco, I had only one and I was on a Muni bus at the time and there was no way to feel it.  Muni bus earthquakes more than the city.  Yeah, it's pretty...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The dogs freaked out.  They started barking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, did they?  The 89 quake, the really bad one where the bridge fell and we had fires in the Marina District and everything.  I was at Candlestick Park for the World Series game.  Oh, you were there?  Yeah, it was really scary because the light standards, I mean, they were moving 15, 20 feet like this, back and forth.  And the whole crowd, I mean, it's like freaking.  But the best part is the players ran out of the dugout, grabbed their kids from the stands and ran into the middle of the field and just stood there looking around while the rest of us are going, oh, what should we do?  So we sat there for a while.  It was a really good example of how rumors spread because some people had radios and TVs.  And by the time the story got to us, the bridge had fallen down, the city was sunk into the water, all just horrific stuff.  My friend, the guy I was with was a San Francisco native.  He said, let's go.  The lights were all out.  The street lights were out.  The traffic lights were out.  But he knew his way around town.  He was able to get me back to the radio station.  And we went in there.  But it was, yeah, when you get a real one, you will know.  And honestly, there's two ways to think about these.  This is the second small temblor in the area.  There was one in the Waldo grade a couple of days before.  It's either the fault letting pressure off, so that's good, or it's building up to the big one.  So let's go with A, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's go with A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the studio, we're not on a slab, are we?  Do you know?  I don't know what we're on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the problem if you're on a slab?  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We were on a slab at a restaurant, so I hardly felt it.  But if you're a wooden structure, you know, on wooden walls, yeah, you're going to definitely feel it more.  Especially if you're not on a bedrock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right, my neighbor was like, you're upstairs, so it definitely feels worse upstairs.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was like, okay, well, that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This building's on a slab, Burke says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Unless it was really bad.  Was I supposed to go and stand up under a doorway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No.  The old news, you are not supposed to get under a doorway.  Turns out those are worse.  Not better.  So don't go stand under a doorway.  Jason should have gotten under the desk.  Under the desk would be a good idea.  Just in case, you know, here probably under the desk would be a very good idea because of the lights.  Stuff falling off the ceiling.  If the building falls down, being under the desk isn't going to help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The first thing I did was look up.  Like what's going on?  I'm not going to move.  Then I went up to Queen Pruitt and she just sort of stood over there in the door because she was,  like I said, I thought she was just sort of goofing off at dancing in the hallway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And, oh, that's just Queen Pruitt rehearsing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right, that's what she does.  She's singing those daggum songs every other minute and it's just, you know, whatever.  But it got worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is what the advice was.  Drop onto your hands and knees before the earthquake knocks you down.  It protects you from falling.  This is from the CDC, but it allows you to still move if necessary.  Then cover your head and neck if you can under a sturdy table or desk.  Yep, okay.  But it says do not go into a doorway.  How many years was that the advice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was all my childhood for a guy out in the country in the South.  That's what we were told.  Yeah, for years that's what we were told.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that is, you know, the CDC changes things all the time.  Oh, moving target.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But thank you, Google, for that alert.  I thought that was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wasn't that interesting?  It's the first time I've ever seen an earthquake alert, but it works.  And because we were in a restaurant, a lot of people, I mean, you really knew.  Everybody's looking around.  Right.  An enduring image of California in an earthquake is a collapsed adobe home with a door frame as the only standing part.  From this came our belief that a doorway is the safest place to be in an earthquake.  True, if you live in an old, unreinforced adobe house.  In other words, if your house is made of clay, sure, get in the doorway.  Or some older wood frame houses.  In modern houses, doorways are no stronger than any other part of the house.  And the doorway does not protect you from the most likely source of injury, falling or flying off.  It's the objects.  So you're safer under a table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they were meant to go and see and say, isn't this pretty?  Let's leave with Christine and then leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So pretty. But you got tornadoes, dude.  Hurricanes.  And Donald Trump.  You've got Bedminster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got Donald Trump nearby, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What else? You got one more thing, Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I forgot about my other thing.  We sing his praises every Dadgum Wednesday as we start the show.  And this was a great article on PCMag featuring Mr. Craig Newmark.  And the title of it is just...  I love the title of it.  But if you read it, it's just a great read.  He's just being himself and genuine.  The person interviewing him.  There was even a point in there where they were like, you know what,  I don't even know if I can continue to take these answers seriously  because they're just so frank and straightforward.  But it was all candid.  It was a good read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And remember, he is studying stand-up comedy,  so maybe you shouldn't take him too seriously.  We've got to get him on again.  I enjoyed having him on. That was fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that'd be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I love talking to the pioneers, the guys who started the internet.  That's always my favorite thing.  Thank you, Ant.  Don't forget, Ant underscore Pruitt on Twitter, Instagram, and Vero.  What the hell? Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's right, and Vero.  And Vero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And don't forget, of course, he is the master of ceremonies in our club,  Twit Discord.  Did we decide on a book for Stacey's Book Club?  We did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The book is a long way to the small angry planet.  Oh, good.  And we just got the agenda, the schedule for our next meeting is October 27th,  9 a.m. Pacific for the book club.  But before that, the 22nd of September,  we're going to be chatting with some Club Twit members in a fireside chat.  Very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We talk about all the time about all kinds of topics,  not just the shows that are on now,  but anime and autos and beer and books and coding and comics  and current affairs.  And that's just the B's and the C's.  It goes on and on and on.  There's even a TikTok corner for you, Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't know that.  I've had that in there for weeks.  Yes.  And I put more in there than you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Get in there, Jeff.  I will.  but really the main reason we started it is  because people said we want ad-free versions of the show.  So for seven bucks a month,  you get ad-free versions of all of our shows.  You get the Discord, you get the Twit Plus feed,  and you're subsidizing shows that don't have enough support,  enough advertising support for us to do otherwise.  Things like Hands on Mac with Micah Sargent,  Hands on Windows with Paul Therot,  The Untitled Linux Show with Jonathan Bennett,  The Giz Fizz with Dick DiBartolo,  Stacey's Book Club.  This Week in Space started in the club.  So it really is a way, and it really helps us.  Lisa just told me 25% of our revenue now comes from the club.  Wow.  Especially as advertising starts to get a little slower during recession.  Thank you, people.  It really helps us.  You can also get shows individually for $2.99 a month  if you just want one show ad-free.  But all of that is at clubtwit.tv,  or just go to twit.tv slash clubtwit.  Either one will work.  Soon I'll propose the Gutenberg Club.  Yeah, sure.  It's basically a drinking club.  Everybody just take a shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what I'm saying.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We'll all be in there like that the whole time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you, Ann, for doing that.  Of course, Ann hosts Hands on Photography,  twit.tv slash hop every week.  What have you got for us, Mr. J?  I'll do this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  YouTube is bragging, for good reason,  that they paid $6 billion to the music industry  in the last 12 months.  Wow.  Up 50%.  $4 billion in 2021, now $6 billion.  We want our twin engines of ads and subscriptions  to be the number one contributor of revenue  to the industry by 2025.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, this is interesting because I would have thought,  oh, that's YouTube Music Royalties,  but it's mostly from creatives  who are using music in their videos.  They say, we also pioneered the monetization  of user-generated content.  30% of the payouts for artists, songwriters,  and write holders for the second year in a row  came from videos using real music  where there was a payout.  So that's interesting.  Maybe an unintended...  Remember, they tried to shut that down for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you explain how that works?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, go ahead.  Can you explain to me how that works?  I don't even know how that works.  If I were to do a video and get a song from,  I don't know, Mariah Carey,  and put it as the music bed,  I'm going to get a notice of copyright,  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,  and it goes away, they'll make me put another song in there.  That doesn't necessarily mean Mariah Carey got paid, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think.  Tell me if I'm wrong here, Leo.  Isn't it that you can keep it up there

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there's a couple of things happening.  just as TikTok has done,  and others with the record labels.  So there is music you can just use  and you won't risk a copyright strike.  But if you just use music,  there are three things that the label,  the copyright holder,  and the copyright holder can do.  One is take you down and give you a copyright strike.  That's what we always get for something.  Another would be to demonetize you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I've seen that notice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then the third one,  and apparently this is a popular one,  is oh fine, but we will get all the money  from your monetization as royalties.  That's what I meant.  The third one.  Which is okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not using it.  This is what the newspaper industry looks at  and says hey, where's our six billion?  Except that a headline is not a unique song by Mariah Carey.  It's just a piece of information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  I think if you use shorts, you can license.  I think there's a way, as a creator,  you can use licensed music,  which would be of course the better way to do it.  And then the money would go to?  Go to the creator.  The creator, the publisher.  Well, this is another long story,  but it goes to the publisher,  which isn't necessarily the label or the artist.  Yeah, true.  That's why you always want to write your own music.  And just as Motley Crue did,  you want to keep the rights to your music.  Yeah.  Six billion.  Spotify's numbers are close to that, I think.  Really?  Let me see.  Let me see what the music industry payout was.  Seven billion.  A little bit more.  A little bit more.  That's in 2021.  That's to labels, publishers and others.  Yeah, that's more than anybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Importantly here,  the music industry is the one medium  that was hit first by the snowball  that became an avalanche down the mountain  that is the internet.  And it screwed up.  And I was teaching this in class last week.  It was the first one,  and the only one I think to date,  to really figure out how to do this.  Will Page, the former chief economist at Spotify,  has a great piece he did in the FT  about two years ago,  taking us through the numbers  where the explosion of creativity  that now exists is amazing  without the gatekeepers that existed before.  So that I think this similar,  an equivalent number of songs  are released every day  as the UK used to release albums in a year.  And the number of genres  goes from hundreds to thousands that exist.  And so the music industry  still has a blockbuster economy,  still wants to have a Mariah Carey,  still wants to have the big guys,  but they learned how to make money  on the long tails we used to say.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nobody else has really done that yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, books haven't really,  though you have Wattpad,  you have that kind of stuff happening,  which is kind of interesting.  Magazines certainly haven't figured it out,  but they're not for a whole bunch of creators.  They don't have the Matt Mullenweg view  of many canvases and many paintbrushes.  It's our canvas, it's our paintbrush.  So music finally, finally figured it out,  it's about to get back to where it was  and it's going to succeed from here.  It's good to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you would like to,  it is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people  are going to London right now  to view the Queen's casket and state.  There is currently a two-mile long line.  If you want to watch it,  it's being streamed live.  This is a live video from the chapel from the BBC.  Kind of the Francisco Franco stream.  She's still dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that's mean.  That's just mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it's an old SNL joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know, I know.  So the funeral is on Monday,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so she will be lying in state  and people are going to be lying in the ground  and people are going to be lying in the ground  and people are going to be lying in the ground.  I'll never forget one of the things  I did when we were in Beijing  is went to see Mao's tomb  because he's,  I don't know if it's a wax effigy or whatever  or he's just well-involved,  but he's lying there  and you can see him,  you can see his face  and there is a constant mile long line  of people from all over the country,  from all over China going to see Mao  all these years later.  This was 2009 or 10,  so it's somewhat discredited  but there's still a lot of reverence  for Chairman Mao  and people bring flowers  and I'll never forget seeing this  so they come,  they lay flowers on the cask,  well it's not a cask,  he's in a, like Lenin is,  he's in a glass jar,  bell jar kind of thing  and they put flowers down  and of course there's so many people going by  these flowers pile up  so they gather all the flowers up  and they're like,  what's the next bunch of people?  This is not happening for the Queen,  I don't believe there are any flowers,  it's actually very solemn,  I don't know if we're getting audio,  I guess we are but there's not much  to hear.  You could leave that on,  Benito.  I think we're alright on this one  and you can see,  it's interesting to see the  guards with the big fur hats  with their heads bowed  and then the beef eaters around  with their heads bowed  and then the bobbies  at the corners  standing there with their heads bowed  yeah it's quite a  touching memorial.  Wow.  So that's live at bbc.com  if you want to watch it.  I don't think they stream Chairman Mouse  bell jar  but I don't know,  I might be wrong,  could be wrong.  How about Lenin's?  Lenin's tomb,  I've not seen that,  I would actually love to go  get the whole,  collect the whole set.  I don't know,  is Stalin's body there somewhere?
