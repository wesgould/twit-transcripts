Transcript:  It's time for Twig this week at Google.  Matthew Ingram joins Jeff Jarvis and me  to talk about the latest news and news,  of course, one of the big topics this week.  We'll also talk a little bit about what we'll debate,  whether a Google phone number is real or not,  that'll text you special deals for Black Friday,  and how you can donate to charity just by using Android Pay.  It's all coming up next on Twig.  Netcasts you love.

It's time for Twig This Week in Google,  where we cover Google the cloud, Facebook, Twitter,  and anything else we want to.  Because Jeff Jarvis is the king of everything else.  He's the king of media, of all media.  Take that Howard Stern.  No, no, no, no, I'm not battling him.  No, no, no.  Jeff's a professor of journalism  at the City University of New York, blogs at BuzzMachine.com,  and has written many books, his most recent Geeks bearing gifts  about reinventing the news biz.  Also joining us, another ink-stained retch,  a refugee from the Globe and Mail, Matthew Ingram.  He's currently at Fortune dot com.  You might remember him from Gigome dot com.  Nice to see you.  Good to see you, boss.  Is it snowy?  You're in just in Ontario, right?  Toronto, yeah.  You're in Toronto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've got a little dusting of snow, but not much.  Not yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Toronto's funny because you get the lake effect,  but the opposite of what Chicago gets.  You get warm air from the lake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it can be good and bad.  Sometimes it means more snow.  You can go either way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Diagraphal.  So I have to, we're tomorrow's Thanksgiving in the US.  You've already had yours.  So how was it?  It was good.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  All right, a little preview of the future for us.  Canadians celebrate a month early.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is there a traditional food that's different?  Do you do those stupid fries and gravy thing for Thanksgiving?  Or what do you do?  No, it's pretty standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You mean poutine for Thanksgiving?  No.  That would be good, actually.  I love poutine.  It's got gravy.  But turkey, stuffing, gravy, mashed potatoes.  Some people like Brussels sprouts, stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is there a ceremonial Canadian apology to the turkey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not usually.  I'm sorry, turkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We parted in the beer.  You apologized.  I'm doing turkey and ham, Parker house rolls, mashed potatoes, green beans, pumpkin pie.  You're doing ham.  Nice.  Yeah, well, Michael wanted ham.  It's his birthday, of all things.  He's 13.  So he gets to choose one of the dishes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And sometimes we'll do ham one day of the weekend or lamb and then turkey.  Lamb is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we reserve lamb for Easter here in the Southern 49.  Yeah, we often do that as well.  So one of the traditions on Thanksgiving is a link-baity think piece on how to deal with your racist relatives.  And I am now a new fan.  And I know you guys will know.  And I just didn't know of Jeb Lund, who writes, I guess, for The Guardian.  Do you know him? Of him?  No, I don't know him.  I've heard of him.  Oh, man, he's good.  So he's going to take the role of the acerbic pundit who has a master of the turn of phrase.  He writes in The Rolling Stone,  It's a meta piece.  You can see the same thing at work with Thanksgiving.  And of course, we've all seen a huge number of pieces on how to argue with your relatives this Thanksgiving.  He says,  He says,  He says,  The first part of Thanksgiving was being forced to return to the thing that had been escaped and that could in no way define the writer who is now a being from a brighter place.  So I agree.  I've seen a lot of up worthy headlines about your relatives.  He says,  It's ridiculous to assume, even if you disagree, that you're going to have three bullet points from an article that's going to change everybody's point of view.  I bet people click.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Actually, I've avoided that.  I'm proud of myself.  I'm like, intentionally, like grit my teeth and go, I will not click that.  Anyway, I just I if you have been and then it caused me to read some more Jeb Lund.  Some of it's in The Guardian.  But I think he's an American and is very funny.  So recommended as an antidote.  And he does say, by the way, the real enemy is taking a perfectly nice turkey and putting it in a does he call it going to find it is at the bottom of the piece.  Fried turkey is a goddamn travesty.  It's only as flavorful as the surface meat and skin.  The rest is just wet inside to make it taste like anything other than hot, neutral turkey meat means relying on a gravy vector that can't be improved by turkey drippings because you threw the whole effort into a curve.  Cardiac drowning pool.  What you get is a moist bird.  That's nice if you're single in London, but it's no good on a plate in front of grandma.  This is the war we should be fighting America.  It's not as tenditious or upsetting as railing about American history or factory farming or carbon emissions.  It's not some bass, weegand, Dave Barry trying out his shoe bomb material on you before you walk through the extra machine.  And it's not someone beating the tray table in fury because the workspace in his row is more important than the sleep space in yours.  And it's sure not some factious exercise by some post teen keyboard jockey whining about returning to darkest Pennsylvania via the contrived avatar of some relative they probably don't even have.  This war is winnable.  And at least it's real.  Okay.  Okay.  Actually, Darwin is in full force with deep fat frying turkey because it's almost certainly going to cause a column of hot fat and burst into flames.  We did that once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And?  We had to do a real turkey the regular way as well because the family complained that the deep fry version would not have stuffing.  And of course stuffing is the whole purpose of having turkey in the first place.  We did deep fry one, did it out in the driveway just in case.  Smart.  It actually went pretty well.  Yeah.  No flames.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No flames.  And the turkey, did it taste good?  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was not a fan.  Yeah.  So maybe we did it wrong.  No, I think it's just greasy.  It is faster once you get the oil up to temperature.  The problem is you've got 40 gallons of oil.  You have to get it up to temperature.  It takes like two hours.  And then what do you do afterwards with all the oil?  Right.  Oh, good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I think it's a toxic dump somewhere in Ontario.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We, you know, got rid of it discreetly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now we just use the cooker to boil corn.  It's great for that.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can make a lot of it too.  Did you see the Star Wars?  I was actually complaining yesterday about the, just the, already, even a month before  the Star Wars movie comes out, the overwhelming amount of marketing.  Yeah.  Google has already done several things to participate.  I think you can change your avatar to awaken the force within.  And if you, they even have a page, google.com slash Star Wars.  And if you google.  You can have a Tie Fighter as your car.  You can choose your side.  And your Google apps will either be on the Rebel Alliance or the Imperial Forces.  It's just like, I, please.  But yeah, tell, so the one you were going to say, go ahead, Matthew, because I'll do it right now.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you, if you Google search a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.  Long time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You won't have to type very much because of course, autocomplete will do this for you.  And you get the search results in a, in a crawl suitable for, you know what?  Let me turn the audio on too, by the way.  Oh, I didn't thought of that.  I never did that.  There you go.  There you go.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know it's nerdy, but I do get chills when I hear this music.  I do.  I do get excited when I hear this music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When did the first one come out?  What year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  God, we were young.  A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.  And those are live links too.  Oh yeah.  This is the actual search results.  So you could click, you know, click it and get a result.  Isn't that amazing?  Do you see now?  Here's the question.  And we, I debated, we debated this.  I said, Google for sure got paid for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I would bet.  It's an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's an ad.  Yeah.  Although they do, it's not that different from the Google doodle.  Barrel roll and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's so, and they, well, they use so much material.  I mean, the song, using the song.  They probably had to pay for that.  They didn't pay for it.  No, but they were paid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody else paid for it.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  Although do a barrel roll.  I'm happy to see do a barrel roll still works if you search for it.  Yeah.  Do a barrel roll.  Oh, you know what?  I already did it once.  I can't, I guess you can only do one barrel roll.  There you go.  Oh, there you go.  Oh yeah.  Nice.  Fun with CSS.  I have to think Disney gave them a little, a little something, something for that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think, I would think they'd do that anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they're, they're for sure nerds.  You know, the kind of nerds who in 1977 were 12 years old and damn excited about the movie  everyone was talking about.  I remember waiting in line to see Star Wars.  I was 21.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I saw it on Geary in San Francisco.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You remember where you saw it.  I think.  What year did it come out?  Wow.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're old, eh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if you think you're old, take a look at Mark Hamill.  He is not aging well.  Well, he had a car wreck or something, right?  He did have a car wreck.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Cause Harrison Ford looks great.  Yeah.  Harrison Ford does look pretty good.  Yeah.  He's looking fabulous.  I don't think the-  Is that Carrie Fisher?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Okay.  So-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there you go.  You know people age.  And-  I'm not, I'm one of them.  If you can.  I mean, I was 21 when I saw that movie.  So was Carrie, I think.  She was close to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's had a hard life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a hard knock life for Leia.  It's a hard knock life for Leia.  All right.  Boy, this is going to be a fun show.  There's nothing to talk about.  Google Hangouts.  Let's talk about that a little bit.  Because in all the attention to the new Google+,  you all have the new Google+, by now, I'm sure.  Yes.  Which, by the way, doesn't seem so very different than the old Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's pushing the collections on me like crazy.  And I can't, I don't, I don't want me.  Well, there's two things.  One, so when you send a message now, it's just public or not, right?  It's just public.  What?  There's no selecting who to send it to.  Oh, you still have circles.  They just buried it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How far did they bury it?  I couldn't find it.  No, they're still there.  That's, and that's one of the things people are complaining about is, if,  so if you click people and then you click following, then you get circles.  So if I post, let me see here.  Let me try this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Start a post, there's a way to choose it.  There's gotta be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If I click public, this is the new, there's the communities.  Scroll all the way down to the bottom of communities and there's the circles.  Way down at the bottom.  They made that hard.  Yeah, they, but you know what?  No, but I think what they're saying is nobody uses circles.  People just share it probably.  I didn't use them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, circles basically just didn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the, you know, it's really, Facebook offers lists too, but nobody really uses them  or knows how or, except Scoble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Remember, this was the answer at the time to all the complaints about privacy and this  and you don't know who you're sharing with.  So at the time, we're on this show.  We praised it and so on.  It's brilliant.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It was a good, it was a technically a good idea.  So I mean, it seemed like a good idea, but just nobody did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's, it's, yeah.  I mean, look at the road to social media is paved with many a failed experiment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, and actually I thought getting people to filter.  I remember Bill Gross from my deal that came out with what the heck was his called?  He had a thing and it was, I know Twitter bought his Twitter client.  It wasn't Uber media and it wasn't, yeah, no, it was a different thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I invested in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, you blank out the bad ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could follow, like I could follow Jeff and get his recipes, but not chime in.  Yes.  Was it?  Yeah.  It could be.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Did you do that or the chat room?  I did that.  I Googled.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I Googled it.  Okay.  platform first.  Right.  And I think circles just took too much effort.  You know, you, you have to have the barriers to sort of interaction have to be low enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just joined a new social network.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Called this.  Oh yeah.  I've been on there.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I follow you.  I've been on there.  I just got my invite.  Give me a break.  I don't have all the clout you've got Matthew Ingram.  Oh, by the way, have I introduced Matthew?  I did.  Okay.  Good.  All right.  I don't have a lot.  So it's this.  It's this.CM.  Well, I didn't know.  I, I, I went through the front door.  They said, oh, good.  It will be inviting people.  And I filled out my address and I just got an invite.  So the whole thing here.  And at first I thought this is really silly gimmick.  You can only post one thing a day.  The trick will be to get people to come back every day and continue to post.  But I like the idea because that means if you can only post one thing, it better be  a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right?  Yeah.  And they do.  So I'll bet you $10.  I don't know this because I didn't ask Andrew Golis, who, uh, one of the founders was at  news guys, but I didn't ask him where the traffic comes from.  But I bet a lot comes from the email newsletter.  So they've got a newsletter that sends you the sort of five top things.  That's cool.  And they're almost inevitable.  They're almost always worth clicking.  Like that has the highest click through rate probably of anything I subscribe to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and there are a lot of, they have the Atlantic, there are a lot of mainstream outlets  and it makes sense that even if you have somebody like the Atlantic, they're not going to post  as they would elsewhere, everything they put out, they're going to post the one thing they  think most worthy of your click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right?  So you can see who posted it.  So you can, you can sort of tell it's a little like nuzzle in a way.  You can tell which one of the people you follow or which one of your friends shared it.  Um, and that kind of gives it added credibility.  You ever use nuzzle?  I love, I live on pretty great nuzzle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, by the way, does lead on as a new version out.  Yeah.  But people didn't really understand.  I saw this when we were news guys that in the Android version, you see a little navigation  on top.  In the iOS version, you don't, you swipe to get two different versions.  Three total.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it also, it now has functionality even if you're not logged in with Twitter.  So it'll show you sort of recommendations of even if it doesn't, even if it hasn't  crawled your Twitter account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nuzzle N U Z Z E L dot com is the creation of Jonathan Abrams who created Friendster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And very importantly on nuzzle, unlike anywhere else on nuzzle, at least in the U S if you  go and click on a New York times or a guardian links say that's already using AMP content.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nuzzle was one of the first ones to be integrated.  So go to your phone, go to your phone, go to nuzzle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  All right.  Doesn't so much matter on the web.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Jonathan told me, I wrote about it when he, when AMP launched and he was talking about  why he decided to do that.  And he said he was actually thinking of trying to come up with his own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, indeed, after a news based Helsinki and I wrote a column saying, this is what  Google are doing.  They don't do an open source version of this.  At the time Google was saying, no, we're not going to do that.  Jonathan contacted me and we were about to try to put together a little consortium of  publishers to try to set the standards.  And then I heard word that Google was working on it.  And then they finally told Jonathan about it.  And so he's a, he's a very early adopter of.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And his point was that one of the best parts is, you know, he was thinking about as a, as  a sort of aggregator publishers, if they wanted to do Facebook and Apple news and something  else, you have to come up with a completely different, you know, you have to arrange your  content and use a different API and sort of jumps through specific hoops.  And he was looking for something that was open and sort of cross platform.  And then AMP came along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's just if you're doing it, Leo, I think it's just the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, let me just I had to install a muzzle because I oh, well, I use it on the desktop  religiously. I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You'll see you'll see the the lightning bolt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The lightning bolt. Oh, that's what tells you you're on an AMP site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, actually, yes, both AMP and Facebook and articles use lightning bolts.  So there's a lightning bolt war.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so does Twitter Moments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we should. I don't think we explain what Nuzle.  The idea of Nuzle is that you add your Twitter and Facebook account and then it will show  you in three columns news from your friends.  That is the most retweeted or reshared articles that your people you're following have  shared, which is really kind of a good way of selecting the content.  And then but the next one is news from friends of friends, which is kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then it's a great way to it's a great way to catch up.  Like if you if you haven't been on tour for a while and you want to see what people have  been sharing, it's a really easy way to catch up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then the third column is news you may have missed, which kind of they call it  Discover on the on the which is probably a better name, actually, Discover on the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually prefer the friends of friends and the discover just because I'm so I want  serendipity to social media mad that I've I in fact have already have read.  Yeah, I think that on the.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So you want that you want that next layer out.  Right. And there there is where you have discoveries, which are really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Looking for a New York Times article, so I can see.  It's funny how few New York Times articles seem to be in today's feed as well.  There is one reporter forced release of Laquan McDonald videos barred from news event.  All right, I'm going to hit that.  Oh, I just see that.  That was a little lightning bolt.  Yeah. So that means it's it.  Guardian does it too.  And then and then so now this is going to this loads faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Guardian, Washington Post, New York Times.  OK, so if you want to see folks how it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I you know, I don't know.  It loads fast. Here's the Washington Post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, then click on it, click on it, click on a non-amp link and compare the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, this really does.  Stay on me, Jason, because you're going to miss the it's so fast that you're going to miss the lightning bolt.  Blink, folks, don't blink.  Here's an oh, I just did that one.  The Guardian does it too.  Guardian does it. Here we go.  Saudi Arabia advertises for eight new executioners.  Oh, good news. All right, let's hit that lightning bolt.  No, no, didn't get it that time.  It came fast.  It was fast, but it wasn't.  So let's find another New York Times or WAPO.  Was it was Jeff Bezos at?  Say, news guys, he should be right.  It was not. Anybody from WAPO?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, Marty. No, I mean, not right.  I like calling it WAPO.  Cat. Yes, I was there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. New York Times.  Forget Turducken. It's pie caking time.  All right. So I'm going to hit that lightning bolt.  Bing. Boom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's so fast. Now go back, Leo.  Yeah. Click on a BuzzFeed link or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, OK.  TechCrunch. How about that?  Google's plan to accelerate the mobile web will go live early next year.  That's AMP. Story about it.  Let's see if the AMP story is AMP'd.  Do do do do. It's not so slow.  Not bad.  But by the way, it's a one paragraph article.  I have story. Yeah.  Well, it's because they don't want you to have the whole thing.  LA Times. Yes, that's pretty fast, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, still loading, still loading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, even on AMP, the ads load later.  So you can still find that ads take a while, but that's the ad server's fault  because they're not AMP'd. Yeah, damn it.  But the key to AMP is it sets the as good HTML has always done.  It sets the architecture of the page that you have to set the ad sizes  so the page doesn't go reconfiguring itself constantly.  Here's the new Gawker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you think about that?  The politicized Gawker.  Gawker has decided to a there.  Oh, lightning bolt.  Choo.  Boom.  It'd be cool if there was a noise as well.  It is the Marvel Comics version of The Washington Post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what?  I think this is critical because because the experience is such  that you feel like you have a left bezel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It feels like distributed content.  It feels like the content is there. Right.  And I think there's all kinds of new things that one could do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's Nuzle native. Let's load BuzzFeed, see what happens.  It's you know, I don't know if that's it.  I don't know.  Is there a video? No, it's still.  Yeah, yeah, no, I am.  Definitely is a superior experience.  So Jonathan's absolutely right.  And by the way, the column is now in my Android one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the swipe you know, it's been on Android.  It wasn't on. Oh, it wasn't on iOS before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It wasn't on. Oh, OK.  I like this. Yeah, it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jonathan's done a good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's got some really good investors now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do OK. So let's look at my desktop now, Jason.  By the way, Jason Hall taking the day off because it's Thanksgiving.  He's got a family.  So Jason Clantus are a producer, technical director today.  So on my desktop, you know, this is a story.  And I get six friends shared it and then I can tweet it or share it.  But I never do that. Am I a bad nuzzler  because I don't reshare? I just consume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because your shares, Leo, no, you're contributing to it  because it recognizes what you share on Twitter and Facebook.  So as long as I share on Twitter and Facebook, that's where it gets the value.  Yeah. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't have to do it through Nuzle, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We should have to know.  So if you do share those things, you're helping the source.  You're not really helping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let me let me load that same Washington Post article without AMP  just to see what that looks like on the it's still pretty fast.  That was pretty instant.  Maybe our Internet is really faster.  It's better to test it on a slow Internet.

Transcript:  Oh, I remember the tech site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a tech site where you go and the whole page is an ad.  And then over on the right hand side, there's a tiny, tiny little  sort of two pixel wide bar.  And that's the content.  And you have to click on it and then it slides over in front of the ad.  But you've seen links cars, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, I installed Tencent.  I read an article that said you should install Tencent.  So I did. I'm that easy.  I'll talk about that in just a second.  This is funny.  Somehow, one of those sites pulled up a pop under.  Now I have three easy steps to cleaning my Mac.  I've got to say sometimes.  Was that the Sun Times?  Yeah. Oh, that's horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, if you haven't irritated someone enough with your ads,  after they click to exit your site, you should show them another shitty ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who would have thought this Chicago Sun Times  would be worse than Ling's car?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How the mighty. Just so desperate.  Well, so desperate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And look what's going on at the L.A. Times.  I mean, is it a women confirm navigation?  Please consider cleaning your Mac from junk.  Are you sure you want to leave this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't seen this in years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's like it's like a porn site.  I had a little porn storm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you, Chicago.  But I understand if you're in print, it's there.  The New York Times and the Washington Post of the world are few and far between.  L.A. Times has been.  Well, we'll talk about this, too.  There's lots to talk about. I got to take a break.  I'm overexcited from Ling. It makes me want to do an ad.  I don't know why I just get the itch to do an ad.  Matthew Ingram is here for Fortune magazine. Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you dance like that while you're doing the ad like Ling?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I gave myself a headache.  And I'm a little nauseous.  Hold on a second. I shook my head too hard.  Matthew Ingram is here for Fortune.com, also from the City University  of New York and Buzz Machine.com are great and true friend.  Jeff Jarvis and they're both longtime newspaper men.  So we'll talk a little bit about the sad state of affairs  in print in a little bit.  Our show today brought you all I love this by automatic.  This is sometimes technologies come along that really change  how you use something.  In this case, your car, of all things, this is the automatic.  Now, all cars since 1996 in the United States have a on board diagnostic port  or an OBD port under the steering wheel.  It is normally only used when you bring it to the shop  and they plug it in for diagnostics, but it is open and it is available.  And with automatic, you can plug right into it.  It's a little dongle that plugs into the OBD port and then pairs  with your phone, the automatic app on your phone to tell you stuff  about what's going on with your car.  My automatic app tells me, for instance,  how much gas I used on the last trip.  It actually can score the trips and tell me if I accelerated too hard,  sped too much, the kinds of things that, you know, impact gas mileage.  So it's really kind of a little trainer.  It's like there's even additional software that you can get  that will be for teenagers as they learn how to drive.  Automatic is amazing.  You can get it. We're going to get you a great deal on it in just a second.  So this is the version 2.0 and I, you know, I played with the automatic one  and I'm just blown away with 2.0.  It's really great.  And you could do things like get this.  I can ask the Amazon Echo because there's an Echo connection.  How much gas is in my tank?  And it will tell me, oh, you're almost out of gas.  If your engine light comes on automatic, the app will tell you what's wrong.  And of course, you get real time feedback as you drive around.  I even have it hooked up to my if this than that.  So every trip I take is automatically logged to an Evernote  notebook so I can go back and get a map of where I went,  the cost of the gas to get there.  It's a it's kind of an amazing thing.  It's a driving lesson.  It's informative.  It's the it's kind of the quantified self for your vehicle.  Really, really cool.  Let me show you my notebook here on Evernote.  Four, let's find it here first.  So here's here's here's the trip I took to come to work.  Two point three, one mile trip to PN.  Actually, this was yesterday.  Fuel cost forty six cents.  And it gives you the map, the point to point.  This is amazing stuff.  And this is all logged automatically to Evernote via automatic.  And if this than that, I can go on and on.  But what I want you to do is take a look at it, go to automatic.  Dot com slash twit a UTO M A T I C.  Just like it's, you know, the dictionary automatic dot com slash twit.  Use the offer, go to a checkout.  You get 20 percent off.  Makes it under $80 and the software is free.  It is really, really cool.  What I like about is these guys are very proactive in in in  adding to the things it'll do.  I mean, the echo integration that just happened.  Automatic dot com slash twit.  Your car has been keeping secrets from you with automatic.  You can find out what those secrets are.  Automatic dot com.  Slash twit.  Don't forget to use a twit check out code and save 20 percent.  This actually be a good gift.  And if you've got teenagers in the house, you should absolutely get one.  Jeff Jarvis is here from CUNY.  Matthew Ingram.  Jeff worked at the San Francisco Examiner.  Gone.  She called it her day.  A paper that had no tomorrow.  Gone.  Matthew, at least Matthew Ingram worked at the Globe and Mail still around.  How's Globe and Mail doing, though?  The editor was a news guy saying he's doing just fine, Matthew.  He's doing just fine.  He's doing just fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's doing just fine.  The editor was a news guy saying he's doing just fine, Matthew.  Doing wonderfully.  Yeah.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good to hear.  And I guess that's true.  What's good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It really underscores what the New York Times is doing is really great because this is arguably  the most important newspaper in the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it is the grand exception to all rules.  But it is the exception.  The other way you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember the report that Emily Bell and Clay Shirkey and Chris Anderson, I think it  was, did where they talked about the future of news.  And upfront they said, we're not even going to mention the New York Times because they're  basically a unicorn.  You are not the New York Times.  Your paper is not the New York Times.  So the things that the New York Times can do, you probably won't be able to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and the jury's still out on whether they will be enough, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and in fact, they aren't enough.  So probably one of the world's most successful newspaper paywalls ever.  And it's barely kind of keeping the Times head above water when it comes to print advertising  decline and circulation decline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep.  Well, yeah.  And the mission was to not decline advertising, and advertising is going down.  And the way the pricing is done, and this is true of other papers as well, I'm motivated  to get the print paper even though we never look at it.  And the advertisers are going to figure that out pretty soon.  Yeah, me too.  The people who are getting the print still because they're artificially supporting print  because print has the advertising in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the Post does the same thing.  You know, somebody posted a tweet about how they couldn't figure out the pricing of the  Washington Post paywall, and the Times is exactly the same.  And the reason you can't figure it out is because it's not designed for you.  It's not designed to appeal to consumers.  It's designed to kind of put a firewall around print ad revenues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, who was it just tweeted recently?  Why is it cheaper for me to get the Sunday Times delivered to my doorstep than not?  Right.  And with a digital subscription, you actually...  I get the Sunday Times for that reason alone, to save money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Economically, it makes sense.  It's killing trees to save money, though.  Well, your eyeballs are being sold to the advertisers who advertise in the paper.  They're going to see at some point that there's some false level of that print product.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think they know that.  I think they know that.  Oh, sure they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just a question of...  The advertisers not to figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a question of when advertisers decide to move on that knowledge because they clearly  know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So when you...  The Washington Post has taken a different route because they're owned, of course, by  the deep-pocketed CEO of Amazon, Jeff Bezos.  Is there...  Is it just going to be his playground and he's going to just accept losing $50 million  a year or...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they just announced that they have more audience than the New York Times.  And Bezos was on CBS this morning and the paper itself trumpeted that they are out there  to become the next paper of record, the new paper of record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what he says he wants to be, the new paper of record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These are fingers in the eyes of the New York Times.  So it's a competitive landscape.  But that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, it is.  He has been making some really interesting moves and moves that wouldn't work unless  you also ran Amazon.  And one is to include, to bundle subscriptions with Amazon Prime, which is super smart.  And the other was to do deals with a whole bunch of other newspapers and say, all of  your subscribers can get the Washington Post subscription for free.  So that's instant distribution.  I mean, it's a pretty smart move.  How the paper is doing sort of financially is unknown, but it certainly seems to be growing  in terms of audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if I'm a Prime member, I can get six months free of the Washington Post.  But then what?  I haven't done this yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, then it's like $49 a year.  It's very low.  It's very, very low.  So it is subsidized basically.  Well, you can look at it that way or you could say that it's...  What's the market price of it?  There's no paper and ink to pay for.  So no more than every movie I watched through Prime is subsidized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the question is, is Jeff keeping...  In order to become the Journal of Record, which is traditionally what the New York Times  has been, you'd have to be doing some really good journalism and reporting and quality  stuff, are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They are indeed.  And Marty Barron, the editor, is a top editor.  I forget who it was, wrote a piece this week claiming he was the best editor alive.  The best editor ever.  Whatever.  I hope that's sponsored advertising.  Yeah.  And Bezos is investing.  The journalists love it when they're hiring.  Bezos is hiring.  See, hiring more journalists is how you win because pay us more and get more of us.  So they can do what the New York Times write show recaps.  More is not necessarily always the answer.  Nonetheless, Bezos indeed is investing in the paper.  He also went after them heavy, I'm told, about their page load pre-amp.  Oh, did he?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And they cut the heck out of it because it was ridiculous.  And he knows the value of a fast page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the best thing about having Bezos there is that, and I said this when he acquired  it, whatever you can say about Jeff Bezos, and there are lots of things to say about  him, he understands how things work online.  He lives and breathes it.  That's his, you know, he swims in it.  And so he's using that understanding, I think, to help the newspaper.  And instead of trying to get someone who grew up through the print era to reinvent the newspaper,  he's effectively driving it based on what he understands about how digital information  and content works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I've long said that my fondest wish for Bezos' reign at the Post is that he would  bring his skills at user consumer data and customization and targeting to journalism.  And that hasn't happened yet, but he's going at his own speed.  But the fact that he knows something about you and then acts on that to give you greater  relevance and value and gives you transparency into how he knows it and what he's doing and  all that stuff, those are tremendous skills that we need and do not have in our business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if you think about it, every city in the country used to have a morning and an  afternoon paper.  But we're I mean, I think because of the Internet and so forth, if we had a morning and afternoon  national paper, in other words, two national papers competing hard with each other, I rule  out the USA Today.  Oh, yes.  The nation's new PAP, as people put on the newsstand, the minute they put the nation's  newspaper, they just crossed out the ER and it worked really nicely.  That would be good.  And that would be kind of not so very different from the day when you had the Chicago Sun  and the Chicago Times.  And I would have a reading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But are you good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember reading about the early, early days of newspapers.  I'm pretty sure it was San Francisco had 11 newspapers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, we had the call, the bulletin, the examiner, the Chronicle.  Those are four I could just I remember.  Yeah, from the 1800s.  You mean?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, and those were the days before the earthquake.  It was a very different time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am partisan to say this as I work with them, but we have The Guardian, too, which gives  us an outside perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's from England.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if you think about it, think about what newspapers used to do.  They used to compete for readers in a sort of defined geographical area.  Now the New York Times and the Washington Post and everyone else is competing with everything.  Every form of information anywhere.  That's a challenge.  So there's no monopoly anymore.  There's no oligopoly anymore.  There's no control over the channel.  And so you just have to try a lot harder.  And I think the hard part is that a lot of newspapers just don't have the resources to  do that because the advertising rug has been sort of ripped out from under them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We haven't mentioned The Wall Street Journal, which I think it's fair to say is also a national  newspaper and it's reporting excellent.  So that's good.  There is competition.  But at the same time, there are newspapers all over the country folding the latest The  LA Times.  I'm reading an article in the LA Observe blog.  Buyout list at LA Times makes you want to cry.  They're buying out.  It's a train wreck.  It's a lot of people going.  Among the departures, two assistant managing editors, the main politics editor for City  Hall in LA and for California, the bureau chiefs in New York, Seattle, San Francisco,  San Diego, Las Vegas, London, all the obituary writers.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But movie reviewers, editorial writers.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, OK.  So let's stop there.  The Los Angeles Times covers Los Angeles.  Does it need a New York bureau, a London bureau?  Does it need movie reviewers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they've also fired half a dozen photographers.  They don't need photographers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you look at what the Sun Times has done with photographers.  They basically fired their entire staff and now they...  They gave their reporters iPhones.  At some point...  They said, here, take your own damn pictures.  When it comes to saying your mission here is to cover the local market, is to cover  a lot...  The complaint I used to have with the Los Angeles Times was they had international ambitions.  So they put bureaus all over the world and they abandoned Los Angeles.  They abused it.  And now they're going back to covering Los Angeles, which is what they should be doing.  And I'm for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That means a much smaller organization.  A much, much smaller organization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does, but Matthew, that's true of every damn paper there is.  They're all going to have to be smaller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think every major city should have one highly local newspaper?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it should have one highly local news organization.  And paper is the wrong word.  Yeah.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Think about...  Look at Tribune Co.  That whole model where you own a bunch of kind of regional papers or mid-market papers  in a bunch of different cities and you kind of...  You merge them all together into one big thing and you run content from one and the other  and you use a lot of wire copy and you...  That sort of model of newspaper chain just doesn't make any sense anymore.  It's not competitive.  I disagree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although the New York Times owns our little Petaluma local paper, the weekly Argus Courier.  They also own the Santa Rosa Press Democrat, which is a daily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I thought they'd gotten rid of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe they do.  Maybe they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's also another...  I think there's another sort of tsunami coming.  And I know Jeff will agree with me.  And that is when all the advertisers who put flyers in all those newspapers and coupons  and so on just head for the hills or some other...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been writing about that for about three, four years now.  Indeed, I did some work at a certain major retailer a little over two years ago and I  said, when's the point at which critical mass of newspaper circulation falls so that you're  not going to put your circulars in the paper anymore?  And they said 24 and 36 months.  That was more than 24 months ago.  So we're not quite on that schedule.  But in the last 12 months, department store circulars have declined more than 25%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Incidentally, you're right, Jeff, that the Times did sell both our local paper and the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Santa Rosa Press Democrat.  They concentrate just now on the New York Times.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I heard a story at Newsguys, which I won't attribute to anyone, that a certain large  retailer came into the newspaper's offices and said, you know, we pay you about $18 million  to distribute things, flyers and coupons and so on.  And we've run the numbers over a long period of time and we're prepared to pay you $2 million  for that.  And in return for that, in return for seeing sort of 80% of what we used to pay you go  out the window, here's what you're going to do.  You're going to do a bunch of these things and then you can thank us for the $2 million  or you can have nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We know what's going to happen with the circulars.  FSIs, it's called free-stating inserts in the business.  When you have newspapers across the country that have gone to three-day-a-week circulation,  the reason they're printing three days a week is because those are the three days they have  inserts.  Circulars.  Yeah, and it's going to go away.  It's a wrapper for inserts.  I have long contended that newspapers have to set a date when they become fully sustainable  digitally before the date at which print becomes unsustainable and no longer contributes profit.  And that's what we're seeing happening.  And those organizations will be much smaller.  We have ecosystems with many more organizations in them.  We have all kinds of new things sprouting up, but I think we need a lot more.  We modeled what a market like Boston would look like.  Five years ago, we modeled what Boston would look like without the Globe because at the  time it was going to fold more like six years ago.  And what we found was that based on the Globe's own digital revenue, you could support an  equivalent number of journalists with a large news organization, still fairly large covering  the whole metro area, plus a blog for every 50,000 people in the market locally, plus  public media, plus ad networks.  And there's a model there that is workable.  It's just not the big old monopoly we used to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the problem is costs have to decrease by so much.  That's why you see so many chains laying off huge amounts of people and cutting like entire  layers of management, because that cost structure was designed for a completely different business  model.  It's just not going to work anymore.  And I think, you know, circulars is part of it.  Remember, Clay Shirky wrote about how he feels like there's another cliff coming.  So advertisers, you know, it's still falling at revenue.  But once newspapers and their circulation or their reach get below a certain point,  advertisers are just going to pull the trigger and say, we're not advertising with you at  all because you're just not big enough or you don't have the reach or you don't have  the targeting that we want.  And those ads will go.  It's not like they will reduce.  They'll disappear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or turn to the Chicago Sun-Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, those ads will still be around.  They'll be worth point zero zero zero zero zero zero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what's really sad.  You're plaguing me with these ads and you're making no money also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And I think, you know, going back to Bezos, I think this is a good point to make  that Bezos, at least, you know, he runs a giant retailer.  And how do retailers make money by serving their customers?  How do newspapers make money by shoving crappy ads in your face and hoping that you will  click on them? Like, it's a difference of of of the way you look at what your duty is.  And if newspapers looked at serving their readers as their duty, they wouldn't they  wouldn't use all those ads.  They would figure out a better way somehow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google says, according to I can't ever pronounce his name, Erzholzl.  That's pretty good. Erz.  Erz. Erzholzl.  The boss of the cloud.  Hutzle. Hutzle.  It means bear. Erz means bear.  What does Hutzle mean?  Bear hug.  Americans can't say this.  According to Google's eighth employee, he says by 2020, Google's ad revenues will be  outpaced by their cloud revenue.  The goal for us to talk about Google as a cloud company by 2020.  This was Amazon Envy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe they definitely they want AWS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that they should have had.  By the way, yeah, Jeff Bezos is more than a newspaper mogul and a retailer.  He happens to run the number one cloud service in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you look at that.  Look at that company.  We only just recently got information about it, but look at what happened there.  They built what's effectively a 30, 40, $50 billion company inside Amazon without  anyone really realized.  Almost as a hobby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's like somebody I read in dogfight the story and I'm trying to remember, but  basically somebody said, you know, Jeff, we've got these servers or not really.  It was a Skunkworks.  Well, it's Verner Vogels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really, Verner is the is absolutely brilliant.  Funny, great, great, wonderful bearer of a guy and unsung, I think.  All of this world is where he's one of the great geniuses of the technology  business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder if he cries at his desk every day.  I don't think so.  He cries with joy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He goes stomping around saying, where's the free food?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  His name should be Urs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because he looks like a bear like fellow.  He's the CTO at Amazon.  So he got his reward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But not that long ago, there was actually debate about whether AWS was even making  money.  There was debate about whether it was even beneficial to Amazon.  If they spun that out tomorrow, it'd be worth $40 billion.  Isn't that amazing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just, it's, and it was just, it was just, it was an internal project  basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And think about it.  Google should really be there already.  I mean, they've got, Microsoft should be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  IBM should be there.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  I think of all the companies that were in the cloud.  EMC.  Yeah, servers.  EMC should be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have all the tools.  They just didn't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Something, Amazon did something right.  Again.  And you know, when I look at things like the Echo, I think Amazon is a dark, look,  they, they failed with a smartphone.  Okay.  But they're a dark horse in many areas.  Yeah.  Don't write them off.  Nobody's writing off, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The whole delivery mechanism that's out there, bringing physical world into this,  the huge disruption yet to be had.  And Uber is going to play in that.  Amazon's going to play in that.  Google, Google wishes to play in it, but it really has just very small  efforts in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I don't understand is why can't Google go up against Amazon and win?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They can, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right now, the problem is they could in a lot of ways, but, but number one,  they don't have fulfillment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they closed Google code, right?  I mean, this was a big, the, the, the few, the, some of the areas where they went  head to head against Amazon, they've already conceded.  Yeah, true.  Yeah.  You win Amazon.  That's not how you beat them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think actually that the structure of alphabet might help.  Ah, you know, they might be able to do things that they couldn't before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you could say Google's picking its fights and maybe says, well, who  cares if we win in, in, you know, compute engines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's interesting.  Didn't someone say that now with the alphabet structure, they'll be asking  units like operating units underneath alphabet to basically pay for services  that alphabet renders, like say cloud services.  Well, that's a standard corporate thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Charge it back.  Yeah.  We're, we're corporate.  We're here to help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They'll pay us.  Yeah.  Charge it back.  Well, that's, it may just be an accounting formality too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no twig would be worth $3 billion if Leo didn't charge us the rental of these

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  sets, right?  How can I, I got to, you know, that's a good idea.  Let me think about this.  How can I make more money?  No, we do that a little bit.  We fight, we separated out the sales, uh, uh, from, uh, uh, twit into a different  agency, uh, I mean, from the point of view of it's a, it's, it's almost an  accounting thing, but there, but it's, but also separates it.  Uh, and it means that that the sales company art artisanal could sell to other,  sell other pod anyway.  I don't know.  I don't understand the name of it.  Artisanal.  Yeah.  Oh, that's pretty good.  Is that a good name?  Cause I've always said this is artisanal media.  It's more like handmade kind of custom.  We're not, we're bespoke.  We're not trying to, uh, do mass media.  We're doing kind of media targeted media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's actually one of the areas of media that I'm the most enthusiastic  about is, is what I've called artisanal media.  Yeah.  You and me both, baby.  One person, two people, six people, 10 people.  Um, right.  You know, have a business, make a living, and super serve a niche as

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  opposed to try to be all things to all people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's the other thing that newspapers like Jeff's point about  sort of serving your local market.  That's the other thing that they tried to do was to be mass and mass  just doesn't work anymore unless you're.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's not something that they tried to be.  They were successful at it, but what we've done is take reach and  frequency volume based business and try to put it into what is meant  to be a very customized business.  You know, Google is not a mass company.  Google is trying to sell ads that are highly targeted to you individually.  Facebook is not a mass company.  No two people see the same Facebook.  The content and ads that you get are, are, they're, they're both  personal services company and media companies don't know how to do that.  And unless we learn how to do that, we're.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's too late because I think, you know, the newspapers, this was years ago.  I remember talking to the globe and saying, we fundamentally, we do not  know anything about the person who clicks and comes to our homepage.  We might know where they came from, like the URL they visited just before that.  But other than that, we know nothing.  We don't know what to show them.  We don't know what not to show them.  And it hasn't really improved that much.  Not just the globe.  I'm not, I'm not talking about the globe, but the knowing your reader and being  able to have a relationship with them that then allows you to show them the  things they want and not show them the things they don't want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But isn't it kind of ironic now that news is moving in, in the opposite  direction of the, with Facebook owning basically the platform and knowing the  reader in ways that the news organization that posts on Facebook cannot.  Uh, Apple's news does you, it's opaque.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To the, that's why they're winning.  That's why they're winning because they know they understand the customer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Apple's news is crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, thank God it's crap.  Seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Facebook's is not, uh, and, uh, so, but this is also, so I wrote a column  in the observer about the plugin.  What I'm today, the New York observer, not the other, I just read it about  news guys in which, you know, I hear journalists love to moan and whine and  complain, as I say that we are a herd of yours.  Um, but we've got to engage with and find peace with and negotiate with the  technologists and we try to act still as if we're above it and, and, but Google  amp came out of news, the last two news guys, Amazon is, I mean, uh, uh,  app Facebook is doing things for news.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, they don't come to those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they weren't invited.  I think in the past, Matthew, they were invited this year.  Didn't, didn't, didn't come with Twitter came.  Um, but I think that, that, uh, we journalists have to engage with the  tech, the technologists have learned to start to engage with the publishers.  And now we've got to do the same thing back.  And, and I hear, I hear that from some journalists, but I also hear a  lot of complaining and whining and, oh, it's two people were quoted as saying  that, that if Facebook held news guys, they wouldn't go.  That's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, but from what you just said, this is, this is kind of, um, uh, uh, step  backwards for news organizations because Twitter and Facebook do own the  relationship at the cost of the news organization.  Well, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, so, but that's our own damn fault because we don't do anything.  You're capitulating if you're publishing on Facebook.  No, no, I disagree.  It's the opposite.  I think that what we have to do is negotiate with Facebook.  We have to recognize that our users, the public we want to serve are there.  A billion people a day go to Facebook.  What are they going to ignore them?  No, we've got to go there too.  I actually counsel media companies that they should consider starting  entire products on Facebook.  Now that there's monetization there.  Yes, you're vulnerable to them, but that's the reality.  And what we need to negotiate back from Facebook and Google, and I've talked  about this with both companies and I'll keep on talking about with both of them  is to say we need user interest data back so we can build our own relationships.  However, however, and I've heard this from technologists.  Okay.  Jarvis, if we gave some data to your beloved newspaper people, they wouldn't  know what to do with it.  And in 99% of the cases that is true and it's a fair criticism.  So we have to build entirely new skill around creating products that are not  just one size fits all mass volume based things, but that are more targeted  people's communities and interests and needs as individuals and towns and such.  We then have to be able to get that data, analyze it and be able to act on it.  So we can actually give you not just targeted advertising, but also targeted  content so we can give you more things.  We've got to change our fundamental business model and culture.  And we can't just sit back and whine that, well, Facebook has people.  Yeah.  And why do they?  Because they created an entire architecture that treats people as  individuals, not as a mass.  Got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think it's about more than just, and I agree with you that we should be  negotiating and we should be getting something back, including data.  But I think it's about more than that.  One of the things that we talked about a news guys was that Facebook pretends and  you know, the comments I'm referring to.  Pretends that the algorithm just kind of behaves magically and, and, and you  effectively control it, which we know isn't true.  And they know if Facebook wants, if Facebook wants lots of news companies to effectively  shovel all their content onto Facebook, which the Washington Post is doing a  hundred percent of its content shows up on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's also part of the reason it became, it became number one over the New York  Times, a very smart tactic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  But if, if Facebook wants news companies to do that, it needs to do more than just  give them data about their readers.  It needs to, it has responsibilities as a news platform.  And I'm not, that's a discussion and I've had that discussion with executives there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And we need to have that conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Because the algorithm is effectively determining what news people see and what  they don't see, and there is no public information about that algorithm.  There's no way of knowing certain things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think, well, so, so what you're really asking for, wait a minute, Matthew,  what you're really asking for is for editors to be able to manipulate the  algorithm and that has happened in the past that has happened.  Well, I need to know what's in the algorithm so I can change my news so I  can get into that algorithm.  No, it's not what I'm asking for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm asking Facebook to publicly talk about its responsibilities.  Yes, that's a different question.  Yes.  I agree with that.  One of those responsibilities is that its algorithm controls what people see  and what they don't see.  And I'm not saying that they're evil.  I'm not saying that Mark Zuckerberg is trying to ruin journalism or trying to  change people's minds in some evil way.  I'm saying they have that effect even though lots of people don't know it.  I sat beside a woman on the way back from Phoenix, a woman who sells technology,  who's mature and well-informed.  And I said, do you know that Facebook filters your newsfeed?  No, I didn't know that.  What?  So something like 45 to 50 percent of people don't know that their feed is being filtered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But then, well, it's all over on the right column.  You can see everything that's there and they wouldn't want that.  And everybody knows that.  Let me agree with you, Matthew.  Let me try to agree with you for a second.  Let me try to agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not going to have to separate you guys, am I?  The other responsibility.  Don't make me pull this butt guest over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead.  Responsibility piece has another angle to it, which is that when trouble comes,  what does Facebook do?  What does Google do?  What does Twitter do?  Right.  So when a government comes and says, take that down, what's your responsibility?  And that's the discussion that you're referring to a discussion in the  Perugia Journalism Festival.  That's the discussion that our fellow journalism professor was asking for.  And that's a discussion that indeed does need to be held.  And I've said this to them afterwards, that we need to be able to have that  discussion to say that whether they like it or not, and I wrote a long piece  about this some time ago, whether they like it or not, Facebook is in the  position of being a primary distributor of news.  And with that comes responsibility.  It's not just about all the mysterious algorithm.  It's also about the decisions they make in terms of the algorithm.  I'm still going to disagree with you there to the extent that yes, there's a filter.  No, people don't want everything.  When Facebook did put up with the Washington Post and the Guardian, a news  thing where the newspapers did control stuff, every single reader complained  they were being spammed by the damn newspapers because again, it didn't have  any relevance to them.  So it's not an evil thing.  It's not a bad thing that Facebook tries to find some relevance.  I argue indeed that's exactly what news organizations should be copying and  figuring out how to do themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not saying it's bad.  I'm saying they need to admit what they are doing and talk about the effects.  They don't.  They don't talk about what you just finished saying.  They don't talk about when they take things down.  They don't talk about why they take them down.  That's not what...  They don't provide information.  Look at what Google and Twitter...  That's it.  Just let me finish.  No, you just said two different things, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One thing is when the algorithm filters and tries to give you what is most  relevant to you, that's the automated piece.  The second piece is if they choose manually to take something down because  the government, let's say, came after them, that's a different question.  They're both important questions, but they're different questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They are different questions.  But the...  And so the one that I think is the most important, I think the algorithm and  talking about how it works is also important.  So what does that get you?  The other one...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, stay right there.  Stay right there.  What does that get you then?  So they say, okay, we favor this and not that.  What's every newspaper going to do?  They're going to go and try to manipulate their feeds to try to just get more  volume for the users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not talking about details about how the algorithm functions.  I'm talking about...  You know how the algorithm functions.  What is it you want to know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, wait, wait.  Tell me what is it you want to know about the algorithm.  The algorithm does function.  Tell me what you want to know.  The algorithm does function.  Tell me what you want to know.  What is it you feel you don't know about how a personalization algorithm works that  you feel you need to know?  I'm serious.  What do you want to know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but I don't know.  It's what users don't know.  I know lots of things about Facebook that apparently regular people don't know.  So even I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know why it's only showing one in three articles that my mom  posts or why it's decided not to do the story about this where it does do the  story about that.  No one knows that, right?  It's very complex.  But that's like the Google algorithm, right?  That's proprietary.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'm not saying they have to publicize all the entire way the algorithm functions.  I'm saying they have to talk about how that works and why maybe you're not seeing  Beirut news when it happens, but you saw Paris news.  I think people don't know that.  They don't know.  I'm not talking about the specifics of the algorithm.  I'm talking about that there is an algorithm and that they control it.  Instead of saying, we're just showing you what you want to see.  I think that's self-evident.  It's very vague.  And that's why Andy Mitchell got so much pushback because he was saying, well,  we're not showing you specific things.  You're choosing those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's the, here's the, let me give you a data point.  Where are you from?  We have a nice visitor in the audience.  Yeah.  Where are you from right now?  Yeah.  He's local guy.  He says, Oh, it's totally random, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, not even close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not even close.  But that, but that's your point, Matthew, which is most people don't even know  Facebook's doing anything at all.  I mean, I think people are starting to realize I'm not seeing everything,  but they don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, people get a filtered view of the world, but they are unaware that that's  occurring and thank you for it.  And some millennials get 60% of their news or something, or 60% of millennials  get a substantial proportion of their news from Facebook and they don't  realize that it's being filtered.  So that's one problem.  The other problem is when they do take down content, they don't talk about it  as much as say Twitter and Google do.  Twitter and Google provide a lot more information about what government  asked to have it taken down.  What specifically the government didn't like about it.  Twitter is very transparent about that.  And I give them credit for doing that.  Facebook just says, we took a bunch of stuff down.  Oh, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't tell us in the report.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they do a bunch of stuff that, that prisoners had posted in the  U S and never mentioned it.  They took down thousands of posts based on requests, presumably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't deny that.  Do you, Jeff, that Facebook is very artocratic in its choices?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think, for example, there are no breast policy.  Yes.  It's a perfect example.  No, no breastfeeding.  It's culturally insensitive in many, many parts of the world.  Right.  And it's their choice.  They can do that.  But I think it's, I think it's a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But, and don't you think that's a problem when, as Matthew points out, a  significant number of people get their news, not from the Washington Post,  New York Times, NBC, but from Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Both of you, there's a, there's a logical problem you have because what  you're trying to compare to is the idea when you had a news product in which  everything that an editor decided was in there was in there and by God, the  editor is in charge.  Sorry.  Over.  Right.  And it's over anyway, because no one goes to homepages anymore.  No one goes to see the package that is news put out by an editor anymore.  Homepage traffic to most news sites in America is hovering around  So the package is already gone.  You are seeing a small subset of the news that any one given publication  gives you based on a number of factors, including in the first, especially  friends recommendations.  So you blame your friends first for not giving you every story in the  Washington Post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and I think, so that's the question about if I don't see, I wrote a post  about this, if I don't see Beirut news in my feed, is that my fault because I  didn't click on certain things?  Is it my fault because I have dumb friends who didn't click on certain things?  Well, it's your fault for getting your news from Facebook.  That's his fault.  It is really.  For filtering the feed.  Right.  No, I mean, I think it's everyone's fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's incumbent on, if you want to, if this is something in your head, I want to  get a well-rounded news, there's never been a better time to do that than right now.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree.  And I think we do need to, we need to tell people that it's, they have a  responsibility.  Yeah, it is your responsibility.  But that, welcome.  This is the different message.  Facebook also has a responsibility.  If it is a big platform for news and it's trying to become an even bigger one, it's  incumbent on Facebook to behave in a certain way as a news platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, just so you know, Matthew, this is the same argument I've had about Google  with Jeff for ages that Google, because it is the search engine for the world, it  basically powers the internet, has a higher responsibility than just its own  business interests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think if Facebook takes down a page about refugees, you know, who, and  because they're just, those photos are disturbing, or they take down a page put  up by Syrian dissidents or something.  I think it is incumbent on them to talk about that they did it and why they did  it and to defend themselves.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you realize that that's never going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There is going to be a discussion.  I just put up a column I wrote about just this, Matthew, you and I have had this  discussion on the show before, so we've already been there.  And no, I think that there is an interest.  The problem is that it's a bit of a culture clash in terms of trying to go to  technology, because you just said, Matthew, they don't see them, even though  they call it newsfeed, they don't see their primary role on earth as to inform  the world with news.  Their primary goal is to connect people with each other, then with information,  and then with things that are engaging and interesting.  That's what they've said.  I've heard that from their mouths.  Right.  So, so news is part of that.  They now acknowledge, in fact, they acknowledge it, I think, in a lot of ways  better than Google, Google has only just now gotten news into the product and  engineering side of the company, not just the marketing side, whereas at Facebook,  they have interest targeting, they have instant articles, they have Notify, they  have all these products, they're working around news and they care about news.  Now, where you and I adamantly agree, where I've had this conversation with them  and I'll have it again and we should have it again and again and again, is to say  that there is a complex discussion about whether or not Facebook chose to become a  primary distributor of news, it is.  And then in a society, certain responsibilities either fall to them or  don't at their choice, but that's a discussion we need to have.  And you can't say that they're never going to have it because we just asked once or  twice and they're nervous about it because what happens when they try to have  it at all?  What happens?  Every damn journalist jumps down their throat.  That's the piece of the observer was the journalist just constantly complained.  They kind of don't know what to do about it.  And this, frankly, is what pissed off Larry Page and drove him away from news for  some time was the culture of our damn complaining industry.  We deal with different views here and we've got to respect each one and try to  figure out where we can build the bridges.  And that's why I think news guys is really important because it starts to do that.  And I think we need a similar thing with Facebook.  And I think that Facebook will be interested in doing that.  But we've got to figure out a way that can do that that lets them have a first,  most comfortable interaction with this rather than everybody jumping down their  throat, which is why they're being so silent these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All I'm saying is going back to your statement about Facebook cares about news  or shows that it cares about news.  I'm not convinced that it has shown that.  It's it's shown that it wants news.  It's shown that it cares about it's shown that it cares about news because.  We see that.  That's an exact.  All right.  Matthew.  It's.  Wait, wait.  OK, it's shown that it likes news and wants news because that encourages people  to engage, but it has not shown that it cares about how it delivers it, where it  delivers it and why it takes it down.  Who showed this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This guy takes down.  What do you mean takes down?  They're not taking down a bunch of news.  Number one, number two, Chris Cox is the head of Facebook and Chris Cox.  Yeah, they're taking it down.  They can breast the news stories.  They're taking things like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They can down pages that contain information that is important about social events.  Journalism, broadly speaking, not articles from the Washington Post or articles from  the New York Times, things that you and I know journalism is larger than that.  They take down things that could be a historical record of facts and information  about the world and they need to talk about why they do examples of things that you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  objecting to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the biggest example I can think of is Elliott Higgins has written about Syrian  dissident pages that were taken down by Facebook, pages that talked about attacks by  the government that contain crucial information about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I'm absolutely going to agree with you.  We should have we should have a forum where we can have that specific discussion.  And I think they have shown that they care about news, but they are they're right.  Disgrutient. There's the problem shown that they want it.  So all right. So wait a second.  So imagine you're a Facebook executive watching this right now and we're trying to  convince them to enter in this discussion.  I know somebody is going to say, oh, screw it.  Why should I bother?  We're wildly successful.  We don't really need them.  And that's what I know has happened at various technology companies, because that's  our constant attitude is looking down our noses at them saying, oh, you just don't  understand how to be important in society.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not looking down my nose at them.  I'm saying they have certain responsibilities.  Let's just say they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They didn't. If they want to play in this field, Jeff, you have to they have to  accept responsibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I absolutely agree with you.  I just put the link up to I wrote a long piece about that and arguing exactly where  and but what I'm saying is they they ended up kind of accidentally in the news  business. They didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it was kind of intentional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is now.  Well, at the beginning, they didn't want any of our news.  They wanted people's news, people's lives.  They wanted all that. That's what it was.  We the people used it to link to stuff and that works well for them or works well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, as Matthew said, it's it's it's financially beneficial.  It engages people. They stay on the site.  So Facebook says, good, we like this.  Let's do more of this. But here's your here's your here's the part in your article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does the answer this question?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does Facebook have a civil responsibility, a civic responsibility?  And they could say you summarize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They could say that they don't.  They could say, listen, we are here to convince, you know, get people dates.  That's what we're here for.  And the fact that you use it for news, not a lot.  We can't, as I say, that we can't expect them to fact check the news.  That's fine. A lot of other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They agree with if they agree with your statement of their responsibilities and duties,  then I am totally fine with having a relationship with Facebook.  But they have shown no sign that they agree with any of the things you said in that paragraph.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's where I disagree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have they shown that they care about what's factual and what's not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not their job.  Neither is it. You said it's part of the responsibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is so well, no, he says they shouldn't be expected to fact check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not. No, they can't be expected to do that.  Same as Google. Google. Let's go to Google.  Google has absolutely no responsibility to fact check the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they have a responsibility not to squelch any stories, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they stand up for political reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, apparently not always as much as they can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And when you challenge Facebook and when you challenge Facebook  about them filtering things and excluding certain things, they say  they throw up their hands and say, well, we don't do that.  You're doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Again, you're conflating two different things.  When something stays in the system, but what the feed doesn't show it to you,  that's the algorithm.  When they take down something and kill it, that's different.  Those are two different things.  If you don't see that Beirut story, they're related.  No, not necessarily related at all, because you may not.  They may leave the great story up, but you never see it  because you never otherwise care about news.  Now, that was the answer that Facebook gave.  It was a bad answer.  We agree about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there is, by the way, there is a higher responsibility  because Facebook runs the risk of being rejected as a news source  by anybody intelligent.  In fact, I think it's perilously close to that.  I think that that's actually happening.  And so maybe they don't care about that.  I don't know. But I think if you want to if you say, well,  we do want to be a news source, we recognize that we are.  Then they have a very high responsibility to make sure that they  they're not fudging the news.  Right. I agree with you.  They can't be held responsible for fact checking.  But they don't have to if the algorithm works right,  because you'll get all points of view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, let's put it another way.  Should they be responsible for news judgment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. But that's exactly what Matthew is saying they are doing,  which is they're pulling down articles they judge to be politically difficult.  Right. They are making that's a judgment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They are editing. They are editing your view of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the same.  I'm telling you, the same article Jeff and I have had for years over Google,  whether Google's making a judgment or it's just the algorithm.  Well, the algorithm absolutely is human beings.  Right. That's a judgment.  When you let an algorithm to wash your hands and say, hey, the computer did it.  I didn't do it is really irresponsible.  It's a complex discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The New York Times saying the guy who laid out the pages made the day.  It's not my fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The press, the presses did it.  They printed it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, now the New York Times, but if nobody comes to our story, well, we try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What if newspapers said, oh, we don't we don't choose what to show you.  We just show you what you want.  What you've already said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's another thing, by the way.  Yeah. Well, it's totally there already.  And if you go down that road, you get local television news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Total dereliction of duty. Right.  Like you've just basically given up any ethical responsibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think, though, Jeff's point, which which I do credit is  in in individual in in in individual niches,  you're going to have all sorts of errors that you can't correct for,  including things like choosing stories that the public wants to read  as opposed to ones don't.  But that the modern Internet gives the consumer of news  so many variety of choices that they can find every story.  And I think we're in actually, I think we're actually in a golden age of news.  I agree. I agree.  But the mistake would be to say, oh, well, Facebook is a you know,  that's if that's your only source for news, you're getting what you deserve.  Just as if Channel four were my only source for news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I totally agree. And people used to be in filter bubbles  when they only read one newspaper, when they only watched one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everything you said, Matthew, could apply to local television news,  which frankly is where most people get their news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's why we're in this mess we're in in this country  with a certain person leading the Republican.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not saying Facebook is the only one who has a responsibility.  I think we have a responsibility as parents, as citizens.  We have schools have a responsibility.  Journalism schools have a responsibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's not unfair to hold Facebook to a higher standard.  And I think we agree on that.  And Matthew, you know that after after that moment,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the Journalism Festival in Italy, which is going way back now,  when Facebook gave what I thought was a bad answer, we both agree about that.  The answer should have been these are important and difficult questions  that we need to have a discussion and let's figure out how to have that discussion.  But why should we agree?  That discussion is needed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they're never. But I'm telling you, there's no imperative for them  to say that, because just like Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, not if every newspaper is giving them 100 percent of their content already.  Why? They don't have to talk about anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This. But this is exactly the problem.  This is what I hear from my media people.  Oh, we're not even going to ask them because they'll say no.  Well, I'm going to go I'm going to be there next week.  You know, ask them, please ask them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to ask them, please ask them.  But frankly, they have a fiduciary responsibility to say no to you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because they're fair and ask before he gave him 100 percent of his content.  Did he say, could you talk about some of the ethical as far as their

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  responsibilities to the stakeholders, the shareholders?  And I think that the shareholders carry a little more weight than you do.  I'm sorry to say, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Same same when you're an NBC, Universal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree. That's why ultimately it's it's it has to come down to the individual  responsibility to seek out multiple sources.  Yes. And there's never been it's never been easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It has never been easier, but it's also never been harder.  I mean, it was easier when you could pick up two or three newspapers or magazines.  That didn't do it. I can see 100 sources in five minutes.  No, I know. Lots of people are overwhelmed by that amount of information.  That's why they go to Facebook in the first place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they they deserve it then. They should have it and keep it.  I mean, honestly, it's not Facebook's job to make sure we have an informed electorate.  I don't think that I think that's asking too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually think I'm a media walk and I'm bored by this discussion now.  Can we get to some technology? I want to play Dvorak now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's about time.  All right. Let's take a break.  We'll come back with other stuff like Google's mortgage shopping tool.  There's an interesting new business for Google.  Our show today brought to you by your friend, Matthew, the folks at FreshBooks.  FreshBooks is an amazing site for people who are kind of self-employed  or entrepreneurs or small businesses, because they do the thing that you don't want to do,  which is those invoices every month,  formatting, sending invoices, collecting receipts, tracking expenses,  following up with late pay clients, slow pay clients.  That's not your business.  That's not what you got into business to do, but it is, in fact, a huge part of your business.  You don't do that. You don't get paid. You don't get paid.  Baby doesn't get new shoes.  So the key is to find somebody who will help you do this.  This is a secret in business. I've discovered.  Do the stuff you're good at and find somebody to do,  somebody who is equally good at the stuff you don't want to do and have them do that.  FreshBooks is it.  They're the super simple cloud accounting solution that's giving thousands of freelancers just like you.  The tools to save time billing to get paid faster.

And when they say, how did you hear about a say this week in Google, if you would  start your 30 day free trial today, FreshBooks.com slash twig.  Tell them you heard it on this week in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They are pretty great.  And I'm not saying that just because Mike McDermott is a friend, but it's a great company.  And I love them.  I love their user support and their sort of customer services second to none.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think, you know, all our advertisers should be from Canada.  They're such nice people.  So Google, we knew this was coming.  It just took them a lot longer.  Remember when we had the story probably a year ago that one of somebody who worked  at Google had gotten a mortgage broker license, a realtor license.  Right.  Right.  Remember that?  Well, finally, yeah.  Finally, they've launched the mortgage shopping tool in California.  More states coming soon.  They apparently have been doing this in the UK for some time.  They partnered with the Zillow and lending tree.  It'll pull data from lenders on Zillow's mortgage marketplace.  So they don't have to go directly to lenders.  But I think it's our sense that Google will be paid cost per lead on this.  So this could be very low.  This is this is a profit center, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. But we're going to we're going to get I think we're going to get back into  the antitrust argument that Google's in with shopping applications in the UK, in the EU,  where they've gone with a vendor, which is smart in this case, Lending Tree.  But what are the other vendors going to say?  I can just predict it's going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the same. It's kind of like that conversation we just finished is that it's very hard  because because from a point of view of revenue, you want to do these things.  But you have it feels like a responsibility as Google to not muddy the waters here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just and I actually do believe that Google feels that.  Yeah, I don't.  I don't know that for a fact, but I think they do feel their size, you know, and they're  sort of the weight that they throw around in these markets that they that they do think  about that. Good. And for all I know, Facebook does, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's the fun. You know, isn't that funny?  Maybe maybe there's no reason, but I always get the feeling that Google cares more than  Facebook does. Maybe there's no there's no basis for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I would say and I've said this before, my concern is not that Facebook is evil.  And Mark Zuckerberg is a very nice guy.  Lots of people I know on Facebook are are very nice.  They're not trying to destroy anything or crush anything or take over anything.  My fear is that Facebook will accidentally destroy things and like like I like it.  You know, yeah, accidentally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tyrannosaurus Rex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It doesn't not God help me to bring up what we just had.  But so I think that our responsibility is to help educate them.  And as a teacher, we don't best accomplish that by starting off by beating them over the head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But let's say the elephant is coming elephant is coming for you and it's going to step on you.  Should you be educating the elephant?  I'm down here. I'm down here.  Should you be waving your arms and screaming?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We work in an odd little world.  We think we're just the most important thing in the world.  And, you know, in a lot of lives, we are not.  And there's a lot of other things to their businesses.  And so I think that we need to take a slightly friendly role to say, listen, these are important things.  You probably haven't thought of it this way.  And let's let's try to figure it out together.  And I think it's possible. But I'm an optimist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm mad at Google because instead of making something really cool, they made Google Glass.  Yeah, apparently, according to Time magazine, Google made a secret prototype  that works like the Star Trek communicator on your chest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Read about that a while ago, actually.  I think that's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they killed it.  They only and they killed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a circular device with a built in microphone and Bluetooth allowed to connect to a smartphone.  This actually was described to Time by Amit Singhal, who was in charge of search.  The concept was intended to test out how users might interact with voice search in new ways.  When you wear it on your chest, you tap it.  See, they're obviously geeks because that's like that's totally a Star Trek movie.  Tap your chest. Yeah.  And you talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But isn't that cool? Wouldn't you have it in the?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I wanted so bad. Singhal said that.  I've always wanted that pin.  You just ask it anything and it works.  That's why we were like, let's go prototype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And all it is, we could you could do that.  You could do that with a with an Arduino, because all it is is a Bluetooth.  All they did was build a Bluetooth link to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now it's an Amazon Echo on your chest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. You know, it's you know, it's funny.  My my daughter is a nurse in Hamilton and they have something very similar to that for inter  sort of nurse communication.  So they tap it. That's right.  They do. Yeah.  You can give commands so you can call something out.  And it actually you can you can turn on the humor setting.  And so it will respond to you,  you know, with, I don't know, Star Trek responses or things that are funny.  But they use a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google will be texting you if you wish with.  Holiday shopping deals, if you don't have Thanksgiving,  Matthew, how can you have Black Friday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cheaters. Yeah, we have all the shopping related  at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, what do they call it?  It's not the day after Thanksgiving.  It's just Friday. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Black Friday, Black Friday.  All right. That's what you guys call it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And you watch our TV.  So you're kind of stuck with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. We get them all anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You might as well just move your Thanksgiving and get it over with.  You realize that, of course, it's too close to Christmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know how you guys put up with that.  It's terrible if you have a college student

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because Henry's home for Thanksgiving in like two weeks.  It's going to have to fly him back again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if your family likes to have turkey for both  and you're not a fan of turkey, say you have to have it  like two weeks after you just finished.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just had your real agenda here, Matthew.  You don't like turkey. Turkey agenda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you could do a Christmas goose. True.  Canadian, Canadian, Canadian geese are quite delicious.  Yeah, goose is delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Canadian geese are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do we think of pie cake in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's I'm willing to try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am. I'm definitely willing to try it.  I think that one that one might work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is it, a pie and a cake in one?  It's pie inside cake.  So there's layers of me think about this, how this would work.  It's so you can go wrong.  From the New York Times caption for the picture,  is this the real life?  Is this just fantasy?  Lost in the land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you heard about the camel version of turducken?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, of course.  Somebody in the chat room keeps telling me about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like, that's pretty sure it's apocryphal.  I don't think that anyone has ever actually made it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's go look at the Wikipedia article.  Whole stuffed camel.  There's a picture of it.  Yeah.  Traditional Bedouin wedding dish like turducken.  By the way, the recipe is in cookbooks.  It's often treated with skepticism, according to Wikipedia.  Many think it might be an exaggeration of a less impressive culinary experience.  Snopes says that it is, in fact, a joke  because of instructions like skin, trim and clean the camel  once you get over the hump.  Ha ha ha.  You know, I couldn't resist that either.  Cook eggs.  Here's how it works.  Cook eggs, stuff eggs into fish.  Cook the fish, stuff the fish into cooked chickens.  Stuff the cooked chickens into a roasted sheep.  Stuff the roasted sheep into a whole camel.  Now cook to taste.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Serves one hundred and twenty five.  That's disgusting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the most disgusting thing I've ever heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think someone should do it.  Myth busters should have done it.  The first are going up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That, oh man.  Camels.  No cruelty to camels here.  Come on.  No camels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who cares about camels anyway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't like Facebook.  You don't like turkey.  You don't like camels, man.  Camels are cruel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Camels are among the meanest animals ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They spit.  They are pretty mean.  They'll spit.  Yeah.  I'd eat one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't it funny?  Isn't it weird what animals we will eat and not eat like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dogs and cats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's wrong with eating a dog or cat?  Eat other animals that size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've had horse.  It was pretty good.  Oof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was in Africa two weeks ago and ostrich was,  they were very proud of having us in ostrich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was it good?  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll try it anyway.  Ain't nothing but a bird.  Staky.  Pie cakin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've eaten insects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Three types of pie.  I don't want to hear that story.  Three types.  They were good.  Were they candied?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chocolate covered bees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I've had chocolate covered ants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're just crunchy.  It's like there's a nut in there.  You don't even know what's in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  An ant has formic acid.  The acid, it's hard to cut that flavor  no matter how much chocolate you put on the ant.  But if you get used to it, it's kind of nice  because it's the sweet with a nice bite of formic acid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, someone was telling me that they figure  in the future we'll all be eating bugs  because there just won't be enough regular food sources.  Cows use up so much land and their methane dispensers.  And bugs actually are pretty efficient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, we should eat lower on the food chain.  Pie cakin, according to the New York Times,  the Journal of Records, sorry, Jeff.  Pie cakin has existed in underground dessert eating circles  for some time.  But a recipe from pastry chefs at David Burke Fabric  in New York spent time this week on the daytime talk show  circuit spiced pound cake with layers of pecan pie  and pumpkin pie topped with upside down apple pie  slathered in cinnamon buttercream and edged in oat strudel.  I'm in.  Oh man, that is just a heart attack in a wedge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's almost dinner time here, so I'm getting hungry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh man, I'm going to Sugar Shock looking at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  But it would be worth a try, wouldn't it?  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's dessert turducken, my friends.  I'm real tempted to spatchcock my turkey this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought of that too, actually.  It's a great way to do chicken.  I don't see why it wouldn't be a good way to do turkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You remove the spine and then you flatten the turkey.  So it looks like roadkill.  And then it cooks evenly because it's flat.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a great way to do chicken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've done it.  Yeah.  It's like a brick chicken, brick chicken, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, like brick chicken, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which I love.  I really want to do it, but I think that the wrong time  to try a new recipe is Thanksgiving Day.  I'm just saying.  Agreed.  I probably don't want to be there tomorrow afternoon  saying, hey, I thought spatchcocking would work.  Let's do it.  I have been told though by an intrepid fan  who went across the street that Petaluma Markets  butchers will spatchcock for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It sounds illegal.  That's filthy.  What I want to know is what are the Elgans having?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah, let's all go over there.  I know Mike and Amira, man, I'm sure it's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Homemade cheese, I know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, homemade cheese, butter.  I've had some of her butter.  It's very good.  That sounds bad.  I've had some of Mike's wife's butter and it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cheese looks great.  Mozzarella looked amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Mike made a brie, right, or something like that.  There you go, spatchcocking your turkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pretty much unknown, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Google has a subscription to Black Friday Deals  and it was in a Google Plus post so no one saw it.  And so here you go if you want to get  the relevant holiday offers and updates.  See, forget circulars.  I've got texts from Google.  Holiday shopping is on the horizon to ease,  blah, blah, blah.  So, okay, here you go, folks.  I presume this is US only but maybe it's worldwide.  If you want Black Friday Deals,  text the word JOIN to 847-904-0608.  Is this Google itself, really?  Yeah.  For Cyber Monday, press 847-906-8958.  For holiday deals, this is the new circular,  847-904-0596.  The death knell of the newspapers.  There you go, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Turn out the lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What happens if you call that number?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Go ahead, I'll let you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jason will do it.  You got a phone there, Jason?  You got Larry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, this is Larry Page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, what can I do for you?  Leave a message.  I'm your new Santa Claus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm your new Santa Claus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  847-904-0608.  I'm sure you can text STOP to it  if you don't want any more.  They'll tell you what you can text.  So it tailors promotional messages to products  you're interested in.  Because remember, Google knows what you're interested in.  Knows what you've been looking for.  Knows if you've been naughty.  Ain't that Amazon.  Knows if you've been nice.  After subscribing, the phone number will remain private.  And of course, you can opt out at any time.  Let's say, for example, the consumer searches  for Black Friday deals and subscribes from the ad below.  It's ringing.  No, it's coming up as a weird number.  Yeah, because it's...  It's routing us to Germany.  Oh, great.  Oh, wait a minute, who posted this?  AdWords, okay.  All right, I'm gonna do it on my phone, what the heck.  But while I'm doing that, let's talk about something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I don't want to...  Will it show you the hard drive that you were shopping for  that you actually bought a week ago?  Will it continually show you that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, see, that's the problem with recommendation engines  is they're dumb.  Yeah.  But if anybody could do it right, it'd be Google, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It would be so...  The first thing that's so simple to fix  is just put a frequency cap on those damn ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, like if you've seen it 15 times.  But everybody who does advertising knows  that there is a correct number of impressions  beyond which you do not want to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's branding advertising.  This is commerce advertising, which costs almost nothing.  So they say, let's harass them.  Oh, I get it.  So the networks should have...  This is one of the discussions we had at Newsgeist is,  and I'm gonna do an event on this at CUNY,  is we need to start setting advertising quality standards.  But this is the beginning of this from Google AMP  that actually does set some irritation standards.  And the Interactive Advertising Bureau does it.  But you need to go farther with things like  how these ads behave, what data they gather,  how they act on it.  We've got to...  If we publishers don't start improving this,  the advertisers never will.  You know what, Leo?  If I go to the AdWords account on Google+,  I don't see that post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you think it's fake?  Just making sure here.  Do you think I'm gonna spend a lot of money on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why would someone fake something so boring?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because maybe...  You got your device?  No, if I click it, it's...  Oh, oh, it is fake.  Look how Google is spelled.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.  Oh, man.  Oh.  It's fake.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where is it hosted?  Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh.  It has 2.5 million followers.  That pisses me off.  It's got five times the number of followers I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this on Google+.  Yeah.  Wow.  That seems...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That they're impersonating AdWords.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that sounds...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it?  I mean, it's got three O's in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know, but I'm not finding it.  If I try to go...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's got three O's in it.  That's not Google.  If you go to the top...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's got 2.5 million followers and it's called AdWords.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the hell out of me.  Go back to that post.  How can they even allow that?  Go back to that post?  Okay, okay.  What's the URL?  What do you mean the URL?  Should I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does the URL have an account name in it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  It says, plus Google Ads.  Yes, plus Google Ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  Well, that should be it.  Yeah, okay.  Maybe I'm wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why would Google be spelled with three O's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe I'm wrong.  I don't know.  Well, there's...  I think they got plus Google Ads.  I think...  Let's report this guy.  I don't know.  And by the way, this article comes from Search Engine Land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and long distance charges apply, right?  You called Germany.  There's going to be people getting charged for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The only thing I'm saying is,  I can't find the post on my own.  I just don't know what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Search for plus Google Ads.  It's not called AdWords.  I don't know how you do that, but somehow...  I'm there.  I don't see it.  Well, I do.  That seems sketchy at best.  It's an old post.  How old?  Oh, how old?  Two weeks ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, okay.  So maybe that's it.  All right.  I'm going to do it anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Call Germany?  No, I'm not going to call him.  I'm going to text him.  How expensive could that be?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's all the text you're going to get in reply.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And can you put up the numbers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, not now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you show the page?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, go ahead, show it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just checking, because I'm looking at the search engine

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  last year. 847.  They're all 847 area code.  Who's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where's that?  Yeah, those are the right numbers.  Because Search Engine Land wrote about it.  Yeah, but maybe they were fooled like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I found it.  Maybe they were fooled like we were.  Oh, I got it.  November 10th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they talked to Google about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe all right.  Maybe all right.  I'm panicked.  But why are there three O's in the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because Google spells with three O's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe that's how you spell it in Blerminey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and the Search Engine Land article  links to that Google Plus post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, that's how I got there.  I followed the post.  I think it's all right.  You think it's all right?  Otherwise we're going to have to edit this entire section  out of the podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not seeing the Google with three O's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to click AdWords.  And then it takes you to their thing.  And then below it, there's the Google.  You can show that.  That's okay, Jason, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this looks legit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it probably is.  All I said was I couldn't find the post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By what definition of legit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the three O's is odd.  I don't get that at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apparently I don't know how to use Hangouts.  I'm having a hard time.  I don't understand how Hangouts works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And all the links are Google links,  google.com slash AdWords.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so it's real.  See, I wouldn't lie to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought we had a juicy scandal going there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's my Google circles.  I spelled it wrong.  Oh, it's my fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really?  Oh, that's hilarious.  Yeah.  That's hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got Google errors.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There it is, three O's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's me.  That's hilarious.  Okay, now we're really editing it out.  Apparently I've already been,  I was following them all along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In my Google circle.  Stop laughing at me.  All right.  Don't judge me.  I did that on purpose  because I thought that was funny.  Google.  So apparently not only do I not know how to use Hangouts,  I don't know how to use Google+.  No wonder only half a million people follow me.  Or how to spell.  I'm an idiot.  I'm an idiot.  Good news.  If you use Android Pay this month,  you'll be helping Google donate up to a million dollars  toward education.  This is a smart.  This is the kind of thing that works.  It's a win-win.  Google obviously wants people to start using Google Pay  because there's kind of a hurdle.  The first time you use a tap to pay solution,  it's the first time it's a little scary.  Will they laugh at me?  Will they think I misspelled Google in my spare time?  Will the clerk look at me  like I'm trying to steal this candy bar?  So here they go.  They say, look, if you use Android Pay,  we're gonna donate a dollar  to a different organizations up to a million dollars.  Each time an Android Pay purchase is made  through the end of the year,  Google will donate $1 to DonorsChoose.  Or I guess DonorsChoose is supporting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  DonorsChoose is a great charity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a good charity  and it will help the children in the US education system  with special needs.  And it will double the donation of two bucks  if you do it on Black Friday.  So call 847-908.  Call or text?  No, I'm just, I'm joking.  That was the other.  Google has three O's.  Did you know that?  People commonly think it only has two.  We've misspelled it.  Changed it.  Yeah, they changed it.  We gotta put another O in there, would you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Bum ba dum bum bum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a little weird when you outsmart yourself.  I'm such an idiot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  LG canceled the Urbane.  Ooh, yeah.  Second edition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it was actually for sale for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know, 18, you could go to AT&T store and get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was it like instant cancer on your wrist?  I mean, what the heck?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unexpected complex hardware issue.  Oops.  It didn't work.  It's a big fat oops.  It didn't work.  Yeah, they got AT&T.  I think T-Mobile or maybe Sprint, they got,  cause this was the Urbane second edition  that had LTE built in.  I have the first edition Urbane.  Actually kind of like it's a nice Android Wear watch.  And this one was gonna have a phone number, a SIM card.  You still have to have a phone,  but you didn't have to always have it with the phone  and it could take and receive phone calls and so forth.  They decided to cancel the rollout of the Urbane  second edition due to a complicated nature  of the hardware issue,  which affected the day-to-day functionality.  Whether the device, this is from LG,  whether the device will be available in the future  will be decided at a later time.  Sounds like no.  That's gotta be a huge hit.  Get that close.  A week from ship date or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or wasn't in the market yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could go, I think you could go and get it,  but you don't know if you'd get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cause that's what I was wondering,  does anybody actually have it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  Does anybody have one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hmm.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it a big deal that YouTube is going to go to the  ropes and defend video makers who are-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that is a big deal actually.  Issued with takedowns.  I think it's interesting that they're doing that.  And I'm in favor of it.  I mean, the more help that those types of creators can get,  there's lots of fake DMCA takedowns  or sort of denials of service based on DMCA takedowns  that have no merit.  So it's nice to see somebody with a little bit of  weight sort of standing up for that kind of thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're not actually going to go to court for you,  but they'll help fund your fight.  It'll pick up the legal costs of a small number,  not a lot of video creators,  that the company thinks are targets of unfair takedown  demands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cause typically what happens is they just,  they file so many and Google's required by safe harbor  clause, they have to take it down.  And so stuff gets taken down all the time  and there's no merit to those DMCA takedowns at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo, can you find the original post?  Because it had some really interesting comments  underneath it, whatever the blog was.  The original Google post?  Yeah.  Okay.  and I can't find it, it said that there are some other  things that you can do Google.  For example, I think one thing is that if a takedown  notice comes, the money never gets back to the person,  even if they win the takedown notice.  As I recall, there were a few other things that they say,  thanks Google, this is nice, but there's a few other things  you could do that would just really change.  Because what's happening is people are obviously gaming  this terribly, oh the other one is a three strikes problem.  So what happens is a company uses three different entities  owned by the same company.  File three complaints to get this person  and there are three strikes right there and down  and then the money doesn't flow to them.  And then even if they win, they've gone through this whole  McGill and they don't get the money back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So as an example, this UFO theater, which is a channel  dedicated to debunking sightings of UFOs,  only has a thousand subscribers.  He takes the fake UFO footage and posts it and debunks it.  And he's getting takedown notices from the original  creators of those phony videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's absolutely fair comment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's what Google's saying.  They're gonna particularly focus on fair use  for commentary or news, which is by the way,  how we use stuff as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well and Google itself has benefited from fair use.  I mean the whole Google Books ruling was based on  the idea that Google Book scanning is effectively  fair use and benefits society.  So it's nice to see them giving back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's only four creators right now.  I would love to see this expanded though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just put that post on the rundown.  Okay.  Because it says, if you look at Mike,  this is a great start, however,  a far more effective change would be to remove  the immediate monetary reward for a false claim.  As it stands now, the instant the claim is made,  all ad money is diverted to the claimant  and is never recoverable by the creator.  I had no idea this was the case.  This is further compounded by the fact that appeals  go to the claimant, not a third party.  Hey, you said that I wasn't, that I was not legit.  Yeah, I wanna appeal that.  I still say you're not legit.  And I keep the money.  So there's a moral hazard, there's a gaming problem here  that's bad.  A simple change would be once a claim is made  against a video to hold escrow, all revenue until  the dispute is resolved or one party fails to respond  in a given time.  Last, a strike should not be issued while a DMCA  counter notice is pending.  It is far too easy in the current system for a claimant  to make multiple claims at once and carpet bomb a channel  to three strikes.  I personally have been hit by Nintendo at least three times  of strikes on multiple videos at once  because Nintendo uses multiple accounts.  Really smart stuff there.  And I had no idea this was the case.  And the comments back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't know about the revenue part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't either.  And so I'd take Mike and his word here, whoever Mike is.  But the others in the comments kind of said,  yeah, what Mike says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Update on that LG LTE watch issue,  according to the Telegraph, an LG rep told them,  for competitive and supplier relations reasons,  we can't communicate the specifics.  However, we can share the hardware issue is related  to a new advanced component we had incorporated  into the device that had never been used in LG wearable  device before during aggressive testing over thousands  of hours, it was revealed that the component failed  to meet our quality standards and could potentially impact  our image quality over the life of the device.  So it's some display thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Screen probably, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Too bad, it looked nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was gonna be the first smartwatch to use a 480  by 480 display, which would OLED display,  which means it would be 490 pixels an inch,  very high res display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So.  And eventually battery life between that  and having to have a cell in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's pretty good, but yeah, I think the cells,  the radio is a bigger issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Plus, I use phones all the time,  I'm not paranoid about the radiation.  However, wearing an antenna at all, a radio all the time,  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google has-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have it in my pocket, but I guess it's not much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  According to a search engine land, Google has received  more than 65 million takedown requests in a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, like 2 million a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jesus.  That's a denial of service attack.  The week of November 19th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The week of November 19th, they got 15.6 million  takedown requests based on copyright infringement.  Look at the graph, it's only going up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, this isn't right to be forgotten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh no, this is-  This is copyright, this is DMCA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hollywood!  Hollywood!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or anybody, that's the problem.  Sorry, don't give me, Europeans all come after me  and say, you're in the middle of Europe, stop one place.  Okay, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's Hollywood this time, it's us.  We actually don't know what it is.  They received 60, in the last month,  65 million URL copyright removal requests  for 72,000 different domains  from a mere 5,492 copyright owners.  So, less than 6,000 people spawned  65 million takedown requests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, previous discussion about YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a lot of lawyers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That means 1,000 a month per copyright holder.  No, 10,000 a month.  What the what?  That's more than 10,000 a month  from each individual copyright holder.  That means they have automated tools too, right?  They're going and-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The responsibility was put on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No disincentive.  Right, why not?  There's no disincentive descending a million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why not, right?  That's why-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Might as well.  Yeah, maybe that's what's heard is-  There needs to be a penalty for false.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there really, there should be a slap,  some sort of slap penalty.  That's what they call it when the slap laws protect you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember in the old days of dial-up modems,  and I ran a sniffer that would see  if anybody was trying to get into my network.  And the number one thing that used to happen  was called an ICOMP Unreachable Storm, ICMP,  and would just basically flood your computer  with requests to respond.  It was like, hey, are you there?  Are you there?  That's a ping, yeah.  Too many pings.  Eventually your computer would become non-functional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, hello.  Hello.  Hello.  It's a SYN flood too, same thing for a website.  Same exact idea.  Let me see, I'm just looking.  See, make sure I got everything in here.  Mark Zuckerberg's gonna take two months off  when the baby comes, good for him.  Good for him.  He's gonna teach him how to hunt elk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The other one, I probably don't wanna say it on here.  It was the story of the fake name.  Fook that beesh.  Oh, that.  You just knew.  I just, I looked at it and I thought,  should I share this?  No, no, this is too good to be true.  Well, it's an interesting story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So he claims that's his real name.  It's a Vietnamese name, sort of.  No, it's a hoax.  It's a hoax, isn't it?  No, no, he's gonna get to that.  Yeah, yeah, it's a hoax.  He's gonna start us out.  Yeah, we knew it was.  Yeah, but it was so obvious.  But boy, it's probably, I agree.  Even the Dr. Driver's license,  it was so obviously Photoshopped.  The fonts didn't match.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fonts didn't match, exactly.  And look at all the places that shared that story.  All this sort of allegedly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, all you have to do is look at the Paris attacks  to see how fevered the need to get clicks is  and the need to speculate.  Of course, you know that CNN's gonna fill 20 hours,  or I guess now it's more like 100 hours  of empty coverage with speculation.  What else are they gonna say?  They don't have any information.  But what really saddens me is the number of good journalists  who reported things like, oh, PlayStation 4 was used.  Or, oh, the terrorists were using Telegram.  No, they weren't.  I kind of fell for it, although I was a little suspicious  of the Wired story about the operational communications  and operational security manual  the folks at West Point found.  I didn't see that one.  They claimed, well, I'll get it for you and we'll show you.  Ops say, supposedly, ISIS's OPSSEC manual.  The security manual reveals the OPSSEC advice  ISIS gives to recruits.  And the story came from West Point,  where apparently they have a security research.  Even when I talked about this story on Sunday on Twitter,  I said, I would like to know the provenance of this manual.  Was this not true?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was not a real manual?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a real manual.  Oh no, it was a real manual created by,  what was it, an Irish company?  It was not created by, this comes from,  the researchers came from the,  this is actually a giveaway,  Combating Terrorism Center at West Point.  That's real, by the way,  but I think maybe they have an investment in this.  The guide was originally written a year ago  by a Kuwaiti security firm, Cyberkov,  for, get this, journalists and political activists in Gaza  on how to protect their identities  and the identity of their sources.  But ISIS has co-opted it.  Well, I'd like to know, I'd like to hear about that.  It also turns out ISIS doesn't have 24 hour help desks,  never did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, let's remember that they, I mean,  a lot of the people working for this movement  are fairly sophisticated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They may be disinformation, they're fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They left a Syrian passport that appears to be fake,  because they were trying to shift blame.  They've thought this stuff through.  They're really good.  Came up with it on the spur of the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat room says,  I don't think ISIS has a PR department.  Oh, yes, they do.  Oh, they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, in fact, if you look at the vice interviews  with ISIS on scene,  the interviews are all with the guy who does their PR.  Yeah, they literally have.  They're very good at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, not only that, but they're very good at social media.  They're very good at manipulating,  obviously manipulating the press.  So calm down, everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you're right, it comes out of this desire for,  it's a business model problem.  I want more volume, more traffic.  Maybe, I'm even willing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's part of it.  I'm not sure that's all of it, though.  I mean, I know that's even watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But we're motivated to go for media traffic.  The most ridiculous example I've heard,  The Daily Beast, I don't know if you saw this,  briefly turned the Chicago shooting tape yesterday  into an animated GIF.  Oh, Lord.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What reflex makes you do that?  Yeah, well, you want clicks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You want clicks.  Yeah, exactly, exactly.  Actually, I think you can even defend it.  Well, this is a good way to get this onto Twitter  and get more people to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's the worst sort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think that the media's desire to cover this security  and ISIS and all this stuff  is not necessarily purely financial.  I think there's a drive to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I also think, if you look at the...  Just look at your Twitter feed.  I looked at my Twitter feed.  There were lots of journalists sharing things  that had not been verified  because there was a lot of breaking news happening.  Not a lot of people knew what was going on.  There wasn't anybody inside the Bataclan and so on.  So you have all the things that used to happen  in a newsroom before a story was published  is now happening out in the open in front of everyone.  And a lot of it is wrong.  And a lot of it is chaos.  And a lot of it is just sort of,  people are passing things on  because they are trying to help.  And yet in many ways they're not helping  because they're not checking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I wanna really hold ourselves to a higher standard,  at least with technology stuff.  Because one of the reasons reporters get that stuff wrong  is because they don't understand or they don't...  I mean, they're in a foreign area for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there are some groups out there  that are doing excellent work.  Storyful is one of them.  Doing sort of real-time fact-checking.  Amazing stuff.  Yeah, and that's, I do everything I can  to try and pass those tweets and messages on  when they say something is fake  or something hasn't been verified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Another team of researchers at work.  That is, by the way, the new authorities say  four out of five doctors.  Researchers.  Team of researchers is the new...  Well, must be true.  Team of researchers did a teardown  of Google's Nest camera and discovered  that even if you turn it off, it's still working.  They examined the security cam's power consumption,  including that when the Nest cam is turned off  via the app, the LED light goes off,  but the device continues to draw 340 milliamps.  But it doesn't still transmit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  It's just a sleep mode.  It may be doing that so it's an instant on.  Many of your devices went off, still draw power,  because when you turn them on,  you won't curse them for taking too long to come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so there you go.  There's the intelligent response  to the link bait headline from Gizmodo.  Yeah.  Yeah, it doesn't turn off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's technically true.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is technically true.  Doesn't mean it's watching you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Surprised they didn't have a big brother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They kind of did.  They had, here, I'll show you the,  they had a picture of the Nest staring at me  with a little light on, like, we're watching.  We're Google and we like to watch.  Like Chauncey the Gardener, I like to watch.  All right, let's take a break.  Did you guys?  Go ahead, yes.  Bring up something new, because I have run out of stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you guys already talk about the app search thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we did last week.  It had just been announced last week,  but so we didn't really fully,  and I don't know if we do now yet,  fully understand what Google's doing.  The idea is when you do a search,  let's say for hotels in Cambridge,  it will not only give you traditional website links,  but it will search within apps like Hotels Tonight  to find your content.  Even if you don't have the app.  You don't have to have the app.  I think that's fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they've got, basically, virtual machines running  every app you can think of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's what we were trying to figure out,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  is how do they do this?  The ones that consent to it, by the way, importantly.  The ones that consent.  But it's in their interest to consent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it shows you effectively,  this is actually probably pretty good marketing  for those apps, too.  Yeah, exactly.  Let's say I got a search result  and it comes from Hotels Tonight,  and I'm like, oh, that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The analogy I use, I wish they'd do it with podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good idea.  Yeah. Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's two parts to it, though.  So first off, the content that is accessible  within the app is exposed to search.  So you can search on something that is, in fact, in an app.  That's a big deal.  It would be like the content of a podcast  and all of our blathering words to be searchable  and discoverable through search.  Then, once you discover it, if you don't have the app,  then they needed the way to display that content to you  by mimicking the app.  And so both things, I think, are very important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think it's a fantastic...  Oh, I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's also a solution for the problem,  and we talked about this in News Guys, Matthew,  about paid content.  You have places built, Shreyer Publications,  Washington Post, New York Times, whoever.  Some of these publications complain  that their content doesn't come up in search  or in Google News because it's too little clicked on  by enough people because it's paid,  and so it's behind a wall.  So if you could expose it up, number one,  and then number two, say, listen,  I know Matthew subscribes to that paper.  I'll go ahead and expose that content to him  because he's already shown he likes it,  and then he can get a wormhole to it.  This kind of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Would a German newspaper that has a paywall  allow Google to go inside its app and show content?  It has to be by permission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, in fact, they're begging for it.  Oh, interesting, really.  Yes, for just this reason.  They're saying you should be exposing our content,  especially to our own users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I beg on behalf of the podcast industry,  which, by the way, is going through  a big renaissance right now, Google.  Have you heard?  I've heard that.  It's huge, it's huge.  So just a little plug, I mean, if you,  it would be easy to do.  There's automated systems that can listen  to the podcast, transcribe it, add it to your search index.  All you have to do is have a little,  put it in the search result, have a little player there,  press play, you don't even have to do video for us,  just audio would be fine.  Just saying.  It's a great idea.  The podcast revolution, you could be a big helper there.  They're already doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you had that conversation with anybody up there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know anybody up there.  I think I know anybody.  I stay here in my little hovel.  We're gonna take a break.  When we come back, picks, tips, anything,  numbers you wanna share, we would love that.  Our show today brought to you by Blue Apron.  I love cooking.  Cooking is an art.  Cooking is a creative art that is satisfying  because after you create your work of art,  and you'll know this tomorrow,  anybody's making Thanksgiving,  the people you love the most sit down,  they're nourished by it, you're giving them pleasure,  you're giving them, you're really giving them your love.  It's so great.  It's such a wonderful thing to do.  And yet we all work hard, and who has time to plan a meal  and then shop for the meal?  It's enough just to cook the meals.  That's where Blue Apron comes in.  They do all the planning.  They do all the shopping.  You get home right there on your doorstep,  your beautiful refrigerated Blue Apron box  with delicious, fresh, perfect ingredients  from local farms, fresh meats and fish, never frozen,  and a card in there, recipe card in there  that tells you exactly how to make it.  Recipes you probably never even thought of making,  and it takes about half an hour to 45 minutes to make these,  even if you've never cooked before.  In fact, one of the great things about it is  you're going to learn to cook in effect.  You can totally do this.  If you can follow instructions, you can totally do this.  And it's so satisfying.  These meals, people go, what did you do?  This is amazing.  You can get meals for two,  great way to impress that special person in your life,  more meals for a whole family.  Can you go, Jason, if you'd go to today's  blueapron.com slash twit,  I just want to see what the menu is for this week,  because they change it all the time.  No matter what your dietary preference is,  they can get you a dish that's perfect for you.  They arrange the deliveries.  There you go.  Let's see, we got chili rubbed steaks.  With, what is that?  Quick kimchi.  I've never made kimchi or cooked with it.  And tomato rice, doesn't that look fabulous?  And then once you do this, you're going to know how to do it.  By the way, you'll never get a repeat,  so don't worry that you're going to get the same recipe  over and over and over again.  You learn, it's a little cooking school in a box.  And it's so good.  Creamy sweet potato and kale casserole  with spiced coconut, bechamel, and ginger.  I'm going to cry.  Crispy tofu drunken noodles with bell pepper and Thai basil.  Those are a couple of the vegetarian choices right there.  Or chicken meatballs, look at that one.  What is that? Zoom in on that.  With braised-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, doesn't that look good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Little braised kale there and spiced.  What is that?  Celeriac mash.  Isn't celeriac like, what is that?  Celery root, right?  Never even heard of it.  That's the thing, you're going to use ingredients  that you've never even heard of.  And you're going to say, that is, there it is, celeriac.  That, you're going to say, that is great,  I'm using that again.  Purple potatoes, farro, watermelon, radishes.  I found a bok choy, a new kind of bok choy  I'd never had before that's so much better  than the bok choy I've ever had before.  That's all I use now.  You're going to love it.  Between five to 700 calories a portion  and get this less than $10 a meal.  Blueapron.com slash twit, your first two meals are free.  Blueapron.com slash twit.  Fresh ingredients, great recipes  delivered right to your door.  Love it.  I'm cooking tomorrow, I'm really, it's funny,  it's not a chore, I'm so excited.  I did the shopping yesterday,  going to pick up the turkey right after the show.  And I just, I'm so excited.  Anybody have any picks or anything, Matthew,  something you're excited about these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, I have something that's kind of interesting  since we're talking about search.  I just wrote about it, was it yesterday?  I forget now.  But I don't know if you remember Michael Robertson.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, he has a new thing, he sent me a note, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's called On Radio,  and it's basically a radio search engine,  which is fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was the founder of MP3.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  MP3.com and then MP3 Tunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Got sued out of existence by the music industry.  It was horrible, not only they sue him  to the point where he couldn't make money,  then they bought the company at pennies on the dollar.  They're just horrible people,  and he's a great guy, I really like him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he created Linspire,  which was originally called Lindo's.  So On Radio basically built a crawler  that indexes what's playing  on 100,000 different radio stations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  Just so you know, folks, it's onrad.io.  I-O, yeah, yeah, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I-O, who owns that domain, I wonder?  So it's, I tried it out.  It's pretty interesting.  He said the problem with radio is discovery.  You just don't know what's playing where.  So your favorite station maybe that you go and check out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Adele is not gonna like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can find a song playing on any radio station  just about anywhere and just click and play it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So like the Adele album,  which she won't let on streaming music services,  well, of course, radio's playing it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There she is, Adele.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, I love Adele.  I wish she'd find a good man though  so she could stop writing breakup songs.  She can sing.  She can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's actually a link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, NBC's taken it down.  They have taken it down, yeah.  To her dry vocals from Saturday Night Live, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So good.  You should check out the one,  she did a version with Jimmy Fallon.  Yeah, that's a good one too with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're all playing toys.  Yeah, they do that little thing  and they don't put that on the, you know what's interesting?  We were watching Adele's appearance on Fallon  and it's not on that.  That's something they do later.  For the web.  The roots get together in the dressing room.  They all have children's instruments, school instruments.  And the first one I saw was Carly Rae Jepsen,  Call Me Maybe.  It was so good.  It made me love the song.  There was one Alan Thicke's son, Robin.  Little Robin.  His big hit, I can't remember the name of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It looks like they're sitting in a closet.  Yeah, it's basically 12 of them in a closet.  It's awesome.  Little toys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and by the way, she knocks it out of the park  on that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, not easy to do when the guy next to you  is shaking a plastic banana rattle.  But she gives it her all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's a hack of a singer.  So anyway, on radio, I thought it was interesting.  Anything Michael does is interesting.  He just seems to have like 100 ideas like this  that he's always working on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  He's an interesting story.  We had him on triangulation.  Gosh, he's been so close so many times.  He keeps doing it with music.  It's like the record industry just slaps him down  and he does something else.  And then he's, and then Lindos, and he gets sued for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like the Energizer Bunny though.  Yeah, he doesn't stop.  The guy who never stops.  This is a really good idea.  So I mentioned in the, down at the bottom of the post,  we talked a bit about the Google Books ruling  because Google Books ruling effectively says  Google scanned all these millions of books,  which technically is a huge infringement of copyright.  But the court ruled that the sort of social value  of doing that outweighed the infringement.  And I was wondering what if the MP3 case was heard now?  It's one of the key parts of the case was  the feature that called Beam It that allowed you to say,  I have this CD and then listen to all those songs  from the cloud because he had ripped a whole bunch of CDs,  which is not that different from what Google did  with Google Books, except it was 10 years ago or whatever.  And the way people looked at fair use and copyright  was very different.  I wonder what would have happened if that case happened now.  Good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On our, onrad.io.  And of course these are all internet,  I mean they're real radio stations,  but they're internet radio stations,  internet versions of them, is that right?  So what's good about that is that these radio stations  do pay their ASCAP BMI fees.  There are royalties being paid.  This is not some sort of free riding thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But as you pointed out with Adele,  the same reason she shows up in Pandora  is the same reason that she shows up here  because radio has a compulsory license.  So they get to play whatever they want.  They play anything they want.  Because it's non-interactive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what's sad about that is that the ASCAP BMI fees  benefit the publishing right, they're for publishing rights.  The writer, not the artist.  They're not mechanicals.  Although doesn't she write all her own songs?  I believe she co-writes them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know that she writes them all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She probably co-writes them so she gets paid.  And actually an interesting,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was just looking at this the other day.  This is sort of related, but Zoe Keating,  who's a Canadian musician.  Cellist, yeah.  Yeah, cellist.  And there was another artist who I'm trying to remember.  We're talking about using the blockchain  as a way of effectively connecting artists to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a great idea.  Who was the other artist?  Just today, just this week I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's a fascinating idea  because the blockchain can effectively track  exactly where tracks are.  It can build in payment.  Imogen Heap.  Oh, I love Imogen Heap.  Yeah, she's great.  So she's a signed artist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She doesn't have a label anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Talking about releasing her own album  using basically blockchain to have people pay for it.  And I think one of the things she talked about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've actually already done it.  Imogen Heap launched her new song,  Tiny Human on blockchain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is pretty recently.  Oh, no, it was this week.  Yeah, a panel that she was on  along with Rob Thomas and Zoe Keating.  They talked about this and she's already put some songs out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's got a lot of potential, I think,  to sort of to allow musicians to sort of customize  the experience a little bit more.  She was talking about how,  what if she wanted to make it free  just for certain, like one day,  or what if she wanted to make it free for specific people?  She totally control it.  Right, she would control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Explain to me how this,  how does this put a layer between you and just the download?  Is it because it's a contract and you,  so I'm trying to get my head on the details of how it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't looked at the details,  but I assume she's got a blockchain,  Bitcoin sort of intermediary.  And so then you would buy her album using their wallet  or connecting it to your Bitcoin wallet.  I mean, it technically feels like-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bitcoin really wouldn't be required here.  What blockchain essentially is,  is a highly distributed database that's open to all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And an automatic contract structure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, it can be used for,  in fact, it can be used that way.  It can be used for legal contracts.  So if you're selling music,  what it is is it's essentially you could create a music store  using blockchain technology that you would control  who can get the music.  There would be some transaction of some,  financial transaction, Bitcoin would be natural,  but it wouldn't have to be, could be credit card.  But at some point-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I suppose theoretically someone could take that  once they had paid for it and burn it to a CD or-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I would guess at that point,  it's attached to your identifier.  I would assume, yeah.  So that's what Apple does with iTunes.  When you buy a song on iTunes,  your Apple account email address is actually in the data.  So they could easily put your Bitcoin or your blockchain,  unique blockchain public address in there.  So you'd be-  It's a watermark.  It'd be watermarked.  You'd be responsible for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the only risk is that it requires  a certain amount of work on the part of someone  who wants to buy it to figure out how to pay for it  and what blockchain means and the sort of,  so it's gonna take nerds basically.  But I think it's an interesting effort  to try and do sort of micro payments at scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The negative right now in blockchain,  at least as implemented with Bitcoin,  is that everybody who's on the blockchain  has a full copy of the database.  It's a lot of data.  So maybe not the best way to do this.  I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is all done for 24 hours at a Guardian Live event.  If you go to the Guardian,  if you look up Image and Heap and Tiny Human Blockchain,  you'll find the Guardian story.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Neil Dash has been involved a little bit with this.  He wants to use blockchain for digital signing.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think blockchain has opportunities  for passing of data to media companies.  That you have a contract relationship  that says if I give you this, I get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and you can't make multiple copies.  You can control it.  Right.  I don't mind that.  I like that idea.  Let's get something equitable  and let's get those guys in white pants smoking cigars  in the Capitol building out of it.  I imagine that they're wearing white pants  and smoking cigars.  They may not be.  Not after May.  Not after May, never after May.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's your number of the week, Jeff Jarvis?  So my number is one for the first.  Jeff Bezos puts up his first tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One tweet in seven years, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In seven years to celebrate  his used rocket coming back to earth,  which I think is just great.  Maybe it's a video we'll go down on.  It's really quite something.  But then my favorite thing is Marty Barron,  editor of Washington Post,  we discussed earlier, wonderful editor,  had to me the best LMFAO tweet I've seen in weeks.  His tweet simply was,  at Jeff Bezos, welcome to Twitter, follow me.  Jeff follows no one you'd think he would follow.  The Washington Post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Washington Post, but so far no.  He's still not following anybody.  One tweet, one tweet, no follows ever.  That's funny.  Yeah, Jeff, of course, owns Blue Origin,  which is a civilian private space project,  which hasn't really done anything.  It's been kind of shrouded in mystery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was interesting to see Elon Musk took a sort of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well he has SpaceX, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  failed shot at Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And remember that Elon Musk had a problem  as he had not yet been able to do what Jeff did,  which was to land a launch vehicle  so that you could reuse it.  They tried.  Yeah, they tried several times,  but they haven't been able to do it.  It's kind of funny to watch this rocket  attempting to land.  What's unknown is if it could be used again.  It did land, but who knows?  Pretty cool.  Yeah, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The other thing, can I say something a little NSFW?  Yeah.  So if you look at the beginning  when the rocket has its module on top,  I couldn't help but it reminded me  of the movie Flesh Gordon from years ago.  You can guess what the rocket looked like.  Looks kind of the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a movie called Flesh Gordon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, there was.  It was back, oh god, this is years and years ago.  It was a classic, soft porn.  It's a classic?  70s I think.  Well, for what it is, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does look like a flying phallus.  Yeah, that's exactly it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But everything cylindrical looks like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's right.  That's why.  Yeah.  It might be, this video is, and the tweet behind it,  it might be a little self-serving.  It's one of those things where  we don't know what happened to that thing.  It might even be a little bit in your face, Elon.  I think it is a bit.  Don't you think that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My rocket is bigger than yours.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like, I'm sure John D. Rockefeller  and Andrew Carnegie kind of had this rivalry go, right?  It's like, well, my yacht is bigger than yours.  My rocket's bigger than yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The weird thing about that video too  was in the middle it has an animated thing  as if passengers are in the capsule,  and then it goes back to reality.  Confusingly kind of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did I ever tell you the story came from a book  about billionaires, about Larry Ellison and his boat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I read that story.  Tell us the story.  It's very funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So he had his boat extended.  I guess they just put a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They want to have the longest yacht.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Rod on the front, right.  And he wanted it to be bigger by even an inch or two  than Paul Allen's boat.  Right.  And so then after he had this extension added,  he went out in his boat and he saw Paul Allen's boat,  and he told his captain to basically cut off Paul Allen  and let some wake wash the boat.  And that was his way of saying, mine's bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I do believe that the other issue was how tall it is  because they can't sail under the Golden Gate Bridge.  The Golden Gate Bridge, Jeff, you'll be glad to know,  does not raise.  And so you can only have it as tall as it needs to be  to get under the Golden Gate Bridge.  And I think they're both like within inches.  An inch, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Plus doesn't the wave affect you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you have to be very careful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they have to.  Time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's why Paul Allen's boat has two,  I think it's got two or three other boats,  smaller boats inside it because it can't dock.  It can only dock at like two docks in the entire world  because it's too big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He has a submarine in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's got two helicopter landing pads and a submarine.  And I'm pretty sure he's got three or four Navy SEALs,  former Navy SEALs who work on the boat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's also a fully staffed recording studio waiting  at any time for Paul to come in and lay down some tracks.  That thing should be in the Navy.  That's ridiculous.  Unbelievable vehicle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think someone told me in the super yacht world,  the annual running costs are effectively a tenth  of what you paid for it.  Oh my God.  So he probably pays, yeah, he probably pays  like $30 million a year just to run it.  That's a cruise ship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I just buy the freaking Queen Mary, okay?  Get over yourself.  He of course owned Tech TV briefly.  Oh really?  I didn't know that.  For five of the six years.  And our program director was very proud to say  he was invited to a party on the boat.  Nice.  He had to fly to Monte Carlo to go to the party on the boat.  I met Paul several times.  I never saw anybody who had less personality.  He has a personality.  It's kind of sad, really.  He's got lots of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you met Nathan Mervold?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think he would have personality.  Well, he does.  He does have a lot of personality.  Almost too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's the one who has a full scale T-Rex skeleton  in his living room.  And he invented a new way of cooking.  Yeah, he was actually, he built a kitchen  just specifically to do sort of the fancy cuisine  where you use like liquid nitrogen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  His cookbook is only $450 at Barnes & Noble.  It's called, seriously, it's called Modernist Cuisine.  Happy birthday to E equals MC squared.  We should throw that in as a number too, yes.  Yeah, 100 years old this week.  The general theory of relativity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Still working pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  What was it Jimmy Fallon said?  Einstein was the last guy to whom one could say,  oh, good move, Einstein, and mean it.  No.  Non-sarcastically.  Yeah, that's worth memorializing.  Hey, I'm gonna wrap it up.  I have picks, but who needs my picks?  You guys are my picks.  Jeff Jarvis and Matthew Ingram,  always a thrill to get together with you  and talk smart stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Makes this show so much fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We had our own little news guys right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Happy Thanksgiving to you, Leo,  and related Thanksgiving to you, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe I'll have a turkey sandwich or something  in your honor.  Yeah, do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do Canadians do it on rye bread with French dressing,  gravy, and stuffing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We just sprinkle turkey on the poutine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You already got the gravy.  And the cheese curds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is there anything else on poutine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you come to Toronto,  I will take you to Smoke's Poutinerie,  where they have, I'm pretty sure,  it's about 42 different kinds of poutine.  That sounds like a lot of exact weight in the ass.  Basically, it's just poutine  with a bunch of different stuff on top.  Poutinerie.  So bacon, sausage, turkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I used to go to Toronto one week a month for years,  and I never even heard of that.  I thought poutine was only in Montreal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought it was Montreal.  It was.  It was.  It was.  So it's been expanding.  In a dream of mine,  if the journalism thing doesn't work out,  is to go to move to San Francisco,  and open up a poutine truck,  and drive around Club District.  Brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we'll all invest, Matthew, do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Poutine took off because club kids  were looking for something to eat.  So all the poutineries basically stay open  until three in the morning.  They do like 50% of their business after midnight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will invest in your poutine truck.  All right.  There you go.  I will, I can't have a yacht,  but I can have a poutine truck.  I think it'd be great.  Can't eat the poutine, but I can have the poutine truck.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Kill me for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a heart attack on a plate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you, Jeff Jarvis.  Buzzmachine.com, that's the blog.  Get the books, get the articles,  read them on Medium, take his courses.  Happy Thanksgiving to you.  Or what are you doing for Thanksgiving?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just hanging out.  Good.  Are your kids home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep, kids are home.  Good.  Got big family feast, football, and turkey.  It's the American way.  Thank you everybody for joining us.  I hope you have a great Thanksgiving yourself  if you live in the US or you're an expat.  We do this show on Wednesdays.  It's the last show of my week  at 1.30 Pacific, 4.30 Eastern time, 21.30 UTC.  You can watch live, join us in the chat room.  But if you can't do that,  you can always get it on demand after the fact  wherever you get your podcasts.  You know, we're in a renaissance, my friends.  So, shouldn't be hard to find a podcast.  We're the hard thing.

Thanks for joining us on Twitter.  Bye-bye.
