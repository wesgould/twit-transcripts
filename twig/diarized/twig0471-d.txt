Internet of Things, because of course we have among our hosts, Stacy Higginbotham, who is the host of Stacy on IoT.  She does a podcast with Kevin Toffle about Internet of Things. Does a great newsletter too at Stacy on IoT.com. Hello, Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hello. You almost caught me off guard looking at my phone making funny faces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Were you Snapchatting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I was just trying to figure out an app. It's all good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe a little later we'll find out what that app is. Stacy is in Austin, Texas and in New Jersey today it looks like.  We've got Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism at the City University.  Marry my twig shirt.  Oh, I like that. You look good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't have a twig shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, we can arrange one.  We'll get you. You want some swag? We can send you swag. That's easy.  I'm just saying, you know.  I'll show you. I got a twig belt. Look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I thought you were going to show me something different.  No. Oh, nice. It's fancy.  It says twit on my belt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like it.  Lisa got that for me in case I get lost in Barcelona.  On the inside it says, please return me to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, of course, if it does fall off, there'll be a twit logo on your ass. So they can identify you that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It says, please see ass.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Poor Stacy. You didn't get here for this kind of treatment.  So all right. This finally we have a reason to talk about the president of the United States on this week in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we can't avoid it, can we?  No, he says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google is rigging search results against him and calls it very dangerous.  Apparently he had never Googled his name before. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was a pajamas media story that apparently got through to, I guess, Fox that got to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is pajamas medium diamond and silk?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's that's the old Glenn Reynolds.  OK, it's dependent.  Insta. I don't know if Glenn's still on that, but a whole bunch of conservative people back in the day started a conservative blog company called Pajamas Media because the old joke was the bloggers were their pajamas.  Right.  And and so now it's a it's a fairly right side.  I mean, right end of spectrum.  Very right end of spectrum, I would say.  But not as far as these days.  He can't really what do you think?  He can't tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is Paula Bullard on on PJ Media dot com.  Is is it is conspiracy theory?  How do I get rid of this?  I don't want that.  And how do I get rid of this?  God, the web is just a mess.  Is it a conspiracy theory to suggest Google?  We need to get conserved.  That's what we need is am.  We need to Google.  Here's the here's the original tweet pair.  Google search results for Trump News shows only the viewing reporting of fake news media.  In other words, they have it rigged.  Capital letters for me and others so that almost all stories and news is bad.  Fake CNN is prominent Republican conservative fair media shutout.  Illegal that this is the thing that should concern you.  Illegal question mark.  Ninety six percent of Google search results for Trump News shows only the viewing reporting of fake news media.  Oh, I got a loop.  I got a Trump loop.  I'm sorry.  Ninety six percent of results on Trump News are from the national left wing media.  Very dangerous.  Google and others are suppressing voices of conservatives and hiding information and news that is good.  They are controlling what we can and cannot see.  This is a very serious situation.  Will be addressed.  So that's the two things that are concerning in here to me.  I mean, of course, he's going to go off.  And this has been a longstanding trope that the media is liberal and they aren't giving conservative voices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which, by the way, is true.  And I've argued often that that we haven't invested in conservative, responsible conservative media to create an alternative to Fox.  So when you do go on, yeah, it's national liberal media and Fox.  That's the only alternative there is for people.  That much is true.  But that ain't Google's fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the aches and so Paula Bollard, who wrote this story originally for PG Media, I didn't I didn't ask about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. Yeah, thank you.  I knew you. So don't tell me it's muted.  You yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would use that using different laptops to perform multiple Google news searches for the word Trump.  I don't know how sophisticated, by the way, she is.  If she did it in incognito mode or not, that's not indicated here.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then she wrote a piece for the Washington Post saying, oops, I don't know what I started here.  Regulation. I'm a conservative, so I don't want regulation.  Yeah, that's the problem with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And by the way, here's the two words that worry me.  Illegal and will be addressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, OK, no, if they were from like a legitimate policymaker, sure.  But Trump is not. Yeah, he's not a policy oriented person.  He says a lot of things. He is the president of the freaking United States.  He is the president. I know.  It is possible that one of his staff members would say, oh, I should take it upon myself to make this happen, kind of like Stephen Miller did with immigration.  But most of his staff members would look at that and say, oh, that is not something our base is going to appreciate.  So I guess it's this worrisome. No, or not.  No, it's not worrisome. I don't think there's going to come up.  Something's not going to come up with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So somebody in the chat room, RF2020, says Google is definitely shadow banning people it does not like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would ask for proof and a definition of not shadow banning, but there Google shows you what it thinks you want to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's why in order to do this properly, you have to go into an incognito mode or log out of your Google account because it will, of course, change search results.  Oddly, though, if you do that and enter Donald J. Trump, you'll get Fox News as one of the first results.  So maybe maybe I don't know. Is it showing the president what he wants to see? Probably not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, he has that word is he doesn't use a desktop computer. He doesn't know how to.  Oh, so it's a mobile. Well, or somebody showed it to him or that, you know what? He probably didn't do the search.  He just saw this. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, Paula Boyard herself tweeted, For those who are asking, I'm not calling for government regulations to solve the problem.  Well, of biased social media outlets, their private companies, they can run their companies however they want.  Government almost always makes things worse, which is a fairly reasonable response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey, the problem, though, is a couple of things. One, there's a chill. You don't have to pass a law to have an impact.  Two, this is the president of the United States.  So I would argue that football players in the NFL who have kneeled have a civil rights case, a First Amendment case against Trump because he's trying to intimidate.  He's trying to get them fired. He's trying to use the power of his office to stifle their speech.  And he's trying to influence Twitter and Facebook and now Google to make changes because of the power of his office and because what he brings.  That's precisely what the First Amendment is meant to protect from is that kind of authoritarianism.  That's precisely what he's trying to bring to this. So I agree with Leo.  I'm still worried whether or not you pass a law.  The attempt that he's making here and the larger thing that he's doing, of course, is that he's going after anyone with authority other than him.  Right. The media, the FBI, the Justice Department are all wrong.  Google is now doing this.  Facebook and Twitter are unfair to conservatives. Blah, blah, blah, blah.  So believe none of them. Truth isn't truth.  Believe only me. Classic technique.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK. And I say as a free speech thing, I can see this.  I wouldn't worry about actual regulations coming from this, which is kind of where my brain was heading.  And yeah, yeah.  But I would say I'm not going to. It is disturbing.  I am far more upset by Trump's misuse of his office just for petty everyday corruption, like having the Secret Service stay in his hotels while he still has ownership stakes in them.  And some of the things his family members are doing, that is far more disturbing to me than just him bullying people from Twitter.  What about I do see that that is it? That is this issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What about the case made here by Oliver Darcy of CNN that and this is a quote from his story with his tweet.  Trump has signaled that he and his Republican allies would continue to paint tech giants like Facebook and Twitter as villains in a longstanding culture war used to excite the conservative base.  That seems to me much more likely what he's up to.  Right. It's always politics.  In this case, you know, this it's great to have an enemy, especially as you're going into an election.  And what it looks like to me now, it's Google, Facebook, Twitter, the Internet elites.  We already have the media elites, but now it's the Internet elites that are also villains. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And and you have the New York Post and Fox News that are also going to Rupert Murdoch has been going up to the platforms all along.  So now they're in line with each other, attacking Google and also the other platforms from a competitive standpoint.  And then I'm trying to talk to people from my world, from media today on our world on Twitter saying that this puts us media on the same in the same firing line as the platforms.  And and we defend the platforms speech here to defend our own.  And so media being constantly pardon me, dystopian and shooting at the platforms as competitors, you know, find that's business.  But there's unintended consequences to be had here.  We're watching them happen as of now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't. So here's here's my quibble with this.  Trump has a problem with truth, not I mean, what he calls fake news and a left left oriented bias in the media is very different than what, you know, the Bush's may have experienced.  And yes, are many people who write for the media?  Are we mostly liberal? I would say probably so.  And I'm sure there's data to back that up, and I'm sure you have it, Jeff.  So I think really what he's doing here is he's just he's just out outlying.  And I'm not worried about that. I mean, I am worried about that one sense, but I don't.  The problem here isn't that Google is biased.  The problem is that Trump is deciding that everything that he doesn't like is not true and thus biased and thus quote unquote illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, of course, there's a much larger issue.  Nobody disagrees with you on that.  But because it's this week in Google, I thought I focus on the impact on the tech sector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We can't argue if the stove started the fire or if it was, you know, a lit match.  We the house is on fire. You guys, let's not focus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm surprised to hear you say that because we know I just thought you didn't want to talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I just I'm anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What do you do if you're Google and let's say 80 percent of media, you know, is is left leaning?  Do you then change your search results to be 50 50 and by doing so boost up the 20 percent?  That's not and it's not left leaning necessarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  While the writers may be left leaning, most of the stuff that's news organizations write is still true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. So that's an important distinction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And just by arguing for this in that argument that you were set to make falls into this camp of like the same sort of, oh, we can't be biased against anti-vaxxers.  We must report both sides equally.  That's bull.  And I love science.  I love media.  Not a I actually used to be more conservative in a fiscal way than you were in Austin.  Well, no, I mean, even more conservative than people in Austin.  So when when the president of the United States says to tech companies better be careful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  As he does here.  Let me see if my audio is functioning.  Serious thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's a very serious charge.  I think what Google and what others are doing, if you look at what's going on at scroll down, maybe you look at what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's not showing what I'm showing.  So right.  Let's start over.  Let's start over.  So this was yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think Google is really taking advantage of a lot of people.  And I think that's a very serious thing.  And it's a very serious charge.  I think what Google and what others are doing, if you look at what's going on at Twitter, if you look at what's going on in Facebook, they better be careful because you can't do that to people.  You can't do it.  We have tremendous.  We have literally thousands and thousands of complaints coming in.  And you just can't do that.  So I think that Google and Twitter and Facebook, they're really treading on very, very troubled territory.  And they have to be careful.  They have to be careful.  It's not fair to large portions of the population.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That worries me.  They have to be careful.  What do we what do they have to be careful of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He doesn't ever say he's so he doesn't need to articulate.  I know he doesn't need to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, you could make the argument.  He's smart enough not to say concretely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That it's sufficient merely to say that.  And then the wheels start turning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look how Facebook has has has tripped over itself since its trending at Jack Dorsey at Twitter and Jack Dorsey going on Fox.  Right. They are tripping over themselves to try to not get in trouble with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are they afraid of regulation or are they afraid of I don't know, Molotov cocktails?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are they? What are they worried about?  I think they're afraid of regulation.  I think they're afraid of boycotts.  I think they're afraid of advertisers getting scared of them.  I think they should be very.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they're probably also afraid of the disconnect between the regulatory environment they're finding themselves in in the US and the historical way they run their companies and their user base here in the US.  Because as a country that's fragmented and being from the US, I think they're good.  I mean, it would be terrifying to suddenly be like, holy cow, we have to uphold these same sort of rules that we uphold and kind of more authoritarian places where we're used to that.  But their employees are here.  Those people are not going to let them do this.  So, I mean, that's got to be terrifying as a company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google said yesterday when users search for content, quote, Our goal is to make sure they receive the most relevant answers in a matter of seconds.  We make hundreds of improvements to our algorithms every year to ensure high quality content is returned in response to users queries.  We never. This is the important quote.  We never rank this. I'm reading from time.  We never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment.  Is that true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would think so. It would be the best way to answer this actually would have would be to look at what they've done in other countries where the government has historically been more proactive about what Google shows people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. I would say it's doubly bad time for Google to go into China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, we talked about this last week that Google has and Sergey Brin admitted has a project to create a censored version of Google for China at the behest of the Chinese government.  Would Google then consider a censored version of Google for the US government?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what they'll say, what Google, what the platformers will always say is we will follow local law.  Right.  And it goes to Stacey's point is we will be safe from a law in this country because we have a constitution still.  But it probably won't reach that level.  There'll be other impact.  You look at this. A story on the Times Today says dozens at Facebook unite to challenge its intolerant liberal culture.  Somebody said on Twitter when I tweeted this.  Well, I'm sure dozens of people have complained about what's you know, there aren't enough vegetarian items in the food free food line.  Actually, that's hundreds, probably thousands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But but you have this atmosphere of what Stacey was saying of the false balance that comes up all too easily.  And, you know, I do think there's a problem of perspective in the larger media ecosystem.  And I'm liberal and I'm media and I will I will confess that sin on behalf of my brethren.  I think it's an issue.  I think it's part of the reason we're where we are.  But that has nothing to do with what Trump's doing.  And the reaction that Stacey mentions of this one, let's get a balance going.  Oh, let's get a balance going.  Mean that if Leo, what you were saying was what you were saying was, are you going to balance by institution or by story?  If you're going to start balancing by store, you're going to start balancing at all.  It's wrong because Stacey's right.  Have I said that enough?  That this is about facts and it's about it's about legitimate, responsible and intellectually honest reporting.  But even so, if you say, OK, we need some more right stuff.  Well, the next thing line on the right stuff gets you to Breitbart really fast because there's not much more.  There's nothing more than The Wall Street Journal and Fox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kara Swisher picked the New York Times picked a good time to add Kara Swisher to their editorial board.  Her opinion piece today, Trump's ludicrous attack on big tech.  The idea that Google and Twitter are rigging their platforms against him is patently false.  I love her lead.  Here's the truest conundrum of the social media age.  Those who complain loudest about being silenced never ever shut up.  He says, she says, I'm sorry, that Trump, instead of attacking techie, should send them a golden boss thank you note.  I guess because what?  Because she says most tech leaders are more often lightweight versions of libertarians and largely apolitical,  except for backing gay and transgender rights and wanting to allow more qualified immigrants into the country to make more tech.  Otherwise, in my reporting, I found they love those tax cuts and adore the repatriated income.  True, true.  And can't get enough of deregulation.  Sure, they don't cotton to the anti climate change nonsense.  Mr. Trump spews.  Of course, everybody withdrew from the tech board when he pulled out of the Paris Accords.  And they can't stand the endless bullying.  But let's stop to reflect that they have handed him all the weapons in his online arsenal to do that.  That's what he has to be thankful for.  I think you could easily make the case that Trump's election had a lot to do with Facebook and his effective use of Facebook or the Russians effective use somebody's effective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody else on Twitter said that you can hold these two ideas in mind at the same time.  Most of the staff at Facebook is probably liberal, but that Facebook is a has been made a better tour, has been better exploited by the right than the left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean, as far even as in and I haven't looked at the makeup of their lobbying efforts recently, but probably three years ago, Facebook's lobbyists were all highly conservative, even in the administration.  So I don't know where that is today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What should so Jeff Bezos had has been under attack.  He just ignores. He just completely ignores it.  Completely.  What should should Facebook and Twitter, who are not ignoring it, they're scrambling around like crazy.  Do the same. And what should Google do?  Is the best thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bezos doesn't have a social network.  I mean, I know that Trump's attacking him and he did actually respond to some of the worker allegations.  But I mean, this doesn't have a social network.  He owns the Washington Post.  So from his perspective, there is no benefit for him to speak up on any of this.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Kara is absolutely right that all of these guys have benefited from repatriation, lower tax rates, deregulation.  It's all been good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I think, Leo, to answer your question, that the platforms would do well and wise to follow the lead of Floyd Abrams, the New York Times, and say this is a this is a matter of the First Amendment.  This is a matter of free speech. Don't tell us how to do our jobs.  It's not your job to do that.  We're doing our job. We're doing it well.  And it is our prerogative to do it, not yours to tell us how to do it.  This is a matter of the First Amendment. This is why it exists.  This is why we're in this country.  And media people should be right behind them saying what they say.  And rather than sniping at the platforms as certain trade groups still do, what Torchaday was somebody from a trade group in the publishing industry.  Well, I stand for the First Amendment, but I still want to complain about Google a lot.  Enough. There's a common enemy here.  And that's the anybody who's against the truth is against us.  And we've got to stand together here.  And we've got to recognize, and I said this in the show two weeks ago, that whether you like it or not, our best ally against Russian election manipulation is Facebook and Twitter.  That's just it.  They're the only ones doing anything.  I don't know how effective it is. I don't know how much of their heart is in doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the real question, Jeff.  Yeah.  How much of their heart is in doing anything about it?  I think now it's strongly in it. I think now it is. It wasn't before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But about our and our joint cause and concern is to protect speech and the First Amendment from this kind of of authoritarian intervention.  And we should be standing together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true. Google and Facebook don't want that kind of authoritarian intervention.  Right.  Because they I mean, how complicated at it's just forget about morality and ethics.  It's complicated to deal with this many policies for this many places and types of people in the world.  So anything that fragments the kind of global platform is a pain for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One social media, Kara Swisher's last few paragraphs are probably the most telling.  As one social media executive said to me recently with an audible sigh, for one set, we can't take down enough.  For another, we can't. We said we can't leave up enough.  One side thinks social media enabled populism.  The other thinks the opposite.  There will be no fixing this, which makes for a kind of digital gridlock that is perfect for Mr.  Trump, even though he seems not to be in on the giant tech joke he has created in an interview with Trump conducted by Mark Leibovitz of the New York Times about a year ago.  Quote, Trump says they want to take away my voice, he declared plaintively, even as he bragged about the 54 million he reaches directly with every tweet on his real Donald Trump handle, along with 23 million more on that POTUS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're not going to take away my social media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She ends the piece.  No, Mr. President, they're not.  They're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it is kind of an odd conundrum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  On the one hand, he has probably the best bully pulpit of any president ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bully pulpit, well titled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bullying pulpit.  Yeah.  That was Teddy Roosevelt.  Be best.  Yeah.  The best bully pulpit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I said be best.  Be best.  I was referring back to anti-bullying and bullying.  Be best.  Put the anti in bully.  Okay.  This is, can we stop talking about this now?  Yeah, no, we're done.  I'm like, this is one of those things, I'm like, we could talk for hours and not make any headway.  No, I think this was perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We discussed the issue.  I'm glad Kara's editorial, that was actually a great way to kind of, I think, sum it up.  I think we all agree with Kara.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I should do my standing disclosure that I raised money for my school from Facebook as well as Craig Newmark and the Ford Foundation and others.  I am independent of them.  I received no money personally from them.  End of disclosure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's take a break.  When we come back, Stacey will pick the first topic.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not going to be here for another three weeks after this, you know.  You could pick all the topics next week.  Jason Howell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your mind is somewhere in the Mediterranean.  Yeah, already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was really punchy on the Windows Weekly.  I'm calm down a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As I come back to us, Leo, stick with us here just for a few more hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You need that.  You need that punch thing right now.  Stacey.  I showed a good go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, you know, by the way, on Saturday we had a robot maker on and she's going to she said, oh, yeah, I could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you have Simone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She's of no Gillian of less.  Let's robot dot TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, also exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Check that.  She it's kind of twitch for Internet controlled robots.  So if you go to let's robot dot TV, you can watch robots being controlled over the Internet.  You better buy a helmet, Leo.  And so if I go to her page, which is let's robot dot TV slash Robo Castor slash Jill.  So she says she can build she has a bunch of robots, but she can build a robot that I guess nothing's really active right now.  But but we'll see.  I can control it up here, but she can build a robot that you can you can punch me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, excellent.  I found I found a friend of mine named Hugo is also volunteered to build one.  He's the CEO over at Electric Imp.  So she's like, oh, yeah, one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jill said when she first started that she was doing it on Twitch and she built a slapping robot and people paid on Twitch to slap her.  She got three hundred whatever the Twitch bucks are in one day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I believe that.  I'm surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So how much would you pay Stacey to punch Leo when he says something nasty?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what? I actually wouldn't pay anything.  I could just hang up.  But I wonder how much the audience would pay.  Oh, no, Leo or even no Jeff or no Stacey.  I mean, we should make it fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true.  That's true.  We have to have their definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Who'd be like, Jeff, no, or Stacey, stop talking.  So it could happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Cashfly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you are running a I don't know, a Internet controlled robot site or a podcast site or if you deliver content anyway to your customers, you not you need to know about CDN's content delivery networks and our CDN.  The best, which is Cashfly.  We've been we've been on Cashfly for almost a decade, literally without flaw.  And I asked Cashfly what our bandwidth for twig for this week and Google alone last month, 771.8 gigabytes on Cashfly.  We do petabytes a month for the network as a whole.  All flawlessly.  If you get this podcast, if you subscribe and you get it fast, if you watch it download on the Web page, that's Cashfly.  Cashfly has been building trusted CDN relationships since 2002.  They eliminate outages with 100.  They guarantee 100 percent availability with their bulletproof 100 percent SLA.  But it's more than just that.  They've got great, great team.  Matt Levine and his team are so good.  Smart, easy to talk to techies that when you call will answer your questions the first time without having to pass you around to five different departments.  I will vouch for that.  And what I really love is it's much more affordable.  It's you will save on average more than 20 percent.  Say goodbye to logging in a couple of times a week or even every day trying to figure out how much is this going to cost me at the end of the month?  Twenty percent.  Just imagine what you could do with 20 percent in the time when you don't have to micromanage your usage or worry about having to commit to a long term contract based on a growth plan.  You didn't even write.  That's a crazy way to buy CDN.  We would not exist without Cashfly.  We host all our podcasts on Cashfly audio and video.  As I said for this show alone, 771.8 giga bits or gigabytes, I think gigabytes of throughput on Cashfly, petabytes every month.  Join the thousands of others who like me trust Cashfly's reliable network.  There's a few of them right there.  Hey, we're on that page right next to ours, Technica and Adobe, Blue Shell and Overdrive.  There's Twit. That's nice.  I have an offer for Twit listeners.  If you go to twit.cashfly.com, you can get a complimentary detailed analysis of your current CDN bill and usage trends.  They will give you honestly a quote for how much they could save you.  You might believe in as much as 20 percent on the table.  I know we save a lot.  twit.cashfly.com. twit.cashfly.com.  Thank you, Cashfly.  Thank you, Matt and team.  You guys are the greatest.  Stacey, have you been thinking what you want to talk about next?  Oh, yes. Yes, I have.  You get to pick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm like, have I mentioned that I'm going on vacation tomorrow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are you? Where are you going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to Banff.  So what a good time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did you get back, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did. This is this is that was family.  Oh, and I have I have news.  This is kind of early news.  Do you guys want early news and then we'll talk about people looking about you?  It is about me.  We in June, June, not next year, Banff.  We're moving to Seattle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, congratulations.  War.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  That is our plan.  So you had so much fun there this summer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You decided to move there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been pushing it for years.  Finally, my husband said, yes, let's do it because you can work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're not taking a job there.  You're going to continue to do what you're doing.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am going to continue what I'm doing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Doing what I'm doing.  That's the beauty of what we do.  You can do it anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. As long as it's broadband.  No broadband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And does your husband have a job in Austin or is he just he has a similar type of job?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, he does. Well, he has a job.  He does lots of jobs, but they're they're not location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He could do them anywhere.  Yes. So what was his resistance?  You have family down there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's hard to move for no reason.  Other than you want to, especially when you're moving from a cheaper place to a more expensive place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you got to pick up a kid.  Well, that's the thing.  Now's the time to do that because your daughter is young enough that it won't be a real disruption.  Is she going? Will she be in fifth grade, fourth grade?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no, she's third grade.  She's in seventh grade right now.  Seventh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So she'll be changed.  So she'll be going to a new eighth.  That is tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a little tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was hoping she was going from six to seven or eight to nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. And we thought about going another year, but dang it, it's hot here.  It is noticed, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's when people say we're moving is in August in Austin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  And, you know, maybe we won't be able to do it, but why not take the chance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey, no more case.  So for you, that is actually on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have a list of pros and cons in case.  So as a part of it.  Oh, my God.  So text makes technically made the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I bet you'll find good text mess next up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they have good interior.  Max, we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Look who's in the chat room.  Kevin C.  Toffle. He's shocked, shocked to hear this news.  Oh, no, we talked about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wasn't going to tell you guys for another several months, but I was like, I was since I was caught out doing something related to that, I was like, oh, OK.  So here's here's my my pitch for our story.  It's a broadband story because, you know, I love my FCC.  Ars Technica just put out a story this afternoon about saying the FCC can define markets with only one ISP now is competitive.  What?  According.  This is an Ars Technica thing.  This is from the I'm trying to read which US appeals court for the Eighth Circuit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So so there was a competitive market test that existed.  Yes.  So and the and this was challenged in court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the Selex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Selex or who?  They're the phone companies, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're the competitive local exchange carriers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they're the not mob bells, the not bills and purchasers of business broadband because the FCC voted last year to eliminate price caps on some business broadband providers like AT&T and Verizon in any given county.  If 50 percent of potential customers are within half a mile of a location served by a competitive provider, you just move, you move.  It's only half a mile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we discussed this is a huge thing.  I call these broadband black holes and it's we see this.  Our policy for decades has been to ignore these issues and there's a couple ways.  So there's this particular example.  There's also with the national broadband map where you don't actually get address level information for who has broadband and what they have.  You grab zip level information.  So it's possible for you to be in an area that's competitive but still only have one provider because you're both in the same zip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I have it all the time, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, this is I mean, I could probably call 10 people and at least one of them will be currently right now having this problem.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm in a zip code that theoretically has two or more Internet service providers, but I only have one that will serve my house or my business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this is one of those issues where, you know, broadly, it doesn't sound terrible, but individually, it's horrific.  And like I just said, you cannot do business today without having a broadband connection.  I would argue you can't live as a consumer without it.  But, you know, there are people who do personally.  I think it's a problem.  But, you know, some people don't want it.  And this is just so messed up.  So nothing to do with Google, but a really frustrating issue.  We still don't have a solution for it.  We may never.  I'm hopeful.  And 5G, by the way, will not solve this necessarily.  No.  Because you can't in a lot of areas where it's real problem, like in rural areas, 5G isn't necessarily going to be able to go out that far.  So that's all.  This was my story because broadband.  Sadness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, we just it's really amazing.  You would think that the FCC of all people would represent the people.  Really?  And try to get an equitable situation for people in the United States who are suffering with among the worst broadband in the developed world because of  Any competitive pressures from, you know, these duopolies created admittedly by the FCC at the behest of the cable and phone companies.  But you would think this is a government agency that they would be trying to make Internet access easier, more available, less costly.  All of the things which are good for society.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you not heard of regulatory capture?  And I would argue, actually, here's here's where these things break down is most in the tech world.  Most companies are like, I have a cool service.  I want to get more people to use it so I can sell more of my service.  Think of Intel and Silicon like chips.  Think of Amazon and cloud services.  So the telcos, though, that is not their mindset.  The quote unquote I.T. mindset is absolutely not theirs.  They don't they don't want to give you more of things that use their product.  They don't necessarily want you to like view their product as a platform on which to grow businesses because they want to treat their product as this high price, super valuable thing.  And it's it is where it's basically like when Moore's law meets the telcos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everything goes to hell.  Basically, we all lose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The judge has basically accepted the FCC's argument that the impact of a competitor, even if the competitors not actually competing, but the fact that if a competitor is within half a mile, that assures a reasonably competitive outcomes in the medium term.  As long as they're close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's like saying you live in America and Canada has Rogers and you're next to it.  Next to it. So it's OK.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or, yeah, I mean, and this is the FCC did not even attempt to show that this is true.  The judges, they just said it was and the judges said, all right, well, you're the FCC.  You say so. So it must be true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, in the FCC can't prove it because and the problem is also on the flip side, the consumer groups can't prove it either because we don't actually have access to that data.  But because the telcos say that address level who gets what data is competitive to them.  So if AT&T, if AT&T's exact service footprint were available as a public record, everyone could see it and everyone would know.  And then AT&T just loses its competitive edge.  I think that is I think the policy needs for understanding who and where broadband is outweigh their competitive concerns, especially given.  Given that they only have one competitor at most markets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The judges basically say that both sides, neither side has data.  So both sides are applying an economic theory and the judge.  The judges say the FCC can rationally choose whatever evidence it wants to believe among conflicting evidence.  And we're not going to get in the way.  Who bothers with truth?  Truth is not truth.  They can believe whatever they want to because they're the FCC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's our world today.  Thanks for depressing us, Stacey.  All right.  Cheer up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cheer up.  Google France is taking down its Google Plus page.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's French.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even at Google, the French are the French.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And they're saying, follow us on Twitter or Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it the beginning of the end of Google Plus?  It is in France.  I have to say I did disconnect from all my big time social media this week.  I killed my Twitter account, killed Instagram, killed Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I killed Tumblr.  I didn't.  I even killed Tumblr, but I didn't bother to kill Google Plus because who cares?  You were terrible.  I even killed Tumblr, but I didn't kill Google Plus.  Should I kill Google Plus too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No. Why bother?  You can't kill Google Plus because you have a Google account.  You can't.  So, you know, I'm going to do something.  I'm going to send postcards.  Anybody wants a postcard, I'll mail you one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's a more civilized way to share information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dear Jeff Jarvis, the road to here was so long and we lost four of our children to the measles.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's the daughter party.  Oregon Trail.  Let's see.  Google has confirmed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I want a new show.  Why?  I didn't quit Google.  This week in techno panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not techno panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not even advocating it.  I quit it because it's a river of sewage coming into my brain and I thought maybe I could just turn that off.  Oh, look.  It worked.  It worked.  What I did do, I'm going to confess, is I had a Twitter account lying around that's just news sources.  So because there is a value to having a news feed.  Right.  So I carefully curated just news, just reliable, unfaked news sources.  And so if somebody, you know, like is somebody dead or something?  Was there an earthquake?  If something like that happens, I can go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I admit it's not completely withdrawing from Twitter, but it's not like I'm going, oh my God, what will I do?  It's like, yay.  I use Twitter through lists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I have a Trump Watcher list and a MediaWalks list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Those aren't the lists I'm looking for, but I have lists like tech news.  Yeah, I know.  Stuff like that.  That's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you pick who you want on it.  That's how you read and it's fine.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I don't need the rest of it.  You didn't get the rest of it.  But if you use your list, you don't.  But if you don't use your list, what do you get?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So use the list and then it's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or just kill your account.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're never going to agree.  Just Leo corner, Jeff corner.  River of sewage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bill Donahue, reporter at Law 360 says...  Bill Donahue?  Oh, Bill Donahue.  Bill Donahue.  Whatever happened to Bill Donahue?  Bill Donahue says Google has confirmed for me the company will indeed appeal the ruling  in Oracle versus Google to the Supreme Court.  This is the case that Google lost.  The court ruled that Google's use of Java...  Actually, no, I apologize.  Google's use of the Java API, Oracle owns Java, was not fair use.  And so anyway, we'll see.  We don't know if the Supreme Court will hear it, but it is a significant issue in the fair  use doctrine as well as software copyrights, if you ask me.  Although I think it was stipulated that software copyrights are illegal.  So that's why they went to the fair use defense.  Nothing more to say.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I saw that and I was like, oh, gosh, this case will A, never end and B, I have  to remember everything I learned the first time.  Forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, it's very complicated.  It was very complicated.  It isn't a case of whether Google stole Java.  It's a case of whether Google could legally, using the fair use rules, use a copyrighted  API.  It was even agreed that the API was copyrightable, which I thought was very odd.  That didn't seem right at all, but that's a done deal.  That's over.  Here's something maybe the president would consider.  If you put a little Google Home.  Oh, and we already talked about this last week.  Darn it.  Oh, you did?  OK, sorry.  I put that one in there.  This is part of the changelog.  I brought back the changelog while you were gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you did it before.  I was here for the reentry.  Yeah, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is a Google Home story.  I was going to tell you about the good news thing, just so people know what I was talking

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  about.  Oh, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, go ahead.  Oh, wait, but we did good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's right.  Yeah, we did it last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that the one you were going to bring up, too?  I couldn't listen to the show last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I was going to bring up a different Google Assistant story, but it's a smaller story.  Give me that one.  OK.  So your Nest by, no, yes, Nest by Yale Lock now works with Google Assistant in theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What is the Nest by Yale Lock?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What?  You don't know about the Nest by Yale Lock?  Is that related to Nest?  It is.  It is a connected door lock that's part of the Nest ecosystem.  It is made by Yale.  It is actually a lovely lock.  It's $239, I believe.  It's pretty.  And it is, yeah, it's actually an attractive looking lock.  I have it installed.  It works.  But it has not actually been integrated into the Google Home yet until possibly today.  But it's not working yet because Kevin tried it.  And then later after Kevin failed, I also tried it.  So I don't know if I'm just having issues because I have had issues connecting things  to Google Home from my Nest account or if it's just had it rolled out to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, as long as we're talking, you can also use the Amazon Spot to use your Ring Video,  and your Nest cameras and even your Wyze cameras.  So people don't like the spot because it's watching you, but now you can watch them while  they're watching you or something.  Take that.  Crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So another story related story from my numbers, I always have extras, is that Google Home,  according to one analyst, Google Home is out shipping Echo.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't that interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is.  And at IFA, Google Home, they say, is everywhere, is on everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's just a function of Google's marketing.  And I will still tell you, from every single connected device maker that I talk to, their  priorities and integration are Madame A first, so the Amazon Echo first, followed by Google,  followed by IFTTT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's interesting.  IFTTT is in there.  That's interesting.  Because they say IFTTT is a glue for all of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe, or they just, there's enough early, I mean, because we're still at a fairly early  adopter stage for most of these.  True.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And early adopters like IFTTT, because it's a powerful tool that lets you use things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Super powerful.  Harmon Cardin has announced a new Google Assistant speaker.  It's only $600.  Jeez.  But that's presumably, it's about the size of the Google Home Max, right?  This is another IFA thing.  It'll be available for preorder in Europe only at the end of September.  I'm not sure when it'll come to the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, Leo and I are old enough to remember that even in our dorm rooms, we had to get  like five or 10 speakers to put them all around the room and up and down and everywhere, because  that was the only way to do it.  Did you have Quadraphonic?  No, I missed that.  I missed that.  I did not do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wasn't that something by the who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Quadrophenia, which was actually, interestingly, no, I better not go into this.  But there was a joystick, right?  They could swirl the sound around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it was the only way to really understand the sound.  Quadraphonic.  My next door neighbor in the dorm had it and drove me completely batty.  He had to blast it to show the ladies how wonderful his stereo was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My stereo is bigger than Jarvis's.  Come over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Citation 500 has a 200 watt stereo speakers.  That's a lot.  And can support 24 bit, 96 kilohertz, high quality sound.  That's a high bit rate streaming.  And then so it's a speaker there.  And then it has the assistant as well for control.  So it's not just for the Google Assistant.  It's the third smart speaker.  I didn't realize this in the Harmon Kardon set away.  Yeah, I have the hardened Carmen that's based on Cortana.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How's that going?  How often do you use that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, she says it's kind of pathetic sitting there on the desk unplugged.  It's sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's well integrated with your Google Plus.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I actually have a Google Mini that every time I go out of town, it's in our bathroom.  Yeah.  Every time I go out of town, it disappears.  And when I come back, I find it back in.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I put cameras all around the house for while we're gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And oddly enough, they're all face down this morning.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Take care.  Every one of them face down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I put them back up.  We'll see.  I need a camera that can get can write itself.  You know, like a little like that robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We had a soccer playing robot in here on Sunday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It would sometimes miss the ball kick and kind of a starkly fall over.  And so but it but it's actually great when it does that because then it does this weird and stands up on its own.  Oh, awesome.  It's like the beginning of the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I use the wise camera for the cat to find out how it was peeing.  Yeah.  It was doing the of course, the cat was freaked by it and batted it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have video of that happening as well.  Cats love the wise cam.  Did you know that as of 2011, Google was still backing up Gmail on tape?  Isn't that amazing?  And it surprised me.  Yeah.  They're wrong.  In 2011, this is from the IEEE spectrum.  For example, I write for them.  Do you?  That's a great geeky boy.  That's geek cred.  If you write a column for them, that is geek cred.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wrote one piece for them once.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wrote I just wrote a piece for the double ARP magazine.  Does that count?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How to go on cruises.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's that's a geezer cred, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  2011, a flaw in a software update caused Google to accidentally delete the saved email messages  in about 40,000 Gmail accounts.  This loss occurred despite there being several copies of the data stored on hard drives across multiple data centers.  Fortunately, the data was also recorded on tape and Google eventually restored all the lost data  from that backup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can we bet that it's not stored on tape anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, wait, actually.  So Facebook started doing their cold storage research.  So this is I mean, because tape is guys, it's reliable.  It's cheap as anything.  It's just slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this would be like Amazon Glacier.  Cold storage is there's hot storage, which is like S3 and there's cold storage like Glacier.  And yeah, why not use tape for cold storage?  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, no, no, no, tape and cold storage are different.  So but cold storage, the the cold storage efforts by Facebook and Amazon, they didn't come out until they started researching those.  And like probably earlier, but they didn't start like doing much with it until like 2014, maybe 2013.  So you got to remember in 2012 or 2011 when this happened, they didn't have anything like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you had this is what they had.  This is actually the tape machine that they were using.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And yes, someone points out that tape does degrade very fast, although it's about 20, 30 years, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's the thing is you're kind of refreshing it all the time.  I'm sure they don't just take all of Gmail, put it on one tape and put in the closet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somewhere my emails from 2005 or in a.  Yeah, I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And when did Gmail come out?  I know they just had a birthday or I think they just had a birthday.  When did that happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I, you know, at least like 12 years old, right?  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I muted it.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's like that's what happens in my house all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Gmail was launched.  Gmail.  April Fool's 2004.  And it was in beta for five years.  Remember that?  I remember in 2004 you had to get an invitation to get a Gmail account and people were selling their invitations on eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, yeah, I can't tell you my husband's email, but it's a wonderful Gmail because he actually was doing like he was a affiliate of Google's.  They one year they sent us a TV.  They got us it.  So I had an early Gmail account because Andy at Gmail dot com.  It is not that poor Andy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But yes, there is a guy who has Jim at AOL dot com.  But he can't use it.  It's completely swamped by spam.  You don't want you don't really like I have reported Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I actually had to abandon it because it's just not it's I get too many French spam messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, but the French spam messages are the best.  I know they're pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Then I also get a lot of things like in French, like your your appointment is confirmed and stuff because people.  Who are named Laporte, they put their first name space laporte at Gmail dot com and I get the mail, not them.  I stopped for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was like, I'm sorry.  I'm not that I'm not Amy Laporte, not Jacques Laporte.  And I finally just gave up.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That is a great story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I bet you they're still using tape.  Oh, yeah, everybody's still using tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everybody is really OK.  That was they say in journalism and also in the media.  Journalism and also any true false test.  Everybody never always.  OK, a lot of people still use many, many, many people and companies.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What? Sorry to go back to a prior story.  Trump just put up a meme.  I don't know if I want to show it on his Twitter.  Yeah, video.  Gosh, it's too bad.  I don't have a Twitter account.  Stop.  So yes, let's stop.  Let's not do it.  If you want to go, they can go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, my dog just barked at you, Jeff.  She even agrees.  She's like, no, no meme for you.  OK, now I feel like a mean person, but I don't even remember his Twitter handle anymore.  So no, stop. You're looking.  You're feeding it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  Stacy's right, as always.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you as ever.  We talked last week about the Pixel 3 and all the videos and leaks we found out were apparently,  according to a nine to five Google, they found out where all those are coming from.  There's a Ukrainian black market dealer who somehow got his hands on quite a few.  See, it's the Russians.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everything is the Russians.  No, hey.  They got across the border from Russia to Ukraine.  Ukraine is not Russia, dude.  I know what I'm saying.  It's right there.  I bet it goes back.  It's fake news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Although a lot of those teaser videos were showing Russian interfaces and Cyrillics.  He's this this seller is offering us apparently, I don't know, stolen Pixel 3 XL for two thousand dollars each.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where where does he get them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you better believe Google's and and on higher wondering Foxconn.  Well, we're but probably that's where right there making them in China.  Somebody's. Snarfing them up, sneaking them out of the factory.  Oh, I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that is no way.  Oh, this was an interesting story for everybody who paid attention to the study on Facebook causing anti-refugee attacks in Germany.  Yes, there's a new teleconnection I hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mm hmm.  Explain explain this to me, Stacey.  I enjoyed putting that one on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was wondering where that was from.  No, I'm sitting here reading it, so I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So here is the introductory correlations anti-refugee posts.  That's the that's the dotted line correlated with anti-refugee incidents.  Look at the strong correlation between the two incidents.  And so Ben Thompson and who else?  Ben Thompson is to techery.  He he focused on a quotation from the authors.  In our setting, the share of a municipality's population that use the AFD Facebook page is an intuitive proxy for right wing social media use.  However, it is also correlated with differences in a host of observable municipality characteristics.  Most importantly, the prevalence of right wing ideology with us attempt to isolate the local component of social media usage that is uncorrelated with right wing ideology by drawing on the number of users on the Nutella Germany page.  With over 32 million likes, Nutella has one of the most popular Facebook pages in Germany and therefore provides a measure of general Facebook media use at the municipality level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So so basically their benchmark for their their statistical accuracy is based on how many people liked Nutella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But yeah, because Nutella is the normative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which I think Nutella is disgusting.  So I'm like, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, only surely only fascists like Nutella.  Right, Stacey?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, that is that is that is a correlation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Leo won't get the tweets now.  I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  You see, again, my strategy is turning out to be genius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Genius.  Oh, Nutella Defenders for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is a good time to pitch one of my favorite books of all time that will help everyone.  And it's called A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper.  It's very dry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought you were going to say Weapons of Math Destruction.  No, no, this is written for journalists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is written for people who don't like math in general.  So it's a lovely book.  And I highly recommend it for people who want to be a little bit smarter.  There are equations.  You don't have to deal with the equations.  By John Allen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's available.  The journalists are notoriously.  Oh, it's John Allen Paulos.  I know him.  I know John Allen Paulos.  He wrote Enumeracy, which is another wonderful book.  I actually have interviewed him.  Nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I talked to him.  Tell your friends.  When Enumeracy came out.  Yeah.  He likens Enumeracy to illiteracy, except with numbers.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And in this he talks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He gives wonderful examples.  He talks about how scientific papers and pollsters and all sorts of people like remember the study about how alcohol will kill you.  I drink a day is going to kill you.  You know, if you look at the actual statistics, your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not as much fun, though, Stacey.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just saying that, you know, the first thing when that came out, I found somebody who actually reported the data.  And then I was like, read that.  I was like, oh, OK, I don't need to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Truthiness through statistics, as Midwestern our chat room says.  Would you like to, shall I?  Do we have a changelog today?  I believe we do.  Oh, we do.  Oh, yes.  I am.  It's not easy.  It takes some time to find new stuff from Google because back in the day when Gina Trapani was doing this, Google seemed to be running out new stuff all the time.  They haven't really as much.  But here is the tenth doodle for Google winner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  OK, I'm telling you, I it's not easy doing a changelog every week.  This is listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do you describe this Google doodle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, maybe if I explain that Google asked students to respond to the theme of what inspires me and the winner, first grader Sarah Gomez Lane.  I'll give you Google's description of it.  Delightful dinosaurs to highlight her dream of becoming a paleontologist.  She was the K through three finalist in the Virginia State winner.  And we asked Google writes how she felt upon hearing she was a finalist.  She exclaimed she was surprised.  Her advice to students interested in submitting to future doodle for Google contests.  Try your best to have fun.  She's the first on the left in the front.  This big award ceremony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  18th at Google.  OK, I'm sure I have some other things in the changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, this is a serious one.  There are a lot of veterans working at Google.  Not a surprise.  And Google has decided to help US veterans find jobs to suit their skills by adding new search, a new search term search jobs for veterans in Google.  And you can use your military job code.  M.O.S.A.F.S.C.N.E.C. to narrow down the job listings to those needing the skills you honed in the military.  So there's a new jobs for veterans search term.  I think that's a really nice thing.  That's good.  Helping veterans make their next move in civilian life.  And the blog post came from Matthew Hudson, who's a program manager at Google Cloud.  For seven years, I served in the Air Force as a civil engineer.  My job was to make sure our bases like the ones in Iraq and Afghanistan, where I did three tours of duty, were technologically and logistically prepared for my fellow servicemen and women to do their duty in defense of our country.  I think that's awesome.  I think it's really awesome.  Let's see.  So there you go.  There's something good.  Google Go search for emerging markets can now read website content out loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm excited by this one.  This is the Google Go is the later version of Android and it is for developing markets.  But what I think is potentially true here is a redefining of the definition of literacy, literacy in the get ready for your drinks.  Folks Gutenberg era was all text based.  And now literacy can also be oral.  And you can hear and I think that there's an opportunity.  So it's going to make web pages more accessible to more people.  And yes, yes, folks, it's an effort to expand the Internet into new places and get new people on and make more money for them.  Of course, that's the way the world operates.  But I think it's a good thing.  I think it I think it brings information and knowledge to more people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hindi, English and other actually 28 supported languages.  And what's cool is it reads the text on the page and highlights the word as it's going.  So it is, in fact, I think a way to teach real literacy.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sorry. Did I say real literacy?  Gutenberg, Gutenberg literacy.  Actually, it's interesting because these are basically the Google Go is supposed to run on pretty simple low cost phones.  So the fact they can do this is impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would I would imagine it's local.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I would think so because you can't kind of bandwidth either.  Right. All right.  And well, we're we're down to the the last item on the Google change log.  If you use G board and I know a lot of you do on your Google device, I guess you could use G board on an iPhone to Google is now offering many stickers.  Emojis it creates from your selfies.  The feature uses a combination of machine learning neural networks and artists to illustrations to conjure up the best representation of you.  Can you get my I left my pixel on the desk?  I should be showing this.  Taking into account various characteristics like skin tone, hair color, style, eye color, face shape and facial hair.  The sticker pack.  Oh, here's an animation.  You can see creates a hundred sticker styles based on your personal, personalized avatar with bold or sweet modes.  Do you want which I'm thinking Stacey's bold and Jeff is sweet.  Oh, it's not out yet.  And it might.  That's why I want to check on my pixel to G board version seven point five just came out.  So let me just see if I can do this because I do use G board.  I like G board.  Let me send a message to somebody.  Send one to my lovely wife.  Now, how do I make it?  Let me watch the video.  What is she doing?  OK, it's creating the mini.  OK, customize that's bold or sweet.  OK, so you pick stickers.  OK.  And then, yeah, I don't think I have it yet.  I don't see a create.  No, but you will at some point.  Maybe we all will.  Google look for G board seven five and that is the change.  Such as it is not, I admit, the most exciting, but sometimes there's nothing to say.  Our show today brought to you by now this I'm excited about master class.  I am a big fan of master class.  We talked about master class on on this show before we have indeed and big fans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So master class is, you know, takes this idea of online learning, but gives you the most amazing teachers you've ever heard of.  There's world chess champion Gary Kasparov teaching chess or Annie Leibovitz teaching photography.  Steph Curry teaching you how to dunk.  And these are, by the way, shot beautifully.  Ron Howard, Opie.  Did you know he's a director now?  He teaches direction.  And look how they do this.  I mean, they're really showing the shots.  They're showing the angles.  They're showing you exactly what a professional real director does.  I love it that people like Ron Howard, who certainly doesn't need the money.  Actually asked the master class.  I mean, people, what do you do?  How do you get these?  How do you get these amazing people to your classes?  They said because they want to pay it forward because they actually like the idea of telling teaching people what they know.  The role of the director.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So awesome.  Let you watch me work with the actors and action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought today was a huge improvement.  Are you nuts?  Play to each other. Are you nuts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, a set a beat of looking this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How do you like to learn how to act from Samuel L Jackson?  This is this is my other favorite when I always pull this one up because I love it.  He walks actors through a scene in Pulp Fiction bit by bit and helps them understand, you know, the motivation, what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Quirks that are result.  We're going to do this iconic scene from Pulp Fiction.  When you're at home preparing to break down what he's trying to convey, the person he's speaking to and to the audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The truth is now some people would want to watch this because they want to become actors.  But frankly, I just find this amazingly entertaining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to teach you many different recipes, presentation, how to really make something happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm never going to cook like Puck.  So I'm never going to play tennis like Serena Williams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the moment that you're in, study every system on a spaceship and then boil it down to what I call a one pager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So really, this is as much a document.  Honestly, I think these are just great documentaries, beautifully shot, great information, but they're also classes.  Masterclass.com slash twig. I'm sorry.  This I could go on and on just showing clips from this.  It's so much fun.  Here's any leap of its teaching photography.  They should do one with you.  I am. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they haven't asked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not standing by the phone waiting for the call.  Masterclass.com slash twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just it's my kind of I don't know.  I think if you watch some of our shows, you probably are the kind of person that would love this.  It's my kind of thing.  I guess we could talk about this Fortnite installer thing.  Now, the Tim Sweeney, the CEO of Fortnite's blaming Google for the fact that their launcher could be used for malware.  Actually, it's an interesting question.  So this is we've talked about this before.  Fortnite decided to bypass the Google Play Store, something they couldn't do on Apple.  They've made one hundred fifty million dollars on the Apple Play Store for this game, this battle royale game on iOS.  One hundred fifty million dollars.  Well, they didn't make that much.  That's how much revenue came in.  Apple took a third, so they only made one hundred million.  So when it came time to go on Android, they thought, well, we don't have to go through the Play Store like Apple makes us.  So they did a sideload, which at the time I thought, boy, you know, you're jeopardizing your user's security so you can make more money.  That the optics of that, if nothing else, are bad.  Well, now, and as we mentioned last week, it turned out that the Fortnite installer they initially put out allowed a kind of app in the middle attack.  It was a two part download.  The first part allowed any app on your phone to download a malicious app.  Google disclosed.  Epic Games says that's irresponsible.  They're doing it because they're they're mad at us because we didn't go through the store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I got I know I tend to side with the platforms on this one.  I'm side with Google, too, because, you know, well, go around us and but also users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Also, I think that they needed to do this because it was a it was a live vulnerability.  Epic was already out.  Yeah, Epic fixed it within two hours.  Normally, what would have happened is there's a 90 day responsible disclosure window where Google would go to Epic say before we publish this, and they probably should have done this for publishers.  We're going to give you a chance to fix it since it only took them two hours.  Google security team apparently, according to the register, turned down Epic's 90 day request to publish the information one week after the patch.  Oh, well, the patch was already out.  OK, Google did report the issue to Epic, which immediately started working on a patch.  Put one out one day later.  Two hours after informing Google that it published the fix, Epic security team asked Google to delay publication of the issue report for 90 days.  Oh, why would why would they want to wait 90 days after the patch was out?  Google published one week after the patch.  I'm not sure what's going on.  It seems like I don't.  It feels like Google's trying to do the best thing for its users.  I think so.  That'd be my guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And a little bit of schadenfreude here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like exactly why we thought it was a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we're here to protect users.  And when you have user side load stuff and you make millions of users do that, you're making millions of small, young, unsophisticated users vulnerable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, here's one that Google doesn't look so good on.  We talked before about the privacy issue.  A research paper published by Professor Douglas Schmidt of Vanderbilt University says that Android sucks 10 times more private data from you than your iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But how do you come up with a multiple like that?  You know, showing me naked versus, you know, 10 times you put my location in.  That's a good point.  Which one is 10 times worse?  Yeah, I don't think Apple.  Is it the data points or not the issue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good point.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a qualitative issue.  I don't know. It could be worse.  I don't know. But don't argue with it quantitatively.  Argue with it qualitatively.  What's more harm to you?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right.  But I have to think that Apple doesn't suck as much of your private data in general.  That's a good question.  Stacy, your mic's off.  Oh, that's why she's so quiet.  Oh, I'm so sorry.  I thought we were just boring you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, she thought we were ignoring her.  No, Stacy, we were not.  I couldn't hear you.  We were just playing the strong silent type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I was, my dog had started barking while you were talking, Jeff, and I wanted it to not be.  Dog has to taste it.  Is he scolding me again?  Yep.  No, no. Family just came home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What is going to be your running theme?  Do you want to say something about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just forgot. Oh my gosh, this is just terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, I got one.  Remember IGTV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Remember that?  Nope.  Instagram TV? It was like a month ago.  Oh, that.  Remember that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What happened?  It's still there. Is that the boomerang thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, the one, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the one where creators are supposed to make long form up to two hour videos.  Right.  On a special application, horizontal vertical videos on a special application, not Instagram, but IGTV.  John Constine running on TechCrunch a couple of days ago.  Instagram has never truly failed at anything, but judging by modest initial view counts, IGTV could get stuck with a reputation as an abandoned theater if the company isn't careful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of like IG plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Two months after IGTV's launch, Facebook is not saying anything about uptake.  It's a new, Kevin Systrom, the founder and CEO at Instagram.  And I like Kevin a lot and I love Instagram, even though I just dumped it.  It's a new format. It's different.  We have to wait for people to adopt it and that takes time.  The problem is you've got all these creators who are deciding, should I take the energy and time to make something on IGTV or should I just put it on YouTube or even just Instagram?  And if there aren't a lot of views, they're just going to walk away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, creating a marketplace is terrible, whether it's a marketplace for content or just, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's sensor tower data.  Starting June 18th when IGTV came out, weekly installs kind of a precipitous drop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's hard.  I mean, how many apps do you have on your phone?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, you're a terrible example for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have thousands.  But I have three less now that I've dumped Instagram, Twitter and Facebook and Tumblr.  Four less.  I won't say any.  I'll stop talking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're going to send you, let me track how many emails they send you asking for you to come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, really?  You think I will get some?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I get email.  Like I just stopped using it and I get so many emails.  I don't, I stop reading emails.  And they get increasingly more desperate.  They're like, Stacey, you haven't been on Instagram in a while.  Stacey, what can we do to bring you back to Instagram?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is an app I might get.  We should have added this to the changelog.  It's not from Google.  It's from NASA.  NASA Selfies.  The NASA Selfies app lets you generate snapshots of yourself in a virtual spacesuit,  posing in front of gorgeous cosmic locations like the Orion Nebula or the center of the Milky Way.  Just snap a photo of yourself, pick your background and share on social media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Show us something, Steve, beforehand so you could have already done your selfies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, let me download it real quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This always goes well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a Leo app.  JPL has always done some really interesting apps, actually.  There's quite a few great apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, they do a Madame A, a skill for the Amazon Echo about Mars that Kevin and I really loved.  Is it like just facts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hold on.  It's facts about Mars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like my daily Mars fact.  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's facts.  And they're in-depth.  They're not just normal like Mars is red.  You ask it a question and it will go on for like hours.  Ages.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We've showed before their Spacecraft AR app, which puts space, like the Mars rover on your desktop.  All right.  Wait a minute.  OK.  NASA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Somebody's got to tell them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK.  Before using NASA Selfies, take a moment to read our...  Yeah, right, right.  Allow, allow.  Is this really going to be a sideways video?  Oh, man.  All right.  So they want to get a square photo.  Yeah.  Take a picture of myself.  Oh, look it.  There you are.  That was quick.  There I am in a spaceship in front of the Serpens Cloud Core.  I mean, a spacesuit.  Select that.  I could try the Andromeda Galaxy or just a random one.  Oh, the Horsehead Nebula.  Oh, I want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's pretty.  It is pretty.  Yeah.  And for those of you guys who want it, it's the NASA Mars app.  You enable it and then you can open NASA Mars and you can ask NASA for a Curiosity rover  update or you can ask random Mars facts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's on the Amazon Echo.  Yes.  All right.  So I need to...  I'm going to get a better picture of myself.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's better.  That's much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, there you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm in the Sombrero Galaxy.  Looks like you need a better fitting helmet though.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, that's the point is you really do want to kind of do it close up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let me just save that out and I can post that on the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I don't have a Twitter account.  I'll put that up on Instagram.  Oh, maybe I could just post that on...  You just show us and we'll appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm showing you right now.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're talking to 1987 Leo.  He's going to post that on Instagram.  I'm going to mail you a postcard.  I've got a GeoCities page you can look at it on.  I'm mailing you a postcard of my selfie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Craig Newmark.  He's at it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He is indeed.  My friend Craig, our friend Craig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just gave Mother Jones a left-wing publication, I might add.  $1 million to fight fake news.  Good for you, Craig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.  And full disclosure, I now am a professor at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism,  thanks to Craig's generosity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's actually the Leonard Tao Professor for Journalistic Innovation at the Craig...  Oh, I messed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to have Craig on the show and I forgot to...  Sorry, Al.  When's he going to be on the show?  As soon as you're back.  We'll arrange it.  It better be after I return.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I need you here.  So, awesome.  No, I don't have to be here.  You could do it with...  Jason will be here.  No, no, we need you.  Thank you.  Mother Jones is non-profit.  It focuses on investigative reporting.  It is absolutely...  It is really good.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fun fact, that is the magazine that I dreamed of working for when I started as a journalist,  as a little baby journalist.  Baton Rolling Stone, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess I could post this on Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it does kind of bring home the fact that a lot of these sorts of things are just silly  ways to get you to share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, absolutely.  Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's okay.  I know it's okay.  Do you still have a MySpace?  Do you still have a MySpace?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right, I put it up on my Google+.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Do you literally...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do you still have a MySpace?  Do you still exist?  Tune it.  I will tune it later.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But here...  It's not super high res, frankly.  I'm a little disappointed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Come on, JPL.  Come on.  Put those supercomputers to use.  What the heck?  Let's get those puppies transcoding.  I think it's fairly realistic though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's exactly how I would look if I were floating around the Christmas tree cluster  in a space suit.  All right, so...  I'm a master of the selfie on Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, Lord.  You're pathetic.  I'm pathetic.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We did...  I think we've done everything.  What about Coach?  Say again?  Oh, yeah.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You go catch your plane, man.  No, no, no.  I'm not rushing us.  I got plenty of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How about Toyota investing half a billion dollars in Uber?  What about that, huh?  Making the ride sharing company worth...  Or valued, I guess I shouldn't say worth, valued at $72 billion.  So it's interesting, isn't it?  Toyota obviously interested in the driverless car stuff.  Which is funny because wasn't there a noise that Uber was going to drop its driverless  car research?  Wasn't the board or something saying, you guys should get out of that?  Yeah.  It didn't seem economical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that is a little strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you got another half billion.  Maybe it's more economical than you thought.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, did you see the information article on the difficulties of Waymo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which was hilarious and very true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but then there's also Benedict...  What's his name?  The VC Benedict...  Cumberbatch?  I love him.  No.  Evans.  Benedict Evans.  So he tweeted and he said, everyone he knows in autonomous vehicle world says, this is  years off.  We're just working.  And so all these darn stories, it's more techno panic.  Oh my God.  It's not ready to take over the world.  Nobody who knows what they're talking about is saying that it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they're doing Waymo tests of the Chrysler Pacifica van in Arizona and the suburban  Phoenix.  And apparently the Waymo vehicles are a little hesitant sometimes.  They like entering intersections and pause and stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As opposed to barreling through and killing someone.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it's bothering the humans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love this.  This is Amir Afrati writing at the information.  Two weeks ago, Lisa Hargis, an administrative assistant who works at an office, a stone's  throw from Waymo's vehicle depot said she nearly hit a Waymo Chrysler Pacifica minivan  because it stopped abruptly while making a right turn in an intersection.  Go!  She shouted angrily, she said, after getting stuck in an intersection midway through a  left turn.  Cars have been driving behind the Waymo also stopped.  I was going to murder someone, she said.  And the cars are the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, indeed, go down to the numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Under excessive optimism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yeah, numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Axios says one big thing.  People cause most autonomous vehicle accidents.  And you look at the chart, there is one accident in California caused by the autonomous vehicle.  The six accidents caused by autonomous vehicles were caused by the person driving it at the  time manually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Waymo vehicle, Afrati writes, is generally programmed to follow every world rule precisely.  That may mean stopping for at least three seconds at a stop sign.  Whether human drivers like it or not.  And turning on its blinkers.  Well, before it makes a lane change.  So you can see that the problem is that people are rear-ending the thing.  Because it's not.  Because it's actually following the law.  How dare you stop at a stop sign?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it looks like in some of these cases, it's pausing in a way that people are not  anticipating to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Well, probably also Stacey, that example though, wasn't the lady like starting to barge into  the intersection?  So it was cautiously saying, uh-oh, she might hit me.  I better stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Well, no, I think it was more a function of the, I mean, having been behind people who  drive this way drives me absolutely nuts.  You're like, oh, they're going.  It's a, you know, left turn yield kind of situation.  You're just like, you make the commitment, you go and you're ready to keep going.  So you can also get in before those cars.  And so when they stop, you're like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A timid driver sometimes is more of a problem than an aggressive driver.  Especially if they're surrounded by aggressive drivers.  One of the problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The daughter drives at the speed limit.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  That drives people crazy.  So when I drive at the speed limit, I feel like I'm a hazard.  People come right up to your butt and go, and so I always now drive seven miles.  I set my, my Tesla to drive seven miles above the speed limit.  Cause I figure you're not going to get a speeding ticket, but people won't be so nutty.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People are always nutty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So one of the problems the Waymo has, according to Amir, is the Zoolander problem.  Like the movie character Zoolander, Waymo's minivans have issues turning left.  Specifically unprotected left turns.  That's when a left turning vehicle, you know, doesn't have the right of way.  There's oncoming traffic.  And in places where there are no left turn lanes, the vans, just like human drivers,  get confused by drivers in oncoming traffic who don't turn on their blinkers to signal  whether they'll take a left turn and continue straight.  And some drivers make such wide turns in front of the Waymo vans, the vans react defensively.  So it's the humans.  We're terrible.  Vans get confused if they approach a line of cars in the road, waiting their turn to  enter a driveway, such as malls or other busy retailers.  Confused means, I guess what, they stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's trying to parse the situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and it doesn't want to just do something until it understands the situation.  So that means it pauses.  And that drives humans nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Barreling ahead is probably not a great plan.  I think this is we you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's going to have to be some acclimatization of the humans, not just as riders, but also as drivers.  There will be these like think of them as like student drivers.  If a Friday says it's like student drivers, they're very, very good student drivers, but they're a little cautious.  So you just got to be more patient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You become normative driving.  And does it does it hold to a flow?  And do you have an indemnification against them?  The law says, yeah, it's safer for you to actually violate the law than it is for you not to.  Because they can program it that way easily.  They can program it to stay in the flow, especially once they're all communicating with each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the thing. Once you get the humans out, that's going to be the other side of this is they're going to be whizzing around like crazy.  Because they know because you don't have to worry if the car has got a blinker on or not.  You know exactly what the car is going to do.  Oh, yeah, he's going that way.  So I'm going to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's not true.  I often pause when people have their blinkers on because a lot of people in Texas, they just drive with their blinkers on.  The fake blinker.  That's more dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You assume they're turning and they plow right into you.  I never assume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just like, yeah, this person could just be high, drunk, who knows, Austinite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Lisa's son is fifteen and a half.  So we're trying to model good driving.  And that's one of the things Lisa's really good.  She's saying, OK, I see that guy backing out of the driveway.  Do you think he sees me?  And really kind of talking through these decisions that we unconsciously make.  But Michael has to learn how to make.  And it is a lot of good driving is very defensive driving.  People are terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, my mom used to my mom, actually, she used to like, don't look at your mirrors.  Who's behind you?  What color is the car?  You know, she would just quiz me periodically.  Oh, I'll say it was it was really useful.  That's great. I learned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to do that.  I'm going to do that.  All right. Let's take a break and we'll wrap things up and then I will.  Then you'll get on your own.  Ramon Iberico is waiting for me along with a nice big glass of sangria.  Our show today brought to you by our new messaging platform.  It's so interesting.  Everybody in the studio is saying, when is when is when are we converting?  Because we've been using hip chat.  Hip chat got acquired in some confusing deal with by Slack and hip chats going to be replaced by Slack.  We were using hip chat, but we had used Slack before when we did the website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And then it turns out I didn't know this, but Megan and Jason had secretly been using Slack for some time to coordinate their news show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because people love Slack.  And and so now everybody's saying, OK, when Megan yesterday say, I can't download it anymore.  Yes, you can. No, I can't. I need Slack.  Slack is a collaboration hub for whatever work you do with Slack.  The right people on your team are kept in the loop.  It's so much better than email.  Information you need is always at your fingertips.  The teamwork happens in channels, letting you organize conversations and information around teams, projects, offices, whatever you want.  People who drink tea, not coffee, whatever you want.  And then everything you need is in one place.  It's faster and easier to get things done.  We did look at alternatives.  And, of course, you know, there are lots of alternatives out there.  Everybody wants to be Slack, but nobody really quite is Slack.  I asked Russell, well, what do you need?  And we had, I think, seven or eight integrations he absolutely had to have applications we use, including Atlassian, Jira and Confluence.  We needed Panopto, which keeps an eye on our servers.  And Slack does it. Slack integrates with more than one thousand apps.  Salesforce, Zendesk, Google Drive.  You can make Slack be your central hub of everything you do.  No more searching for emails for that follow up or searching through multiple systems to find what you're looking for.  You don't have to switch across multiple tabs and platforms to keep updated.  It's all there. It's secure.  It's fast. It's easy.  And it's fun. And I don't want to.  I think you shouldn't deprecate that notion either.  People want to use it.  You can have another solution. And if people don't use it, who cares?  People love Slack. With Slack, your team is better connected.  Learn more at Slack, SLACK.com.  Stuart Butterfield. This was his startup after he sold Flickr off, right, to Yahoo.  And man, did he do it right. He learned quite a few lessons.  I think it was his third startup.  Initially, they were going to do a game and then they made it into Flickr.  And then he sold that. And this is an awesome, awesome job.  Slack.com. We thank Slack for their support.  And we're all very excited about moving over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you going to have a Slack group for us for the show?  You bet. Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you like Slack? Will you use it?  Yes, I do. I do.  I think I've never met anybody who doesn't like Slack.  No. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of a time waster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the only complaint you ever hear is it's too much fun.  But you can control that.  When we were doing the website, we had, I mentioned this before,  a plug-in that anytime you said, that's nice, which I apparently say a lot,  maybe they were trying to get me to stop saying that.  I would say, that's nice. And a Borat picture would show up.  It would say, that's nice.  In fact, it worked because I stopped saying that.  So maybe that was the point.  The thing I did love is we had an Alex Trebek bot.  And I could just say, Alex, let's play Jeopardy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So if you're worried about productivity,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  you might want to leave those integrations out.  But there's lots of useful stuff.  Jeff, actually, let's start with Stacey and her thing of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My thing of the week is, okay, are you guys ready for this?  It is a smart olive oil bottle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How smart is it?  Oi.  Oi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's pretty smart.  It's actually not that smart.  Okay, so this is a, I think it's a $60 bottle.  And you guys are looking at it.  So the cool thing about it, I know, it's like, come on, you guys.  So the cool thing is, it is designed with glass, so it's darker,  so your oil doesn't get, have a lot of light hit it,  which is bad for your olive oil.  And then it's a refill program.  So when you're 80% through your olive oil, it glows.  Which you're like, do I care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is the Juicero of olive oil bottles.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So then you, so then you, for 12 bucks, you get a refill.  In a bag.  You can have olive oil in a bag.  Well, that's actually kind of nice because that's easier to ship.  I'm a pro bag and you just stick it in there.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's less wasteful.  Oh, I can imagine this PowerPoint to propose this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They have a small, they're Dutch though, which is not known as an olive oil nation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, yeah, I mean, this is more, this is not something I would buy.  And I use a lot of olive oil.  But if, you know, you're interested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can I show you, can I show you my pick of the week?  Oh, sure.  Yeah.  You put the olive oil in these squeeze bottles.  They're about a buck each.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it was Kenji Lopez alt.  These are actually awesome.  And you know what you do?  What?  This is, this is the pro tip everyone on the side, mark out your favorite dressing recipes.  So like a quarter cup of olive oil, you know, half a cup of lemon juice, and then you shake them up.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have, you buy these a dozen at a shot.  I mean, like a buck each.  I have one next to the stove that's filled with that delicious olive oil.  We have a sponsor that's an olive oil sponsor, Tres Pontas, and it's really good.  So I keep that there.  And then I have another one that is my vinaigrette, which is balsamic olive oil, a little Dijon mustard, salt and pepper.  You shake it up and I squirt it on everything.  It's fabulous.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Fabulous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So then you do the recipe though on the side and then people can make it when you're out.  Oh, that's smart.  Isn't that so like you're no longer the dressing kid.  Like in my house, they're like, Stacey, could you, could you whip up some of your hazelnut dressing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I'm like, I have a dressing I make with instead of olive oil.  I use cashews.  You soak them and then you put them in the Vitamix and it liquefies them.  Cashew milk.  Yeah, it makes it amazing.  It's a popular vegan cream.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You, that's like half the steps of a vegan queso right there.  Oh, you had me at queso.  Vegan.  I said vegan queso.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So there's no cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. It's cashew cream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How does it taste?  I think that's against the law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's why you have to move to Seattle because you're not allowed to be in Texas anymore because you violated queso statute.  But wait, it's a popular vegan queso.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It may not be as bad as, you know, chipotle queso.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, nothing's as bad as chipotle queso.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, Stacey, I want your bottle.  What your bottle should come with, Annie Brains, is gin.  Ah, now you're talking.  Gin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Get empty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Give me the bag of gin, honey.  I would love that.  I would love the mail order gin.  Unfortunately, blue laws make that difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  You're probably in a state where you can't get that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't ship alcohol here for anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  California, everything goes.  You can ship pot.  You can ship anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, and I have this awesome gin and I can't get it delivered to me.  It's from Utah.  And I'm like, God, what's the name of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll have it delivered to me and then drink it for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Excellent.  Beth, great plan.  It's called, it's by Beehive Distillery.  It's called Jackrabbit Gin.  If you guys can take it, like, get it.  Oh, it's amazing gin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had a really good, I didn't have it, but I just sniffed the,  my drinking colleagues gin and Buenos Aires.  Local gin, it was really wonderful smell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So is it the combination of botanicals that makes this so good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is.  It is a really delicious gin.  Juniper is king.  It is Juniper forward, but it's also kind of sweet.  It's a nice mix.  It's good for a G&T.  It's good for a G&T.  It actually is amazing in an aviation.  So, oh, and you know what else it's good in?  What?  Southside, which we've been drinking a lot here in Texas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, what would Southside be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is three quarters cup or three quarters cup,  three quarters of an ounce of simple three quarters,  lime juice, some mint leaves and two ounces of gin.  Oh, okay.  Easy, easy.  That's like an aviator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's similar to an aviator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was talking about an aviation, an aviation.  An aviation, I mean.  Yeah.  No, an aviation is lemon juice, creme de violet and gin and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can you come to my house and I will get the beehive?  If you'll make the salad dressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Excellent.  Done.  Done.  Mr. Jeffrey Jarvis, you have a number for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You haven't given them all away, have you?  But I've got one.  I got one thanks to Ms.  Stacey Higginbotham.  Oh, yeah.  Who was thinking of me on Twitter.  And I'm grateful.  And I said, oh, oh, as soon as I saw it from Mr.  Kevin Toffle.  Who says that the LTP picks up to could end up having LTE,  which is what I've been wanting to have.  I love this from Kevin's post on about Chromebooks.  During my daily scan of the FCC database today.  Oh, Lord.  Does for that's hard for jobs.  Yeah.  So he's come across that.  That'd be really nice.  I'd like that if I could take my my combination laptop tablet,  whatever the heck it is anywhere in the world.  I'm going to bet it's going to be Google Fi compatible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think you're actually the world is on your side on this one,  Jeff, because of 5G.  I think that most devices, including laptops, will be wireless enabled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If your stupid watch has LTE, why doesn't your device where you're  watching things and doing things all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I think you'll see LTE everywhere soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The question is, what are the what are the plans going to be?  I think that's where Google can make a difference with Fi.  I mean, I hope it doesn't charge some ridiculous monthly fee for having it,  but it just puts you into your data feed, whatever it is.  And then that's easy.  Then I just have multiple devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I will be taking T-Mobile and Google Fi.  And remember, I learned that Google Fi does not work in Monaco.  So I will walk a couple of blocks to France.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I will.  What happens for me?  Does this happen for you with Fi?  I like I hit Buenos Aires and it took like four hours for it to recognize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  It goes right away because I like to check in to four square the minute I land wheels down.  Can I do I can I keep my four square?  No, I can only keep social media.  No one uses. That's my rule now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I'm on Google, my space, my space, Mastodon.  I will be I will be tooting.  I guess. What about Snapchat?  Where does that go? It's right out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Too popular. Maybe if it goes downhill a little more, it has a show.  I was like, it's it's not it's on its way out.  As soon as no one uses it, I'll be there.  Excellent. Actually, I think that's a pretty good rule of thumb for social media.  Only use social media. No one else is using because you find no one there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's any social media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I will also be carrying this to have global Wi-Fi with me.  This is the Skyroam.  I we we tried it in Japan.  We it worked really well. It's not cheap.  It's I think nine dollars a day for unlimited for five devices.  Ninety nine dollars for the month.  But but between me and Lisa, ninety nine dollars.  This is much better than Verizon or T-Mobile.  Well, T-Mobile, what about your five?  Five is ten bucks a gigabyte.  So but is five going to be as fast?  So I will in a way be testing all of these devices.  I had used it in Japan and really liked it.  It was a real because I don't have fi on every device and I have it on my laptop.  I guess I could do a hot spot.  It's called the Skyroam Solus.  You can rent it or buy it.  It's like 150 bucks to buy.  It's basically a it's like a my five.  But what I like about it's a little bit bigger, which means you can use it also to charge your phone.  It's a battery pack as well.  And and it's global.  It's totally global, which is really cool.  So you don't have to change SIMs or anything.  It just works. Ninety nine bucks.  And that's important because I'm going to be in seven different countries in three weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So does the does the do you buy time that expires or any of that?  No, it doesn't expire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, yes, you do. You subscribe.  You either get a day pass, which expires at the end of the day.  But there's no there's no bandwidth cap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They say it's a day pass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nine dollars a day.  And I'm but I'm going to do the ninety nine dollars for the month because we're going for three weeks.  So it'll be a better deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And it's ninety nine dollars for the puck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think the puck's one hundred fifty.  I'm not sure. One hundred fifty.  Yeah. OK. But you could rent it.  Oh. And if you rented it for ten dollars a day, if you know, if you didn't use it all the time, that would make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ten dollars a day is actually what Verizon charges for daily Internet access on your phone.  That's right. And AT&T, I think, charges that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they're there. Yeah.  Ninety nine is the better deal if you're going to be gone long enough.  If you're only gone a week, it's not worth it.  But if you're gone two weeks, then it would be a better deal.  And there somebody told me there are bandwidth caps.  I never ran into them.  So I'll give you I'll give you a report when I get back.  But this is this is going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you need to use it and join us on Twig, actually.  I don't know if it's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
