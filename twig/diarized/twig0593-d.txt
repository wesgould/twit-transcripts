In fact, oh, yeah, according to mother

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They did

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Motherboard they hired a company called IRI consultants  It's a union avoidance firm kind of like the Pinkerton's a detective firm  The parent there was this motherboard article said that they these this  Union busting firm, which is what it really is compiles dossiers on employees  They didn't get information about their Google research, but they got a spreadsheet created  In an attempt to thwart a union drive at two Seattle hospitals in  2019 and every employee was in the spreadsheet  categorized by  personality temperament motivations ethnicity family background spouse  It's kind of like what you would do if you guys there. That's just their HR file  Everybody I'm sure spouses employment finances health issues work ethic job performance disciplinary history and involvement in union activity  Each employee was then giving a rating for how likely the company believed they were to vote for the union in  One and notes for one employee according to motherboard IRI consultants wrote they were lazy  money oriented aloof  from Samoa  Tired of people on team and doesn't want to assist them and told the managers the union is full of crap  This is gold this is like what you do in jury selection, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that would hurt that I take that as an assault right you could say I'm from Samoa, but don't say I'm sympathetic

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm hopeful that part of it, you know, I didn't see the whole thing  But maybe that's more because I focus on technical stuff. I think I'm I don't know. I don't think you're sympathetic

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you  Listen and understand you're not out to get anybody  Maybe they maybe if you're in PR somebody who's not out to get you is sympathetic  probably

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some of my stories, I mean obviously there there are two classes of stories when you're a cub reporter  There's your basic news and then there's the profiles  They assign you to get everybody on your beat accustomed to you and those I never felt as bad if someone said it was a good  story  Right. Okay. That's fair. Yeah, but yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Was pre-used long pre but I still take great pride in is it because you reviewed the Cosby show, yeah  Yeah, yes. Well because I said when I'm former TV critic the TV guy critic. Don't forget  We have to add that to my lower third  so I  I liked Cosby. I loved Cosby in the early days, but then we got preachy. I said so he got raged. He sent me a  A  Tin cup and said, you know, where are the flowers for my funeral? It made no sense. That's what he did. I  When we started entertainment weekly, I had a fake cover that was on the junk mail that said kiss Cosby  Goodbye, it was about about Murphy Brown and Roseanne Barr and he had he managed to find a copy and got very at the time  Very expensive work done to have it redone kiss Jarvis.

He said hey there's Jeff Jarvis that no  I wasn't there. I wasn't there  I'm driving the next morning Saturday morning  I'm listening the radio because with us when we had radio hey kids used to be that that we we turned it on and it  Came through the air  I know and so somebody said did you hear about Sinatra last night?  He stopped in the middle of singing my way to go on a rant and call me a bum Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Honestly, you very well put my rant. That's the very first thing I'd put on the list  Sinatra call me a bum that should be on your tombstone. That's awesome. Well, it might have been so friends sent me

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Black flowers afterwards because I was gonna Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  anyway back to Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We really went down a rabbit hole there  So that's not the apparently according to motherboard IRI consultants was asked but they had no comment  But there is another consultant from at least one other union avoidance firm  So they got a wall. Yeah  So Google the the other shoe that dropped on this is the Google's  several hundred Google employees have now  Unionized which is something that does not happen often in Silicon Valley the alphabet workers union  400 Google engineers and other workers engineers is important because those are the most valuable workers at Google  Those are the ones that you work the hardest to get you recruit hard. You want to get the best?  There's a lot of competition  And it's hard for Google to piss them off as you know, because when the engineers have said no  We don't want to do that defense work Google said, okay  Having them unionized is a big deal  the union they'll the alphabet workers union  Was organized in secret according to the New York Times for the better part of a year elected its leadership last month  They're part of the communication workers of America

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which actually now have job security?  Yeah, do they?  Apparently, yeah, you can't know if Google fired any of them  Yeah, they've got their pictures on the unions pay homepage. They're right homepage. Yeah, the pictures are there  No, you cannot fire them. You get deep trouble. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  CWA is is very it's a problem for many telcos and they also represent media too, apparently

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Didn't Google see this coming though considering all of the that's why they hired all those pink

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why the hair of the companies. Yeah, you know, yeah the alphabet workers  Union is a so-called minority union because Google has  260,000 employees and only 400 union members  Workers said it was primarily an effort to give structure and longevity to activism at Google rather than negotiate for contract  And that's because Google has been it's alleged  Pretty active in  censoring punishing even firing activists  at Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's low wait wait wait wait wait, let's also say that they're not negotiating because they're all paid incredible amounts of money, right?  And so it's you know, unless you're a guard and they are letting the freelancers in but but basically  Googlers are so damn rich that to have this to have them poor mouth as a union in gun play very well  So it's a different matter. Yeah, that's exactly what the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chewie Shaw an engineer at Google and vice chair of the Union's Leadership Council said our goals  Love the name chewy our goal name chewy. I want to be named after a wookie apparently our goals  Our goals go beyond the workplace questions of are people getting paid enough our issues are much broader  It is a time where a union is an answer to these problems  Google's director of people operations Kara Silverstein says we've always worked hard to create a supportive and rewarding marketplace  I'm sorry workplace for our workforce  Our employees have protected labor rights that we support and as we've always done we'll continue engaging directly with all our employees  So I don't know. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really  Really interesting and it could be a debacle in the sense  so what I think is most interesting is that this is having both the engineering and  The contract workers which if you look at the tech industry the tech industry is like if you're not an engineer  What is your freaking point you're like a freeloader on the back right we're carrying you  Yes, so and that's that that's if you're a professional like accounting marketing CFO or if you're god  Help you a janitor driver  So I think the fact that all of these are together  Could be good if it helps engineers  understand the concerns that other  workers have  But it also could be a debacle because the engineers are gonna want and aim for things that a bus driver is like  They're good. I I don't care about this. So I just think  It will be interesting to see given the power  dynamics here and the perceived value that engineers have if they will  Use that only to their advantage if they'll learn  Or if it will just not work because they can't come together

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So our chat room says that they should let the wookie win  Not the only Silicon Valley company to be unionized a Kickstarter employees have unionized  Glitch this is from the New York Times article and a small group of contractors at a Google office in Pittsburgh  unionized last in 2019 and of course  Amazon warehouse workers are set it to vote in the next coming months about unionizing  There tends to be among young people and among the white-collar workers and elite  in this  Generation kind of an anti-union sentiment like why they first say it hates unions not in media. Yeah, I'm an union guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm after all that. Yeah, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the you the Google  Alphabet workers and Union has to pay 1% of their salary to Union Union dues people don't like that  If you're well, if you're already well compensated and you get good vacation time your benefits are good  You might say well, what's the Union gonna do for us, you know that we can't do already  There is definitely anti-union sentiment in this guy. Why does Andrew hate unions? He doesn't even

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, he used to actually way back in the day he worked for AT&T and  He

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also, you know from CWA, you know CWA, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He he and he's he's he's an old-school Republican. I'll be honest. I mean we we have very different views on the world  I don't know where he stands now. I mean, I know he's not that the today Republican because that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that was only when he was working that's cause for  AT&T

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Conservative and he's very pro capitalism, although he's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's doing a lot of work unions unions balance unions balance the capitalist point of view as well  I think Amazon warehouse workers are perfect example of a group that should unionize. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sort of half and half on it. I get it from an employer standpoint if I were in that  leadership role like you mr. LaPorte and  Versus being someone in the warehouse. I very diplomatic of you to say that  But it's I see both sides of it  Queen Pruitt could have been a part of a union at one point in time  And I remember discussing it with her and saying, you know, there's there's some good things because they can offer you certain  Protections in its rare quotes. That's right that you can't get yourself. It's collective bargaining

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think that there's a lot to be said for that  But I also but there's also lots of examples of corrupt unions corrupt union

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, there's a lot of others there's you can't I mean if by that argument I could say well  Capitalism and business just sucks because there's so many great capital. That's a good point  Yeah, yeah, I mean they're they're a counter their reaction to the overwhelming power that that's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Businesses and corporations have over people. Yes, and you could say the United Auto Workers really improved a lot of  workers on Ford's  Assembly line and other companies assembly lines. They really were a very powerful union  And then perhaps went with a little bit in the wrong direction with Jimmy Hoffa and so forth

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Power it's corrupt corrupting you. Yeah  So here's my wish here's my dearest wish I  Want at least a special if not a sequel from Silicon Valley with episodes about the Google Union  Imagine Oh  Picket line that would be awesome. They're all they're going on the picket line on motorized  Scooters or skateboards, right? I think they get free lunch there  What would a Google picket line look like it would be full of segues?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm worried about as a union. They're like focused on things like free lunch or enough vegetarian options when  The concerns of other workers we're striking for more vegetarian

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that was always what Silicon Valley did is they created an environment

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not merely to bust unions because that was also how they recruited  Because that was also how they recruited but they really created an environment where you wouldn't want a union because you were so happy  Because you had nap pods and free lunch and free dry cleaning and you know multicolored bicycles  So I can understand that Silicon Valley does it it is antithetical to the idea of moving fast and breaking things  It's just more of an impediment and people like, you know, Larry Page  They don't want they don't want any regulations getting away. They want to they want to innovate freely  I understand the tension there. I really do

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So remember when everyone talked about Google being the best place to work in the USA remember all of those press public publications and  Where is that now?  Are people still trying to model after that type of environment for the workplace or to say oh, well, you know what they  Overstep their bounds a little bit being a little too friendly to me. Yeah, we're friendly. What do you think Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You wrote the book. What would Google do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's a really interesting question. It's really interesting and and yeah, you know  Google number one place to work was often a number of the week on the show  because it came up and and  That's really interesting that because in a way did they did they screw themselves if you compare let's compare for a second  How about this Amazon versus Google? Right? So Google here's the bikes. Here's the lifetime benefits  Here's the free lunch. Here's all the swag. Here's everything you want. Here's all this right Amazon never went that route  Amazon said this is a job and we're gonna be hard asses on you very famously. They didn't have desks

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They had doors on sawhorses, right? Jeff Bezos established his food. Yeah, he established this kind of  Frugality as a company value

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the last two companies that I worked for were just  Wildly different far as culture goes and the first company we did try to have a bit of that fun  environment the way Google tried to do it with with their people with having a lot more outings and  Just little random activities throughout the day all while getting our work done  I really hate those give me money hours was a lot of fun and then it started in the  Nicer car  It started an IT department  But I noticed that it trickled over to the other departments and it just sort of made the place just a great place to work  People were really happy to drive and a word for us  And no, hold on and then I went to the next company and it was like a whole 180 flip. It was  Totally different. Nobody knew who each other were  leadership was  You know, they just did what they needed to do check the numbers and they went on about the business and everybody else just  Did their job and that was fine too because you didn't have to worry about a lot of political crap  You just hey, are we working today? Yes, we're working today get the job done go home in the store

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so I had to answer your question. I just looked up the glass door best places to work 2020  Everyone I guess what number one is it's a it's a technology  Footlock force  Zappos HubSpot HubSpot

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the company that are  No, it's in Boston  Boston, okay. That's the company that our dear friend wrote that mocking book about  Andrew Keane, Dan Lyons, that's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Dan Lyons, right right exactly number two is Bain and company because they're all effing rich  Number three is docu-sign get this number four four ready in and out burger because the french fries, right?  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because they give their employees health care and they have they pay more than minimum wage  And the french fries are darn good the french fries are pretty good  But you end up smelling like french fries when you go from that's true. So it's a it's a it's a mix

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We sit down the win-win companies. I haven't heard of a Lawrence Livermore lab is number six. Hey, let's make some nuclear bombs  That's a fun thing to do every day  They do  Labs are awesome. I know I know well when I worked at the examiner I did a story on Lawrence Livermore inventing the neutron bomb  So Lawrence Livermore has done some things that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, I just got a breaking story from Mike Isaac who is a New York Times tech reporter. He says  Facebook has remember  You may remember if you listen to this later in the week that as we recorded this the Capitol building had been stormed  The president posted on his Twitter account and his Facebook account a video saying I love you  Thank you. Yeah, we won but go home and  That video has now been removed from Facebook. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Twitter put up a rule that you couldn't like it or retweet it, but you could quote tweet it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I saw that on Twitter, but dang Facebook totally pulled it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's according to Mike Isaac and they finally found some cuts. Yeah Wow  it's interesting because  He does say go home. Yeah, he says

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But he did say hey people we need to do the right thing go home. Let's keep everybody safe, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that's a wink. It was still inciting. They're interested in both Twitter and Facebook seem to agree on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not I mean he did he's already incited and now he can sit back and be like, oh exactly. Okay y'all go home

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah  All right, you want to know what number of Google is the top 100 places to work work what yes, please

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it below in and out burger? Because honestly if you have a choice, I take in and out. I mean I take it's below Southwest Airlines  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Southwest is not a bad place to work. Yeah, it's number 11. Oh  That's not terrible

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  14 is Trader Joe's where's Apple on that list?  Say hit search way down there  84 84

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple says we don't need your list. We're Apple. Oh, yeah, Apple's not a fun place to work. Yeah, I know they're mean Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That that I know so many people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know so many people including people who work worked for us who took jobs at Apple now  honestly, I I think Google would be a great place to work, but  It just seems to me that it would be a really fun place to work, but  who knows I  Really would rather work at Google. They're not taking into account pay scales because  Honestly, I think the lowest paid employee Google probably makes more than the best paid in and out burger

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but not everybody is motivated by I mean money after a certain pay point. You're kind of like am I  Crushing people's spirits by taking this job and you know, it's like working for Palantir  Some people would do it but not everybody so is where's Microsoft on the list?  I'd say I would work for Microsoft. Yeah, I'd say the pretty high Microsoft

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They probably have climbed over the last decade. What what you want? Where's 21 Microsoft is Facebook even on the list?  I don't know. I wouldn't want to work for Facebook. Not now what he's probably not now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As low as Google is ranked it's still a best among its peers, which is interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and Facebook is better than Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What where's Salesforce?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Salesforce is is number 12. I think it is. Oh right after Google. No, no, I'm sorry. I'm wrong wrong wrong. That's LinkedIn, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They all they're all look like LinkedIn and Microsoft are now the same commercial same company. Salesforce is 34

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Below Wegmans on 30  Anyway, anyway, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Numbers for that. Yeah, you get credit you got numbers. You're done with numbers for the next six weeks  Google has a new oh should I save this for a change log? Or is this the nest cam? No, it's not out yet  That'll be a change. I thought it was a very long. That's why I brought it up  I wanted to give Stacy some throw her bone. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't need your bones

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google confirms plans for new nest cam lineup  I've used the nest cam IQ outdoors, but that's apparently now discontinued  You can't buy that  Yay  Why yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm just I I don't think I don't think well, here's what I think needs to happen  They need to redo their lineup with an eye towards today's costs because yeah $300 for a camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, is way beyond what wise and yeah, and you credit to wise for bringing that number

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Way down. Yeah, even I mean even logitech cameras the Arlo cameras, which are expensive but are not that expensive. So  anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google says it will continue to support  Its existing cameras with security updates and even new features  And they haven't released anything since 2017. In fact, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, they released it. Oh and the nest camera and then in the camera line. Yeah, okay  Yeah, I think what they're doing if we look at Google's like smart home device strategy  And I actually think this is not a terrible thing. They focus on cameras  Then they do a refresh to the thermostat then they do  Usually something different right? So I don't think you need a new camera every year. For example, right?  I think it's totally reasonable to go three years

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  According to an FCC filing they have also  Preparing a new nest hub. That's their  The kid the screen thing with solely gestures  Those are the gestures they built in the pixel 4 never took advantage of them and eliminated pixel 5  That's where you stop and swipe and all of that stuff. I think that might be useful in something static like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It should and I don't know we talked about this on our show this morning, but  It's also having peripheral devices available that run with Bluetooth and you're also see thread  So that's three really significant radio announcements there  thread because I think that's gonna be the  Format for communicating using project connected home over IP, right?  three  The Bluetooth peripherals means something maybe sensors  I don't I'm trying to figure out what you'd like having your hub talk directly to things via Bluetooth. It's kind of neat

Transcript:  Directly to things via Bluetooth is kind of neat. I there is something happened to my so there's two kinds of nest hubs  There's one with a camera the hub max and then there's one without a camera, which is the one in my bedroom  Now when the when I come within proximity the one with the camera it says oh hi Leo. Here's your calendar  Here's some you know  It knows it's me because it recognizes me and it makes a sound and you know, it kind of announces it see me  Just lately in the last few weeks the one without the camera has started noticing I'm around and I'm baffled  Which one little screen no, no, no, it's Google. That's a nest. I'm in it  It's the little nest hub camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Using your phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your phone I don't it must recognize maybe I don't know  I haven't it's just the same kind of thing that happens with the one with the camera is now starting to happen with a little one  When I'm in the proximity to it and I thought that is not that's that's bizarre  They're saying now Scuder X says it uses sonics

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to do oh is this  Yeah, it could be although are you though?  It how would it recognize Leo or does it recognize people or does it just automatically think a person is you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good question  ultrasound sensing on the nest Sonic in the nest hub  That takes you to another level of convenience  By  Customizing your favorite Google Nest display depending on your distance from your device

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what we thought was solely last time but it wasn't it was the ultrasound uses the speakers in the microphones

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To determine whether a person I guess yeah, you're right. It doesn't know who it is is  Approaching within approximately four to six feet your devices speaker will amiss soft sighing sounds. Oh, no  Soft  That was just me fugue state. Sorry soft inaudible  ultrasonic  Soft inaudible ultrasonic pulses  Which are reflected off nearby objects in the room the microphones so it's using it's using  sonar to detect me  Wow  Occasionally other things in your home environment may cause ultrasonic noise and may disrupt it for a brief period  Wow  That's okay. Now. That's that's a little bit on the creepy line

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A year ago, it's not creepy  Like it's it's basically saying there is something here. You should interact with it. You are here

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh  Heavy breathing that's creepy

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But if it's just like Amazon on the other hand is gonna watch what we call it aware computing self-aware computing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember that conversation last. Okay. I must have forgotten. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You do more shows than we do about this. I must have forgot

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Freaked me out. Yes, we talked about it. How do you know I'm here? I know how my

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Other one yes, I guess yeah, it's less intrusive than a camera and remember if you're farther away  And you ask at the temperature it'll give it to you a big type and if you get closer it'll smush it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yeah, supposedly we'll do that. Yeah  I know look it I'm obviously not completely up on what mine can do because I just recently discovered I could watch TV on it  Because I subscribe to YouTube TV and I found out I could say hey  Hey nest hub play  CNN on YouTube TV and I can so I can last night when I went to bed and I was following the election results  And I got tired. I just turned it on there and was lulled to sleep by wolf blitzers gentle  When you tell it how long to play it so serrations to go off. Yeah, it has a sleep as a sleep timer. Yeah  That's kind of nice. You can watch the ballgame

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could just go to sleep or I just couldn't sleep

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what I've ordered you have sleep and sonar we should we should just jump ahead for one second to the Amazon story  online  67 just piss you off  Not actually it's a democracy I decided okay contact when we were on the other on the year-end twitch show  Our relationship shocked the other participants like why you guys really have a strange  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't say this doesn't use sonar radar

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Radar sleep apnea tracker. So this is actually like so  Solely I'll tie it to Google for you here Google's projects solely also uses millimeter wave they use  Radar as well to detect gestures pretty close what this is doing again  This I don't think this is creepy, but it is important to understand how this works  It emits the signal and  It when it uses that the bounce back to see what you're doing and it's basically what Amazon's doing  That's worth noting is that it's created an algorithm to watch how you breathe to this and that's obviously machine learning because

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, it's not something you could say. Well if it goes  That that's  Snoring it has to kind of you have to put a bunch of sleepers in front of it about not breathing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right now I don't know it's doing the sound. I think it's it's sensing. No, I understand it is exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's it's it's looking at some part of either the rise and fall of your chest or  The way your head jerks back. Can it see air? Can't breathe. Can it see the movement of air?  I wonder think about how a bat uses sonar right or think how literally how radar works

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're throwing it you're throwing the RF signal out, right?  And  It it runs into something it lets you know, I ran into this  This is what that looks like and the algorithm they figured out that they they're running against this is  There they know what the pattern of sleep apnea looks like right before that radar

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Obviously with having done a lot of machine training. Yes. Yes. This is this is not something, you know  You wouldn't necessarily know how to look for sleep apnea before you headed into this  This is a big push for Amazon into health tech  We've talked about the halo fitness tracker

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They did kill their haven effort the health insurance effort with JP Morgan. Did they oh they ended up? Yep  Yep, and the buffet. Yeah, they did that bus. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We really thought they were gonna start to get into the health insurance business. That's interesting  They did just launch their pharmacy service though, right?  If you you can you can send them your prescription and they'll fulfill it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kind of like they're not leasing jets anymore either they actually bought by and jets they're buying the jets

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Big Seattle news  They buy new ones or used ones

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Delta and WestJet take that Boeing. Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, at least they bought Seattle Company jets, right? Yep, I don't actually know yeah 767 300

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, 11 of them they normally lease the 767 400s, but  There's also the race was too good to pass up. Oh gosh, I just drew a blank they could have just snapped up all the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  737 maxes it would have been you know, who cares if cargo goes down  No, I'm joking. Obviously

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The max is now flying again the max I know would you get on it?  Yeah, I would so I ordered it's actually waiting on my doorstep right now, I think this might be crazy. They're Maki  Yeah, no, I did that's not waiting for me. I wish it were I don't know whatever  Supposedly I have an order in but I don't know where it is. But that's another story for another day  Bose makes the strangest in-ear buds ever because you can't listen to music with them  You can't listen to podcasts or books with them  You can only listen to the 40 sounds on the Bose sleep app, but they're designed to help you sleep you can the they're  They're designed to leave in your ear when you go to sleep  I don't I hope they're comfortable but they lie flat in your ear the sleep buds and then be down for that  They play ocean. Is it the inter aural beats? Oh, no. No. Well, I don't know. I you know, I  They're ridiculously expensive considering you can't listen to music with them  Yeah, that's not now you've lost me but I'll tell you well  You know what we could do  I don't know we could talk about it when I when I get them  but the reason is I have tinnitus tinnitus in my ear and I just ringing in my ears and  it's getting louder and  You really hear it when it's dead quiet, you know at night when you're sleeping  And I thought it might be because I can't mask it with certain white sounds. I don't hear it  So I thought maybe what I should do is get these  Put it on those sounds and maybe that will help. So we'll see I'm gonna try it  We'll see I'm like for you on that. It's like earplugs. It seals  So it you know gets if you have a partner that snores or there's street noise or whatever that's keeping you up  It'll help in that regard, but I'm actually more interested in the cure for tinnitus

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm envisioning kind of an IOT Stacey gone mad with all the things you can do in your sleep

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I the other thing now that we mentioned it. I've got millimeter wave. I've got sonar waves  I've got RF in my ears house. Is this all gonna end up being carcinogenic

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are we good? Oh, I thought you were gonna ask me about different RF interference, which is actually a huge issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just don't want to die, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay  There is research on some of this like every frequency band is different right so  millimeter wave is  For all we know I mean it's the stuff you run through the airport. Yeah, and remember how people were about that  Well, I don't know what frequency that it's at but we're also doing a lot of 5g deployments deployments are at well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We know that causes kovat. Oh  I forgot to mention I also have a sleep tracker in in between my mattress and box spring that I  Think doing sending RF or I think it must be our sensor

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know cuz I mean there's RF because it's got to send the data to the phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's can't no no, it doesn't go to the phone. It's connected to a dongle which has Wi-Fi  So there's Wi-Fi, but that's okay. So then there's no RF going no, but I think it must be sending out something because it detects heart rate  breathing rate and  motion so  Pulses and waves that's why you can't sleep. Well, I'm just thinking I'll add more things to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I envision a data visualization of all the all the rays going through Leo's body. Yeah, can you imagine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh not to mention I have an electric wave doesn't millimeter wave doesn't go through it attenuates

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  None of this is is the kind of radiation what do they call it that they can cause cancer none of it is that  Microwave no, no, no, no, no, no took people out in strips out cell this that can enter your cell  I can't remember the term. It'll come to me in about five minutes when nobody cares anymore. It's just it's as well as ionizing  Thank you ruin your brain  Ionizing radiation radiation. So in theory, it's not in Previgin Leo  Previgin you not have you been taking that because I feel like I'm getting stupider

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My my nightmare is to end up on a plane. I finally get to fly again. Yeah, my first flight  I'm stuck next to one of those Previgin people, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm 78 years old and I think better than ever thanks to Previgin

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm a motivational speaker and I take Previgin, you know, I motivate you to take it. You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff you and I watch too much that cable network news  Our news channel my lord  Everybody on watching those channels is in their 80s and they're dying of some  Malady or other and then oh my god the worst part. I'm watching CNN accurate  I'm watching CNN Tom sell it comes on to sell me reverse mortgages  So I case a quick MSNBC and there's Tom Selleck sending me reverse mortgages. You can't escape it  What is Previgin is that the one made out of octopus squid it's what it yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's made out well bet on squid or something, right?  There's no how

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The amount of money they spent on advertising is unbelievable. Well, it's apparently it's very expensive somebody saying in the chat room  I don't I'm not tempted  No, I'm not either. No, I don't like those people. It's a supplement as we know FDA does not regulate supplements  So anyway, if he sees our is this to charge them with false and deceptive advertising last January Oh Previgin. Oh  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well that 5g, huh, how about that 5g so the this is a con this is the contrail of  Technology I would say is the RF cancer thing. So  There's research that shows that the research is not definitive  I'm not I'm not super worried about all of this  But you know you heard me I was more excited like oh are we gonna talk about how we manage the interference between all this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, how do we manage that look at why don't you start that I have to go get a drink of water go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I'll be back. It's it's it's super nerdy like electrical engineering stuff  I this is what I read and like bring it e times or no  Well, I don't even know how to do this. I mean, this is like it magic antenna stuff  You know antennas are like the dark magic of the Internet, right?  But if you think about it, we are I mean most homes will now have  Five to six different plus cellular so this is just in our homes local  Networks and then you've got cellular and then you've got whatever that like sub gigahertz  That's in your microwave or your baby monitor. So your garage door opener, but we've had those first  anyway, I  Can't tell you how to manage this because I'm not a design  Electrical engineer. I'm sorry, but we can come into a different story if we want to go back to  Take over it's not a so it's just like

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of Twitter and its recent acquisition of breaker, you know considering what's happened in the podcast world with  Spotify goblins up everybody and  Stitcher in our heart radio and so now Twitter house into buy breaker for its Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's it's it's audio is the next thing right? It's it's having audio chat audio Twitter. What's what's that other? What's that?  Country club house  House that's what it was clubhouse. That's the thing is I think they want help with their Twitter spaces  I don't I think audio is the  audio space is the  I'm trying to do what what Stacy did a minute ago  Wait, you gotta wave your arms. This is the AR of audio

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People the AR he's I think he's is this my contrails of the technology is chemtrails  Trails that's it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Contrails are real

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, you should you should I don't want to mess things up I do worry cuz I I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just was looking at my Wi-Fi set. I have 70 different  devices on my wife

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah  Well, I think it probably is that's pretty normal with everybody  There's there's at least five people in a household nowadays  Everybody has some sort of phone. Everybody has some sort of laptop  Everybody has some sort of tablet and then you start to get all of these other smart things that number jumps up pretty deck

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of 70 71 clients  TVs everybody's got all sorts of stuff. Now what I did do what we were talking about was try to segment the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm gonna give you a piece of data  Comcast says there's an average  About 12 devices in people's homes and their power users connect up to 50 devices  I'm a super power user there it is. I just want to give you some data there  You want to see the map?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the map

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's that's trippy get windows doing a thing for there's the there's the map of all the devices and the switches and  routers and the hubs

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're multiplying

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple can't handle your your display. No, there's something going on there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So but I did Stacey I did do the segmentation. I actually there were so many IOT devices that I decided  Okay, you guys can have the network  That's just secure because there's only like six computers and phones and things almost all of those 71 devices are IOT

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hold on. I have this guy. I'm gonna give you guys a freebie  His name on YouTube is the hookup the hookup. It's terrible terrible  But he has a video that helps you set up your ubiquity  System. Oh good. It's called setup IOT V lands and firewall rules with unify

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I I did it but I would watch it to see if I did anything wrong one thing I found and I doubt he'll he'll address  There are devices that have to be on the same network the Sonos

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, so he shows how to do that and that's why he was my favorite. Oh, I'll watch it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  printers printers most of my printer so I set up a firewall rule that says  Traffic can go from the secure network to the IOT network so we can control them but not back because I don't want any  Any, you know that makes traffic from my IOT network under my secure network, but things like printers need two-way traffic. So I  What's gonna end up happening? I know this is gonna have having I had to put all the printers onto the secure network  I had to put the Sonos is on the secure network  Segmentation is not gonna work, but I will watch no I will watch that video and see at least the June Oven is on its own  network  I don't need to control that that's  Thank You Stacy she just put the link in the show notes. I will I will be watching

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Doorbell is that your doorbell or my doorbell? That's yours. No, it's my doorbell and my dog just ignore that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The ubiquities are great. By the way for all of that. I have to say I've been very happy  with that setup  While you're going to get go go get the door. I will do the next I will do you need to go anywhere  And you want to go anywhere? Now's the time. This is it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

You know I come from broadcast media  Even when I we first started doing this the idea of doing this live was pretty you know crazy  You know if you get a he's saying it's insane  The cost structure thought to do that. I don't know I was stupid  That's why this cost structure is completely upside down with with you know radio or TV you build a transmitter  And then if a million people watch it or one person watches it it costs the same it doesn't matter  But that's the exact opposite of streaming the more people will take you stream the more cost you it's a it's it's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you start the same year as YouTube?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but we weren't doing live streaming then but I was probably somewhat of an influence on us yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, but but also everybody said at the time YouTube was insane Google was insane. It makes sense. It just doesn't scale right yeah  And you went and did it um I don't know what I was thinking

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's worked out alright now. We got the new tricaster, and it's kind of like a whoo new tricaster  Yeah, you like that you and playing with it haven't you you're getting trained on it. It's quite nice quite nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now granted is a lot of stuff in there that we don't necessarily need but man that thing is pretty badass

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll just say that does John want to show anything off right now. I don't know do you have anything set up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's all no there's all sorts of there's virtual sets green screens  There's all sorts of interesting stuff one of the things where we want we are going to start to play with you know normally  You can see I've got my laptop hooked up. I have to get a video out of it that goes into a converter  I actually this has changed remarkably when we first started doing a tech TV  The only good way we could get a screen on  Camera was to actually have a dedicated camera and camera camera  We put it on a big on a TV because it was CRTs back then and the camera operator had aim its camera at it  And you had to pull the focus just right so you didn't get more array from the screen  And that's how we shot screens and if you wanted to zoom in the camera  That's why I had an operator you could zoom in pan on the screen  But by the time we started doing this 15 years ago. You could get a scan converter that you'd plug the thing into  But in the early days of that it was real tricksy  You know you had a the frame rate and refresh and all that stuff had to be just right and then  now I just put a little driver on the Mac and  Connect it to the internet and using NDI the network. Yeah network is a distribution interface  Digital network digital interface it just goes into the I don't have to have a scan converter. It just goes into the board  Though it has an NDI scan converter is it a bit of hardware or software only it's software  So it's really I mean things have changed quite a bit. It's uh and by the way  Jumping the shark says we need instant replay and what is that little button on this on the thing there?  There's an instant replay button. It is instant replay, sir

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of this stuff we haven't set up  Yes, we have to set the recording going but but but I thought it'd be useful for me  Press buttons all day. I thought it'd be useful for me and Jeff. I could say no Jeff. You didn't say that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's roll the tape go to the tape check the tape. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why don't we have this? I know  Big news  The person at my door was a gentleman coming to pull the fiber  So I have a conduit today was the fiber  next big step  Getting the CPV in so getting getting it's the ONT that's gonna actually the day the fiber got pulled down there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although there is a kind of long-standing tradition to do comical readings of tweets, isn't it?  Who was it had hate tweets? They bring in tweets gene Kimmel. Yeah, Jimmy Kimmel the mean tweets. Yeah  Twitter did you mention this when you were talking about audio Twitter buying breaker?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, we were trying to that but we needed your why

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why  It's a I don't know. It's a social podcasting app called breaker

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's because you said it was the AR of it. So Jeff was like, I don't think  This audio is the big deal I think so the audio chat interesting. Yeah, I think that's really interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's it's in I don't know if it's for me. There's some there's another service out there  I think it's called polo or something like that. And this is what it reminded me of is you giving  people the ability to connect using audio instead of text when  Just picking up the phone and calling would be just as good. I just don't quite get that the only

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The only slant I can add to this is  The CTO of breaker is the wonderful Leia Culver who  Co-authored oauth and o embed and she was involved in pounce, which was a Twitter clone that I really liked  She's very cool. Kevin Rose, right?  Yeah, and Rose involved in yeah, he was involved and so  I'm really happy for Leia  Mm-hmm. But yeah, I don't know. It'll be interesting  Yeah, I don't know it'll be interesting  Leo will be joining Twitter with a focus on Twitter spaces  Which is their audio based?  Social networking product. It's kind of like Clubhouse  I think I think the kids I think honestly Jeff it's not for you and me, but I think the youngs like it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually think it's people like our generation. Yeah old folks kids hate talking on this stuff. That's what I heard

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was our age group was in Clubhouse  Yeah, but it was a different

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Talk

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, that's exactly why I am NOT a member  I don't want to hear anybody else talk  Anyway, so yeah, that's that's good news. They'll shut down for good  January 15th  And if you are a breaker user run over there and export your OPML file  So you can transfer your subscriptions to another podcasting app  Interesting  Interesting yeah, I think you know Twitter Twitter has a history of doing this kind of thing and not necessarily  remember vine not necessarily being able to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Manifest they just shut down periscope shut down periscope last week, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they're smart to  You play with different things  They can afford it, right?  Um  Verifications coming back on the 20th  You could try to get verified

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are you still verified or did you quit? I'm blue check. I'm blue. I'm gonna try

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I probably don't have to try it now, but at one point  It was a lot of people tweeting other ant pruits confusing them. Oh, it's always good to get the blue check. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Always nice to actively I think Twitter reached out because I was a giga

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you were a giga that's probably why right yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep, I was with a more famous publication  That was my dad  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How does Leo Laporte's brain work

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Doesn't so here is if you want to use your brain an article that a number of people have referred to from  Berthub  dot eu  It is reverse engineering the source code. Yes source code of the Pfizer  Covid vaccine and it is I highly recommend it it is fascinating

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, wait, why does the vaccine have a source code that's what's fascinating

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because most vaccines are deactivated up till now vaccines are basically  deactivated  Viruses that you you know like the salk vaccine that you inject and then your body not knowing it's a deactivated virus  Is not a threat it's dead, but the body creates the antidote antibodies for that virus  You know to repel it, but that's but the mRNA is much more interesting much more sophisticated and  The weight it's what's really interesting is very early on  The virus was sequenced you sequenced you may remember this back in January that the the the genome  Genome of the virus was released publicly and it only took a week or two. I remember we did the story  For a couple of companies to create the vaccine  based on the genome  Knowing that you know it the way an mRNA vaccine works is  it basically is instructions to create the antibody that are injected into your body and  So  Having the genome they could fairly quickly within a few days  Design the vaccine all of the time from January till now was testing was yeah  Yeah, it's almost instantaneous  Thompson has a Ben Thompson has a very interesting article on strategic are you saying that that's a that shouldn't take that long  We should have gone immediately to things like human challenge trials, which are dangerous  Because of the desperate need for this vaccine we should have taken a riskier yeah, right we should have taken like to  Well, I hope in person breathe on you as it turns out if we had done that we would had the vaccine a lot earlier  But if on the other hand, it was a dangerous vaccine that killed people. Well, it wouldn't have been quite such a good result  so the the the  BNT 162 B2 mRNA vaccine  code  Is published in this blog post. It's four thousand two hundred eighty four characters  In other words, it would fit in about ten tweets or twenty tweets  Somebody at the very beginning of the production process  Uploaded this code to a get this DNA printer  Which converted the bytes on the disk to actual DNA molecules?  Out of the machine came isn't this amazing came tiny amounts of DNA  Which are which after a lot of biological and chemical processing end up as RNA in the vaccine vial a  Thirty microgram dose turns out to actually contain thirty micrograms of RNA. It's entirely RNA and then there's a  Lipid packaging system that gets the messenger RNA into our cells  So it's it's very much like a computer program being injected into your veins  And the RNA then instructs the cells to create  This you know, I guess analog of the virus so anyway, if you're interested I think Stacy you'd really you'd really dig this article  The idea of a vaccine is to teach our immune system how to fight a pathogen without actually getting sick  Historically, it's been done by injecting a weakened or  incapacitated virus  Plus an adjuvant to scare our immune system into action. That's why it used chicken eggs  To make it and it took a lot of time  The mRNA vaccine does the same thing educate our immune system, but in a laser like way  The injection contains volatile genetic material that describes the spike protein on the cove  SARS-CoV-2  virus  The vaccine manages to get this genetic material into the body  Which then start producing  SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in large enough quantities that our immune system says whoa, hold on  leaps into action  They're really not the virus. They're just the spike proteins, but the immune system develops a powerful response  against multiple aspects of the spike protein  And you are protected  95 protected so it's a fascinating thing  100% protected so it's a fascinating story. It really is for people interested in digital technology. The analog is very

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Close. It's very very interesting. Okay. Okay. So let's let's let's switch into moral panic mode. What could go wrong with this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you could stimulate a result you didn't you know a reaction you didn't want you could you're just like any other issue of going

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Too narrow right? So you're training your emotion training your immune system on it the exact protein and then the earth the exact spike pattern  I'm asking in the hands of a bad act the virus evolves a bad actor  Well, you could create I mean  We already have synthetic viruses out there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean one of the things that kills you in some in these  in these  Respiratory infections is a cytokine storm an over reaction of the immune system  So I imagine that would be one thing you could do is trigger an immune reaction that is fatal  Um, but honestly, I think  That was kind of ben thompson's part of ben thompson's point was that these mrna  viruses are not  Really that dangerous not compared to other kinds of vaccines

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so concern of like an over reaction. Yes. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that maybe it would have been appropriate for us to literally fast track it  So that we could have had

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know this vaccine six months ago, but not everyone was doing an mrna vaccine  That's I mean, so do you change the rules?  And the other thing is the mrna mrna vaccines were so pooh-poohed by established. Oh, yeah for decades  That you know it  It's easy to look back and say oh this is so safe we totally should have done it differently right but  and  And you could argue that  We were at such risk. I'm sorry. The dog is going to keep going because there are people working outside

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But we were at such a dog that that person is doing god's good for you. It's good stuff very important work  That person is a friend like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you'll be on the internet more

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they're cats on the internet doggy cats  Hey, here's some good news. I forgot to make my point. Oh make your point. I'm sorry. I forgot it. I was like dog dog  Point dog  mrna  In hindsight, it's easy to say now knowing that it isn't dangerous that we should have done it quicker  Right. That was what you were starting to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, and the question the the rest of that I don't remember doesn't matter doesn't matter doesn't matter blame the fiber

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  blame the fiber  Good news book publishers. Hey  Maybe jeff you should write a book  Thanks to man. I'm trying thanks to covid business was better than ever. Yes  For hardcover real dead tree books

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I guess because maybe people bought them they didn't want to go to the library and you had all this time  So you were like during my pandemic. I will get so smart. They're also

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People reading more for sure, right? I I read more print sales up eight percent  however  audiobook sales up

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  17% year over year in 2020 more about community and stuff. It's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, and and ebook sales which have been declining, you know that that whole ebook revolution turned out not to happen  It's the ar of printing. Yes  But actually but last year even ebook sales are up 16

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I buy ebooks all the time. I talked to my editor. I like ebooks too. You know, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, for instance, i'm reading a marvelous science fiction trilogy right now  And uh, oh if you haven't read, do you know peter f hamilton? Do you know his work?  Oh, he's I think one of the one of the great science fiction writers alive working right now  Read fallen dragon. That's a single volume one a really nice one to start fallen dragon by peter f hamilton  But his most recent series is the salvation trilogy  Sequence. Yeah, it's a trilogy, but it's called the salvation sequence, but it's really good. But  There are a lot of uh  Weird names and words for instance  Uh, there is a race  Of genetically modified people that cycle between male and female and so they have to have a pronoun for these  people and so it's instead of  Him or her it's h i r  Instead of he or she it's s i e and when they the audiobook it's here and see but it's not clear  What are you what is it?  So you have to read it and then it's kind of all make sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I ended up buying with motes and god moat and god's god's god's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fantastic so  But having I like the audiobook but I also want to see the text and so  The whisper sync with the kindle and an audio is really great  And and it keeps track of where you are so you can pick it up as you go. So I actually  I have been buying more ebooks this year. So i'm one of the people that  Helped ebooks increase 16 percent this past year been buying a lot more

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Changed some my editor said they they kind of pulled some stuff back to see how it was going to go and then and then saw  It was going to write and push back in isn't that interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People were bored like you said and then there are some people that were inspired because of the additional free time from  Not having to commute and things like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's another thing at work, uh, and it certainly happened in podcasts where because of the political climate and and covid and black lives matter  A lot of people went and got books about those subjects  The history. Yeah, so trump political books sold well escape using no no books about race relations  Sold really really well  Bookstores had according to new york times had trouble keeping how to be an anti-racist by kendy or so you want to talk about race?  by uh, oluo in stock  books about uh  The president trump has performed particularly well  Um the mary trump, uh book sold more than 1.35 million copies in its first week  I have been loving by the way, if you want a great audiobook president obama's a promised land. He reads it  It's in his voice. It's a it's a really personal memoir of his  Uh life the his presidency. I I think it's one of it's a just fascinating book that sold 3.3 million copies  in the last month  Um, it's really good. I'm not surprised and it's been a bestseller around the world too actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The only audiobook i've enjoyed there were two one was trevor noah's  Uh, yeah, that's pretty good because he does all that he does all the accents. That's way better  Yeah, thank you born a crime. I was like something about crimes  um, and then  americana by i'm gonna screw your name up  It's a fiction book though  But it is story of a nigerian immigrant and it's all about  race and  Not just in the u.s  But primarily in the u.s  But a lot of it depends on the accents of the people who are speaking  And the actress who does who reads the book does all of that's where audiobooks excel, don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's really where they can be fantastic  Sometimes they call those full cast productions where  They use this is the same. This was a single one good reader. Yeah  A good reader is really good, but there are also these fabulous full cast  Production, you know my favorite. Uh, it was one of my favorite novels. I don't think it was last year. It was two years ago  um  Oh, it was the one about uh, it was lincoln and the bardo. I don't know if you read that by george sanders

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, everybody thought that was great. I loved it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know what listen to the audiobook because every character in that has a different reader  And so it's like listening to it  You would like this one try it. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So leo i'm wondering about this here's here's a here's a macho audio book moment i'm honestly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Say again  The decline and fall of the roman empire. Oh, sure 126 hours scribble scribble scribber. Hey, mr. Gibbon

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, 126 hours. Should I do it? No, but you know, it's good and I have been reading

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not quite as long as the rise and fall of the third rike  Is quite good

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that is there a reason I have another friend of mine did that is it is it a new recording?  Um, I don't think so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think twitter just removed the president's tweets. Oh, they removed it too. Oh tweets all of them  No, just two of the most recent ones

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's interesting how they're getting a spine now. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, just like now is if you don't have it now, right? It's not like it's not a good thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, we're we're setting the fire. This tweet is no longer available. This tweet is no longer available  Did he this I guess one of them was the video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, one was the video. That was the last one and the one before that was he was saying hey, uh, take care of the the police

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Law enforcement something along those lines. Oh, I thought it was something about the fraud and the sacred election  I was like the sacred and landslide election that was blatantly. Oh, i'm well, I must have missed that tweet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was special

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's amazing what a world but I do think that's but that's why it was interesting the book sales were up  I think some of it was because of covid 19  But I think also some of it was people trying to understand black lives matter what's going on in dc  There was there was a kind of a seeking out of something that maybe was a little bit more  Thoughtful reliable detailed than just the day-to-day reporting we're getting and I I think that's actually true and I think that's encouraging

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's really encouraging plus their experiment with the form right john ronson did his great butterfly effect thing  Which was about you know, the impact of free porn on all these yeah  I just listened to unquiet my life with beithoven. Oh, I have to listen to this  Uh, so it's an audible original jonathan bis who's a concert pianist who talks through  from covid on  his anxiety about his decision in life to record all the beithoven sonatas  And then you hear  Pieces of them obviously and so it's really very good. It's the only it's the only podcast the only audiobook  I listened to recently on one dot o speed

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now see i'm an audio book right now that uh, it's a book that i've had it for a couple years  I just never really got around to it and I fired it up last week and i'm halfway through it and it's talking about  A snowstorm is just really wiped out a big part of new york city  A threat to the infrastructure there's quarantine going on  And this book was from october 29 october 29 2013 and it's called cyber storm and i'm reading this now and i'm thinking  Wow  This sounds oh so familiar

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we we we appreciate that book. We recommended it a couple years ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I had it a little while ago and never cracked it open and finally cracked it open last week

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also a little bit of a reflection on a little chilling how poorly the day-to-day media has done explaining and  Helping people understand what's going on  Uh, I don't know about that. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think part of it is if you're seeking the media is not super diverse  So I think if you're seeking actual authenticity and voices from people who are not just being explained by like others  I think books are really your only option because the media has done such a bad job. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the same and we agree. It's just another reason right to go deeper than what we're getting. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  if  the media is not  Diverse if you will, uh, is that because of the leadership?  Should we start there because i'm sure a lot of these anchors that are on the screens trying to present this information to the masses  A lot of times they disagree with what's being whispered in their iam saying  Hey, we need to make sure we hit this point that point so on and so forth. But because of the way  News is today and everything is sort of sensationalized for the clicks and for the views  It's just a big old freaking mess of nobody can trust it  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  think there's a lot of there's a dearth of voices because  For a long time to make it in the media industry. You had to have money  and  You had to have money because you had no paying in like no paid internships  so  You know you had to be willing to work for free or very little for  And then there's also discrimination in the newsroom  I sat in a news meeting at fortune. I one of my jobs was every morning  We had a meeting  Um to talk about what we're gonna run that day and working on and the entire white male editor  The the top editors there was one woman  They were like what's microaggressions and then they proceeded to make fun of the concept of microaggressions while every single person  like all the youngest staffers were just like  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that the thing to remember is that media is no different than just corporate america. It is corporate america  Yeah, it's corporate america with a camera and a microphone, but it's corporate america  So it's prone to the same exact deals those things that you just described stacey are happening in every boardroom in america

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Amen and just the media is supposed to have a different it's supposed to but it doesn't it doesn't msnbc is owned by

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  mbc which is owned by comcast. I mean it's  It's yes, it's all corporate right? It's corporate america with a microphone and a camera  So why would you expect it to be any different? I've tried to tell my family life experience that too. Yeah  Yes, you'd expect reporters to have a little bit more life experience, but I don't think you're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think you'll only hire white reporters. You're right. So there's a wonderful wonderful book. I recommend by louis raven wallace  Who's a transgender journalist who was at npr who got fired from npr?  because he wouldn't  um  High to their standard of objectivity  And and he was always told or you can't cover that story about about trans or gender issues because because you're biased because you're trans  Because you know something about it. Yeah, exactly versus white people covering white people because you can do that  Because that's that's that's that's normal right in their definition  and  You know what? He makes an eloquent point about about how you've just rejected the lived experience  That would help your cover. You've devalued it down to nothing so that your coverage has none of this now  And uh, and and I don't know we talked about this on the show before but but also i'd recommend anybody interested in this  Wesley laury who was a Pulitzer Prize winning washington post reporter covering the police killings of people  Who left the post because he got an argument with marty barron over his tweets  That he wrote an op-ed about three months ago in the new york times that objectivity is  fundamentally racist  Because it is people like me old white men who decide what is objective they decide what is bias they decide what is normal  And and that whole structure is systematically biased

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they decide what's interesting. So I put things in my stories  that also like  When I use she as my pronouns for people who like just like  If i'm talking about the user when when she does this right?  They get that's he is the default right and he did when I talk about oh, yeah  And I mean i've been doing this a long time jeff 20 years. They might not do it today  And then there's things like just just a few months ago my i triple e editor I had stuck something in my story  It was about domestic violence actually  in the smart home and it was an not an aside, but it was a small paragraph and  You know, he was like, oh, I don't know if our readers really want to hear about this and I was like  They may not want to but they totally should and I think that's about to  And and he was like, that's a really good point. I'll bring that up and one of the reasons  I triple e hired me to do this column is because all of up until that point all of their columnists were really old white men  Now they've got a semi-old white woman. It's sort of progress  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To answer your question too and um  with more depressing  data here  Um, the newspaper association or the whatever it's called. They change the name all the time  Nla, nla, I think newspaper something or other  They uh, the the newspapers won't even  answer the surveys  Of the diverse numbers in their newsrooms and numbers is the least of it, right? That's not  Inclusion that's not equity just how many they're so embarrassed after all these generations of having made no progress  They won't even fill out the survey for the industry. That's how bad we are

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not even looking at it from a race standpoint. I'm looking at it from the standpoint of  You have to look at all at a different point of views if there's a story about  A football team. I don't know just some random football team check  With different sources and I try to tell my family and particularly with my boys  Uh, you can check other sources for this information. Don't just depend upon abc or nbc  Don't just depend upon me because sometimes i'm going to shoot you a bunch of bull crap just to make you look it up and verify  You know, so just just check all of the sources

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, let's do a little google change log in just a bit  I want to reintroduce our fine panelists  Stacey Higginbotham stacey on iot her newsletter is free. There is absolutely no reason not to subscribe to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's january it's just january by the way, I I slagged uh, uh google on macbreak weekly yesterday  For not I I repeated the fast company story that google hadn't updated any of its apps since mid december  Because if they knew that the apple rule was if they did I think it was after december 6th  They would have to include the privacy nutrition  Statement and be subject to the privacy, you know  Yes, no questions that apple does to all for all ios apps and google didn't want to do that  but that was  Calumny because in fact as it turns out google like many companies doesn't release new products  During the holiday period because they don't want showstoppers bringing their employees back from their nice holidays  So the google said no, no, no, we're gonna we got all the updates  We're gonna put them out the next week or two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is stacy with a skirt. Tell me about this gpt3 thing. What is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh the the artificial intelligence. That's the writing one, isn't it? Yeah, that's the one that's that's been writing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  News stories that are indistinguishable from actual  Yeah  journalists reports  Um, it can write original passages passages of text given a short prompt

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the game, I mean it's a gan so it's it's a it's generative learning. Um,  yeah, and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that the one they didn't want us to release they didn't open ai created it and they didn't want to release the source code  or how it worked so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then the the  The what's it's still talking about the turnip  You know, okay. So the so yes the turnip

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is dale so now we're in a dangerous no dolly after wall e except. It's also play on salvador dolly  Yeah, oh yeah, get it. It's a it's a surrealist. It's a dadaist  play on a pixar character

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What gpt3 is to language and generating words  Dolly is to turning language into images. Yeah, and it's also a generative thing created by open ai  And

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so this is this is where instead of writing a paragraph of text based on a prompt  It does a drawing based on a prompt this these  Drawings are from the prompt a can of soup that has the word skynet on it  Which is kind of funny all by itself  And there it is. There's it has a tab on it. Yeah, it's easy open. It's an easy open

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That soup. Yeah. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It can take unrelated concepts that are nothing alike and put them together into a functional

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Object says that's why you have the radish walking the dog. That's a functional on how exactly yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what was the prompt on the radish walking the dog?  an illustration of a baby  Daikon radish in a tutu  Walking a dog

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's it. I mean, that's pretty good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then so what's from from literal minds? What's well, what's remarkable about this is is is these are three completely unrelated concepts?  Daikon radish tutu walking a dog and it was able to synthesize those into an image

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's impressive I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Got to take impressive that a computer imagine that so yeah, think about kids do that all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My kid could do better than this computer and then of course we got to do a little 230 news  Mike Maznik all up in arms. He says and I didn't see it  So I can't comment that the 60 minutes piece on section 230 was completely bogus and wrong  Mazik was in fine form though fine moral panic you called it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Fine federal he said it. I didn't he said it. He said moral panic clear and then you have a piece in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On your blogs also, I presume on medium  speechless an allegory for our time  with a new yorker cover from 2018  Of a woman with my effort to dismiss. It's kind of jeff does sci-fi

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, what is it? So this is fiction magic  What is it? So this is fiction imagine  Yes, imagine a world where where 230 and other things have happened  and  so the character goes to see his editor and  discovers that he has to pay  To have a fact checker take out all the facts because non-fiction is too risky  And pay for uh your speech insurance  And then it costs more now to write than to read what it would be like without section 230

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your post 230 dystopian novel buzz machine.com  I think we can I mean I think we can safely say that section 230 is safe for the night for the time being in fact  Some say because of the democrats win in georgia that maybe even net neutrality might come back  That now that the democrats control the senate  President-elect biden can nominate as  Candidates for instance the chairman of the fcc that would be a little harder to get some  Neutrality that would be a little harder to get through a republican senate

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You say yeah, but the uh for the time being you mean as in just with 2021. It's safe for now  I think it's going to take a little bit longer

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's no we don't have that neutrality right now. The fcc overturned it two years ago  So it could come back to 230 session 230. Yeah, I feel like the assaults on 230  We're all kind of political posturing  and none of them  Uh got enacted into law, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I i'm very are we talking about net neutrality or section 230?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Both 230 230 first I tune out when we talk about 230 230  Back in let's talk about neutrality. Okay  I'm coming back. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, well in other words, well, we already saw it. Uh, it's just a rumor but the that merrick garland will be uh, uh  nominated for attorney general a candidate that would not have been nominated had the republicans continued control of the senate because  Biden would have to nominate somebody that would be more likely to get past muster

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Plus it's just too embarrassing to finally talk to the guy you wouldn't talk to. Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  uh, but that the thinking is perhaps  the same thing will happen with the chairman of the fcc and perhaps if if dave recordin can convince  Uncle joe that net neutrality is a good thing. Maybe we can get make some progress there  I think I think biden does support net neutrality. I know he's kind of iffy on 230, but I don't want to put stacey to sleep

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, I just I i'm not  My brain can't focus on I know what you 30 is just I dumped it. Yeah  There's smart people who deal with that already. Um, I would say actually instead of dealing with net neutrality on its I think we should actually  God help us revamp the communications act of 1996

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That includes section 230  By the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See you tried to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know  I was trying to be honest to what we really need to do even if it sucks for me personally because of 230. Yeah  But I do think that  Okay, i'll read it. I mean I I I know enough about it to know what it is and what it isn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just don't want to think about it anymore. No, but I think much much of america has now been misinformed by that 60 minutes piece  Which was just factually just wrong. You're right. Doesn't nobody cares. You're right  Just one day  Yes, just us that care

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My piece is set in 29 when we have the next pandemic which I called bloat

Not even my regular people know this  Hey, hey, are we regular people? Geez? Sorry my iot newsletter subscribers in podcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's absolutely no reason not to subscribe that have I mentioned that yes, there's no reason

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of my goals this year is to make the really boring parts of my house smart  So i'm looking at you know, the flow or finn water leak detection monitors whole home detection monitors  I'm looking at breaker box monitors things like that because I i'm really interested in  How we can actually make our building smarter and more adaptive for energy conservation for better health outcomes for people  So i'm i'm automating the boring stuff with apologies to tony fidel  Um, and one of those things is my water heater. So I just got is boring. That's very boring. It is boring  Yeah, but the water heater  stops working the second  Well, yeah that too it uses the second largest amount of electricity in your home for most homes after hvac. Do you have an electric water here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um a lot of people do because I have a gas water a lot of people do okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had electric in charlotte this guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what? My water heater does use a lot of electricity because I have a recirculating pump on it  And that uses probably more electricity than anything else in the house. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, um, and there's a big push for whole home electrification in california, i'm sure you're aware of that. Yes  It's a big thing  Uh, because we generate our own electricity on our roof. So we would like to do that actually  Yeah, so this is the device. This is going to go on your water heater  It's going to measure a couple things mostly it determines how hot it gets and it learns over time to understand your  The times you need hot water  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you doesn't heat the water unnecessarily

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. So it it keeps the temperature. I mean it never lets it it never turns it off  But it lowers the temperature that you want to maintain it at  Which saves a lot of electricity because keeping water hot is is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chemically, what's the name of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a quanta a q u a n t a  Ream r h e e m makes one as because they're a big water heater manufacturer  Whirlpool has started to introduce  Smart water heaters, but this one retrofits to just about any electric one out there in many gas ones  And it's a fairly quick install. You just will I say this now theoretically  I haven't installed it yet because it just arrived but I could tell you more about it after that  But it's turn the power off you pop it on you attach the sensors to the outside of the two water lines  In and out and then you attach a sensor somewhere else  And that is yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's what i'm doing. It's a hundred and twenty nine dollars. It also tells you how much hot water is available

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, that was the other thing that's in the house. Oh, no, that's nice  Yeah, it lets you see your hot water usage and I believe it'll actually let you set rules like  Eventually, you can chop your kids shower off after like 20 minutes suddenly good buddy. Dad the shower is cold

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's good that'd just be fun always yelling that just be it just for a little fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll give you some breaking news. Yes expanding on your previous breaking news about twitter. It's gone further  They just tweeted as a result of the unprecedented ongoing violence situation in washington dc  We've required the removal of three real donald trump tweets that were posted earlier today for repeated and severe violations of our civic integrity policy  Second this means that the account of real donald trump will be locked for 12 hours  Holy moly the removal of these tweets if the tweets are not removed the account will remain locked

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, he's not going to remove those tweets

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Future violations of the twitter rules including our civic integrity or violent threats policies will result in the permanent suspension of the real donald trump account  man at last

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, okay. So now my question for you all  Will twitter as a whole get a little bit more quieter or will it get even louder now if this suspension happens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think for a little while people be loud. I mean you can already see a supporter saying  Oh, this is unfair. La la la la la  I've already seen i've already seen doctored screenshots of his tweets saying this wasn't so bad, was it?  um  So I think we're gonna see a lot of kerfuffle  But if they stick to their guns you suck the oxygen from the room and maybe they'll go to parlay. I don't know  They don't like it there because they can't rile up people and that's the goal right? Uh, yeah, and of course, uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This will now be the most important issue for the president of the united states for the next couple of weeks  So that's a good thing too  Uh, give him something to distract him  Uh, jeff jarvis a number how about a number oh we've got such a panoply

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
