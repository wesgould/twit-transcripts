But we're joined by, of course, Gina Trapani from smarterware.org.  Thanks for being here and anchoring the show.  How are you doing today?  Great to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm doing great.  Missing Leo and Jeff, but really excited about our lineup today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff is off with a book tour.  He's out there meeting the people.  So meeting the people is kind of like a Google Hangout, but it's in real life.  It's in 3D.  It's in really great resolution.  But we're also joined by Adam Pash of lifehacker.com.  How's it going?  Great.  How are you guys doing?  Good, good.  And all the way over there is Kevin Purdy, formerly of lifehacker.com.  Hello.  You can find him at completeandroidguide.com.  Or you have a nice lower third there of a bit.ly slash g plus mm.  Indeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It links to an O'Reilly page for Google Plus the Missing Manual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So how are you guys feeling about this lifehacker reunion?  This is fantastic.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The three of us haven't hung out together in a while, actually.  I'm excited about it.  It's a lifehacker gang, ganging up on you, Iez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had one tip that was posted on lifehacker a long time ago.  Way back, I think in 2001.  Long time ago.  I had a CRT monitor.  I'm telling a tip.  It was a simple idea.  I hated doing the dishes.  And so I decided I think I'm going to put saran wrap on my plates, microwave my leftovers,  then remove the saran wrap and I have a clean plate.  I remember this.  You ought to because I remember the audience was kind of angry about this.  I forgot that lifehacker is kind of a green kind of thing.  And yeah.  What do you remember, Adam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember it being controversial.  I apparently wrote this.  And my lead in says, lazy lifehacker reader and ex-bachelor as writes in.  Back in my bachelor days, I lived on my own for a while.  I hated doing dishes.  However, I enjoyed eating off plates.  At some point, I realized the plates weren't really platforms to hold food.  I got the idea to place plastic wrap over the plates or any other hard surface to create a clean plate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I used to.  I was quite inventive as a bachelor.  I mean, any hard surface, if it was a particularly large book, I'd use that.  Saran wrap worked on that, too.  It didn't matter.  I mean, look, when you when you when you're just starting off, I was just out of college and I was like, you know what?  I don't want to buy lots of plates.  So I already bought all these books.  Exactly.  I mean, what are you going to do with the physics book?  Otherwise, I mean, it's a paperweight and it's a plate.  So yeah, June in 2006.  Yeah, but that the tip originated from 2001.  That's back when I was living on my own, because I remember doing that in my apartment in Boston.  And there it is.  There it is.  There it is.  The controversial comments still up there.  The oh, yeah.  Somebody said, this guy will never get married.  He is his mother should be embarrassed for him.  I love the Internet.  I certainly love the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All the posts that are the most controversial on Lifehacker are the ones that the editors assume are the least controversial, almost exclusively.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought it was benign.  It was something stupid.  You don't have to do it.  But anyway, so yeah, there's there's the true Lifehacker reunion.  I get my one post and I'm pretty sure that pales in comparison to everybody else's thousands, probably millions of posts at this point.  You're part of the family now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're part of the.  There's my initiation.  The rest of the commenters.  You're part of the family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody called you unrealistic on Lifehacker.  So welcome to the club.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Speaking of wrath, you know, there's a lot of people ticked off about iOS five.  It got released today around one o'clock Eastern time.  And apparently nobody can get it.  It's apparently the download times are about I'd say four or five hours.  Are you guys?  Is anybody trying to get it right now while we're we're streaming?  Are you five hours?  Five hours.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I stopped the download because Skype is a delicate, delicate flower.  So I decided to resume after the show is done.  But it's actually I think I'm done downloading.  I had a problem with my iPad.  Couldn't be restored.  That was the last error message I got.  So I haven't quite updated yet.  I'm hoping that'll finish this afternoon.  But yeah, you know, I made a snarky tweet earlier about how the update servers being unreachable wasn't exactly the biggest advertisement for iCloud reliability.  And, you know, several Apple fans kind of rushed to their defense and said that it was a huge download.  And this happens to lots of big companies.  Of course it does.  I'm actually really excited for iOS five.  I have to say I'm dying to get Android like notifications.  And I'm really excited about not having to plug my iPad into my Mac.  Again, in ever again.  That's something I think Android always just just did so well as well as notifications.  So I'm excited to get that kind of that kind of parity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Kevin, have you succeeded in getting iOS five yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, and I didn't follow lifehackers tip on getting it early last week.  And now I totally wish I had.  I know, Adam, you've got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You've got a hold of it somehow.  Somehow you got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we had I haven't downloaded the official update at all.  Like Gina, last time I was on Twig, I had a miserable connection.  So I'm not I'm not playing with that right now.  But but I am getting an iPhone for us, which is the first iPhone I've had since the three G.  So it'll be interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I saw the tips about getting iOS five early.  I wanted to wait because I really wanted to get the official version.  I didn't feel like having to back up my system and do everything on my own.  But for some reason, Apple also just they sent out lots of different updates.  They have new applications in the app store.  Like I think there's an airport utility.  There's a new version of Lion out ten point seven point two for some reason.  Are they just trying to crash the Internet today?  I mean, that seems like a really bad idea to introduce three or four products at the same time over the cloud.  It's true. It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got notifications for iTunes, but I think iTunes has actually been out for a couple of days.  I just don't launch it very much.  But those OS 10, the lion updates, the airport utility and then and then I was five.  So it does seem like it was it was quite a list in my software update window.  So, yeah, I think it's going to be taxing for a few more few more hours at least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As I'm being told in chat room, this is not Mac break weekly.  But Adam, do you have something to say or if Kevin before we I always feel like it would be like when we saw Adam and I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina and I were all a lifehacker when Windows seven when the betas were coming out and it was just instant Internet crash.  Nobody could get it.  And I always wondered if it would be really cool if like Microsoft or Apple to kind of create their own private bit torrent ish networks.  Just, you know, not demanding that folks keep a certain ratio, but just, you know, check a box and say I'd like to help other Apple super fans, you know, with better wording, get iOS five as well.  I always wonder why that's something that no company wants to do is try to share the load with a peer to peer a little bit without going totally into the bit torrent recesses.  It's really intriguing idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The big news we were supposed to be talking about today was the Samsung Galaxy Nexus.  It was the Nexus Prime rumored supposed to be unveiled yesterday at an event at CTIA called Unpacked and didn't happen.  The official reason, according to a Samsung spokesperson, was that it was in respect about the passing of Steve Jobs.  They didn't want to introduce anything right now.  They said they want to postpone the new product announcement at CTIA fall.  We agree that it's just not the right time to announce the new product.  A new date and venue will be shortly announced.  And I think the rumor is the 19th now next week, a week from today, it's supposed to be dropped in Hong Kong.  We're going to see the something big is coming.  If you haven't seen the teaser video, I'm sure you have.  It's just a it's a curved glass phone.  Is anyone still excited about this?  Are you guys getting annoyed that this has been delayed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was surprised that it was delayed.  I'll be honest and not to come off as an insensitive jerk, but it kind of seemed like extreme deference.  I mean, we all know that Android wouldn't be in the form that it is if it hadn't been for iOS.  But I was surprised it was postponed.  And actually, Eileen and I were supposed to go to that event yesterday.  And and there was an Android tech talk scheduled here in San Diego for last night, which I was going to.  And the plan was to discuss what had been announced yesterday, which was basically code code word for ice cream sandwich.  So I went to the tech event anyway, and they wound up just giving the same old kind of honeycomb talk that I had heard at Google I.O. in March.  Although, you know, the developers, it was a couple of developer advocates and they were saying they were discussing kind of all the stuff we know about honeycomb already.  The action bar and fragments.  And they kept saying things like and future versions of Android will also use this.  So if you want to future proof your app, you know, make sure you use these these new components.  So it was a little bit of a hint of what's the common ice cream sandwich, which is just basically like that.  It's on the same track that honeycomb was.  But I was pretty disappointed.  Although, I mean, they need to get this thing out soon if they want to sell it for, you know, the holiday season.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you think that the Google was going to take a bunch of pot shots over at Apple and say the I.O.S. five just dropped and it's not spectacular.  Our phone is amazing.  The stuff they're doing is ketchup.  Do you think there is there a reason why they wouldn't just rewrite what they were going to do and then just kind of do this difference or are they waiting to just really hammer the point that I.O.S. five is just a joke compared to ice cream sandwich?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I kind of imagine that there's I feel like the difference.  It seems unlikely to me.  I feel like there's another reason.  Maybe.  I don't know.  And if they did, the thing is that if they can't they can't talk about so they can talk about notifications, for example, unless their notifications have improved from what they are right now, because Apple may have taken notifications, but Apple kind of leapfrogged a little bit with notifications.  And so I don't know.  I don't know.  I mean, obviously they have been kind of pot shoddy in their more recent keynotes and announcements about Android related things.  But but yeah, I don't know.  It seems hard to believe that they postponed because of Steve Jobs.  But who knows?  You can't trust the press release, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a rumor out there by Eldar Murtazen.  He's the guy who broke a while ago on Twitter that Nokia was going to buy was going to be bought by Microsoft.  And he just track records a little if he's claiming that the Nexus Prime was delayed because of patent issues, saying Google is removing some features which are subject to a patent war.  No timeline for this job.  Kevin, do you believe this thing?  Do you think that Samsung and Google just weren't even aware that there was a patent concern?  Like, oh, the day before we're going to cancel this because of a patent like they wouldn't know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  I mean, especially with recent developments, I tend to think that most of the time, if you have like a product like that, it costs a lot of money to move an announcement and a conference and all that kind of stuff.  Read, you know, redo your press, all that kind of thing.  I tend to think that they would be they would just say, oh, we'll just release and apologize later, you know, easier than getting permission.  There has to be some other reason.  I think Adam's right.  The apology slash deference doesn't seem legit.  But I also don't know that a last minute patent issue would necessarily delay it either.  Must be something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  While speculation time, anybody's got any ideas why they would delay this?  Just boredom?  Just because they wanted more of a they just don't have the parts ready?  Anybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.  Eileen?  Anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm the only one that maybe I just feel like I'm the only one that believes the press release, I guess.  Or I guess I want to believe the press release.  You want to believe that there is some sort of sympathy out there.  But I guess I'm the I feel like I'm the only one.  Maybe I should be jumping on the conspiracy bandwagon.  You're like Mulder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want to believe.  Yes.  OK, that's cool.  That's fine.  You can believe that.  But AT&T, at least they introduce some smartphones.  They're like, hey, look, our future is Android.  We don't have iPhone exclusivists.  Can you say the word?  Exclusively anymore.  And Verizon's had it for a while anyway.  But they are banking on Android with the Atrix 2, which has got a pretty killer screen at 960 by 540.  It's got a dual core of 1 gigahertz processor, gig of RAM, all that fancy stuff.  This is their new flagship Android phone.  Then there's the capacitive glide from Samsung, which is a captivate that is, excuse me.  It's also capacitive.  It's a slide out QWERTY keyboard.  And there's a nice little video from AT&T showing off all of their nice new phones, including the Pantech Pocket, a very odd large 4-inch phone.  It's very unusual.  It's supposed to be all one-handed design for this.  Do any of these phones have you guys forgetting about the Nexus Prime?  I totally doubt that because that's supposed to be amazing.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because wouldn't it be awesome if they came out with that announcement and they also said, and guess what, folks, we guarantee you that the Nexus Prime is going to be a great phone.  We guarantee you that in six months, these phones will all be running Android 4.0.  But nobody ever does that.  Nobody ever releases a phone right before an update and says, and we're also we're committed to making sure this phone gets updated, which I always hope to see or at least hear from some channel or another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they created that agreement that they were going to push out updates within 18 months, which that's a long time.  I really wonder if regular consumers really sort of internalize the difference between new hardware and new software.  I think, I don't know, my sister-in-law bought a new phone which has Android on it and just kind of assumed that it was the newest version of Android because it's a new phone, which is a bummer.  And then she couldn't install something and it was because it didn't support this older version of Android.  But I completely agree with you.  I would love to hear something like that.  I would love much more of a guarantee like, hey, we have brand new we have a brand new version of Android coming out and all the new phones are going to have that version.  It's one of the biggest problems, I think, with the Android ecosystem in general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was that 18 months agreement?  Is that like a hard thing or is that our partners have agreed to?  Like they won't give you the Google apps with Google until you say 18 months?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If I remember correctly, yeah, they won't.  It's part of the with Google agreement that you will update in 18 months.  And this started this agreement, I think, just kind of became part of things like I think a month or two ago.  So they're just starting to roll this out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, yeah, I mean, when that announcement was made, it all felt like a lot of wind because there wasn't it was like we have some partners were loosely moving in this direction.  But there was never it wasn't like this is what's happening.  These are specifically the phones that you can get.  And it's still it's a huge problem with Android stuff.  It's it's what it's one of those other things that makes the iPhone so much easier to understand for any consumer to just be like, I will get this and I will be able to access updates when they're available as soon as they're available.  But but yeah, and with I struggled for a really long time with a really crappy Android phone.  It's miserable.  And they need to get that whole situation under control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually think the Motorola acquisition is going to help with that a lot because I think Motorola is going to get it get phones out with the latest version of Android and they're going to be awesome.  And I think that that's going to really, you know, nudge other manufacturers to do the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is what's exciting about any any like Nexus phone, too, obviously.  That's why everyone wants the Nexus, because it's the one that they actually know.  Well, aside from the fact that they are doing a good job with like nice hardware when sometimes that's lacking as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So speaking of which, Adam, you had the Nexus or G for a little bit and I had it also testing it.  So it looks like the new phone is curved glass.  Did you like the curved glass? Do you know? Do you guys know anybody who likes that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did. Okay. Yeah, I was pretty happy with it.  It wasn't I don't know. I felt it felt very nice in the hand.  It was a very smooth screen.  And it didn't it didn't, I guess, stand out to me as as strange.  It was just I mean, it's not like it's a basketball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, the curve of the Nexus Prime, the curve about Nexus Prime does look a little more extreme than the Nexus S, but I have the Nexus S and yeah, I love it.  I don't really think about the curve very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. When you look at those when you look at those pictures, the curve looks really extreme.  I don't know if that's just an exaggerated thing with the highlight along the top of it.  But but you're right. I mean, looking at it looks strange.  But using the other Nexus, I never had any issue with it.  You guys, I'm assuming you did, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just I said, well, I don't ever trust myself because I like things that in terms of Android that others don't.  But I liked it, too. I just I wasn't sure if like they thought it would be such a huge hit.  And it wasn't the Nexus 4G on Sprint, I think, is a free phone right now.  So I just never know how others perceive things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You guys remember when the G1 came out, the first Android phone had that banana shape.  It had that chin that came out and you had to use it like a real phone.  So when you did this, it still looked the same.  Do you think there's some kind of like push to make a phone look like a phone with with Google for some reason?  Do they really want this thing to be curved to your head?  I mean, is that really a big deal?  Because I know they said, oh, yeah, the curve is good for you for your fingers when you want to do touchscreen stuff.  But maybe they just want ergonomics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They just need a design differentiation.  They just need something to say, hey, look, this is this is new and cool and it's curved.  So it's better than the other.  Are you happy to see me? That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is why they have to be flat.  Otherwise, it just looks very bizarre in your pants.  That's true. That's good.  You got to think of these things.  Unless you're unless you're going to be carrying it like a bandolier or something.  Right.  That's the next tablet version, which should be right across over there.  So Google Plus. Anybody still using Google Plus?  I'm assuming that everyone here is using Google Plus.  What was that? What was that horrible reaction?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, just, you know, book I'm working on Chapter six right now.  It's OK. No, nobody's using Google Plus, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. There was a report out from a company called I think it's called Chitika,  which I keep on a culture, Keita, that they're saying that Google Plus traffic is down 60 percent after they went public.  So there was there's a there's a nice graph which I'm trying to load very slowly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If I was our boss at Lifehacker, I would ask about the where they get their stats from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There we go. So there's the graph.  Here's the thing. I've spent way too much time in my life obsessing about like ups and downs of visits and traffic.  And every time I'm I'm not I don't know Chitika or whatever.  Maybe their measurements are 100 percent right.  But every time I see like like compete says this person's gone down this much and like whatever the various the various stat trackers,  they never whenever they're related to things that I actually know about, they're wrong.  So I don't know.  The Google people seem to argue that.  And I in this instance, for those sorts of things, I tend to believe them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Plus one. Yeah, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, the Google Plus team continues to grow the network and they're there.  I mean, you know, it's hard to say.  My experience is totally subjective.  And it could be that I just have encircled mostly tech nerds and journalists.  But it seems like things are still really active in my own stream.  I enjoy using it. It's a different feeling than than Twitter and Facebook.  But I don't know. I am dubious about these numbers as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Mike Elgin on Google Plus basically tore this this thing apart, saying the figure represents not the decline of Google Plus,  but the kind of newspaper trustworthiness.  And he explains what happened.  Explained that Google Plus was invite only on the day they opened the floodgates to the public immediately spiked by twelve hundred percent.  These new people were mostly enthusiastic new users, but a minority were tire kickers who didn't stick around.  And he basically tears this whole thing apart, saying it should have read traffic increases fivefold as Google Plus opens to the public.  Because if you look back at the graph again, you'll see that when it opened on the 20th, a lot of people showed up.  That makes sense. Why wouldn't people try it out anyway?  Versus sticking around. I mean, this is I was kind of I wanted to believe this.  And here's why I'm like one of those Google Plus hipsters like, you know, I was there before it was cool, you know,  and you have a public post or you have a hangout or something and like, you'd know the people that would show up.  But now everyone's there. Absolutely. Everybody's there.  And they're like, hey, what's going on? And they have all kinds of comments.  It's like the Internet again. So I kind of closed off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The reality is that like that the growth pattern for a small unknown startup launching a new social network is going to be that steady up.  Right. But when Google releases something, you're always going to have that initial spike, especially when it's invite only.  So you get that like Gmail wave rush of people who are just dying for an invite to try it out.  And then when it opens to the public, it goes back up again.  I just think it's unrealistic to think that this traffic pattern is indicative of failure.  I think this is just like this is what happens when Google releases an invite only product and then opens it to the public.  And Google's just you know, it's a big target, easy targets.  I think it's easy to see a lot of stories like this saying, hey, you know, it's dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. The other thing is it's not I mean, it's not as though Google Plus doesn't have its problems.  That's I don't think anyone would would argue that it's perfect.  But I just this it's not it's not I don't think that this chart is indicative of anything that you could actually extract a meaningful analysis from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As Google released the conclusion they reached.  Has Google released any information about actual statistics?  I mean, I know we've seen stuff from I think was Paul Allen from Ancestry.com and we've seen those kinds of speculative kind of numbers.  But has Google said anything in particular?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not that I know of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, Google itself specific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're committed to it, though.  I mean, they they're now listing number of the number of circles and authors in in Google search results, which I thought was a really big and plus one is integrated across all of their their products.  I mean, this is I'm convinced that Google is like full steam ahead on Google Plus committed to integrating this everywhere.  And just the power of having it in that black bar across your Google home page is is is huge.  I don't know if we're really if many people are going to have the choice but to check it out or use it in some capacity, even if it's sort of this like passive sharing kind of face a la Facebook just through plus ones and kind of saying, hey, what's that red button?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, there was there was a post that went out publicly by Google engineer named Steve Yagy.  And he basically tore apart Google Plus.  It's funny that you said that they took time doing it because he called Google Plus a knee jerk reaction, a study in short term thinking predicated on the incorrect notion that that Facebook is successful because they built a great product.  And then it goes on a bit there.  I just want to read some of these quotes and just find out how you guys what do you guys think of this?  Because I was reading this and my jaw was dropped because it just seemed a little bit a little harsh.  But the actual post had been taken down because this was meant to be a private post and has been published everywhere.  So what do you guys think about it being a knee jerk reaction?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Adam really dug into this.  Yeah, sorry, Adam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, go ahead, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was just going to say that in part just to kind of explain it, it seems like he's really targeting the Google Plus platform more than saying Google Plus itself was a knee jerk reaction, unless I read it wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  So the basic idea in it from what I understood was he's not attacking.  It's not an attack on Google Plus primarily, not specifically or primarily.  In fact, it's more about the Google culture.  And his issue is with Google as a company culture that makes products that stand alone, basically these silos.  And he's talking up the one thing that he felt that or the one of three things he felt Amazon did very well during his time in Amazon, which was create services and platforms that that could talk to each other and that that developers both inside the company and outside could create things on top of.  And so his argument with Facebook is that Facebook created a one killer app, which is the wall, the sharing, the social things.  And then the rest of the good things about Facebook are all things that developers have brought to the platform, mostly third party developers.  And Google launched with something that was very much a product.  It's very siloed.  It didn't have an API.  And now the API that it has is very I mean, Gina, you can talk about that a little bit more, but it's not really robust at this point.  And and yeah, so his argument basically is that Google as a company and in particular with Google Plus needs to expand their their thinking towards services over individual products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gina, do you think it's a knee jerk?  I doubt it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, like Adam said, I think that the overall thesis was that that Google has to concentrate on platforms over products.  And so that they're trying to win with Google Plus by making a great product, but they really have to make it a great platform.  You know, this guy worked at Amazon for several years now works at Google.  So I certainly don't have the perspective that he does.  But this didn't seem right to me.  I mean, wave launch Google wave launch.  And it was too much of a platform and not enough of a product.  And, you know, I've worked with the Google Plus API.  I mean, the Google Plus has been out for a couple of months now and the API is limited.  But if you just log into the Google APIs console, there's tons of APIs for all for many of Google's services, if not all.  So I don't know.  I don't I don't see Google as having trouble with making platforms.  I think that, you know, we're so late in the social game at this point, Google has to make a compelling product or else they're going to make the same mistake they made with wave, which was like, here's a thing and you can do everything on it.  You know, developers come build on it.  And it just and it just flopped.  I mean, the way that Facebook and Twitter grew is that they made this great small little product and then they grew it into a platform.  But I don't know if you know that's that's you know, Google is on such an accelerated launch, you know, kind of timeline just because they're Google.  I think they have to make a compelling product first and then extend the platform out.  So far, the Google Plus API is pretty good.  It has a long way to go.  But it's been only a few weeks so far that that it's been out.  So I don't know.  I kind of disagree.  I kind of disagreed with his thesis that Google, you know, maybe internally Google needs to concentrate on platform more.  And this was a post meant for other Google employees.  So it was interesting.  You know, he described how Bezos at Amazon had had kind of issued this edict that every single small team within Amazon had to communicate with one another using services that would eventually be be public facing.  So you had to build an API for everything or else you couldn't use services that other products that other groups are making and how that that really shows because Amazon is such an incredible service provider and platform.  And it is and that Google should adopt a similar a similar model so that, you know, in order for the groups to communicate with one another, they have to create these services that then developers can use.  And that sounds like that that sounds like a great idea.  And that does sound like a huge cultural change inside Google.  I would just love to know what this employee's boss thought about this post because it is interesting that it got taken down, but it got reshared and the shares public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The original love to have written a letter when I was at Lifehacker saying that, you know, Lifehacker deals is a prime example of our complete failure to understand platforms from the very highest levels of executive leadership.  Hi, Adam, Gina, Nick Denton.  Howdy, howdy.  Like it shows something about Google's culture.  And then he even mentioned somewhere else in this really long post that he wrote like a spreadsheet about all the ways that Google loses to Amazon or something.  And he gave it to H.R. and they loved it.  But marketing was a distributor or something like that.  It was all the ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was better than Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I liked it because it would.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But so it's just amazing that, you know, this is something you could write internally and expect not to get fired for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's kind of nice that it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He does say on his on his Google Plus profile, he has a post up and it's basically saying that no one told him to take it down.  It was a call he made himself and deleted because he hadn't intended to make it public in the first place.  But yeah, for whatever that's worth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And when Google Plus launched, I was thinking about some things that were missing.  There's a company right now called Topsy, and they will allow you to search Google Plus for public posts.  You guys remember when Google Plus launched how there was no search built in?  Because I remember that there was some ways around that you could do the site search and you can you could do it via some some extra syntax in Google searches.  But I mean, it looks like people are like like Topsy and other companies like that think that there's a future here in Google Plus.  Like there's a reason why they want to actually scour through these things.  I just know that this is a welcome thing.  I know that Google just added it as well.  They had the search in there.  I could see some of the negative stuff that that Steve put in this post and why he was kind of lashing out a bit on some of this stuff because it seems not fully there.  Are you guys going to try out Topsy or did you enjoy the fact that search is now there are more options for search?  Topsy is kind of a version of Google Sparks that they think works better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like that's what Google Plus Sparks are kind of supposed to do is let you search through and kind of keep track of topics on Google Plus.  But I'm Topsy seems for what I've seen of it to kind of be like what they think is a better implementation of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's scary that you use Sparks because I think maybe our audience may be the only one that knows what that is.  Didn't they rename Sparks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, even I was a little bit like, even I was a little taken off guard when you said Sparks.  Yes.  Does anyone want to try to explain?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google Sparks, which I like this idea.  You'd be able to go into Google Plus and then you'd pick a topic that you're interested in and then you'd see some curated content.  Be a great way to start conversations.  You want to reshare all that stuff because there's no easy way to share stuff on Google Plus once you're off of Google properties,  not including Google Reader where you can't share things directly.  That's a whole other problem, isn't it?  But yeah, that's what Sparks is supposed to be.  It's a very small curated kind of thing.  It's saved searches basically, right?  Kind of.  Well, you can tell what topic you want.  It's taking forever to load.  I picked technology and then I click it and it loads.  Let's see what happens.  Or like a Google News section.  Let's make sure everybody sees everything on my screen.  See, that's private.  That's private.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Excuse me.  As I wing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I'm just teasing.  There's nothing over there that's going to get me fired yet.  But yeah, there we go.  There's some technology posts by my friends on Google Plus.  It's a great idea, but nobody really knows it's there.  You just actually have to pick a spark.  How do you add Sparks anyway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think if you do a search, you can save a search as Sparks.  And I think they actually are still calling it Sparks.  I'll do a search for Lifehacker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.  And then I can say save the search.  And there it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's my spark.  Now I can see it.  And you should see every post where someone has just written the word Lifehacker.  Well, if Lifehacker was a person, it would show you every post that that person has been tagged in publicly.  You know, that kind of thing.  So it is supposed to be kind of like, it kind of seems like what Topsy is trying to get at.  But...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We still don't have a timeline when businesses can be there.  General businesses anyway.  Because I know there's a few partnerships out there.  But Google Plus, I mean Google hasn't said anything about when Lifehacker can actually have a page.  When Twit can.  When SmarterWear.  Anybody hear any rummings about that?  I would say it's likely going to be very soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very soon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Without breaking an NDA?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's my guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why so?  I thought you were going to say because if they're doing all the stuff with APIs, that probably seems like they're building it.  No, actually, I do think...  I think that it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't give specifics.  But we were talking to them right away and really didn't know what they were doing.  And they were like, oh, I'm going to build an API.  And I was like, oh, I'm going to build an API.  And we were talking to them right away and really desperate to get one.  Especially Lifehacker readers are really strong on Google Plus.  So yeah.  I actually don't know anything 100% specific.  But I think it's going to be very soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But now it sounds like you really do.  Yeah, that's what I did.  Yeah, okay. Just checking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Speaking of search, you know, they're just they're enabling hashtags, linked hashtags.  And I'm sorry that Jeff Jarvis isn't here because he's a huge hashtag fan.  But they're going to start hyperlinking.  That's a throwback term.  They're going to start automatically hyperlinking hashtags a la Twitter.  So if you click on them and you see a search for hashtags, which is really interesting for a lot of reasons.  So they don't have that deal for the real time search results with Twitter anymore in search results.  So they have this live search results and hashtag support.  So you can imagine being on your Google TV and watching the premiere of Glee and having the Google Plus stream of Glee hashtag posts kind of running down the side or across the bottom of your screen.  And that's something that I do manually with Twitter now.  But you can see that they might want to move that kind of functionality over to Google Plus.  And really interesting to me that they're using hashtags, which really started as kind of a Twitter convention.  But the inventor of hashtags, Chris Messina, works at Google now.  So it's not too surprising.  So I assume that we're going to see real time search results from Plus inside of Google search results soon and that hashtags are just, you know, will be will be used even more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I get text messages with hashtags in them.  I see people using them on Facebook.  You know, they're almost kind of just a fact of online life now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's true. I was going to say kudos to Gina to get the Glee mention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, we have some some viewers who play a drinking game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Earlier when we were talking about the Google Plus rush, I was going to say it's like when Chipotle opens and everyone goes during the first week.  And then, you know, but I decided against it.  But then I kind of didn't. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now we've got two drinks. That's two different games.  Chipotle and Glee.  So if you're if you're really, really having a bad day, Glee, Glee, Glee, Glee, Glee.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Habermas.  Or you can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You see that Google did a Google Plus hangout ad in a newspaper, which I find this very odd.  The New York Times. It's a small publication in a very tiny town called New York.  The New York Times is full page ad.  Well, it's a full page, but there's a little bit of text.  It's about the Dalai Lama not being able to go to Desmond Tutu's 80th birthday party.  But then he was allowed to because they corrected the ad, the actual ad there.  You could see with a little red pen there says he was able to join in a hangout thanks to Google Plus.  I really want to know if you guys think that the New York Times audience has any idea what that ad means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good question.  Like I would assume that.  It's a print ad.  It seemed kind of an obtuse ad, didn't it?  For someone who doesn't know what hangout is, it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is a rather subtle ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the Google Plus logo, like the plus sign after Google.  I mean, obviously everyone knows what the Google logo is, but I don't know that you're like, oh, Google Plus.  That's like another product for someone who doesn't know.  It's like an odd ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, they didn't do anything like interesting.  It's not even a QR code.  I mean, that I think would be more obtuse if it was simply a QR code.  But there's a tiny URL on the bottom.  I'm just confused about this.  I mean, if they're trying to get people on Google Plus, I mean, maybe this is the audience they want.  But I mean, would this ad get you to go, yes, this is, I will learn about what a hangout is.  This is via hangout.  It doesn't even explain what that is.  This is joined at the 80th birthday celebration via hangout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is definitely probably one of the coolest breakout features of Google Plus.  And in every sense of the word breakout, because you could kind of almost use hangouts without even really being a Google Plus fan.  You know, you just have to add the right people to your circle or just do all your hangouts publicly.  But the group video chat feature of Google Plus is probably like one of its biggest appeals beyond the I don't like Facebook or, you know, I want a different kind of sharing market.  So it's a it's a good direction to aim an ad in.  But that is really subtle for even a supposedly higher educated audience.  Well, hopefully they get a lot of people's attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know the hangouts are being used by Felicia Day nowadays to promote a new show.  I think it's called Dragon's Age, but I don't want to say the wrong name.  Yeah, Dragon Age.  And what she'll be doing is a three hour marathon session where she'll hang out with as many people as she can.  She's calling it Hangout House Calls.  That's that's coming up on Tuesday.  So if you want to hang out with Felicia Day, I guess you just have to start to set up a hangout and she's going to just keep showing up.  This is what do you guys think of this as a marketing kind of idea, just showing up to talk to, I guess, fans.  So it's like you got a new show and you just show up.  Is this is this going to be are we going to see like, oh, great tweets about this later or Google Plus messages saying this is fantastic?  Are they going to say this was a disaster because it was very awkward?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually think that this happened yesterday and I didn't get a chance to see how how it went.  I mean, I think Felicia is super savvy social media user and she's got tons of fans and followers.  And I think a lot of them are really shy nerds who would be scared to ask her for a photo in person if they saw her,  but would like love to get a screen cap of a video chat with her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thanks for the question. It was yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I think it was yesterday.  So I actually I wonder if she posted an update. I'd love to know how it went.  I would love to see our political candidates do this kind of thing or just anyone who kind of wanted to reach out to fans in a way that was manageable,  but not, you know.  Well, I mean, it's nice to not have to leave your computer right and be able to connect with people individually.  Although I imagine it was a bit of an awkward and long three hours for her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that what is happening here and what Google knows what they're doing is that like with Twitter, you know,  I can I can broadcast on Twitter and a lot of us can broadcast on Twitter because we have like a certain critical mass of followers.  That's not normal.  So that's not like the ability to broadcast on Twitter.  I don't think is why most people sign up for Twitter to start out.  I think most people sign up because they want to follow Felicia Day, Felicia Day, or they want to follow various celebrities.  And Google is playing that up big time, I think, specifically with Hangouts because it does give them the opportunity to show what is cool about Google Plus.  And it actually draws a lot of people in.  So they've had like they've had like some will I am promotions and and then, you know, things like this.  Like this is the kind of thing that is their best bet to draw in people like Kevin said, who aren't the privacy crowd or or whatever.  The very specific thing that it definitely does better than others.  This is the thing that's going to attract people and be like, oh, I can hang out with a celebrity.  I think is cool. Awesome. I will sign up for and maybe stick around at Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This has to be like a chat roulette session for Felicia.  She did 40 Hangouts in three hours.  I'm sure that it was a little nerve wracking to click that join button for 40 Hangouts or 40 different guests in the Hangout.  She had 40 different. She says 40 different Hangouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hardcore. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is the ears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have screen shots, post the links on her on her post.  I could see. Yeah.  Like Gina was saying, potentially chat roulette danger.  I would hope that you have some kind of screener because you don't want to necessarily see something you don't want to see right away.  Yeah. On that note, we should thank our sponsor.

They apparently had a lousy August when it came to market share when it came to searches.  If you guys forgot, Google does searches.  They're not just an advertising company that does social networks and makes phone operating systems.  But they've gained some market share back.  And I'm patiently waiting for the thing to load on my computer to tell me the number.  They dipped down below 65% and they went back up to, well, they went back beyond 65%.  So that's what they did.  Is anybody surprised that Google's market share is diminishing to things like Yahoo?  And obviously Yahoo's powered by Bing.  Or are all these searches fungible at this point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They stumped everybody.  Yeah.  They stumped everyone.  Sorry.  Yeah, there we go.  Forget that then.  Let's go to Google.com and go to the Google Doodle.  That'll wake everybody up.  If you go to Google.com, you'll see little clay balls.  Oh, Gumby.  Yes, exactly.  Because it is Art Cloakey's 90th birthday.  Wow.  He made Gumby.  He also made, if you've watched a lot of television when you were a kid like me, you've seen Davy and Goliath.  He was behind all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My God, I love claymation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How awesome is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Click on the balls.  They all do awesome things.  Let's see.  Ken?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've totally started to come around on people against folks who are complaining that Google doesn't have a standardized system for what they choose to celebrate.  Because you can click on the clay and it turns into Gumby people.  I mean, the argument being, if you've been following Twig for a while, that they choose weird things to celebrate and they don't necessarily choose some major things or things that are just commonly celebrated and recognized.  But this is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a challenge in the chat room.  Can you name all the characters that are on there?  I can only name Gumby, Pokey, and the Blockheads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pokey is the best I could do past Gumby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Who's this little Stenosaurus dude?  I can't remember his name.  Or this is Gumby's sister.  I think that's Gumby's sister.  If only I could use some kind of search engine to look up Gumby characters.  If only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know their names.  This is really, really interesting actually.  If I paste a link in here to Skype, can you see it?  Can we bring that up at all?  This is the background.  In the dock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, put it in the dock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The dock chat.  I'm just putting it right at the top because I don't.  So if you go to that URL, the way that they're doing the animations, I was kind of curious.  They've got a background image for each of those little balls.  And when you click it, it animates through the background position.  So it's got like the whole animation in one image.  It's kind of neat.  That is really neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is really neat.  It is true stop motion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's probably how they got the market share back actually.  By having lots of fun animations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Straight up stop motion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You don't need to actually offer great search results.  Just have really cool animations that make you play.  When they had Pac-Man that I lost the whole day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that aren't Flash, right?  That are HTML5.  Yeah, that Pac-Man.  That Pac-Man doodle.  I still want my...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's still around.  You can find it somewhere else.  I think it's one where you can record music for Les Paul's birthday.  I know it's not a birthday.  I guess the anniversary of his birth.  Because everyone is all dead.  But I didn't want to bring everybody down.  Because I've already done that a couple of times.  The chat room was correcting me like crazy.  Like, Art's dead.  I'm like, yes, I know he's dead.  Sorry.  I can't bring him back.  So Hulu is still for sale.  And apparently Google's still in the running.  Now, Yahoo just bowed out because they're having all kinds of problems.  As I'm sure everyone knows.  They have an interim CEO.  They're trying to figure out if they're going to be going into sale with a private equity firm.  Or what are they going to do?  But Google's still out there.  And they seem to be interested in Hulu only if they get certain conditions.  They want some exclusive rights.  Exclusive content rights that are guaranteed for years.  Adam, do you think that Google going into Hulu or buying Hulu is the best thing for them to do?  I mean, they seem to already have deals with a bunch of content partners for YouTube.  Why would they necessarily even need something like Hulu?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what I don't actually understand with this is obviously there's pretty clear reasons why they would want Hulu.  But if they bought Hulu, do you think it would stay as its own product?  Do you think it would integrate with, it would just become a YouTube channel of some, an elevated YouTube channel of some sort?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I would think that after what they did with Google videos and YouTube, that to have two separate entities might be a mess for them at this point.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because...  And it creates one, yeah, it creates one place where they can send all their people.  And integrating with things like Google TV.  Because you also imagine that they're thinking some point down the future where you could...  Because right now Google TV is best for...  Or it can do web video, but it can also do your cable box.  But this could potentially bring the cable box or take the cable box part out of the equation because that web video would do the same thing for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Kevin, do you think that, do you think they would, Google would merge YouTube and Hulu or would they keep them separate?  I mean, Hulu does actually have a bit of goodwill to its name and people know it already.  I mean, but people know YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What Adam just said, but with the cynical footnote that like once Google tries to do that, every network and carrier tries to shut them down for trying to do it.  Every cable company.  I mean, that's their worst nightmare really is that you would, you know, have Hulu integrated into a set-top box that you get from your carrier.  And then, you know, you can just at any time come home and watch reruns with a reduced ad rate with, you know, with cheaper ads that they weren't able to place as easily.  So it's kind of what some of the tech savvy among us are already doing with, you know, Roku's and, you know, DIY boxes and stuff.  But it would be a smart ploy if they could figure out some way to make peace with everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So if they could buy Hulu and they could preload it on their Motorola tablets, they could preload it on Google TV, unless they could block themselves and basically be jerks themselves like has been going on.  Gina, what's your opinion on this?  Do you think Google, the fact that they want all these conditions to buy Hulu, do you think they're actually still a serious competitor?  Because, I mean, they want exclusive deals for a long term and that seems like something that the content companies just don't want to give them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  I would love to see Hulu kind of come under their Google umbrella and keep their name and get integrated right into my Google TV.  I'm one of the, you know, one of the 10 people who actually has Google TV and uses it.  So I'd love to see that happen.  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the other thing about keeping them separate is that it makes it a little clearer that Hulu is where you go to watch TV and YouTube is where you go to watch user generated video, even though that's not actually the case.  Can anyone remember what's the name of the partner, the music video?  Vivo.  Vivo.  So it could be a Vivo situation where it comes in and it's like Hulu branded but it's in Google.  But in ways it does make, I think, still a lot of sense to keep Hulu as a separate entity.  Kind of do too.  But who knows?  Because there's also the issue of YouTube in a way that a lot of Google products aren't has a really, really, or and like Google Plus, as I'm sure trying to get to be, it has a really strong community.  YouTube comments aside, like it's a very, very active social network.  So you could see wanting to integrate the social aspects of YouTube, but then also they have competing networks like Google Plus that I'm sure they kind of want to get to become the de facto network of their various properties.  So who knows?  Yeah, it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can rent and buy or stream movies and TV from the Android market now, right, to your Android device.  And then, and I still, it's true, I still associate YouTube with kitten videos from Japan or whatever, user generated videos.  So it'll be interesting to see how they fit Hulu in.  I think that, yeah, I think that you're right.  It'd be interesting to see.  I would like to see Google have a property that's like, this is where I go to, you know, to watch TV or to even rent or buy episodes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just want to, I want Google to buy it just because of the irony aspect of this.  I mean, Hulu was created to kill all this piracy on YouTube, all our content's being stolen.  Nobody's going to watch us.  We're going to create our own thing and we're going to kill YouTube.  Yeah, no, you didn't.  You didn't kill YouTube.  You're going to get bought by YouTube.  That I think would just be kind of funny to see in the long run.  But I'm kind of curious about considering how Google also, back to what Adam was talking about when it comes to the whole social aspect of Hulu.  I mean, the fact that you can use Facebook Connect with it.  I mean, Google and Facebook haven't exactly been pals and Google wants to scrape Facebook's data.  You know they do.  I mean, Facebook's got to deal with Bing about it.  I wonder if they would do it, if they, if they did buy Hulu, if they would try to continue that relationship with Facebook,  would they just change the button to sign in with Google Plus or sign in with a Google account?  It could be an interesting kind of backdoor way to get into a relationship with Facebook if they wanted.  Because I mean, real time search and social search is, I think that's a big deal.  You know, what your friends think is kind of a big deal.  Anyone have any thoughts on the idea of Google working with Facebook via Hulu?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, God, all your ideas do belong to us, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The utopia would be then that I could share Hulu watching habits with my close friends circle and nobody else can see them.  Because I had an incident recently where my wife and I share a Hulu account and a lot of people think I like Grey's Anatomy now.  So I would really like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We know you like Grey's, Kevin. Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I watch it over the laptop. I'm doing work, Gina.  Oh, the fear of showing up.  While Liz is watching it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My obsession with Hell's Kitchen, even though it's the same episode every single episode, I'll watch all seven seasons over and over again or nine seasons.  Yeah, I guess that could be embarrassing.  Maybe I should disconnect that kind of thing.  It's kind of like with Spotify. I make sure that my information is not going on Facebook.  Oh, yeah, sometimes you talk about Facebook on this show.  Facebook launched an iPad app.  Is everyone excited? Because I heard it's not very good.  It just crashes over and over again.  Gina, you tried the Facebook app. You liked it or you didn't like it?  Because I heard it's crashing all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I liked it and I was really relieved.  You know, the only iOS device I have is an iPad.  So I get really, really kicked off when apps don't, you know, that are in 2X, that small little frames.  I feel the same way about Google+.  So I liked it. I haven't spent a lot of time on it because I'm not a huge Facebook person, but I do like to pop in once in a while.  So I haven't had too much crashing happening, but I'm a casual Facebook user.  I'll admit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is anyone else just waiting for the Google+, official iPad app?  I think the web app's really good.  I mean, I don't even know if there's a need for it other than the fact that you just want to have a dedicated icon you can get from the app store.  I mean, do you guys think there's a reason now that Facebook has gone ahead and made, and finally made, their iPad app official,  will Google actually come out with a Google+, iPad app soon?  Or are they going to, I don't know, maybe do that for honeycomb or ice cream sandwich, if they already have those things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's probably a little bit lower on their to-do list for Google+, I imagine, in terms of the things they want to fix and things they want to get in place.  Facebook took a long time with their iPad app, and it's not like people started quitting over, to my knowledge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and I actually don't imagine, I can't imagine it making, they're not hurrying most of the time to the iPhone stuff,  but I could see very easily an Android tablet version of Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's definitely going to happen. That's no doubt going to happen pretty soon.  You know, the thing is, the reason why I want the iPad app for Google+, is that the account switching gets kind of wonky for me.  I'm a Google Apps user primarily, but I switch to my vanilla Gmail account to log in on Plus, which is a whole other annoying thing about Plus.  They don't support apps users yet.  So the web app gets kind of flaky for me, so I really like to just have a native app to log into on my iPad,  but I think that they're going to probably release the honeycomb slash ice cream sandwich tablet layout version of the Google Plus app first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And let's thank another one of our sponsors, Vast.  Now, this episode of Twig is brought to you by Vast.  Vast Conference is the ultimate in professionalism, clarity, and flexibility for your conference calls, all at a low price.  For two Vast Conference calls, you can try that out.  We'll explain some more about it before you go try it out.  I feel like most of us, when you want to try to be professional in your business,  professionalism really begins with those all-important conference calls,  because you don't want some weird, VoIPy, Skypey thing happening while you're actually on a call with a prospective client.  So what makes a call professional? A dial-in number.  Some people, they don't want to just have to sign up for an account and do an audio thing.  You can have a dial-in number that give out for calls at a moment's notice.  Clear connections when you and your participants dial in.  The popping delays of VoIP, yeah, that doesn't happen on Vast.  And for large calls, you can manage call participants online.  Now, I want to tell you about a company that's put it all together, and that's Vast.  Vast Conference is a professional, affordable, and quite advanced.  It enables you to quickly connect two or more callers on the phone.  Many conference calls have three to five participants.  But get this, Vast supports up to 300 callers at once.  So if you wanted to have some kind of like giant conference call, Vast can handle that.  They give you both a regular dial-in number and a toll-free number,  and you use these to set up calls at any time.  Vast calls are clear because they are using fiber optic lines and high-end teleconferencing equipment,  something you just can't get from VoIP.  Vast includes a well-designed conference call management interface,  which you can use on their website to manage your users and callers.  For large calls, you can even have a question and answer session.  It'll be right on the website.  You can record calls as MP3.  So let's say you want to just use it as a podcasting tool.  You could even do that, have people call in as your guests.  You can use Vast for this kind of thing because it'll record an MP3 for you.  So that's doing all the work for you.  You can also access detailed usage tracking and billing codes for internal accounting  if that's what you're using this for.  Vast also comes with a friendly, very, very friendly, and enthusiastic customer service team.  They call it above and beyond customer service, and they're right to call it that.  The pricing for this professional conference service is low.  It's pay as you go, 2.5 cents per minute for regular toll calls  and 6 cents per minute for 800-number calls.  You decide whether to give out a regular call-in or a toll-free number,  so your rate will vary depending on what number you give them.  Sign up is fast and easy, and there are no commitments or contracts.  You only pay for calls you host.  Now Vast is giving our audience an exclusive, two business calls for free,  up to 300 minutes to give you a chance to try out the service.  Go to vastconference.com and sign up for a free account.  It's fast, it's easy.  They'll give you a regular toll number and a toll-free number,  so you can start using this for your calls right away.  Remember to use the promo code TWIG and get your two business calls for free.  That's vastconference.com, promo code TWIG,  and you can go out there and have conference calls with just everybody  for a very low rate.  We thank Vast Conference for their support of TWIG.  And now it's time for Gina's tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My tip, it's a really simple one this week,  but it's something that I use all the time.  I constantly use Google as a dictionary to define words.  You can use the define keyword in the Google search box to get definitions  right in the Google One box, which is little bits of information  that give you your answer right away, like weather and flights.  They added synonyms.  This made the writer and me really happy.  They added synonyms to the definitions one box.  So if you do something like, if you say define, obviate,  you get the definition of the verb, and then you get synonyms,  avoid, prevent, evade, avert.  So when you're looking for a word other than, you know, awesome  or something that gets overused, you can get that straight in the One box  in Google search results by using the definition tool.  And I mentioned this earlier today, but I also noticed, this is new to me,  but they're including the number of circles that authors of web pages  are in in search results.  So if you search for something that Adam authored at Lifehacker,  for example, you can see how many circles he's in on Google Plus  if he has that information public on his profile.  So that's kind of interesting too.  So Google search results getting a little better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That seems really cool.  I use Google as a dictionary far too often than I'd like to admit.  But synonyms would be nice too.  But yeah, the circles thing, that's a cool little feature.  And normally we have Jeff Jarvis with a number,  but we are going to throw that number segment to Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. Stop me if you've heard this number before, but I don't think so.  44%, and that is the number of searches for last-minute holiday gifts  that Google says will be made on mobile devices.  It's a little bit of a trick number because in some ways  they're kind of saying that 44% of all searches around the holidays  will be mobile and so therefore you can kind of fudge the numbers  that way to make it look like that.  But they also have some other interesting numbers in a post  they did recently on their mobile blog where they found that basically  the tablet buying, the tablet audience,  the people who are shopping for holiday gifts on their tablets  are 45% likely to buy before Thanksgiving  and 17% likely to buy after Thanksgiving on like Black Friday.  Smartphone buyers though, they're only 34% likely to buy before Thanksgiving  and 35% likely to buy after Thanksgiving.  So Google is telling you iPad owners that you're doing great,  you're ahead of the curve, you're totally on top of your holiday shopping.  Or as smartphone buyers, we're on Amazon and Newegg on Friday  trying to fill in the last of our list.  That's not really what they're saying, but there's a lot of interesting statistics  about mobile use and shopping on Google's mobile blog, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not to put you on the spot, Adam, but do you happen to have a tip?  Considering you're a life hacker, you might actually have one at the top of your head.  If you don't, don't worry about it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a secret tip. It's quiet, we can't hear it, it's muted.  It must be earth shattering.  Okay, okay, okay.  There it goes, there it goes.  Otherwise I was ready for charades, I was gearing up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, so I didn't know if there was going to be a number today,  so just now I scrambled and I have a very good one,  so I'm going to piggyback on the number.  Earlier this week, Google released the Chrome Remote Desktop extension,  which you install on your Chrome browser  and someone else installs on their Chrome browser,  and you can remotely control their desktop using just Chrome.  You basically give them a code that's generated when you launch the extension,  they paste it into their browser,  and then they can control your entire desktop.  It's a remote desktop thing.  19.1 is the number of megabytes that the extension download is,  which is I think probably the biggest extension I've ever installed.  That's a pretty hefty extension.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a big part of a Chromebook hard drive.  I think it works really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Chromebook hard drive is like what, like 8 megabytes?  I don't know if that's even going to fit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've seen the original tester unit, I saw a number saying it was like 85, 65 megs or something,  so yeah, that would be about a third of your hard drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I like that the extension needs all the data on your computer  and all the websites that you visit.  It's like, just give us everything if you want to use this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Those app access things are very daunting.  They always seem very scary.  Yeah, I mean, if you want access for anything,  like if you do a script that wants to read anything on any page,  then it's all your tabs and browsing and data on your stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In some ways, with the Chrome remote extension,  the permission should just be your computer.  You install this, and guess what?  Someone's going to have your computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  At least to be honest, I could just say, you know, you don't want to know.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just if you trust us, do it.  If you don't, just don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's the new EULA. Trust us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Capitalism's a dirty world, kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I've got a tool for you guys.  It's for Google Chrome.  Now, I don't like putting extensions that affect Google Plus  because it's not fully rolled out still.  I mean, even back then, it was in a private, what do they call it?  Field testing or something like that.  And so I finally got an addition for Google Plus, and this is for Google Chrome.  It hides the Google Plus notification.  The actual extension is called hide Google Plus notification.  And if you're like me, you see that black bar on the top  of pretty much everything you are using.  I use Google Docs for everything,  including my email and the documents for our shows and things are there.  And I get so easily distracted when that black bar turns red,  when that tiny little thing turns red.  So I have to click it, and then somebody's written something,  I get infuriated, and I start going off and doing something else,  and then I forgot that I was supposed to be doing work, and then forget it.  What this thing does, it actually takes away that little number  on every property except Google Plus, which makes a lot of sense.  So if you're in email or if you're in a rundown for, I don't know, a show,  you won't see that number there anymore.  So even though there's all kinds of ways to turn off certain notifications,  when somebody adds you to a circle, you get a little number.  There's two, there's three, or you've forgot about some stupid comment,  or in my case, some stupid comment I wrote on Google Plus,  and then people have written something else on there.  So now I get to avoid it.  So I definitely suggest this for those kinds of people who just want to see a black bar,  and only a black bar, and no little red button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really funny because I noticed in your rundown  when we got to it before that there was no number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we can go, we can cut to it right now.  You can see that it's just my name, and, but if I went to Plus, it'd be there.  Does it also take the number, you know what drives me crazy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The fact that the number of notifications shows up in your Google Plus tab title.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, that's why I usually keep that tab closed.  Yeah, so if you have it open in the background,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you see that you've unread things like on the tab, it makes me crazy.  I actually enable that for Gmail because that I want,  but I don't want it for Google Plus, so it'd be great if that extension did that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you can, can you turn off the thing in Gmail you can, but not in Plus.  That's, it should get on that, but yeah, on Plus you can actually see the red too.  I don't know what, let's see what happened.  Let's see what happened in my Google Plus.  Oh, somebody commented on something, so that's fine.  This is the perfect location for where I want notifications,  not when I'm in the rundown and I notice, oh look, pithy comments, that's great.  And that's also why I usually keep Google Plus, the tab closed,  because of what Gina said, there's a little number up there,  and I don't want to see it because then I'll get distracted,  because I'm all like, a child.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They did something pretty incredible with that little notification button,  or that number when it flips through, when a new comment comes in,  you know, like six and then six is scrolling up and down,  it is extremely addictive and really, really hard to ignore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I try to keep it at nine plus for a while, because that's the max it does,  and then you're like, okay, you're hoping that nothing happens.  I'm just pegged at nine, it doesn't want to change.  You just never want to click it again, because then you have to keep clicking.  It's like a disorder, I think, Google Plus disorder.  I think that wraps up this episode.  Let's plug some things.  Kevin, where can people find you on the Internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, I'm Kevin Purdy on Twitter, and I'm on Google Plus as well, just Kevin Purdy,  and let's see, thecompleteandroidguide.com,  and most recently there's a link here on the screen, but bit.ly slash G plus MM spelled out.  That's the link to the O'Reilly book I'm writing right now, Google Plus, the Missing Manual,  which should be out just after the holidays, maybe before them, who knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Will the back of the book have a URL which has like updates to the book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Indeed, it's the, Google Plus is nothing if not a moving target,  as I like revise every chapter five times.  So yeah, we'll also on the Missing CD page, we'll have all that stuff you should expect from O'Reilly products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's great, because there's a lot of things on Google Plus,  I mean, unless you spend like all day in there, you won't be able to find, so it's good on you for writing that.  How about you, Adam? I know you're on lifehacker.com. Any other things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm Adam Pash on Twitter, same on Google Plus.  Let's see, Gina and I wrote a book, co-wrote a book, it's the Lifehacker book.  It's, you can go to lifehackerbook.com, and yeah, I think that's probably good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What if people want to see you in video form? Maybe if you do like a show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could go to youtube.com slash lifehacker for all the latest, or check us out on revision3.com slash lifehacker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's awesome. And Gina, would you like to plug anything beyond SmarterWare?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, I just released a new version of the software that I work on called ThinkUp.  ThinkUp, if you go to thinkupapp.com, it's a social media analytics tool,  and we just added Google Plus support in our last beta, which came out two days ago.  So you can archive, you can capture and archive all your Google Plus posts, your Facebook posts, your Twitter posts,  and you can analyze conversations, get like word frequency graphs, and export your tweets to CSVs.  You can do all kinds of cool, you can plot your tweets on a map.  But this is the best beta ever.  So if you've been thinking about trying out ThinkUp, and I know a lot of Twitter listeners have,  now's the time to do it because the latest beta is probably the best it's ever been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And if you've circled Gina in Google Plus, you would have known this already.  So you should be following everybody because I'm sure everyone is explaining this.  Is it circled? Is it followed? What's the actual verbiage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My editor does not think that it's encircled. I'll just tell you that.  It's not encircled. Nobody thinks that's cute or funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what I would have been using.  You were Lysud. That's what it was. It was like a corral.  Okay, so next week Leo will be back. So you can watch this show, this week in Google, with more Leo Laporte,  100% more Leo Laporte next week. Thanks for watching this episode with Hosted by Me. Bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Skype is, I'm just noticing that we're having some issues with our connection here.  I'm noticing that the video is, or load times for the internet is slow. So I don't know if that's.  We've done.  Probably on our end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or wait, you know what? It's probably iOS 5.  It's iOS 5.  Who's downloading iOS 5 here?  Stop downloading iOS 5 and Lion 10.7.2 and.  Stop chill out for the show.  And iTunes 10.5. Come on, guys. We're trying to run a network here.  Oh, God. Sorry. So Kevin, are you?  Kevin's back.
