Let's start with all the way over to the far left, which is Kevin Marks. He's in Seattle at a privacy conference right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's right. I'm at Privacy, Authenticity, Innovation, which is one of those conferences where different groups of people meet.  So there's tech people, there's lawyers, and there's like legislative people as lawmakers as well. So it's an interesting one. It's quite fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin works, of course, at Salesforce, but he's an advocate of open standards. Were you involved in OAuth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was peripherally involved in OAuth. I forwarded it to the internal security people at Google and they jumped all over it.  I was sort of on the mailing list and listening, but I don't pretend to understand security well enough to comment helpfully on some of that stuff.  I just listen to people and talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Authentication is a big part of not just identity, but security and privacy and all of that.  I was pretty much a breakthrough in this.  He also hosts a great show about Tummeling, which is the name that the old Yiddish comics and performers used in the Catskills.  The Tummeler was kind of the social director, wasn't he, for those Catskill hotels?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The one who got everyone to talk to each other and dance, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everyone needs a Tummeler. We'll make Kevin our honorary Tummeler. Now look at this shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think you're the Tummeler here, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at this shot. From Sydney Harbour, Jeff Jarvis at BuzzMachine.com.  If you're watching the video of this show, that is sunrise in Sydney. Thank you for joining us so early in the morning, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My pleasure. I'll get better light on myself soon, but I thought I'd give you a nice view of the bridge.  We were earlier looking at the opera house.  Wow.  And I don't think we're going to see the opera house from here, not quite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the good news. For the first time ever, you don't look too pale.  What are you doing in Sydney?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm at the Sydney Writers' Conference, Writers' Festival.  I was speaking a couple of times, and it's about privacy and publicness this year, so that's why I'm doing it.  And then I go on to Seoul next week.  This is so great. This is so fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, we're missing you at PII, Jeff, because they were reminiscing about you coming last year or the year before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wish there was a very good conference. Good people. Really good people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We will definitely get synopses of both those conferences from you guys in just a second.  I also want to introduce Gina Trapani, who, like me, is staying home this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm just living my boring life, sitting in my boring home office, but thrilled to be here as usual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You should go to San Diego Harbour. Then we can have an all-harbour session.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We could. We'll all harbour all the time.  I'll just go out by the Petaluma River, which is actually only posing as a river.  It's really a tidal slough, and it smells like one, I might add.  Top story today, Glee mentions Chipotle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Huge. I was so excited when that happened last night.  I was like, oh, now all we need is Gutenberg, Habermas, and Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If Glee ever mentions Gutenberg, then you know there's somebody in the screenwriting room who knows us.  That happens every once in a while.  There have been comic books, there have been TV shows that have had little inside mentions of stuff on Twitter  that's kind of like a little wink or a nudge. So it could be. You don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If they ever mention Twig on Glee, I will explode into a million bits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But we'll know, Glee writer, anonymous Glee writer, we'll know if Gutenberg sneaks in.  Yeah, we will know.  Habermas is a giveaway.  Oh, Habermas is a giveaway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you get to study Habermas, that would be beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I still don't know who Habermas is. The only guy I've ever heard talk about it is this guy, Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I get in trouble for it every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you shouldn't.  There was a fake Habermas Twitter account at one point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What did he say? He was a German philosopher? Is that who he was?  He is.  He's alive.  He's alive.  Well, wait a minute. Chad, we've got our new producer, by the way, Chad Johnson on the board today.  Eileen, as you know, has departed the building.  But we'll be back on Monday for all that Android.  Chad, let's book Habermas.  Let's book him. Let's get him on the show.  Wow.  And if you do, do-  He's a recluse in Germany.  Recluse. We like him even better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll make sure to send him a 4G card so he can remain reclusive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  There goes a vote behind me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And here's the fake account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at that. Look at this.  This is the best looking twig ever.  The Sydney Harbour comes to life behind Jeff Jarvis.  So I don't know where to start here.  There are a lot of stories.  Matt Cutts, I will just give you right at the top, is going to be joining us for triangulation this afternoon.  Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Great get. Great get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m. Eastern Time.  And he did a great little video.  Well, actually, he's done many great little videos.  And here is the mashup.  A fan mashup.  A fan mashup, not produced by Google, of Matt Cutts, how to rank-  Let's just play this. I think we can play this.  How to rank number one on Google with Matt Cutts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hi, everybody. Hello.  You know, anybody's welcome to show up.  It's a party in here.  So, hi, everybody.  Matt Cutts here.  Wow, so many questions.  We have a fun question today from a billion people in the Philippines.  Matt, your Webmaster help videos are a big success and I think everybody loves them.  Yay. It's a great help for Webmasters.  But if one wanted to rank number one, how would you go about doing this?  You know, on what basis are the results ranked?  Wow, really good question.  I don't think anybody's ever asked me that before.  So, oh, I know this answer.  Poor guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, very good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm glad you asked this.  Rest. That's a really interesting question.  Oh, boy. Okay. Keyword density.  Let's talk about it a little bit.  There's one recipe and you can just follow that like, you know, baking cookies.  And if you follow it to the letter, you'll rank number one.  And that's just the way it works.  Hey, that's pretty interesting.  It's about that word.  The next time you mention that word, oh, okay.  It's still about that word.  And once you start to mention it a whole lot, then that might help with your ranking.  Absolutely.  What is the ideal keyword density?  The answer is 77%.  Get the same phrase on the page as many times as possible.  There's lots of different factors that would make you rank well.  But fundamentally, in addition to keyword stuffing, we look at links to porn sites.  That's the sort of thing that's going to be really rewarding for users.  So links to porn sites.  Could be annoying?  Yes, it could be annoying.  It could be annoying.  And that's perfectly fine.  So another thing is you will rank higher because you run AdSense.  It's definitely the case that you get some boost because you run AdSense.  So I absolutely would recommend you run AdSense.  It's a really nice feature.  So yeah, that would be an opportunity.  So that's just some very quick advice about how to rank number one.  And this made me feel really good.  I go to bed at night sleeping relatively well, knowing that I'm trying to change the world.  And I think that's fantastic.  But also, I do think that Bing or Bleco or DuckDuckGo are potentially doing illegal things like hacking sites.  Let's take a step back and stop hating on everybody for a second.  Peace out, spread the love, don't worry about it that much, and keep working on it.  You're making your own website as good as you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow, Sam Applegate made that call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bravo, kudos, Sam.  Yeah, kudos to Sam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been through this with Google and none of the advice is accurate.  As far as I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For those of you listening, you can see all Matt's different haircuts, different weight loss stages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At one point, he's completely shaven bald on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's completely shaven during one of his 30-day deals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what? I think that's adorable.  Matt is such a great frontman for Google and Google Search.  As you know, he's been on the show many times.  He's in charge of fighting spam on Google's web results, search results.  But he gives those great webmaster videos and I think that's...  Just pray no one does that for us. That's all I can say.  Pray.  Other top stories.  Let's see, where to begin today?  I don't have anything to hang my hat on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, nothing screams this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm pretty excited that I finally got ICS on my big phone, my Galaxy Note.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you were an ICS hater before, I thought.  Well, I don't like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A couple of things I didn't like about ICS are fixed in the version that Samsung pushed.  Remember, this is Samsung's version, so it has TouchWiz and it has some new Samsung apps.  But the couple of things I didn't like, I don't like the Nexus because it doesn't have buttons.  And this, of course, this phone has physical buttons.  Oh yeah, I'll put it down here so you can see it.  Which means you don't lose the menu button.  So part of my complaint about ICS is that the buttons tend to...  Because they're all soft, they're all in software, they tend to be in different...  The menu sometimes is here, sometimes is there. I think that's bad design.  My other complaint about ICS was you were forced to have a Google...  On the Nexus, anyway.  A Google search box taking up a considerable amount of space.  And on the bottom, the icon row.  So even on a big screen, you lost a lot of real estate to forced Google content.  That's not the case.  What's TouchWiz is running is pretty much identical to the gingerbread version of this phone.  Except that it has now ICS running in the background, so the user interface is nicer on some of the apps and things like that.  I think this is actually a good compromise.  If I press and hold the home key, I now get...  The thing I think is completely useless, but some people like the task browser where you get the thumbnails of running applications, which aren't really running.  And so you still get that ICS feature, but it's not taking up a whole button, really.  I really don't like it that the home button does...  Or what is it? The recent button does that.  So you still have a back button because that's a hardware back button.  You still have a menu button because it's a hardware button.  Those don't change even if you rotate.  So I think all in all this is good.  It feels a little sluggish on the note, to be honest with you.  I'm not sure if there's something I'm doing or if there's something that's going on with ICS on the note.  But it did seem to slow it down a little bit.  So, I don't know.  That's not a story. That's just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, not to jump ahead, but Apple is rumored to be going to a larger screen iPhone, right?  Is there some magic moment coming, some magic size you think?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, this is one of the reasons I like...  There was a great chart of Android fragmentation.  I'll pull it up and show it to you.  This is one of the reasons I like Android fragmentation.  More choices.  So there is a sweet spot for every human.  Very few people like the Galaxy Note.  Well, I shouldn't say that because I think it's selling quite well.  But not everybody wants a 5.3-inch phone.  Some people want a 3.5-inch phone like the iPhone.  Some people want a 4-inch phone.  And I think that's one of the nice things about Android is you have a choice.  You don't have a choice right now in the iPhone.  You only have 3.5 inches. That's it.  Let me see.  This is kind of a wild...  This comes from...  There's some software that will let you...  What is it?  Find Wi-Fi access points.  Let me see if I can find this.  It's...  And...  Open Signal Maps is an app on Android.  And so this is from that app.  Now this is going to be Android users who run Open Signal Maps,  which is a way to find open Wi-Fi access points.  So that's going to be kind of limited.  But I think that this is an interesting...  If you look at, for instance, these are all the different...  Let's talk about fragmentation.  These are all the different Android models out there.  And if you look at...  If I can find... I want to find the original article on Open...  This is from Boy Genius Report, but let me see if I can find the original.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't find...  When I'm on Word Drive, I don't find a single open network anymore.  Google managed to find a few on Street View, but that's pretty much it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Open Signal Maps said there are 3,997 different Android devices running its app.  There's one iPhone.  Maybe... No, no.  There's got to be more because there's...  For old ones.  So there's five iPhones, or four iPhones,  but there's 3,997 models of Android phones.  And each one has its own display resolution, its own screen size, and all of that, it seems.  So that's the negative, but I think it's also the positive, that you have a choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. And you have an abstraction layer that actually works, which is...  The iOS... Everyone is now padding their apps with multiple different giant bitmaps  to fit the multiple different screen sizes they've got there.  They've got four separate screen sizes in two rotations.  So they end up with eight bitmaps because they're doing everything with bitmaps,  as opposed to doing it with layouts, which is a shame.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, Gina, you're a developer.  You kind of know the pros and cons on both sides,  because your to-do text is on both Android and iPhones, right?  Yeah, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, the nice thing about the way Android is structured is what Kevin said,  is that you design screens with relative layouts, similar to the way they design web pages.  Just like the web. Right.  Yeah. So if you expand the size of the screen, the screen can fill it a certain way.  And that's why on Android, apps that run on the small handset  that don't have crazy graphics, that aren't games that have extreme graphics,  can just expand to fill the screen.  That's really nice because I have one app on Android.  It runs on the big screen and the small screen.  On iPhone, like Kevin said, you design straight to the screen.  I mean, the small screen and the retina display,  and then the big screen and the retina display,  and it's different resolutions and demographics.  So on one side, you get maybe design that's,  you're more sure that it's going to work everywhere.  But at the same time, you get a lot of apps that you have to increase to two times size.  You have that problem that we've talked about before,  where you're running iPhone apps on the small screen.  You know, the fragmentation, it's a double-edged sword, right?  It's like consumer choice and apps that are relative layout.  But at the same time, for a developer, it's not clear, it's like, what should I develop to?  Every month, you kind of have to check the charts.  Okay, what version should I develop to?  How many emulators do I have to run?  I've got, in my Android development setup,  I've got a list of 10 different emulators and screen sizes that I want to launch my app in and test in.  So it makes it more complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's not just screen size.  It's also API and OS version, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely. And it's whether or not there's a keyboard, a hard keyboard or a soft keyboard.  I mean, there's a lot of different variables.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, let me temper that number 3,997.  Part of that is because every custom ROM kind of identifies differently.  So of the 3,997 devices, 1,363 appear only once.  So you could probably take those off the list.  But somewhere there are thousands.  The Samsung brand is a clear winner.  40% of the market.  Wow.  40% then HTC.  But this is where it gets challenging for the developer.  This is the API level.  And it goes everywhere from Android 1.6 to Android 3.0.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what gets difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To 3.2. It gets very difficult.  And then this is the resolution scatter chart, which is all over the place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, these are some incredible charts.  I mean, as a developer, you pick out the biggest slices of the pie and you develop to those.  But that stinks because then you have users who write and say,  Hey, I've got this crazy model at this strange screen size that three other people have.  I can't run your app.  That gets hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's a great one.  This is a graphic that shows the various variations in screen size on Android.  And then I'll scroll down and this is Apple.  And Apple, there's four lines.  So I hate to say fragmentation.  That's a loaded word.  I like to use the word choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I agree.  I don't think that developers don't matter.  Users matter.  Yeah, users matter.  Right.  Like to me, it's like making life harder on developers for the sake of giving users more choice.  Like that's the right balance.  As a developer, I'm not going to blame these companies for making my life harder.  My life, that's my job.  Right.  If it's a little bit harder for me to develop for more users, then so be it.  I mean, of course, there are ways to get around this with better development tools and that kind of thing.  And Google has a long way to go with that.  But we should always err on the side of giving the users a better experience.  And it's arguable whether or not a lot of choice, the paradox of choice, is a better experience.  We could have that conversation.  But definitely better for developers versus better for users.  We should always err on the side of better for users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, Fred Flintstone, our chair, who is an iOS developer, says, no, no, there is screen layout support on iOS.  There is some way of handling a variety of orientations and resolutions.  I'm not familiar with it, so I don't know.  I have to defer to those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, there's interface builder, springs, and layouts things.  But it's not quite as flexible as the Android one.  Interface builder, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's definitely not as flexible as Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Android will just kind of flow it.  It's what we call, on the website, they call it, what did they call it?  Adaptive resizing.  There's a word for it.  Responsive design is what you call it.  Responsive design.  Because you don't know, not only do you not know what the resolution, but you don't know how big the window is or how wide it's going to be.  You don't know anything about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I run my browser narrowed with an echo font down the side.  And too many sites don't cope with my browser being slightly narrower than 1024 and give me horizontal scroll bars, which is really stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I want you to, when we get our new TechEye site up, which is supposed to be responsive, Lullabot's really good.  I want to say, hey, Kevin, how's it look on your browser?  Not that you'd ever listen to the radio show, but just give us a little feedback on that.  It would be very valuable.  Yeah, so I thought that was kind of an interesting graphic.  I like that.  Now, get ready, because here comes Android 5.0.  We're currently at four, which is I scream sandwich and Jelly Bean is next.  And according to a report in the Wall Street Journal, Jelly Bean will be deployed not on a single Nexus smartphone, as they have done up to now, but on perhaps as many as five models this fall.  Welcome to diversity.  They're all named Nexus.  They're all named Nexus.  Last month, Google began selling an unlocked variation of the Galaxy Nexus, which runs Android 4 for $400 via Google Play.  I didn't know that they went back to selling their own version.  That was something they did with the Nexus one and then pulled back.  So maybe they will start doing that again, doing their own channel.  I didn't even realize they had done that again.  Yeah, look at that.  You buy it.  Four hundred bucks for the Galaxy Nexus.  I don't think the Galaxy Nexus was at any point, maybe briefly the best Android phone out there, but it's not close now.  There's the HTC One.  There's the Galaxy S2, which I thought was better.  There's the Note, depending on what you need.  But at least there's a vanilla experience for people who want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a great scene in one recent episode of Mad Men where they're going in to pitch a client with two different ideas.  And Don leaves one of the ideas in the cab and just pitches them one.  And later on, one of his people says to him, why did you drop off that other idea?  Why didn't you pitch them both?  And he said, I picked one idea and I went with one idea because when you go with more than one, it's weak.  And that's very much the Apple way.  We're going to give you what we think is the best for you.  And you accept it or you don't.  Whereas this is the other way around where it's like, let the customer choose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Steve Jobs always said, you have a choice.  Use Apple or not.  That's your choice.  And if you choose Apple, we'll choose the rest.  We'll take care of the rest.  And then, you know what?  It's interesting because I think you and I, Gina, fall in that other camp.  We want the choice.  We like the idea of having a more open platform.  But there, obviously, the market has told us, it shows us that a lot of people want to have everything done for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just hand to them.  I like thinking about your users and your customers as smart people who know what they want.  And that it's not always the same.  I don't think that there's a one size fits all.  I never believe there's a one true way.  I think that there are some people who feel very strongly they want a hard keyboard.  And some people want a bigger screen.  And for me, it's a matter of treating your customers like they're smart people.  The way that you treat your viewers, like they're a smart audience.  You know, I think saying, I know better than you, there's a level of arrogance there.  It's just not my way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And yet, P.T. Barnum said you never went broke underestimating the American public.  Right?  Yeah. Yep.  Look at this.  Sun's coming out in Sydney Harbor and Jeff's still freezing.  No, it's not that bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just breezy and I'm causing noise.  I know.  No, we like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just stay where you are.  The more you move, the worse your audio is because it breaks up.  That's just a beautiful view.  Beautiful view.  Jeff's still an iPhone user.  We pick on him.  Hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We tried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, I am too.  I carry both.  In fact, you know what?  Something happened.  I don't know if this is, I'd love to know if anybody in our audience has had this happen.  All of a sudden, Google Voice is going right through for some people who call me.  Some people can get through.  Others go right to voicemail.  And there's no apparent setting in Google Voice.  I mean, I know that that's a setting where you could say, go right through.  I turned off the spam filter.  Unfortunately, it's my kids who can't call me.  So I have to carry an iPhone so they can continue to call me.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not good.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very frustrating.  At least it's not a Blackberry, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, kids, call me on the Blackberry.  I just can't figure.  Don't show this, Chad, because it's got all my phone numbers on it.  But I just, I can't figure out why it's bouncing only calls from certain numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wonder if they've got interconnect problems, because they do explicitly block some exchanges with Google Voice,  because they're the ones that...  Are spammers?  No, they're the ones that offer free conference call stuff because they are rural exchanges that get a large amount of cross payments from other ones.  Well, yeah, I mean...  There's some weird interconnect rules in telco.  Maybe that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a nice spam filtering checkbox which sends calls and text messages from numbers identified as spam by Google directly to the spam folder.  So that one I turned off.  That didn't seem to make any difference.  I just wonder if there's a...  I think it feels like there's a bug.  It happened all of a sudden.  I bet it goes away.  MXX says his dad who's on Sprint always gets forwarded to voicemail.  So maybe there is something going on.  Maybe there's a little something.  And Lance Seidman in the chat room.  We love the folks who watch live.  Thank you.  Say, no, it's not like he's got a link to a talk support note, but this isn't it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Answer.py.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's answer.py.  It is answer.py.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's answer.py.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That means it's a Python script.  We love their Python script support.  We're going to take a break.  Come back with more.  Jeff Jarvis is in Sydney Harbor.  Well, not in the harbor.  He's on the edge of Sydney.  That may come next.  Well, the sun is coming up.  BuzzMachine.com is his blog.  His new book is Public Parts.  He is in fact talking about privacy and publicness in Sydney for writers.  Is that right?  It's for writers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a writers festival.  We're just having so much fun.  We writers, we get together and you don't know the fun we have.  We writers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you get to wear a tweed coat with patches and smoke a pipe?  Because that's what I want.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Also with us, Kevin Marks, who's at a privacy and identity conference in Seattle.  He would have a view of the harbor, but we told him to go inside.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If I go that way, I can see the space needle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We almost had a two harbor view.  That would have been something.  And Gina Trapani, who's indoors.  She's a blogger at SmarterWear.org.  We're brought to you today by Stamps.com.  We love to talk about solutions that make your life easier.  Stamps.com is a really good example.  Never go to the post office again.  How do you like that?  Because you can do it all from your computer, Mac or PC and Stamps.com.  I love this solution.  Stamps, you don't need a postage meter.  You don't need special ink or anything.  It's your regular, everyday printer.  They even will give you a USB scale that you put into your computer.  And then you just throw what you want to mail on there.  And you always have exactly, precisely the right postage.  You don't waste a penny.  Now see that $110 value?  You won't see that special deal if you just go to Stamps.com.  You've got to go to Stamps.com and click the radio microphone in the upper right-hand corner.  See that?  And then you'll get the special deal when you use the offer code TWIG.  You'll get $55 in postage coupons, the digital scale, a supply kit and a four-week trial.  All you have to do is use our offer code TWIG.  This is a great way to find out if Stamps.com is right for you.  I'll tell you, if you are an Amazon or eBay seller, you've got to use Stamps.com.  It automatically fills out the forms, prints the postage directly from eBay or Amazon with all the information they know.  They give you discounts you cannot get at the post office, up to 21% on express mail shipping.  Priority mail, up to 15% discounts.  I mean, these are good things.  It's a really great deal.  And they even have no monthly fee, no service fee for high-volume shippers.  So if you're in it, you know, if you use a lot of U.S. Postal Service, you know, you really ought to be doing this.  You're crazy if you don't do this.  Stamps.com.  Use the offer code TWIG to get started with that $110 no-risk trial.  We use it here like crazy.  I think we got several accounts actually.  So Bing.com is going straight after Google and everybody else with their new social search.  And the idea.  All right, here we go.  In fact, I could show you.  Do you want to go on the tour?  Because I got it.  It got turned on for me yesterday.  Yeah, let's look.  Let's tour the new Bing.  So you'll see on the right hand side, because I'm logged in, friends who might know I'm searching for movies, friends who might have something to say about movies.  You could add your own comments here.  Ask friends what they think.  Choose the friends you want to ask and write a comment to get their ideas.  I'm thinking about seeing the new Avengers movie.  But I just want to know, is Diana Rigg in it?  And then you and then you should type that just to see what people say.  That is actually what I thought when I saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I was very disappointed.  I was hoping for a Joss Whedon reboot of that.  Oh, Joss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Come on.  Emma Peel.  John Steed.  Together again.  Fighting crime in a cat jumpsuit.  OK, so you can do that.  You can show friends what you found and results you found from this and other searches.  There's a little button, a link button.  Let your friends see what you're thinking about.  Share your search on Facebook.  Yeah, I just searched for herpes.  Would you like to join me?  Not all your searches are probably appropriate for sharing on Facebook.  So now this is of course better if you search for things like movies or music.  It'll give you more information.  If you search for Jeff Jarvis, let's see.  I just had a curiosity.  Uh oh.  And herpes?  No.  No, look at MG Siegler posted, Rafe Needleman posted.  But it doesn't seem to be related.  Rafe's looking for an Audi A3 with a sequential automatic transmission.  And Robert Scoble says, ha, this is one way to get me to try Bing.  Google has locked me out.  That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So these are all the tech journalists who are trying out Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no one else is using it except my three friends who are tech journalists.  Actually, I don't have any normal friends.  That's why.  Yeah.  So this is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, how is this different than Search Plus Your World?  You sign into Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Because Search Plus Your World uses just G+.  Yeah.  So that's the biggest difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can sign into Windows Live too if you want to.  Yeah, I have both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So is this going to have a problem like the social newsreader that people are going to get freaked on Facebook when they see their searches?  They forget that they signed in for it and suddenly the herpes search is out there?  I think you have to explicitly say, I'm searching for genital warts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Would you like to join me?  And then it will...  I'm sorry, folks.  You didn't deserve that.  Now what's interesting is that there are three columns now in search and the ad column is front and center really because it's the middle column, which typically is the content column.  Right.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, it is?  I've never seen that on mine.  Oh, I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at this screen.  Here's my search for Jeff Jarvis.  Yeah, you've got that narrow...  It's responsive.  So I have on the left, I have search results.  On the right, I have social activity.  And by the way, I have added my Windows Live account as well as my Facebook account.  You know what I haven't joined?  Because it just seems so down market.  Bing rewards.  The more you search, the more you win.  It's like SNH...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What was that old search engine that did that?  That gave away a million dollars supposedly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, was it ask.com that did that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  There's another one.  The whole schtick was that you search there to earn money.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Every click makes you money.  That was one of those things that was going to take over the web.  I'm kind of surprised that Microsoft would do that.  It feels like green stamps.  Cheesy.  It's kind of cheesy.  It's kind of cheesy.  And by the way, we all have the same number of reward points.  I have 24.  And our chat room, somebody has 23.  And I'm not even signed in.  So I guess they just give you some default number.  But see, right in the middle there is the search.  Now the ads for Jeff Jarvis are, you'll like this,  discountbooksale.com offering what would Google do.  Well, I was staring at the Viagra ad.  At a low, low price.  Low prices on Jeff Jarvis.  Qualified orders over $25 ship free.  We found Jeff Jarvis at peoplesmart.com.  These are the junk ads that you get whenever you search for a person named.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, the problem is Google would know me better and there would be Viagra ads there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Shall we compare it?  I'm just curious.  I don't think there are ads on your Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody buys Jeff Jarvis.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I guess somebody buys just personal names, right?  Yeah, there's no ads on Jeff Jarvis on Google.  You're ad free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who, who, who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hate it when you search for a person's name and you get those ads for my life and USA people search and all that crap.  Yeah.  I think that's really bad.  Yeah, it's a whole crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  So it's interesting.  I searched for you, Leo, and it points out that you tweet.  And it gave me a link to your Twitter account.  That's good.  And I searched for myself and it said, Gina's on Google Plus and gave a link to gave information.  That's very interesting.  I think that's the key difference between this and search plus your world is that you can.  It's agnostic.  Yeah, it's agnostic.  Not only can you sign in with both Facebook or Windows Live, but it's returning results from Twitter, Google Plus.  I mean, it's it's returning results from competitors.  Of course, the underdog, you know, is kind of going to do this.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is interesting.  I searched for myself.  Paul Therot has photos of Leo Laporte.  Connect with Facebook so you and your friends can each.  Wow.  And then and then it has my Twitter account.  Wow.  Very interesting.  We connect with Facebook and see.  See, OK, I'm now allowing Bing to post on my behalf.  That's always scary.  Don't you love that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now I see that Trey has posted pictures of me.  Paul, Sarah Lane.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  Says Sarah Lane has a photo of Leo Laporte.  I probably don't want to see that.  That scares you, doesn't it?  I know what you did last night.  Oh, my God.  These are weird.  OK, let's not click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So when you get that DM saying there's weird photos of you in Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, you know, when you get that on Facebook, it usually is a virus saying, I know what you did last night and I have video to prove it.  And then they get you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But for you, it was true.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, there is video.  That's no virus, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what do you think?  How does Bing steal market share from Google?  This?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, my fear is that both, you know, you'll have some Google stuff later.  I think this goes back to your argument before.  Search is now getting very cluttered.  It's like Yahoo takes over the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  God, that's a depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Adding more stuff on trying to make you know ours is better.  But no, ours is better.  We have we have free jalapeno peppers on our search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do any of you have the the new Google Knowledge Graph stuff showing up yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do you get that?  So this is the this is the technology is being used to provide popular facts about people, places and things alongside Google's traditional results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It looks like a Wikipedia box, but there may be a bit more sweat than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or the baseball card, the digital age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like this idea.  Knowledge Graph flows into units.  They have no official name.  So Danny Sullivan writing on search engine land says he calls them knowledge panels.  They don't always appear only showing up on Google deems them relevant.  I know I think this does not bother me, but you're right.  It is cluttering, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the only thing.  Yeah, it's it's just it's I'm afraid we're going to get into a war and the whole world is going to look like Yahoo.  And you know what happened to Yahoo, folks, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google says it's combining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it was a testing will be fairly good at making it making them the right size.  That's that kind of optimization they're good at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, you clearly complain about about the addition of Google Plus to search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wasn't too happy about it.  So I guess I'm not getting it because I searched for a movie star and that would be what you'd get.  So they say they've compiled three and a half billion facts, information about and relationships between 500 million objects or entities.  Entities are persons, places or things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I'm assuming this is the free base stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what is free base?  Is that an acquisition that Google made?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, so it was it was a semantic mesh basically of information like that.  A lot of it is based on Wikipedia.  A lot of these like semantic things end up being useful, useful cause Wikipedia.  Do you think that's a potential?  But it's still a source.  I think Microsoft is using the same data set for their stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think that's a potential problem?  Because what it's kind of doing is putting Wikipedia information on the web without really highlighting it from Wikipedia.  And I know there's a lot of schools and people who say, oh, you're not allowed to use Wikipedia information because I mean, I trust Wikipedia.  But it is, you know, you're not allowed to use it in a lot of schools, for instance.  And this is kind of crypt.  It's crypto Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  It's not just using information as Kevin says.  It's what it's really first trying to do is to recognize entities.  Daylife has a very smart engine doing that as well.  We're full disclosure of a partner.  But what they want to know is the entity.  So once you know the entities, then you can say, aha, well, here's all the stuff we know about that entity.  And here's the relationships of that entity to other entities.  And here's patterns.  Oh, there.  Did you get that, Chad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Chad's turned on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, that's it.  That's it.  Chad, we know a lot about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're right.  Brad Pitt as your as your default here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I searched bicycle and nothing came up.  So harbor bus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Habermas.  Don't worry about it.  It's an inside joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It should find out.  That is a good test.  I should find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It will not find Habermas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, one thing that I did was I signed out of my apps account and signed into my Gmail account.  So if you're signed into apps, it may not be available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, in docs now, you have this too.  So if I type Brad Pitt in a doc, I can right click on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's probably on the port.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, see, I think I don't have it turned on.  Are you in docs?  Once again, that's in apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're using Google Apps as Twitter TV.  So if you sign out, you'll get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do an incognito window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, an incognito window.  Because I switched and it didn't it didn't help.  Yeah, it's not working for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So but if it's turned on for your IP range, it might work.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Chad, Chad got it.  So yeah, so I turned it on over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me get to the correct thing.  And so we're in that this is the Twitcraft doc.  And so you turned on research over here.  Oh, it's a now a bar on the document.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So so maybe I wanted a quote that started with Minecraft.  And let's see.  No, no quotes with Minecraft.  Let's not do that.  Let's say Google search everything instead.  OK, now we have this is very small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's so did you sign out of all account like all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I did the double the double sign in where where if you scroll back up here,  you're signing either of those.  So there's my other email address and here's the apps account.  So like Google Apps for Business now doesn't seem very relevant.  I don't know how I guess I'd insert this link into could I drag it over?  I guess I'd cite this.  I mean, this seems now it's added a little one over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then I put the footnote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Look at that.  So describe because people are listening as well as watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. So so there's this little bar on the side.  And so let's search for something more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not so little, by the way.  It's a fairly wide column.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's say architecture.  And I'm butchering architecture.  A R C. Oh, that worked.  Look at that. Perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So so Wikipedia is the first result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. But there's other stuff like say say in this document, this is this is man.  I really want to use that.  That's what I want in my thing.  So let's just drag it into that in.  So he dragged an image of the right on in or whatever.  Right. And then it cited it already.  So I'm jealous that you're getting it and I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's I want.  That's why I hired him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What the doc stuff is separate separate though.  You can turn that on.  Yeah. You turn that on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where do we turn that on?  Is there a setting in the tools menu?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's an item called research or research.  I think it has to be in a when you join a you do control alt R.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK. Right.  And that brings up the research.  But once again, I don't think it works for Google Apps yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe it doesn't work in Safari, which I'm using.  So OK.  OK. This is kind of I guess I think this is cool.  You know this strikes me who this might be for is tablet users who don't have windows.  Because one of the things one of the issues you know a lot of schools are looking at using say an iPad in school.  But the problem I have is I'm doing research.  I'm report doing a report.  All right. Maybe I bought a keyboard because typing on glass is bad.  That's problem number one.  But then the other problem is I'm not windowed.  So I'm writing and then I have to go to another full screen to see something.  Well, what if I were writing in a Google doc and I had a research bar on the right that would make it a lot easier, wouldn't it?  On a tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if that's I guess it also tries to Google wants to give you answers to any question anytime for any need.  So when you're writing a letter or anything, the idea is get your answer right here right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, if you're if you're using Chrome version 19 should have been pushed to you in the last few hours or days and you will get something very interesting that is definitely a geek feature tab sinking.  Yes.  Did I tell you it was a geek feature?  Tab sinking. What does that mean?  I don't understand.  Gina, what are we talking about here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So if you turn on tab sinking and you're running Chrome on, say, your Android handsets and you when you launch Chrome on your Android handset, you can say show me all the devices that have Chrome open.  You can switch to a different device and open up any one of the tabs.  Oh, good.  On your computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that doesn't open 48 tabs on my Android phone.  No, it doesn't.  That would be untenable.  Yeah, it would be untenable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It just it just says, hey, here's the name of your computer.  It's got tabs open.  Here's a list of the tabs that are open and you can just tap one and open it.  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Weren't they supposed to be able to do that like five versions ago that you're supposed to have the tabs go across and it never worked for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was it's been in the beta.  This this tab sink has been in the Chrome beta for a while, but it just got released to the stable like it's the stable version 19.  And there's been sinking from Chrome to Chrome on desktops.  But I think this is the first time it's correct me if I'm mistaken chat room.  I think this is the first time it's going to Chrome on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I could never get it to work on desktop to desktop.  That's just me.  I can't get Wi-Fi to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So and would it be in my Chrome settings that I would enable this or is it just enabled by default?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I know it's not enabled by default.  I had to turn on it's in.  If you click on the wrench and go to settings and then it's in it's it's the advanced sync settings button and then you have to be logged in to Chrome as your Gmail account as well.  Yes, at the top of the page, Leo on the right advanced sync settings.  Scroll up.  Yeah, advanced sync settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, there it is.  I'm signing as Leo.  Okay, now my advanced sync everything encrypted data types.  Oh, look, you don't have it.  I don't have it.  Even though I do.  I did check and I am on Chrome 19.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That checkbox is right below themes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's one more item in that checkbox.  Yeah, I guess it's going to Chrome 19.  Chrome is up to date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wacky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wacky is right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're holding out on us Google today.  They're like, blacklist.  You know what?  That's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Except for Chad.  Chad, I bet you have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not signed in on this computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  Yeah, we don't want to.  Yeah, that's a public computer.  So we don't want to sign in there.  Huh.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe you have to be on the Google Plus suggested user list before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'm off it, by the way.  I'm off it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you see, you should never have complained.  They dumped me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I never complained.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They dumped me.  He's not a technology person.  Kick him off.  Kick him off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That sinking is apparently rolling out slowly.  And because I had it, I just assumed that it was out to a lot of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, let me see.  Now, how would I know if it's on Android?  Because it is supposed to be an ice cream sandwich.  So when I launched the browser, which is not Chrome, by the way, on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, this is the thing.  You have to be running the Chrome data on Android.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  So this is, yeah, they're in life of the bros.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not in the browser.  It's in the Chrome browser.  Right.  Right.  So the Play Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Play Store, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doesn't that sound stupid, just saying that, the Play Store?  I'm going to go look in the Play Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're not going to get yourself back on that list, are you?  I know.  Talking like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love Matt Cots.  All right.  All right.  I'm going to go look on the Play Store.  Chrome Beta.  At least it's free.  And then, so I would be able to then turn it on on the Chrome Beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then you'd be able to see, you'd be able to say, there's a button.  I think it's in the menu.  It says request desktop site.  So that's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's kind of the next step of Chrome to phone, which has always been around as  an extension where you could send to your phone any page you were looking at.  Now, if you just leave it open in Chrome, you'll be able to pick anything, any tab you've got  open on your desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, which sounds pretty geeky, but the point in the future when Chrome is Android's default  browser and this all just sort of happens in the background, if you're reading something  on your computer and you've got to dash off to the dentist, looking at it in the waiting  room, that's a nice, it's a really nice feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, what if, I mean, this is a way of Google getting everybody to just use Chrome everywhere.  This is smart.  This is the kind of thing Apple does, although Apple doesn't do it.  I mean, I wonder if people would get upset if Apple did this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think Apple assumes that they're different experiences and you don't want to emerge them.  Ah.  That's a very different approach.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why would you want to do that?  They're saying.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It is a geeky, I'd have to say it's a geeky feature.  I don't think most people care whether they can do that, but I think the geeks who use  tabs like crazy, I've never understood it.  But if you ask a geek, anybody on any of these shows, how many tabs do you have open, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Dozens.  Oh, as always, too many to read the title of R.  Dozens.  Yes, a lot of tabs.  Yeah, they're all little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a sign of optimism in life.  I'll get to that later.  Aha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  That's exactly what it is.  Oh, I'm going to read that.  Oh, yeah, definitely want to keep that around.  I'm never close.  It's the same people who have, it's hoarders.  It's digital hoarders.  Hey, hey.  Pretty soon, you're not going to be able to walk down the hall in your house because it's  full of magazines.  Tabs everywhere.  Nowadays, it's just bits.  Now it's just bits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was one of the conversations at the Private Identity Conference was discussing about  whether you should design to minimize retained data.  And the comment was, well, engineers are hoarders.  They keep everything.  They just log it all.  Right.  And you have to explicitly go and find them and get them to delete it.  And I'm thinking, yeah, that's kind of true.  We sort of log everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, because bits don't take any space, so why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, we've got space to store all this stuff.  And later on, you may want to debug that and know what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you don't know the value in it.  You can't predict the value today of what that data, what the anomalies will show you  tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but I'm going to give you Leo's law.  The more stuff you hoard, the less value it has because you can't find anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not data.  You have Google.  You see, this is the whole point of Google's worldview is we'll fix that for you.  We can find it.  Save it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's in there somewhere.  Yeah.  It's like Gordon Bell, who was wearing the former digital equipment guy who went on to  be a Microsoft fella and wears a camera around his neck that takes pictures every few seconds  of everything he does.  And he says, I'm not going to worry about that.  Someday I'll need that.  He's got pictures of everywhere he's been, everybody he's talked to.  And what you're waiting for is the technology to catch up to do all the face recognition,  for instance, and say, oh yeah, you had a meeting with Kevin on Friday and you did this  and talked about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the other thing I do in Gmail is I will see an email on my phone or whatever, and  then I'll mark it as unread, believing that it will come back up with the list somehow  magically, and I will then deal with it later.  It is.  Instead, what happens is three weeks later somebody says, did you get my email?  And I have to, they can see my eyes roll.  I have this vague memory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I dimly read it.  I read it.  At one point I handled it.  Yeah, this is you.  You hit the nail on the head, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My jar is full of stars.  Yes.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The inbox is full of stars.  It is a form of optimism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have more stars.  The universe has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're all jolly, jolly people who think the world is a good place and someday there'll  be an infinite amount of time to go through your stars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  I like that slant on it.  We're going to take a break.  We're talking about the Google.  This Week in Google is on the air.  Jeff, Gina, and our guest today, Kevin Marks.  I want to ask you about PII in a second, Kevin, and what's going on.  What's the latest in privacy and identity?  But first let's talk Ting.  Why would a service, asks Ting, treat its best customers like criminals?  Criminals.  Oh, you're talking about cell phone industry, aren't you?  Where the ... You just, you cannot, you can never get out of it, right?  You join it and for two years they own your, I want to say you know what, but they own  your tookas.  Ting is totally reinventing the cell business.  Now Ting is using Sprint.  So if you've got good Sprint coverage where you are, Ting is going to be every bit as  good as Sprint.  They have great phones.  But unlike everybody else, they have fees that are fair, honest, and out there, forthright.  They believe in full disclosure.  And they never penalize you for using more than you said you would.  They refund you for minutes, text messages, or data that you didn't use.  There is never an early termination fee.  Everything is month to month.  I love this.  You love your netcast.  How about your phone company?  Ting welcomes Twig listeners.  I love that.  That is really cool.  I love these guys.  They're doing, right now they're doing a contest for May.  The Dump Your Contract Contest.  They'll buy out one winner's mobile service every day this month.  And sign you up for Ting.  Ting.com slash D-Y-C.  They'll cut you a check to pay your early termination fee from anywhere from a hundred  to three hundred dollars.  Ting.com slash D-Y-C.  You can share your contract termination horror stories and follow contest winners on Facebook.  I love that.  And you can enter every day to win.  So simple, honest, fair pricing.  You pay for just what you use.  Let's go to the plans page.  And you can see, you can choose ahead of time how many phones you want.  So it's great for families or businesses.  Six dollars per phone.  Flat fee once a month.  And then you choose how much data you're going to use.  How many minutes you're going to use.  How many text messages.  But do this kind of, you know, you don't have to, it doesn't matter really because you could  pick zero across the board and you'd still pay the same amount.  If you pick the XXL, 3000 minutes, 6000 text messages, 3 gigabytes of data, and you don't  use it, they refund your money.  So this is a really, I don't know, you know, this is like the phone company's got.  This is Randall Stevenson is losing sleep over this.  He ought to be if he's not.  So look at that.  If you do that plan, it tells you kind of what it would be.  That's really what this is for, is for planning.  Because in truth, you only pay for what you use for.  There's never a penalty.  And by the way, included free at all, on all Ting phones at no charge.  Voicemail, picture and video messaging, three-way calling, caller ID, tethering, and hotspotting  at no additional charge.  And look at these phones.  Great phones from feature phones to the top of the line smartphones.  I would get the Galaxy S2.  That's my personal favorite, the 4G.  In fact, I use that on Sprint.  It's a great phone.  The Samsung Conquer.  They even have, you know, very inexpensive phones, basically burner phones.  For 170 bucks, you can get the LG Optimus S.  That's a great Android phone.  They say it's a, it's not a cheap Android phone.  It's an Android phone at a good price.  And I'm going to say, I'm going to help you get 50 bucks off if you want to get a good  50 bucks off.  If you go to Ting.com slash twig, 50 bucks off of any of their phones.  So pick the phone you like, subtract 50 bucks, save money, only, only use this, what you  need and never pay a penalty.  There's no waste.  It's wonderful.  These guys really, I hope they win because they're, because this is exactly how phone  service should be.  Ting.com slash twig.  And to enter the contest, Ting.com slash D Y C.  You can do both.  It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, Ting, Ting guys, can you fix hotel wifi?  Yeah.  Can you fix that problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's next.  You know what?  You know what it is?  It's Elliot Nos who runs Two Cows and he's fixed domain registration with Hover.  He's fixing the phones.  I wouldn't be surprised if the next thing is, is hotel wifi.  Elliot, if you're listening, please, please, please.  So tell us about PII, Kevin Marks.  What is, what is this about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's, it's privacy identity innovation.  So it's the collection.  It's, it's Jeff, I think came to the first one and it's in some ways, it's the collection  of people that Jeff rails against because there are privacy commissions, people like  that here, but there were also geeks, people from, from Facebook and Twitter and me and  EFF people.  And there are also some lawyers who think about privacy policies and things like that.  So it reminds me, it reminds me a bit of the supernova conference where you would get  a group of people, a different sort of group of people who are normally at loggerheads  and not talking to each other and it puts them together for three days and gets to talk  to each other.  So it's, it's, it's very good from that point of view.  And I've been impressed with the conversations we've had here because they've been, they  haven't been railing at each other too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are the problems that people feel we need to solve?  I mean, I think when you say the word privacy, that that's the problem.  But, but what are they, what are they identifying as the problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The problem is, is to some extent, overreach and some extent leakage.  That's what they're saying.  It's like, are you, are you correlating things you shouldn't be correlating?  And how do we, how do we stop that happening?  And the debate is, do we, do we make a, make it an offense if somebody collects data they  shouldn't or do we make it an offense if they abuse that data?  But the interesting thing, one of the things has been, there's been a lot of people who  have, a lot of public pressure when, when people discover apps are gathering information  that they don't think that they need.  And that, having those, those things pushed out in public has actually caused the apps  to draw back and then think more about what they should be collecting.  So that, that's, that's actually been working better than, than legislators or even, you  know, FTC suits in, in many cases did to do that.  So the sort of the power of the, the web as, as, as public shame is working better as a  sort of privacy restraint in many cases than, you know, government action.  And of course the other half of this is that the government's, you know, talk out both  sides of their mouths because in one thing they say, you can't collect this stuff.  And the second, the other thing they say, you must collect this and give it, give this  to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Save it for us.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can't collect this data, but can you send it to us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll take it.  No, wait.  You could trust us.  We're the government.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And there's, there's been, you know, bits and pieces like that.  Who do you trust more?  A large company or a government?  And the answer tends to vary depending on whether you're from the US or Europe.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not interesting.  It's purely cultural.  Yeah.  But it's a weird, it's a weird paradox.  When I was in Germany at Repubblica a year ago, two years ago, presenting what was then  to become public parts, I talked about the German paradox, the European paradox.  And somebody stood up and said, well, what about the American paradox?  You've had a better government than we've had for much longer, but you all don't trust  government.  And, you know, we have better companies, better regulation companies here.  We don't trust companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  So the other thing we're seeing is we're starting to see more of the, the personal  locker type projects and things like that show up, which, which, you know, I've put  in with those.  Those are good ideas.  And so some of the startups people have been showing off have been things like that.  There's personal.  There's.  But Kevin, hold on for a second.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The locker idea versus the server of your identity ideas.  The locker just a place to store your own stuff or is it, which Gene has been kind of  heading to too, the place from which you can serve your stuff at your option.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff, we're getting a bunch of wind if you can position yourself.  Yeah.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a bit of both.  You know, there's, there's, there's both variants of the idea.  So one is, is downloading stuff that you've got to record yourself.  There's those interesting ideas from a startup called curious that is trying to do that for  medical data.  So gather together all the stuff.  Right.  I saw that.  Your attention to yourself.  And it's one of the founders of 23andMe and she wants to correlate that with genetic  information and other stuff too.  So there's, there's that, those kinds of sort of personal lockers and that, and her  argument was this is a way around this medical privacy thing is, is very actually very hard  to gather clinical data for clinical trials because of all the rules about this, but gathering  data on yourself is allowed.  And if you want to do that and share it with other people that can work, which I think  fits in with Jeff's discussions of sharing his illness in public and things like that.  So there's, there's that side of it.  There are also ones that are providing an encrypted store that will then fill in forms  for you on the web or will potentially provide an API as an alternative to using Facebook  for all effectively.  So you can offer to that using often and feed data into that.  And the challenge there is still we haven't all got those standards converged yet, but  there there is there are several ones working on that.  That's interesting.  So Glyph is one of those.  I think secure me was one of those as well.  There were several several different startups showing stuff like that here.  And then the other aspects of this that have been there's we had I was on the with big data  comes big responsibility panel just talking about the idea what happens with the so-called  big data, which I was reframing as it's actually messy data where what these what these sort  of map reduce worldview comes down to is taking a large amount of messy data and constructing  a database out of it.  You can use for other things.  And that that is the size of the data is not so important as as the schema list of it,  if you like.  And the fact that you can reconstruct schemas arbitrarily rather than spending your time  getting the data into the format that you've already decided.  You can say, oh, I wonder if I can find data in this format in this in this in this pool.  And then you write the map reduce to construct that.  Then you've got a database that has that piece in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So there's there's but there's there's there's tension around that as well because it's the  same thing of, oh, you mean now I can run facial recognition over photographs that you've  you posted 10 years ago that you didn't realize that was possible.  So there is this that there is this problem of the computer in the future getting better at  making sense of the stuff it has.  And that that is that does make people nervous to some extent.  It's something that Google has said that Google has been backing away from facial recognition  stuff because because it because it creeps people out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they're going to end up doing it because everybody else is going to push it forward.  There's an iPhone app called Click.  If you take a picture of people, I tried it out.  It's amazing. I took a picture of Chad.  I didn't even have to take a picture.  I pointed it at Chad and said, oh, this is Chad.  Now it's doing it for my social graph from people I have already taken pictures of.  So I guess in that case, there's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because it has a has a good version of that.  And I always has a has a nearly as good version of that.  Yeah. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's but it's interesting because I think what happens is that's nibbling away at the corners.  And eventually Google could try to hold the line.  But if everybody else ends up offering similar things, Google's going to say, well, yeah, we got to give in.  And then it's really out of the cats out of the bag because Google has so much information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Google has got very good face recognition technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. They know how to do it.  Come over here. I'll take a picture of you.  Let me see if I can recognize Kevin Marks on TV.  With a headset on on TV.  Now we can start using the yes.  You want to see you. You want to see something creepy and scary.  It did. So let me take the picture.  Really? Let me take the picture.  And it did it in seconds. See, it says Kevin.  It knew immediately that that was you.  OK, that's what face recognition looks like.  Now, again, don't let me see if it does.  If it'll do you, Gina, don't get scared because this is taking it out of my Facebook friends.  If you're not my Facebook friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why do you need it if you're a friend? But be that as it may.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, because what it does is I take pictures at parties.  Stop hiding your face. I take pictures at parties and start wearing sunglasses inside.  And it's already already tag because that's what you do in Facebook.  It thinks you're Lin Fu, by the way.  So you're kind of Asian looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's try. Let's try.  She has the Zen of Asian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Coming to us from from Blurrny, Blurrmony, Sydney, Australia.  Let's see if I can get.  But by the way, it also gets smart because it learns so you can add people and learn about.  This is K.L.I.K. on the on the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's where they haven't tested on women much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe maybe it only works on guys.  You know what? It's only recognized guys so far and it doesn't recognize you.  But you're pretty blurry. Yeah. Yeah.  Oh, you moved your head. It said, oh, I know who that is.  Let's see. Keep keep moving your head.  Yeah. It's K.L.I.K. on the iOS platform.  Click. But I tell you, I want. Yeah, there it is.  I want this. I know everybody.  I understand women especially are terrified of the stalking potential. Blah, blah, blah.  But I don't I don't think that's really an issue.  I think that this is going to be valuable.  I mean, if somebody's going to stalk you, they don't need to know your name.  They just follow you. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, this is you're looking at someone. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it just helps you know who it is. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's still problematic.  If you if you take a photograph of someone on the subway and it looks up their name  out of the global pool of faces, that's still problematic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you know, the government has this ability and uses this ability now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think the thing is, it doesn't actually work very well for the government's use case,  which is finding the one terrorist out of millions of people.  But it is quite good at this use case, which is finding the person for the subset of people you already know.  Yes. Right.  One of the things I think Google did an experiment on this where they fed trained on on faces of celebrities  and then then got the defined celebrities in photographs.  And that works well because they have a good training set and they have and there's only a certain pool of celebrities.  So you can you can use it for that.  But it's not as good at picking, you know, somebody you only have one fuzzy photograph of because he's a terrorist  and has been hiding his face out of the moving video stream of a camera like that.  So. Well, let's move on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Federal judge has learned to code.  It's big news. I love this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a great bit. Love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was a wonderful blog post from Coding Horror said, please don't learn to code.  It comes from Michael Bloomberg, who's doing that.  I don't think Michael Blum, mayor of New York, really is learning to code.  But he tweeted, oh, I'm going to learn to code because there's this new startup, a New York startup that's kind of cool.  It does teach you. I can't remember if it's Ruby or JavaScript.  They teach you online. And so Bloomberg signed up for it.  Coding Horror points out that it will not help him be mayor in any way, shape or form.  And any time he spends learning JavaScript from CodeYear.com is time wasted solving the problems of.  Well, he's got to look for a new job, you know, so he says yes, that when Bloomberg does learn to code his his his first program, his only program will be 10 print.  I am mayor 20 go to 10, which is fairly likely.  And he says, and I think there's a good point.  Can you explain to me how Michael Bloomberg would be better at his day to day job of leading the largest city in the U.S.  If he woke up one morning as a crack Java coder, Jeff Atwood, coding horror dot com.  However, it's nice if it's nice if the judiciary at least understands technology.  Yes, which they seem to have a great lacking of so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Have you got the have you got the quote there for the for the judge?  This is that this is wonderful. He says, ironically women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me see here. Let me find it.  This is from the O'Reilly Radar post by Mike Luca, Luca, these.  Judge William Alsop learned Java in the course of the trial.  Can you believe that? I'm trying to find the quote here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that it's in the link to it's a wired and it's in the wired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He told the court he had learned to code Java for the trial, implying he knew other languages as well.  He said he had written some of the infringing code at least 100.  What he said. Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's got a transcript here. He says, I couldn't have told you the first thing about Java before this problem.  I have done and still do a significant amount of programming other languages.  I've written blocks of code like range check 100 times before. I could do it. You could do it.  The idea that someone copy that when they could do it themselves just as fast.  It was an accident. There's no way you could say that was speeding along to the marketplace.  You're one of the best lawyers in America. How could you even make that kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow, David, boys. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And when I come back to range check and the judge says range check,  all it does is make sure the numbers you're inputting are within range and it gives them some sort of exceptional.  That witness when he said a high school student could do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is great. I wish I'd been in court during this. Wow. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the point is, you know, the thing that's good about this is not that the judge learned to code, which is that's good in itself.  The point is it's part of the culture now.  The fact that people can understand what coding means and what effort is, is really, really important because it means we're more likely to get sensible decisions in cases like this  rather than treated as some kind of magic like boys is trying to get them to do.  And that's the difference between this.  The court cases now and these kinds of lawsuits we've had five, ten years ago where it was all this code is pure magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's Kevin. Kevin, you're absolutely right.  But in journalism, I find this this desire to have the mythical journalist coder is going to solve everything.  I think the difference here is that what you're talking about is literacy.  The judge. Yes.  Made it a standard to be literate about coding.  And that's what we really need. Yes. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On the bench in Congress. Absolutely.  But they don't need to code. They need to be digitally literate.  But I think that a judge who could say, hey, a range check is simple.  Anybody could do this. So calling this infringing code.  By the way, this is the Oracle versus Google case.  Oracle, which bought Sun, which created Java, is asserting that its its patents and copyrights were violated by Android's use of Java.  But I have to say, I like it that the judge in this case is making these arguments.  I think that's good for Google. Right.  He's even saying, you know, you may you may not have any statutory damages here, which means you may get zero.  You may continue. You may even win this case and get zero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oracle. But then then you had stories in the lineup that I didn't understand.  What's the so so Google doesn't pay anything they can afford anyway.  If they win the case, though, what is the precedent that this sets?  What's the what's what does it do to the rest of us and other cases?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it says a precedent that you can copyright APIs, which means they can go around suing other people because their APIs are copyright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's different from copywriting code or patenting code, copywriting an API saying the ability to interface with my software.  And by the way, people have pointed out an API could be something as simple as, hey, give me that Web page.  I mean, it's very right. Simple stuff. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. It's just a way to access the interface of the system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It could be it could be a get request as an API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely. It makes method patents look like kids work.  Right. And we're already bitching about method patents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you could copyright an API and say, hey, get is ours.  You know, you can't Netscape could say, get we invented get no other browser can use it without licensing it.  Oy oy. That's a good word. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Even though it could totally goes against the whole purpose of an API, which is that people can use it to interface with the system.  But this is this is a question of copying API.  Like this is about correct me if I'm wrong on this, but this is because Google created Dalvik, which is a different Java runtime, which mimics all the same APIs at the official Java runtime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The code within Dalvik probably doesn't I mean, originally Oracle asserted that the code was copied, but I think that they've lost on that.  So now they're saying, well, are even if the code wasn't copied, are either the only thing with these nine lines in the range check, you know, which is clearly trivial.  Diminimus. Right. So throwing that out now.  OK, well, but you copied our interface.  But see, that's where that goes back to the earliest days of computing when, for instance, Phoenix copyrighted the IBM PC bios to make it possible to make IBM clones.  They didn't they did it in a clean room environment.  They reverse engineered it. They merely made it interface compatible.  That allowed the entire explosion of technologies, personal computer technology as we know it.  That would all be thrown out. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, in a lot of ways, they were respecting Java is kind of right once run anywhere.  They could have built Dalvik with a completely brand new lead defined interface, right, which would have been insane for Java developers.  They wouldn't have been like, you know, what are these classes? What are these methods and interfaces?  And I'm so used to. So in a way, you know, you want them to respect the interface, but they didn't license it.  So that then that's the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Also, Google's attorney complained because there is a debate over how much money was made.  And Oracle said, well, we're going to find out we're going to call Larry Page and Eric Schmidt to the witness stand for the damages phase.  Google's attorney argued it was a stunt designed to turn the case into a Java versus Android battle when only a few lines of code were infringed.  Calling the top executives was outrageous. The judge did not agree in that case.  He says the fact that Mr. Big is being subpoenaed, I'm sorry.  This is a big case. That doesn't cut much with me.  But he did not make a ruling. He said, you guys work.  He said, I'm busy. Figure it out.  I have to say, does not look like it's going well for Oracle. Is that your sense of it to Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that was that was my sense of reading that last transcript.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But isn't that the argument, though, that is that Oracle may win nothing, but we all lose everything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it would be if this API if we're allowed to copyright an API.  But I have to say I'm encouraged by Al Sipp's clear understanding of what's going on.  I love it. A judge can say, I wrote a range check. That's not so hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's pretty fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, given that they systematically excluded all the jurors who knew how to code,  which in, you know, in Santa Clara County was like a third of them or something.  They've now got a judge who knows how to code, which is good.  That's the encouraging part for me is that there is a broader understanding of this stuff now in the same way that there's a broader understanding of open source ideals because Wikipedia is is out there and people understand they can they can edit it.  So that means that we're less likely to get bizarre decisions by courts or even by politicians because they don't have an understanding of this because people it is actually more pervasive.  This is culture. So that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there you know, it isn't it isn't over by any means.  And the guy who writes false patents, who I think is a pretty intelligent guy, Florian Mueller, and is, by the way, a paid consultant for Oracle, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, Microsoft.  Well, he's, he wrote a blog post saying that yes, I'm a consultant for Oracle, but the timing is a coincidence.  I'm doing something else.  In any event, Mueller.  Take this with whatever grain of salt you wish says that there's no way Google's use of Java could be considered fair use.  I take it. That's what Google's asserting.  He says it's equivalent to hijacking the platform.  Google benefited from the development of Java by basing its code on it, then specifically made Android incompatible.  Yeah, if you're an open source guy, this is kind of exactly what open source people hate the most, which is you took advantage of our open source work and then you closed.  You know, you pulled the ladder up behind you.  He says, on the other hand, George Reese of in Stratis Network says if API's can be copy protected, that would be incredibly destructive to the Internet as a whole.  I did not just the Internet technology in general.  It would, as you say, would have repercussions far beyond the patent problems we already have.  But we'll see. We'll continue to follow this story.  You know, courts court cases are so difficult for us.  We do have a good show, which I recommend called This Week in Law, where actual attorneys discuss these issues intelligently.  So that's that's novel.  Well, there's so much to talk about.  We're running out of time.  Let me just quickly run through a couple of the other top stories.  Apple is probably, according to rumors, credible rumors, dropping Google Maps for its own in-house mapping with an incredible quote, quote, 3D mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See that coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that was pretty obvious.  And I don't think I think it's a risky move since Google Maps is the default.  But remember, Maps Quest used to be the default and there are.  Right.  So these things can change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm surprised that Google has it tied in more more of your personal information into the maps.  The more that they brought in our preferences, our history, all that, the more we would be loyal to Google Maps.  Right. Well, they do.  They have another.  Latitude doesn't.  They have latitude.  Yeah, but who?  I don't.  I use latitude.  I like to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can still play with it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, Kevin and I are the only people who do use latitude.  Well, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, the only people who check in on latitude are people who work for Google.  That's really amazing.  It says, do you want to check in?  I go, OK, I'll check in.  It's like, oh, the leaderboard is like.  Oh, it is.  It's all Google's.  You're right.  Come to think of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's funny.  But no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But the thing I found amusing about some of these reports was was the people who clearly  never used Android saying, and these maps are going to be great.  They're going to have navigation in them.  And it's like, well, you have you have actually looked at Android navigation and how good it  is.  And that's it.  I suspect that's the thing.  I think it's a little bit of a surprise.  And that's it.  I suspect Apple can get away with this.  They can make something that replicates the features they've got now, which basically  haven't moved in two years and add something a little bit better.  Oh, that's great.  It's like when they got notifications to iOS.  But the deep navigation stuff that Google has got will be really hard to replicate without  them buying turn by turn data from somebody.  Right.  Got that by driving all those cars.  Oh, interesting.  Google made its own turn by turn.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The other half of the Street View thing was actually getting the turn by turn data.  I didn't know that.  They didn't buy that from anybody.  They bought it before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then they realized when they wanted to do navigation, that was the piece that they

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  weren't going to be allowed to do.  And after Nokia bought one of the big providers, I can't remember which one it was, that was  the other shoe dropping.  There was Navtech and Telonav and Nokia bought one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Ericsson is somebody bought the other one.  I can't remember.  Yeah.  So that was part of the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That partly led to Google having the, you know, okay, we better get this ourselves  because we've got more control over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting.  And I haven't seen any Apple Street View vehicles.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I think they would have to license Nav from one of those others.  But the OpenStreetMap stuff is good.  And the fact that that's available and that those layers are being supported and even  by Microsoft is good too.  Again, the OpenStreetMap stuff gets the value there.  I love OpenStreetMap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there's no Nav in OpenStreetMap and there's no satellite or StreetView or any of that  stuff.  It's just maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the other thing that Google has on Android, which potentially Apple could do, is the each  Android that's using Nav is feeding the bank traffic data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  There's a huge advantage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's huge.  Yeah.  And so Apple could do that with iPhones.  They could gather data that way, but it won't give them, you could potentially eventually  get turn by turn data that way, but you have to have something to bootstrap it.  And a lot of the terms in the data that you buy from people, it explicitly tries to stop  you doing that kind of thing.  Trying to mix data from more than one source.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Finally, the Google glasses are now patent protected.  Of course they would be.  Apparently not just the glasses, but the ornamental design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google owns Kiki now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ornamental air quotes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  Well, that means they're serious about Project Glass.  It means nobody else can do Project Glass quite the same way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Amber Case was here and she had some glasses that really look like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we should mock some up and walk around and pretend we know more than we do.  Oh, hi Lin Fu.  Wait a minute.  Reboot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is truly the only time in my life anyone's ever told me I look slightly...  It wasn't me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was the app.  It was the app.  It was the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't blame me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  Maybe even the app didn't.  I don't know.  And by the way, this patent design has the heads up display right over the eyeball.  So, unlike the ones we've seen before where it looked like you had to look up, it looks  like you really are looking through a screen for this.  So, whether that's telling, I don't know.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Come back with tips, numbers, and tools.  If you would like, Kevin Marks, I will cede my Google tool position to you if you have  something you want to talk about.  Otherwise, I could let you go if you want to go back to your conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me see if I can think of a tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You think about something while I do an ad and if you're not there when I come back,  I'll know you recused yourself.  Run away.  Run away.  Run away.  I want to talk a little bit about GoToMyPC, the best remote access out there from our  good friends at Citrix.  Citrix has a great philosophy.  Make the product better and better and better.  Upgrade.  Always be upgrading.  A, B, G.  Always be upgrading.  GoToMyPC is the best remote access out there.  They started with, of course, the brilliant Citrix platform.  Mac or PC.  They use NAT traversal so you never have to do anything scary like open firewall ports  or things like that.  They make it simple to install so you don't have to call IT and say, I don't understand  what's going on.  It's so great.  It sets up in minutes and then, by the way, you can leave work.  You can go home.  You can take, you hit the road.  You can get work done wherever you go.  And here's one of the features just added that I think is so cool.  You don't have to just use a computer to access your office computer, Mac or PC.  You can use your iPhone or your iPad or your Android tablet.  Free apps available.  You can use all three.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So here's the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You want to try it?  30 days waiting for you.  GoToMyPC.com.  Click the try it free button.  Use the offer code TWIG.  Then get those free apps.  The app store or the Android Play Market.  And you're ready to go.  Hit the road, Jack.  You know, anybody calls you up from work says, hey, where are you?  Say, I'm right at my desk.  I'm going to send you an email to prove it.  Send an e-mail, send a receive email, access any network resource running program with  GoToMyPC.  Try it free for 30 days.  G-O-T-O-M-Y-P-C.com.  And then get the app because it's so cool.  Gina Trapani, time for your tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just got an email about this today.  An app that we talked about a few episodes ago called Schemer.  Schemer.com.  This is a Google app.  It doesn't really quite look like a Google app, but it's kind of a lifeless goal setting  kind of app.  You log in with your Google account.  You say, I want to climb Mount Everest or learn how to speak French fluently.  Best icon ever though, because it's just a little bit of a language.  Schemer though, because it's just a blue icon with a mustache.  Yeah, the mustache icon is great.  The iPhone app launched today.  So the app, so I think when we talked about it on the show, you needed an invite.  You don't need invites to sign up.  There's a new iPhone app that launched today.  There's an Android app.  And you know, it's a fun kind of lifeless bucket list kind of app.  And it's really neat to see what your friends want to do.  And it all ties into your Google account and your circles.  So yeah, the app's pretty good.  I was playing with it for a little bit before the show.  Does it look pretty much like the Android app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It looks similar to the Android app.  And it's iPhone only, not iPad.  But yeah, it looks similar to Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what I love is it gives you this thing.  How many people I've inspired?  I've inspired 651 people.  I don't know how.  I don't know what I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That means that people have looked at your schemes and hit the I want to do this button.  Meaning that they want to do that scheme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My top schemes, install a custom ROM on a rooted Android device.  Done it.  Visit all seven continents.  I'm missing one, Antarctica.  Travel to Norway.  Did it.  So I only have one left on my bucket list, but I'm sure there's some other ones.  So that's kind of cool, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a fun app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Schemer.  Free on iOS now as well as on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's really neat to see how many people are scheming to get on Twitter someday.  I wish I was the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Done it!  That's a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good idea.  I like it.  Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I switched here to get the Opera House behind me.  If you can see it there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at that.  Oh, it's beautiful.  The sun's hitting the Sydney Opera House.  That is gorgeous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I also want to thank you, Leo, for the power of Leo Laporte last night.  Only about a few hours beforehand I said, oh, anybody want to do a twig meetup in Sydney?  And suddenly 15 folks were at a bar.  Oh!  With good time.  Amazing what you can do.  So the number of the week is 240.  There's a story on NPR, which will be on the list, about a pizza guy who used $240 worth  of Facebook ads and really tried to learn how to go viral.  And so basically he found that everyone on Facebook in New Orleans finally saw his ad.  Wow.  A pair of them were General Motors, which just dropped Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I saw that.  They had a $10 million a year budget on Facebook.  They said it didn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The thing that this demonstrates to me is the guy, the pizza guy, knew that this is  about relationships.  He had to twig it.  He had to figure out who knew whom.  The old days GM of just saying, you will listen to our message are over.  And I think that, yeah, I don't know if Facebook is good or bad as an ad medium.  I don't know.  But I do know that that old attitude the GM would show is over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I have to say Scott Monte, who's the social guy for Ford, responded to GM pulling  out saying, well, it kind of depends on exactly what you said.  How well you engage, what kind of content, how well you do it.  He said, we're very, Ford is very happy with our ad.  Yeah.  Scott.  I don't know if that was a chance to zing GM or if they really meant it.  But I think that's probably the case.  Now I have to say people pulling out of Facebook just makes me happy because, of course, we  provide a different kind of advertising from banner advertising or social network.  It's a much more engaged kind of advertising.  So I'm not unhappy to see GM pull out.  There was some concern around here.  What does this mean?  Ford is going to pull out from Twitter?  No, it's exact opposite, if anything.  Jeff, I mean, Kevin, I gave you a chance.  You want to show us something cool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, I do.  I remembered one.  So there's now the turntable FM app for Android, which is actually really good.  It's nicer than the iOS one.  So if you know, turn over FM, it's a website that you log into.  It's American only at the moment, sadly, and you play music for each other in rooms.  And then there are a bunch of rooms you can go to and it'll play music to you.  But you can become a DJ and play music for your friends.  And what I found is the Android one works really nicely.  It works well.  And it actually has been a good alternative radio for me as I'm driving the car around.  I can just pick one of the rooms out.  I pick the Ska music channel and click on that and play a nice range of different Ska music while I'm driving around town.  And so you've got these rooms that are themed and they but you can also join in and step up and be a DJ.  So I can go into the room and you get the little UI from the website there with all the animals dancing and stuff going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's really that's beautiful.  There it is.  That's very cute.  Now, is it true that no matter what room you go into, it all becomes dubstep eventually?  No, no, that's the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're actually curated pretty well.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, the phenomenons are coming to the mystic of the Phoenix across the street if you want to come to town next weekend.  They're fabulous Ska band turntable FM now on Android.  Thank you, Kevin Marks for being here.  Kevin works for Salesforce, but he's also a well-known, very well-spoken advocate for open standards on the net.  And he does a great podcast called Tummel Vision available at Tummelvision.TV.  Thank you for stopping in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We really appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin Marks on Twitter and of course on Google+.  From Sydney, Australia, ladies and gentlemen, Jeff Jarvis, the author of Public Parts.  He blogs at BuzzMachine.com and Google Plus is Jeff Jarvis.  Nice to see you, Jeff.  Boy, it's beautiful.  The sunrise in Sydney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Trying to get it for you.  Yeah, it's gorgeous.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  Thank you for being here, Jeff.  Thank you all.  Yeah, Gina Trapani is at SmarterWear.org.  And of course, she's on Google Plus, Gina Trapani on Twitter and Gina Trapani.  Thank you, Gina, for being here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thanks for being here.  Thanks for having me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Great show.  And I'm going to wrap it up with a video from Google on how email works, the story of Send.  If you've ever wanted to know, Google has a very cute explanation for you.  Thank you for joining us.  We'll see you next time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tummel scenes with Gmail.  The journey begins as soon as you press Send.  This prompts your message to travel through cable or DSL lines to our infrastructure and  into our data center.  When your message reaches our data center, we protect it with a wide range of security  measures like security cameras, iris scans, and fingerprint scans in our buildings.  Your message then enters the networking room where our equipment sends it to the Gmail  servers on our server floor.  Our servers work together to process your data, including duplicating your message to  create backups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You read everything you write and then we put an ad on it.  Anyway, that's the story of Send.  You get the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  At one point they say they keep their server rooms at 82 degrees to save on cooling costs.  So they said Googlers can come to work in their shorts.  In the video there's a guy, a bearded guy in shorts going by on his scooter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's about green.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And scanning it for viruses.  All our servers are shared between our products, which means we can do more with less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  More searches.  Thank you.  Goodbye.  You can find this if you want to watch the whole thing on their Google Green account  on YouTube.com.  Thanks everybody.  We do this show every Wednesday 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern time, 2000 UTC on twit.tv.  But if you miss it, you can always get video and audio after the fact at twit.tv slash twig.  Join us next week for another episode and welcome to our new producer, Chad Johnson.  We'll see you next time on Twig.
