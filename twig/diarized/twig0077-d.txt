Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hello.  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How's it going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good.  You feeling better?  Quick recovery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Quick recovery.  She had pertussis.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm still coughing a little bit.  I will mute when I do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm glad you're feeling better.  Thank you.  Good to have you back.  Aren't you glad you're not where Jeff is right now?  Jeff Chavis from BuzzMachine.com.  Show you.  Is it snowing?  No, it's over now.  But there's the view outside my window.  Oh man.  That's pretty though.  Wait a minute, that's pretty.  That's nice.  It is.  So I guess you're too far south to get the blizzard they're getting in Boston.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  About 7, 8 inches, 9 inches maybe.  I'm going out your way.  I'm going to do Regis and Kelly on Tuesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, you're not going to see me and I'm so hurt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well I could see you but it would have to be breakfast.  Oh I do that.  Because it's a red eye.  I get there Monday morning and then rehearse Monday afternoon.  Then scramble around New York City trying to find bits and pieces to make the demos  work because Gelman always says, well what about that?  You need a toilet for that to work.  Okay.  Hey, we forgot to pitch him.  We forgot to pitch him the iScooba.  That's the little thing that cleans your toilet.  It's like the iRobot from iRobot.  Better add that to the list.  They love toilet cleaning devices.  Also with us, Kevin Marks.  He is from tummelvision.tv.  Like that?  An expert on all this.  Just to give you, because you're going to get the lead story on this one which is that  Chrome no longer is going to support H.264.  To give you some back story on this, Kevin was involved in the development of QuickTime  at Apple Computer.  iChat at Apple Computer.  He went to Google and worked at Google for a while.  Was it Google profiles or standard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Open social and Google profiles.  But the two main things I worked on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then most recently at British Telecom where he worked on Ribbit which is also a  kind of streaming standard.  So this is the guy who knows this stuff.  So what's the story?  Why drop what is absolutely a standard H.264 from Chrome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well you've got to look at the history of this.  So the challenge has always been how do we do video on computers.  And that's been fought over for a long time.  There were a whole bunch of rival standards.  You remember RealPlayer, Windows Media and QuickTime were fighting it out for most of  the 2000s and the late 90s.  And then Apple then said, okay we'll work to standardize this and we'll work with the  MPEG group and move from pushing QuickTime primarily to pushing MPEG4 and standardize  on that.  And the MPEG4 file format is largely based on QuickTime.  And then while I was there they held up a release of QuickTime explicitly to get better  terms out of the MPEG licensing association so that you could actually ship it without  having a sort of infinitely increasing royalty.  This is MPEG LA, is that who it is?  Yes, MPEG LA is what they call a patent pool.  Basically they collect all the patents that relate to a particular technology.  And they issue invoices to people saying we will license these patents for this and  then they divide it up between the patent holders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was concern last year that MPEG LA might, the royalties are fairly cheap right now,  might raise the royalties suddenly.  They made a promise, no we never will.  I mean they kind of reassured everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a bunch of different royalties on different bits of this.  So there were royalty agreements in place up until this year I think that were so much  a year.  When Apple sort of held them to account it was they put a cap on the royalties so you  don't have to pay more than X million a year however many decoders you ship.  And that was something that they did so that they wouldn't have an infinite expense for  this.  And that meant that any sufficiently large company could adopt this without knowing exactly  what their cost would be.  So that's one of the reasons that Adobe and Microsoft adopted H.264 as well because it  had known costs.  And the other part was that it was standardized by consumer electronics and there's lots  of hardware out there that generates it and supports it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we should point out that if you're watching our video, you're watching, streaming anyway,  you're watching H.264 in a flash wrapper or not.  But everything we do is H.264 and in fact when we release downloads I think it's all  H.264.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  So that's the sort of, you know, that's what, well 264 is a codec inside the MPEG-4 file  format.  We were getting into audio as well.  But there is, it is proprietary, it is patented, you have to pay to use it and depending on  what you're doing with it you have to pay different amounts.  What they did say was that if you're not charging for video and you're publishing it online  they will not charge you royalties ever.  That's something that they did change.  But they only announced that after Google bought Onto and set up WebM.  So Onto was a video codec developer that built the sort of VP range of codecs.  And so the original flash codec that was widely used by YouTube and others was VP3, was part  of the Onto staff.  And the current one I think is VP8 and the open source VP6 and the WebM standard that  Google is promoting along with Firefox and Flash as a web video is based on the technology  Google bought from basically Google acquired Onto and open source the full codec stack  and so on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does this all come down to HTML5 and the search for an open unencumbered standard for HTML5?  Is that what's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, that's partly what's going on.  The other contender in this was Ziff.org who had the open source audio video codecs which  is Vorbis, Audio and Theora Video and they've been around a long time and that's also the  Ogg file format.  They also had their own file format as well.  And their goal was to provide something that was patent and royalty free and open source  and available to anyone.  And it has got a fair bit of pickup within those communities.  It's the standard codec used for Wikipedia.  A lot of game people use it and there's some traction there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although there have been assertions consistently that nothing is unencumbered including that  there are bits of other people's code in there and it really isn't patent free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is Apple's position.  So when I was at Apple I tried really hard to get them to ship Vorbis inside QuickTime  because Vorbis is a nice codec, it works well.  Good for you.  And it's open source.  That's an audio codec though.  That's not a video codec.  Yes, that's the audio codec.  Theora is the video version.  Theora is their video codec which came a bit later.  And the pushback I got was even though they say it's unencumbered they're not worth suing.  So as soon as we Apple with our billions of dollars ship it someone will turn up with  a lawsuit and probably Dolby or someone like that or Fraunhofer, Lambsdorff, BMP3 patents.  They'll turn up and injunct us.  And if they do that they could deny us the right to playback DVDs.  They could cause us or MP3s or cause us all kinds of grief.  So hence the...  So the VP at Apple said to me we can't do this because these patents may come here.  It's not worth us taking this stand and potentially being held blackmail like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's in fact better to ship a patented product that you know the licensee is and pay the  license fee.  That's Apple's position.  Than to try to find an open one because of the risk of getting sued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was their contention.  And you can argue that but that's their position.  It's still their position.  If you follow what Apple spokespeople have been saying about this, their position is  still we want to do this thing where the IP is clear.  Now Google's position is we should do an open source one.  And so they said okay we're going to ship this open source audio video codec stuff.  Go ahead and sue us.  They don't actually say go ahead and sue us but they're basically saying we're taking  that stuff doesn't have a patent, isn't patent encumbered and guess what we're big enough  to sue so if you want to start a lawsuit over this Google will be the person to sue.  If you're Dolby Labs or Fraunhofer or Toshiba or any of that.  So that was somewhat altruistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean Google was almost basically trying to cut the Gordian knot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  And a lot of this is like who has market power and what can they do with it.  So YouTube had market power like two or three years ago everyone wanted YouTube integration  and YouTube was using flash for everything and the path Google took at the time and when  they were still friends with Apple was to use 264 and to work with Apple to make the  264 stuff work so Apple didn't have to ship the flash codec and license that from Adobe  and so on.  And so that was their sort of step towards openness and it meant that YouTube now uses  264 generally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In a flash wrapper in some cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In a flash wrapper or not you've got the choice now.  But that was the other the other lever that happened there was that flash adopted 264  as well because before that flash had a series of projects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We were using VP6 before.  I want to just clarify a little bit because people are going there's a wrapper which is  flash or QuickTime and then there's a codec which is what's actually inside the wrapper  and these wrappers like flash can use different codecs.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So codecs stands for Coder Decoder.  It's basically the piece of code that takes pixels and turns them into small compressed  bits and back again.  And there's you know that they all work basically in similar ways.  They divide the picture up into squares.  They frequency encode it and they say did this one move from here to here this one here  to here.  And they're actually the whole generation pretty much two dimensional.  So if you start rotating the camera or moving the camera then they have to work really hard  because their mental model of the space is something like the shot we've got here.  There's a static thing behind that's not moving as a piece that's moving.  And that's that.  That's what they're really tuned for.  So these this generation of video codecs are all broadly similar.  And the difference is in how big the squares are how variable they are how much interpolation  they do and do they do they go do they look at frames in the future as well as frames  in the past to encode it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's a there's a there's a lot of battle going on between who's better you know and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a lot of people complain of course and then you know there always will be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's and you know but in your opinion I mean you gosh you if anybody knows this  you do I'm sure you've looked at them all and you have the technical expertise to judge  is WebM as good as H.264.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I haven't I haven't reviewed them recently.  I mean the difficulty with this is it's really hard to do this without doing subjective testing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Encoding it and looking at it and saying encode it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It looks better because if you can if you can measure anything then that gets incorporated  into the codec so you can do signals to noise stuff and things like that.  But that means the machine can detect that and then you tune for that.  But the subtlety is you know does this work better with different dynamic ranges.  Does it look funny on certain kinds of shots.  Just does it does does the way it interpolates pixels feel wrong.  You know you sometimes get that crawling weirdness in the background.  And some of that can be tuned by and that can be independent of the bit stream as well.  You can define a bit stream for how this works and then you can compete with encoders that  do a better job of creating a good bit stream for a given.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In other words it's devishly hard to say one's better than the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah it's very hard to evaluate.  And you know I think they're all pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah I mean if I.  I like H.264.  I have a strong preference for it because it scales well.  It works well at low bit rate rates and works really great.  It works for a range.  Yeah and that's important to us because we're a streamer.  Yeah.  Well let me ask a thing.  Go ahead.  No you go.  Go ahead Jeff because I want to make sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I want to ask one political question and one practical question.  Political question.  Is this an anti-apple move?  It does seem like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think it's directly an anti-apple move.  It's more a extending the openness in their viewpoint.  Their viewpoint is we should move to open source codex.  We shouldn't have to be reliant on this patent pool and therefore over time we should move  to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they're going to drop the flash support too right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My sense is my suspicion is they're trying to use the market power of YouTube to drive  it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are they going to re-encode every video and web app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That was my next question.  And then those, you know Leo, do you have to re-encode your entire stock?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No they do it for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you put it on YouTube they encode it.  They've already done this once right?  They already encode to four different sizes and two codex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We just upload a mezzanine file and they encode and if they're going to change it they have  to re-encode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right but Leo on Chrome if I want to watch you directly from some other service, I want  to watch your archive you find other means.  Everything you have is stored in HD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  From a practical point of view, Kevin, can't we just install an H.264 codec on top of Chrome  and then be able to do it anyway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Use the flash wrapper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah I mean it's just if it's...  Yeah but what this de facto means is that flash is secured on the desktop because...  Whoa whoa whoa hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Flash which Apple's screaming about is not open.  We now depend upon flash.  This is the issue.  To cure the not open H.264.  I'm not getting something here.  Yeah I mean this is what developers are upset about right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Chrome dropping H.264 support means that the HTML5 video tag will not render those types  of videos.  It doesn't mean that the flash wrapper won't play those videos.  The flash wrappers will play those videos.  So they're claiming that they're pushing the openness of the web farther and kind of...  I mean I think the view there at Google I imagine is you know short-term pain for long-term  benefit but the thing that developers are concerned about...  The pain is ours too.  It is.  It's not just them.  And for publishers.  But I think the thing that developers are worried about is that this is pushing the  whole point of HTML5 video tags is that you don't have to use the freaking flash plugin  right?  But this is going to...  People are going to say I've got a whole library of H.264 video.  I'm not going to back encode so I'm just going to serve flash.  So I think the concern is that this move is actually going to push people back to that  where we're using flash for video now all the time which is the exact opposite effect  of what we wanted with HTML5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  So yeah my take on this is that the browser should obey Postel's law which is be liberal  in what you accept and consider what you output.  And they should...  Exactly.  If you're building a browser you should play the maximum number of things possible.  To explicitly say we're dropping support for that is a strongly political move.  Especially when you've already shipped it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  E-Volometer to 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can argue whether it's evil or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're going to make an evil-ometer.  There's plenty of evil to go around in video patterns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay so from a practical point of view...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's short-term versus long-term view I think is the other way of looking at it.  The other thing that Peter Hodley just said to me on Twitter is that the other half of  this is if you have to license codecs for partners for devices they all have to currently  have to pay the MPEG LA licensing for 264.  So this should potentially make devices cheaper in the future because they won't have to pay  that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  It eliminates the license fee.  And Google I guess is indemnifying people on WebM because that seems like...  They're not.  Well they're not indemnifying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No that would be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're saying we'll take the first hit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're saying you're going to sue anyone sue us.  But you know...  They can sue anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Google's not promising anything.  Right.  I mean you know and also...  So I'm looking at for instance our streaming partners.  You stream Big Gravity, Justin.TV.  They all ship Flash with H.264.  Maybe you could make a compelling case to them.  Oh use WebM but we won't indemnify you if you get sued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  So but you know Flash has said they'll adopt WebM.  So we're now in this situation is if you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just going to promote Flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you're using Chrome or Firefox you'll need Flash to play H.264.  If you're using Safari or IE you'll need Flash to play WebM.  So Adobe by being the general...  Adobe wins.  ...supporting both.  Adobe wins.  And the issue then we then have is that the portable devices which is the future battle  and currently they all play H.264 because they've paid the licenses and Google's shipped  it and so on.  Google will ship WebM on those and then Apple will be in the do we ship this or not state  in the same place that they are at the moment with WebM on the desktop.  And their take may well be they don't want to do that.  So they're going to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Presumably they're going to continue to...  They need to continue to embed it to support Flash, have the embedded Flash player that  they currently ship with Chrome in there which seems completely antithetical to what they're  saying.  I mean that's talk about proprietary.  Right?  Are they going to take Flash out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In that case this is sort of different levels of market power again.  So Apple by shipping little portable device that everyone wants can say okay we don't  want to ship Adobe code on our device we don't trust it so we're not going to do that and  therefore if you want to work on our device you have to drop the Flash stuff.  But the H.264 will still work.  And Google has got the...  The other thing is like if we want to compete as a desktop browser we need to have Flash  there.  Frankly you can't throw that out yet.  You know even though Apple started doing it with the air.  Have you held out on the air or have you installed Flash?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I installed Flash.  I'm not going to hold out.  Nobody's going to hold out.  I'm not that pure.  I need Flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Does it squeeze on the iPad then?  No it's good for the iPad.  It's more dependent on Flash and its lack of Flash is all the more a detriment.  Is that what's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh I see what you're saying.  Yeah you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Potentially.  You know it may be a power play in that direction as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because Android supports Flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Android supports Flash though.  You have it on like click to play.  Not well.  Yeah.  It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know we're going to have Tegra 2.  You know everybody's going to have Tegra 2 which and Flash plays great on that.  So eventually the hardware will catch up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The other half of Flash, the other reason that half of Flash is that much of Flash on  the web is actually used for extraneous advertising type content.  And so the reason, that's the reason that it creates such battery load on the iPhone.  You're playing Flash videos all the time.  Of course you've got little Flash videos playing all around the stream while you're trying  to read something else.  So Apple's basically saying we don't you know get rid of that.  If you want to watch video, watch video but don't do that.  So there's you know there is a tension in that space of are we going to you know are  we going to propagate that?  Are the people who've planned on businesses on having video advertising going to be able  to carry that on?  On the other hand as a general web user if you sit there and look at top or you know  activity monitor the Flash bits of your browsers are way up there most of the time.  It's certainly my first candidate for somebody to kill when I'm out you know my RAM's full.  So there is there is a tension there that's going to continue.  And the sort of the shame for me is that there's been this sort of battle going on inside the  HTML5 standard as what should be the one true codec.  HTML5 needs to stay agnostic on this and let you support whichever one you want.  But as a browser vendor supporting more is always better in my opinion.  Because you know at the moment we've got you know HTML5 is you know it's for life it's  not just for this current codec battle.  We need to be sure that it will support multiple video formats.  And the other half of this is archival stuff.  You want to get you want to have access to the older 264 stuff.  But actually if you're archiving video and audio you eventually want to use something  that's this high quality.  And I had a chat with Karl Mellermood about this.  Who's you know Karl he's been open government documents and stuff like that.  And he's concerned about stuff actually staying around over time.  And what you do there is you archive uncompressed audio and potentially uncompressed video.  That's that's not that practical at the moment.  But I'm assuming you archive all your shows as uncompressed audio not as compressed audio.  Right.  Because that's sensible thing to do.  And it's only like five or ten times as big.  Most of the browsers the browsers won't necessarily play that at the moment.  They're all focused on on different bits and pieces.  So we've got some some work to do to get this stuff to perform better in the browsers and be  more compatible.  But I think this is a step in the wrong direction in saying oh we'll play we'll play less stuff.  I think my idea will be all of them supporting all the formats.  You know I'm I think Apple supporting WebM and 264 will be sensible.  Google supporting 2400 sensible to this kind of near turf or doesn't doesn't help us in the long  run.  But also we should be thinking about can these can the modern browsers playback that the A.U.  files the web files the F.F. files these audio files at the moment.  No particularly.  And there's also some playback wave files often.  Right.  Yeah.  I'm doing some of them don't.  Yeah.  I mean Safari is pretty good at this because he's got QuickTime into it plays anything  QuickTime can but most of the others are like we sort of half play this.  So that's you know I think there should be that maybe I should go and shout out the standards  groups and set up a test page for his 16 kinds of files you should be able to play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John Gruber asks five questions on his daring fireball blog.  We've answered one.  Android currently supports H.264 he says will you be will you be Google will you be removing  it from Android too I guess presumably right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think potentially they will be in over time I think that'll be harder for them but right  I can I could see them doing that again.  That the question is is how much you're going to have to license to build the device.  Right.  Right.  Right.  So if you want to make a cheaper device you want to produce the number of things you have  to pay for to put in it.  And at the moment you'll have to if you want to capture 264 you have to pay to license for that.  Yeah.  So yeah that that that that's that's one strand of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think Google was aware of the unintended consequence of promoting flash from this move  or is it sounds like this is a very common kind of open source purist type move without  really considering consequences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is basically doing what doing what Mozilla is doing.  You know they're basically Google is now in line with Mozilla.  That's right Mozilla said all right right from the front no H.264.  We're not the ship 264 but we're ship flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Again so you can install flash you can install a plugin of some kind that will let you play H.264.  That's not the issue.  It's what happens when a browser hits bracket video bracket.  It's what exactly what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the challenge you know the challenge there is if you you know if I'm building video stuff  in the future and audio stuff in the future I want to be doing using that.  That seems like a great way to do it for me but we've just been condemned to make sure we have  to write and either encode everything twice or potentially more or write a whole bunch of hairy  fallback code to do flash.  Well and the other thing is if you can't.  Sorry so slightly here you cannot declaratively do a fallback onto flash.  The way that the video and audio tags work is if you say video format equals something  and the browser can't play that it doesn't fall back to the stuff inside.  It does it just gives you a controller that doesn't play.  So the only way you can get the right behavior is to write java strip that sits there and munges  around and tries to do the right thing and swaps in the flash one.  But here's the problem.  I guess is the flash you can do the other way around.  You can make a flash thing and say if you haven't got flash put the video in and the video will  play and that works declaratively without having to write JavaScript at all.  So what that means is the asymmetry is that it'll be actually easy to embed the flash and have the  fallback for the non-flash case which is the wrong way around in my in my head for as a you know as  a stepping forward.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's my question.  But in a Chrome OS world where I'm going to be editing video raw material it's not just a  question about consuming material it's also about being able to render things in my browser and the  browser is the OS then have they limited the radically things like like authoring a video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Historically it's very hard to auth to edit mpeg video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  No I mean this is this is the sort of Apple's great squandered opportunity was QuickTime was  the thing that had that.  Right.  And it is editable it is edited by reference it's very quick and very powerful and that was the bit  that they they decided to charge for and you know therefore lost the edge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Almost everybody transcodes before they edit right.  I mean nobody edits in native mpeg.  It's too hard it's frame based it's very difficult to get accurate ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah well you can you can do it actually QuickTime can do it.  QuickTime can do frame accurate edits on bi-directional encoded stuff.  But yeah you don't need to re-encode on the on the on the iMovie.  Yeah.  iMovie transforms it into a platform first.  Yeah.  It transcodes it.  The original iMovie was always in dv the modern one is in.  ProRes or something.  It was I wish it was it was pixelate for a while I haven't actually looked at what it translates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's an easier to edit frame accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's designed to be an all key frame thing so you can edit quickly.  Right.  Oh that's right.  So you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think it does use ProRes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you need to explain key frames and difference frames?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean that's a that's would be a great thing to do for another show.  I would love to kind of in fact you're the guy to do it have a  primer in video and codecs and all of this stuff because it's a fascinating subject.  But I think we're more interested in the politics of this than the the technology.  Gina what's your what's your reaction on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm really sad about the possibility of excuse me sorry.  Sorry I'm really I'm really sad about the possibility of the backlash.  I think that Google the backlash being that we roll back to flash.  Sure looks like an anti Apple move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean this is exactly like contrary to what Apple has been saying.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This feels like a business decision.  This doesn't feel like we're serving our users decision in the short term.  I mean a lot of people are saying hey this is going to be short term pain for long term gain.  And I can see that.  And I can see that.  But I just hope it doesn't set back HTML 5 and it feels very much like a business decision and not  a decision based on what users want.  And I just wish that Chrome had shipped this way.  Like when you build software you don't have a feature and then pull it.  I don't like the idea they dropped it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah Mozilla we don't we aren't complaining about this with Mozilla.  Of course they're not as they don't have the more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've complained about them as well.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean the reality is that Google is trying to pay the license fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not reasonable for Mozilla which is a charity to pay 10 percent of their annual  income to MPEG LA to ship the codec.  So I think it makes more sense for them not to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. It doesn't feel like a matter of resources or money for Google.  It definitely feels like a like a political move.  And I see you know Google is obviously trying to shape the future of the web.  People spend a lot of time trying to make their site easily findable by the Google bot.  This isn't the first time that people are going to change their content in order to  work well with Google technology.  For users this is going to be a pain in the ass but all you have to do is switch to another browser.  I don't know if people will do that.  I think it's interesting they waited till they have kind of the market share that they have.  Yeah that's why they didn't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a really good point.  I mean they could have done it on launch instead they waited till they had market share  and then said haha and pulled the rug right out from under.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not sure WebM was ready.  You know they're not going to ship a technology that doesn't work very well.  Is WebM ready now?  WebM is pretty good now yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they're going to re-encode every video on YouTube and WebM  and they're going to drop Flash and they're going to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And 200 years from now it'll all be done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  At some point they'll drop it.  I think my suspicion is that the you know Peter Hoddy's licensing point is a good one.  If you're going to make a cheap Chrome OS device  you don't want licensing audio video codecs to be a chunk of that price.  Yeah that makes sense.  So this might be more for the Chrome.  The goal of the Android and Chrome is to make the licensing stuff negligible  so that you don't have that extra burden on those things.  So that you know I can see that as part of the agenda  and the longer term thing of moving off this patented technology onto open technology makes sense.  But I'm just surprised they're doing it this early  and I still think dropping support is unhelpful.  Yeah supporting legacy stuff is hard.  You know one of the things that the QuickTime era that I was there was  we will support every movie ever made in QuickTime and make sure it still plays back.  And that was quite a commitment that Apple held up from sort of 1990 through to 2004 or so.  And then the recent version of QuickTime, the QuickTime X  has shipped without support for all of the older formats  and you have to use the older player to play some of that back.  So they finally made a break with that on their side as well.  But I still think that certainly for these archival formats  for stuff that has a large deployed base of video out there  unless you're going to you know commit to transcoding not just the stuff that you host  but the rest of the web as well service side.  Which is potentially I can imagine that someone in Google thinking about that  and going oh we could crawl the video on the web and re-encode it sure.  But that's a very Google thing to do.  We'll do it for you.  But unless you're going to do that you're starting to lose stuff  and we've got enough problems with losing old material already  without deliberately doing it.  That's my sense of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And meanwhile Larry Page buys a $54 million super yacht.  Not cynical.  All right let's take a break.  We're going to talk more.  Kevin Marx is here.  It's great to have you.  I guess we'll call it we'll say with Tummelvision.  Tummelvision.tv.  Until you get another job.  Gina Gervani is also here from smarterware.org.  Jeff Jarvis from buzzmachine.com.  CES there's lots to talk about there.  Fitty cents making $8.7 million this weekend from a tweet.  And the guy in the UK who called Google deeply unethical and tax avoiding.  All coming up this week in Google is on the air.  I do want to talk a little bit about my friends at the Ford Motor Company.  They were our sponsors of our trip to CES and they chose CES,  which I really liked, to make their big announcement of a new car.  I can't think of another time that's ever happened.  Usually they wait to the auto show which is on right now in Detroit.  But no they said this is really a consumer electronics device and I think they're right.  It's the new brand new 2012 Ford Focus Electric and I can tell you right now my next car.  I tried I couldn't believe this thing.  It's so cool.  Voice activated sync of course in my Ford Touch.  That's a for me a requirement but it also has high voltage capacity lithium ion batteries.  Higher capacity than any other Ford vehicle.  Plugging it in to either the 120 or the 240.  Although I got to say you're going to want to go with 240 because this charge is faster  than any electric vehicle.  Three hours to a full charge.  Regenerative braking means when you slow down it charges up.  Miles per charge and that's the new standard by the way.  No more mpg it's mpc miles per charge that is as good as it gets.  And it's going to save you money too let me tell you and save the environment because  it's no co2 no co no carbon emissions of any kind.  And the battery management is very cool.  They've added that to the my Ford Touch.  So you can actually issue battery commands manage your badger battery as well as make  voice calls.  True hands free.  You got your hands on the wheel your eyes on the road.  You press the button you make a call.  You could play music has the new my Ford Touch has two USB slots.  And an SD card slot in the car as well as three screens a big eight inch screen in the  center console two behind the steering wheel.  You can manage your battery you can make sure you're going to have enough to go where you  need to go.  The new sync understands more than 10,000 voice commands in total.  So Ford you're doing it you're crushing it you're knocking it out of the park.  We're glad to be partnered with Ford and we're very excited about the new Ford Focus  electric you can find out more at Focus electric power dot com.  Focus electric power dot com.  And I immediately got on the list.  I don't know if there's a list.  I just said to Alan Mulally the CEO of Ford I'm on the list right.  I want to be the first to own a Ford Focus electric.  I can't wait I'm very excited.  Let's get back to the conversation.  Boy there's so much to talk about Jeff.  I mean Kevin I'm so glad that you he actually he actually went to the chat room and said  I want to talk about this.  And I'm so glad you did because I can't think of anybody better equipped to explain this.  Dismaying news and I'm going to you know Gina I know you're gloomy and depressed about this  but I'm going to look on the bright side I'm going to say I'm going to I'm going to assume  it's coming from a desire to promote open standards.  I think there may be some bumps along the way but let's let's hope that Google you know puts  its considerable weight behind the notion of an open web standard for HTML 5.  I mean WebM is fine with me but we got to do something about the flash issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah yeah I think I think it comes from a good place.  I think Google is trying to control you know guide the future of the web the path the web  is taking.  I'm just I'm just a little bummed I am a big believer in you know pastel's law like like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin said but that's not always compatible with open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know I know but when open is limiting that's when you know when open affects users and web  publishers in the way that this may affect people.  I mean hey you know this is people just have to switch browsers.  I mean they may they if they lose users then that then they will.  I mean like you said Adobe may be the short term winner.  I think in the long term this is a good thing.  It's just right now it felt like it felt like a political strategic business move not a move  that's that's that serves users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Luke Johnson well-known British entrepreneur former head of channel four in Britain disagrees.  He says he says Google is arrogant.  They accuse them of acting unethically by avoiding tax.  We talked about that the Dutch sandwich and the what was it the Irish Irish go between  whatever they're using.  If I were big enough I would use it.  When are we going to get in our Irish branch of the out to it.  We could funnel all the money to the accent Leo I bet you can.  Oh and I like it too.  Nathan Vergara welcome to Twitter Ireland.  They also he says by dominating web advertising Google siphons off revenue that once supported  quality content television newspapers.  Well that's the old media talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's recycling every possible old anti-Google argument you can imagine.  It might as well be German.  It's Murdoch Ian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes that's a new word.  It's Murdoch Ian.  Ian by the way a rumor is that Rupert Murdoch and Steve Jobs will take the stage in a week  at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art to announce the daily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  As a wag setting start it goes straight to the museum.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Good place to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good place to do it.  We're going to go to a museum and talk about the future of newspapers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not according to Google criticism now.  The Germans my favorite country the Germans are going after Google.  They've they've cut off negotiations with Google and turn about privacy and such.  I'm not sure what the negotiations were aimed for but their big argument is that  Google Analytics tracks your IP address.  How could they did Ted Stevens come back to life and take over the Bundestag.  I track your freaking IP address.  And now they're going to this ridiculous thing that you have to be able to anonymize your IP  address where your IP address essentially is anonymous and then some talk about how you can  you can make a partial IP address or some such thing like that.  It's absurd.  Meanwhile the German government were the one who wanted Google to hold on to data longer  so that they could track you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google already does IP address degradation.  They have that they did a long thing about this a while back when they said they hold  it for so long and after a while they randomize the low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They want to do it from the start.  Which makes no sense.  So all they're going to do is you know they'll go by your cooking number not your IP address  but it makes no sense.  It's not a problem.  We should track you better.  Yeah right.  Yeah it's absurd insane and just plain stupid.  I love you Germans but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well how about this the South Korea Cyber Terror Response Center in August as you may  know seized hard drives from Google's Seoul office and they said we unlocked 79 computer  disks seized from Google last summer discovered emails instant messages and other private  data set over Wi-Fi networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's the old Street View thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love this the headline from from Yahoo Finance.  Yahoo Finance well hell if all I knew if I knew all I had to do was seize the hard drives.  That's it's not a quote but they said that might be what attorney general connect attorney  general Richard Blumenthal who was suing Google might have said I should have gotten the hard  drives.  I want to make it easy.  So but it's fragmentary data right.  Yeah yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or it's the same thing.  It's just it this is just an effort to be anti-Google and Google doesn't do everything  right and Google is not perfect and all that's true but this is kind of anti-corporate anti-capitalist  anti-American.  I hate to sound like a conspiracy theorist but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Speaking of privacy you know I should have bookmarked this.  This is one of my favorite stories over the over the holidays.  You know Google was sponsoring free Wi-Fi on airplanes and there was a tech reporter  sitting behind a Google employee on a plane and the Google employee was connected to the  free Google Wi-Fi and was reading you know confidential company email and and the seat  this was he actually wasn't directly behind him he was in the seat diagonal and the person  right in front of him had put her seat back.  So we had like a clear view of this Google employees screen and he actually he said gosh  I have to hunt down this link and we'll put it in the show notes.  He contacted Google PR and said do you have a policy about laptop screens being you know  visible in public places and I guess they said they didn't or they didn't get back.  I'm not I'm not sure but I was like oh okay.  He said he could see the big words confidential about like the you know the employee bonus  over the holidays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Winona Ryder shares our fear of Google I see she.  Yes she does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You got to queue that up after the ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I'm going to I'm playing the ad right now I'm going to skip the ad.  This is from New York Magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The one that comes after that is very good too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is Winona on what late night with David Letterman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No I think we'll see we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Maybe one.  Unfortunately the ad is very long.  There we go here we go.  This is Winona Ryder on some show late night on late night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know it's the whole thing of the Googling which is very terrifying to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah the Googling I it scares me to the Googling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I fear that I'm going to be trying to find out you know what movie is playing at what  theater and then I'm going to suddenly be a member of Al Qaeda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's Jimmy Kimmel.  Jimmy Fallon one of the Jimmy's.  It's a Jimmy's.  You know I confuse those two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not going to happen to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not looking for a movie you're not going to come Al Qaeda members.  All right well then stay away from it.  I want to be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Pete Townsend and we know that that you know.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the Pete Townsend thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Pete Townsend references that he was doing research on child porn to see how awful it was.  Oh yeah see you never know the Google.  God knows what Winona is searching for.  Yeah the Googling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Googling will get you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And now here's a.  But like my dad was on Twitter first.  So this is Donald Glover.  Danny Glover's son.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Took Donald Glover and he we have the same name so I took Don Glover.  Don Glover looks like Dong Lover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay that's a bad name.  Stick with it.  Stick with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes it does.  Yes it does.  Lots of people don't know.  That's exactly what it looks like.  So I get a lot I was getting a lot of strange tweets you know.  Just like a lot of people like oh hey like I would tweet something like hey I'm going  to eat a Chipotle and they'd be like yeah I bet you love burritos.  Big boy and I'd be like I sure do lol.  No way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is a definite Chipotle.  Every show gets to Chipotle sometime.  Is that the new Godwin's law?  At some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Every tweet discussion will degrade either into us Googling ourselves or us discussing burritos.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So something that struck me is that if Winona were to Google herself she will find naked  pictures of herself like most of the time so I can see it might put her off a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh put me off.  But she knows what that looks like better than anyone.  She's seen herself naked maybe I don't know maybe.  So this is the one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Your perception is that's what you see when you search that could be off-putting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Speaking of the Twitter I can only imagine an SEC investigation is just around the corner for  50 cent.  Curtis Jackson the rapper he has 3.8 million Twitter followers  and he has an investment in something called H.  He has 30 million shares himself in something called H and H import.  They make his headphones sleek by Fitty.  By the way I talked to some people who was I talking to that were Fitty was a big investor  and he said it was these guys.  Sleek audio.  They said he's very involved.  He shows he talked they talk to him almost every day.  He's incredibly intelligent.  And apparently he pretty much knows how to kite a stock because he tweeted to his 3.8  million fans this weekend.  You can double your money right now.  And then the disclaimer but just get what you can afford.  And then he says I think somebody said you keep Fitty you can't say that.  So he says I own HNHI stock thoughts on it are my opinion talk to a financial advisor.  But the stock went up Monday 290 percent.  The company was 10 cents a share and went up to 39 cents boosting his 30 million share stake to  if my math is correct 8.7 million dollars from 3 to 8.  He made 5.7 million dollars from a tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Fitty's got some serious social media engagement.  I think Fitty's going to get a knock on the door from the feds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what Fitty's going to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When I saw this headline I was sure it was going to be some advertiser paying him to tweet about  something and it was not that.  But I love getting financial advice from rappers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was Sleek Audio we were talking to?  Those headphones, Sonomax headphones or something like that?  The other ones that came after.  They were the ones that we actually met him at CES and he said oh yeah he's very involved.  He's a big investor and he gives us a lot of ideas.  He listens, he pays attention, we talk to him every day.  So maybe he was just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The chart's hilarious.  I just looked it up on Bloomberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's gone back down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's gone back down some but it's still what's funny is the volume 10 million shares.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now remember Fitty made what 100 million dollars on bottled water?  And I mean this guy's sharp I guess.  Fitty by the way is a big fan of H.264 and I think that he.  What about CES?  Let's talk about CES.  I thought we were going to see more Android tablets.  We didn't really see Honeycomb.  We saw a video, the same video we showed last week.  That was a rip off.  And you know I was a little disappointed because CNET named that Zoom tablet,  the Motorola Zoom tablet their best to show but all we saw was it playing a video.  Yeah.  So I couldn't really say that was best to show.  It might be if it lives up to that.  Kevin have you played with Honeycomb?  Have you got insight?  No.  No?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No I haven't played with Honeycomb yet.  Haven't seen one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll tell you what surprised me and looks good and was my best of show  was the Blackberry Playbook which until now I had thought was vaporware but I played with it.  They purchased QNX and customized it and that thing sings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What does it run?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  QNX.  They.  QNX?  Yeah QNX.  It's a long it's been around a long time.  Unix like real time operating system.  RTOS that is used often for embedded systems.  It's very stable because it's been around so long.  And they have they have made it slick as can be.  I mean it is beautiful.  And what I really like is their multitasking.  So you can have a full screen video on YouTube playing.  Swipe up from the bottom.  There's no there's no buttons.  Swipe up from the bottom.  It minimizes to a window in a cover flow kind of display.  And all the windows are still live.  You know how the sometimes the dock is live on a Mac.  All the windows so the video continues to play.  You open the next window it's a game you minimize it.  It continues to go.  All of this stuff is going and you know it's a Tegra 2 in there.  It's dual gigahertz processor.  Gigabyte of RAM.  This is a very powerful system.  It's a seven inch.  Ten minutes of battery life.  You know they weren't they didn't say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm surprised that was your pick of the show.  I was sure that you were going to come back with some awesome Android device that you love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But well the other one I was very impressed with also Motorola was the Atrix phone.  Oh the Atrix.  Which is again a Tegra 2 platform in a very nice looking phone.  And it docks.  It's so powerful.  It docks and a keyboard and I think was a 11 inch screen.  And it's a laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah that looked really cool.  That gave me that feeling of like oh it's like the Jetsons.  I'm just going to fold up my car and stick it in my back pocket kind of feeling.  You know that was really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No I was I was but I think Motorola is doing some good stuff.  Now that's Android based not not based.  So the zoom if the honeycomb is as good as the video looks I would have to revise my opinion.  But it's just a video so we don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah yeah.  The Atrix.  And the next version of Android ice cream or ice cream sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now so clarify this for me that's 2.4 right.  That's not I'm confused.  That's after honeycomb.  It's not 3.1 though.  So this is what I was worried about because it looked like they might be forking it because  honeycomb is clearly a tablet OS.  I don't see that necessarily on a phone.  Do you think they'll fork it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh I see what you mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's more that they're making it more general.  What they've done I read a thing about this last week but  if you look at the the the spec that they say you have to build a device like this to  ship Android X that spec has got looser over time.  So what the 1.6 spec said it must be a phone it must have a camera it must do this there  was a whole set of musts in there before they would even consider letting you call it 1.6  and get therefore get in the app store and all the Google pieces.  But as the assets moved over time those the must have become maze  or shoulds so that you don't have to have telephony after 2.1 and you don't have to  have a camera in 2.3 and so on.  And so this they're sort of relaxing the criteria for what constitutes an Android  which means that they're making support a broader range of devices over time.  So I you know and that the they've said that the honeycomb will run on older devices too.  We've got directly from Android engineers saying no no we're not going to require two  processors that was a myth.  It'll run on the other ones too and Brad Fitzpatrick did a quite a long post on all  the work they've done to optimize and improve Android and the monitoring stuff they've got  there now.  So I think the assumption is that they will keep you know expanding the range of things  it runs on so I don't think that the intention is to fork it at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good well I hope not because that would be a bad idea.  But so ice cream is I think 2.4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So well wait honeycomb is 3.0 right.  I said that.  So ice cream sandwich should be 3. something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It should be but I don't know if that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah I'm not sure I'm not sure that the TechCrunch article about ice cream sandwich  it is a sandwich.  It's a sandwich okay.  It doesn't have a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because you can't make a statue out of just ice cream you need something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well it doesn't look any different from frozen yogurt that's the problem.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  More butter fat I think is the key.  And by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's fine with my Android more butter fat.  More butter fat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way Halix in our chat room told me that actually Fitty prefers Agthior and  a Matroshka rapper so just we would like to make that clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tim Bray tweeted that after he listed all the Android things and after honeycomb was insulin.  Insulin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Diabetes.  I did you know there were 8 million because Android is open and anybody can use it there  were 8 million very cheap Chinese tablets out there that I didn't really bother covering  that were all based on Android.  Really surprisingly large number of them on 2 2.  Really doesn't look like gingerbread is really has been ported to many of these devices yet.  Everything's 2 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Still waiting for gingerbread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're still waiting for those to for the code drop and you know this was the  post I read about the two faces of Android is that there's this set of ones that aren't  bothering with Google's compatibility staff.  They're just taking the code importing it and potentially modifying it themselves.  And that's fanning out into all the consumer electronic devices.  So we're going to have all these sort of cheap and weird things are going to just happen  to be running Android.  It'll be in cameras and phones everywhere and TVs and you know photo frames and MP3  players and whatever because it's it's a fairly resilient OS that you can do quite a lot with.  If you do a bit of work you can make some apps supported and then there are others that will  you go the step further and do the compatibility staff with the stuff that Google requires.  And then the step after that is you're actually going to do business with Google and get  agreements on shipping the store and Gmail and now from the stuff that Google provides as well.  So there's a sort of it is spreading out into a lot of space but the I think Google's assumption  is they can keep it coherent by that business piece that's on the on the top layer of what  constitutes a fully realized Android with Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that'll affect brand I think to some extent.  The one device I saw a release on you know that's all CES releases is Snowgoggles  with Android in them and Google Maps as a result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah actually we're going to show those on Reaches and Kelly on Tuesday.  You are?  I may not mention Android.  It's got a heads up display so the display is six feet in front of you and you see it's  got GPS it's got wind speed altimeter and all this stuff is on a heads up display and  yes a Google Map as you go down the slopes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right on cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah well that's you know it's interesting I mean how much of it is that it's free and how much of  it that it's I think free is really the key isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Free and standard to an extent that if it does develop at some point you can you can go along  with the ride.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah that's a good point yeah that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well it's free of encumbrance of contractual encumbrance not just money but  witness the issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes well even even Chumby.  It's free as in speech as well as free as in beer yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even Chumby is moved to Android I don't know if Chumby was Chumby was a Linux OS  in the Chumby device but they've made an Android version of the Chumby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it makes perfect sense you know it's like oh there's a platform here we can either like  write all our own drivers and do everything and then go and evangelize developers or we can say  here's a here's a you know here's a fairly well designed platform that lets you build apps that  will run on this thing and we just have to write a few device drivers and plug into that and that's  you know the sort of effort of software development is so much lower to do that that that that makes  a lot of sense for everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think you're soon going to see what you see at Kickstarter which is a company I love that  enables people to get enough money to get started and make something I just bought my  third thing from Kickstarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was it out of curiosity you want to tell us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I bought the the little holder for my iPhone so that I can put it into a  tripod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh neat so this is a company that says we'll manufacture it if we get enough people who say  we'll buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right right right and you get certain benefits for that device which is in my bag if I'll pull  it out in the commercial break if you wanted it right away and donated more they would have  turned it off off a 3D printer and you would have gotten it first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh cool.  Yeah that by the way that was another I was really pleased to see MakerBot and Brie Pettis  at CES which is just the strangest experience to see a wooden device a thing maker at CES.  So great.  Isn't that great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Brie made me a little box out of that out of a MakerBot and I was just absolutely  amazed and it's right on it's on my desk right over here like I just I just love it.  So cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I got split strap that was the latest one which is the problem I have with with  laptop bags and such is that the strap is never good and this one's designed differently and  they look into it and so they've got straps for cameras and bags and even a sling and what the  heck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This really reinvents how a company can can bring a product to market I just love it.  It does it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So now go into the idea of adding in things like Android adding in technology to this  and imagine how someone can find out whether there's demand for the product  underwrite the cost with no capital need use others platforms for the technology use others  platforms for the manufacturing distribution and reduce the risk to not and you know I think  there's a lot of opportunity here to really get if I were if I were Google I'd set up some kind of  some investment fund or contest or something for hardware to use Android in new and cool and  creative ways at a place like Kickstarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah you need well and this is what Microsoft the lesson of Microsoft in the 90s was if you have a  solid stable platform that people could develop for it really spurs innovation and maybe that was  one of the lessons of CES.  Microsoft was there but they said we're going to make Windows on arm Intel was there but they  went huh.  I mean this was I mean of course CES has never been a wind tell show but boy you just feel the  guard changing you just really feel the guard changing it is not Microsoft and Intel anymore  and all the innovation is happening on portable and a lot of it is powered by Android if not  iOS.  What do you what do you got Jeff is that your this is the glyph.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh yeah I saw that right very simple little thing and so the camera goes you know the watch  that was not going to work well it will kind of work but I have I have my stupid case on it  antenna case thing yeah right but then it becomes a right and I think this was 20 bucks.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Quick Kickstarter is like the place for iPod accessories I actually bought the lunatic  watch holder for the iPod Nano which I do not own I'm actually going to buy an iPod Nano.  I'm sorry I missed it I missed the time yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well now but wait a minute because Griffin and everybody else is now making iPod Nano watch  holders Griffin actually they made a slap watch you know about those there there's a smart metal  in there so you slap it around your wrist it fits one size fits anybody because you slap it around

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  your wrist it fits and it oh no I haven't seen this and does it does it activate the watch screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  when you do that well the screen is the default screen on the Nano so when you press the on button  the watch screen pops up I've been wearing my Nano as a watch for some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just see and I'm waiting for Kickstarter for the Kickstarter guy to manufacture my

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  he raised a million dollars yeah yeah wow that is impressive it's it's it's it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it's the first Kickstarter project I think that broke a million the reason I got into

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  covering technology is because it's so it's changing and ever changing everything so fast  it's so fun but but you still it's still there's a certain gradual feeling to it except once in a  while and something like Kickstarter and you go this is going to change everything forever yeah  you know I mean doesn't world just the world just changed you know I was I was on Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  taking this through and this is going way afield but that's what I do that's why I specialize in  you know if you look at a company like GM that really had a century that was it and you wonder  whether and people are debating you know will Facebook be forever well probably not neither  Google you know what do they have maybe at most a generation maybe 20 years tech companies have a  much shorter cycle don't exactly you know how long did Microsoft have at the top IBM and then  right or they have to utterly morph themselves into something else IBM became a service company  Google's trying to become a mobile company Amazon's becoming a service company Facebook's  trying to become the phone company if you believe some people which is JP's great great uh uh  as a ranga swami yeah and so you wonder whether there's this idea of kind of a pop-up company  that you you go to a different life cycle like a VC fund that you you raise the money you make  the product and then you kind of exit that's all you need huh well I think that quite a few people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  have actually done that I think so too I think it's a new way you're not living forever you could  be the guy buying the 45 million dollar yacht by the way Larry Page's 45 million dollar yacht when  you look at the pictures it's quite prosaic yeah it's not I mean I thought for 45 million you'd get  something you know like uh arab oil chic kind of but no it just looks like a sort of known for living  fairly normally it looks like a normal just like you know it's got you know normal yacht it's normal  it's like when you go to Hurst castle if you've ever gone to Hurst castle and of course the most  insane thing ever built you know it's a castle in the middle of southern California and uh which  William Randolph Hurst built with his millions and uh you go and you look at the table and and and  and this is a long table that people like Charlie Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. ate at and there's  ketchup at every spot there's a bottle of Heinz ketchup it's like that the rich are just like you  and me the great Gatsby was wrong uh let's take a break we're gonna come back with your  pics just a little bit also I have a a little musical interlude including vovozele's no don't  run away it's good but first I really I promise but first a word from Squarespace.com the secret  behind exceptional websites Squarespace is what we use for our inside twit blog so many of my  friends now are using Squarespace in fact it was really amazing when uh when Alex Lindsay told me  that he loves Squarespace so much and he uses it all the time that he went to a restaurant the other  day they didn't have a website and before he left the restaurant he had gone to Squarespace sign up  for a free account and created a site for the restaurant and said here it is guys if you want  it you really ought to have a website all you have to do go to Squarespace.com slash twig click the  green button you don't need a credit card you don't need anything just the name of your site  a password an email address for password recovery and a captcha to keep robots out and you'll be  designing a site thing is you don't need to know any html or css because Squarespace has 50 plus  actually 60 plus great designer styles that you can make your own with drag and drop they've got  they use Ajax it's such a slick way the software is so cool but but this is software plus hosting  it's everything you need for your next site you can move your existing site over easily enough  because it supports all the major apis including movable type wordpress type ad and blogger by the  way that imports not just the content and pictures but all the comments everything all the links work  so literally in 10 minutes you could set up a new site on Squarespace.com with all of the content  of your old site then go to the iphone and ipad for the great Squarespace application that lets  you post manage delete spam and see incredible statistics the stats package is so good on  Squarespace.com I want you to try it out absolutely free Squarespace.com slash twig if you decide to  buy and it starts at twelve dollars a month that's hosting plus the software automatic updates and  all of that you'll get 10% off when you use the offer code twig not just for the first month or  the first year but for the life of your site Squarespace.com slash twig it's a secret behind  exceptional websites okay so they've named the google orchestra they do this every year right  yeah youtube orchestra I'm sorry youtube youtube orchestra what is the deal people submit their  auditions and now they've selected 101 people from 30 countries to go to the Sydney Opera House  to perform in March as the youtube symphony orchestra

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  applebaum otherwise known on twitter as io error he was staying out of the country for a  while because he was on the secret summons that twitter then revealed and now what do you think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of that because by the way I have subpoenaed twitter uh because we received a death threat  and I went to the police and had him subpoenaed and I have to tell you I don't know if it's such  a good idea that twitter would tell the guy who issued a death threat oh by the way we revealed  your identity to leo it just might speed up his you know what I'm saying that's a good point  so it's not always a good thing now twitter did notify uh they had to go and get the order

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  unsealed the feds went after twitter to find out about certain accounts not supposedly the content  of them but who they're talking to though which is creepy from following yeah who's following  whom that's creepy I don't like that and so what so what if I follow jason is a joey nassange I do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well you know what I did immediately I clicked follow on all of these accounts including the  wiki leagues the assange everything because you know what we need to all do that we need to all  say okay is it illegal to follow him all right I'm going to follow him so applebaum came back in uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  two days ago into seattle and he was questioned not arrested but questioned there for half an hour  here's the interesting thing for our audience I think he was not neither carrying a phone nor  computer they wanted his phone they wanted his computer didn't have one don't have it all you  had was a thumb drive with the declaration of independence encoded in it right on dude  and they couldn't they couldn't decode it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and so you had to tell him well it says okay I'll give you the first sentence when in the course of  human events see if you can get from there yeah in some plain text these were really interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  kind of cloud questions of whether or not if you're going abroad or if you're somebody like him at  high risk you never carry a device with you you go borrow someone's as somebody said later in twitter  you uh you laptop surfs right and you use somebody else's machine and or you bring in a chrome machine  that has nothing stored on it and no way to do a back door into it oh that's an interesting maybe  there is a case for chrome os yeah it was very interesting I thought uh and so he's tweeted the  story on twitter uh fearing somewhat that uh this might affect his next trip to Canada in a week  but uh I think it's very important for our folks to be uh aware of this and to think about the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  implications including the one you just mentioned well I can vouch for the fact that the Canadian  authorities uh thanks to ACTA by the way will in fact confiscate laptops at will they say it's of  course to search for child porn oh look at the puppy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  she just came to join in here yeah I'm sure she I would not have guessed that as your dog

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would not sorry another one here wait wait show the tail does it have a puffy tail it's a poodle  I should say a full standard poodle it looks like yep puffy tail and now there's the white one

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  oh that's more like three actually the other one's hiding somewhere oh this one's a puppy so you do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the full grooming thing it looks like well Rosie does I don't but yes but they don't do the sort

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  all right well I'm going to follow io error and I guess we should just say everybody follow him  he's only got 7 000 followers uh let's show our support uh follow WikiLeaks as well last time

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jake went through customs they took all his devices anyway so it makes perfect sense for him not to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  not to carry anything that's right they're looking for they say we're looking for child  pornography or we're looking for they actually look for piracy by the way which is I think a  lot of what it is is they're doing the bidding of the record industry of all things but they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  not looking for weapons they're looking for contraband they're looking for information  and by the way the free thing that freaked me out was when he when he hit Seattle they knew that he

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  had tweeted right before oh they're watching yeah oh yeah yeah they're tracking him well I guess  Twitter is not safe anymore I thought nobody I thought the feds didn't know about the Twitter  let's take a break actually let's not take a break let's go right into our picks  of the week starting with Gina and her tip of the week which I just discovered when I went to our

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google Docs yeah if you go into Google Docs you'll get a little pop-up that says that you can upload  up to one gigabyte of video through Google Docs storage and you can upload all kinds of different  files to Google Docs that's been for a while but uh this new feature is that you can upload video  and then there's a built-in player so you can play back that video right inside Google Docs I  originally tweeted about this and said I think this is an odd feature considering that they  you know own YouTube does it support h.264 it does as a matter of fact WebM, MPEG-4, 3GP, H.264,  AVI, WMV, FLV I guess the Google Docs did not get the memo Google Docs didn't get the memo  but you can you can play back these videos inside Google Docs and you can share them with the same  mechanisms that you can share with Google Docs so I tweeted like this is a weird feature and I swear  the next day and my sister said to me hey that video you showed me when I was at your place like  can I can you send it to me somehow and it's something that I don't want to publish I just  want to send it to my sister and I said yes there is is a matter of fact so there's no is there a  size there must be a size one gigabyte oh that's a lot up to one gigabyte video yeah it's amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and this is on AppSphere domain as well this works this works or is this just on um public docs uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  apps as well if I go to my I'm looking at my apps right now yep does it make a lot of sense for  it does it does it's h.264 compliant it does support h.264 and Kevin made the point on twitter  too like this makes a lot of sense for a business or a small organization that wants to share video

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  oh gosh yeah I mean a gigabyte's a ton that's an hour or more I mean you know you shouldn't be

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  sending people hour-long videos anyway well it kind of saves YouTube money too because they don't store

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  stuff that's going to be watched once forever I know right this does email presumably this does

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  yeah Jeff your number of the week they first do a tip since Gina rejected but I'm so enamored of  this um android uh version of google translate now you can translate speech to speech let me  try this watch it will not work with Darren so I'm going to input text this is so cool I like to eat  apples

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  what what language is that and now and now I'll play it  yeah is that true is it right is it good yeah that does suspect ik is it colloquial

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  yeah wow well what's amazing to me is you can now have a conversation with someone right you can  talk into it and say this and it's it's star track it's the babble fish it's douglas

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's really cool I just okay so remember I said just a minute ago about you see this is going to  change this is going to change everything no I don't even want to do my tip you're you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  you're right about that because you know I'm at the point now where I use google translate of  course to translate my really bad German lazily but now I see something in Swedish or Portuguese  and I'm not scared of it it doesn't become this impenetrable wall anymore I can I can just look  at it and get interested fascinating all right you want a number of the week yeah 15 percent  of customers in the UK who complain versus via a social network expect an answer within 60 minutes  and do they get one is a question well that's the other question of course it's Britain so  of course they don't I'm sorry six percent want the answer in 10 minutes but I figure that's only  Arrington and Scoble 50 a day is good enough that's very British right uh Kevin we used to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  queueing yeah yeah yeah and very orderly queues unlike the French and bad service  a day's a day still seems fast to me but anyway that's good well you've really kind of you know  put the kibosh on my uh tool because you know your tool translates speech I was just going to show  the fact that the new google goggles will solve so to do puzzles this is so cool that is  pretty cool though you take a picture of a sudoku and it solves it brilliant marketing twist

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't have a really good way to get people to download goggles anybody got a newspaper or the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  video the video does a demo oh I could do the video I mean that's pretty cool you know and when  I want to wow people I show them it's on the iphone I show them um that that that program  what's it called that uh that will look at a sign word lens and translate it yes we live in amazing  freaking times indeed I mean I was talking to somebody uh at CES who's a old friend Richard  Hart he uh he used to be on CNET and uh he had a show called the next step for a long time on  television and now he teaches tv to the academy of art in San Francisco and I said I must be great  well you could you can confirm this to me actually Jeff I said it must be great to to be teaching  tv to these smart kids who really understand technology he said you know what the younger  generation does not understand technology the same way we do they because they grew up with it  they have no curiosity about it they have no wonder and they don't know from file systems or

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  command lines or anything I said that's that's that's that's curmudgeonly talk no I think that  that the beauty is they don't need to know that stuff and they can pick up the we're going to  we're going to almost require every student we already require every student in my journalism  school to have a mac laptop we're going to strongly recommend that they buy a an iphone or an android  device because this is the always in case journalism device at the video on these true  it is the future of journalism isn't it right and I can I can capture anything I can do all kinds of  things they've got to know this so know that the beauty is the tools are so simple you don't have

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to geek out alex lindsey uh who uh is was you know does pixel core is one of our contributors  was going to report on ces instead he took his iphone and shot iphone videos about 40 different  products the quality is superb it's right there in the field he uploads it from the field I mean it's  it is transformational credible yeah it changes everything this changes everything
