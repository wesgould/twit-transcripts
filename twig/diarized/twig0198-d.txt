Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We grew together in person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We drove up together in a small car so we already had our group.  One of my knees tired.  And it's Jeff Jarvis from Buzz Machine.  And we were in the room during that long keynote.  Do we have a final time on the keynote?  It started smack dab on time at 9 a.m.  Yeah, the countdown.  There was a countdown on the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Developers flipping out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, with developers, you want to be precise.  Yeah, absolutely.  You want time square for developers.  And it went to sometime after noon. So it was at least three plus hours.  It was at least three hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was longer than the director's cut of The Hobbit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was supposed to be over at 11.40. It was over about 12.30.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, and I don't mind because I have to say, well, before I say, you say, what overall impression, not specifics, but just overall impression.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How about you, Jeff?  Well, I have to be a little careful of being in the mood of the place.  But still, I thought it was impressive. I'm not a developer, but I can see a lot was aimed at developers.  That's happy. So it wasn't a hardware wowee zowee.  I was really struck at the end with Larry, I think, was trying to take on the mantle of Steve Jobs.  It was quite a moment at the end with Larry.  It was.  Standing up in front of the world, going behind him. It was a little patch there.  But fine, it was beautiful. And he's talking about the future.  It was a little Pattonesque, to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, it was.  You soldiers, you boys, you're going out there.  OK, your overall thoughts about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot more subdued than last year, but enough developer goodies to get me kind of really happy and excited.  I mean...  It is a developer conference after all.  It was truly a developer conference this year.  It wasn't a circus like last year. There weren't skydivers. There weren't tons of new products.  They didn't ply us with tons of new gadgets.  I wasn't really upset about that.  It was slow and steady, but really nice upgrades and new tools and things that we'll talk about, both for consumers and developers.  But kicked off with the developer goodies, which made me really happy.  And the energy in the room was good.  And then went into consumer, I think, features that we're getting today that are impressive and I like.  Subdued, but slow and steady.  And I'm generally happy with it.  I thought it was a good...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot of attention always paid to the giveaways at Google I.O.  Last year they gave away about $1,200 worth of goodies, including a Google Q, a Chrome Box...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nexus Q, Chrome Box, and the Nexus 7.  Nexus 7?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This time only one item, but an item worth more than all three of them combined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true. But an item that's out, right? That's been out, right?  I mean, it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they said they want to encourage developers to use it and to build to Chrome. I think that's why they're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The developers were happy.  By the way, we should say there were about 5,000 developers in the room.  We estimate maybe 500 perhaps, maybe more.  Plus other kinds of partners.  And then in the front they called them I.O.ers.  And I think that they were Google employees.  This is what Apple always did.  They would make sure that there were Google employees in front.  Because those are the people who are going to applaud the loudest they're going to be seen on screen.  I don't know if that's the case, but they were reserved seats for the first maybe 10 rows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then there's an entire section for Scoble's ego.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Robert Scoble made an appearance of all things at the end, Larry Page.  This has happened before in other keynotes, but it's not common.  But I think because Larry hasn't been heard from in a long time due to his lung paralysis.  Steve Jobs?  No, no, no, no. Larry.  Larry, I don't think so. No, Steve has.  I can remember times when the Apple executive team has gone on stage after keynote and answered questions.  But those were for press only. This is a little different.  There's, you know, letting developers ask questions can be a little risky.  But Larry, I don't think it's he hadn't spoken and seen in public for a long time.  You were trying to say about his throat that he talked about yesterday.  He had a paralyzed vocal cords from youth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One from youth and then one recently.  And that's why he was silent and silent about it for so long.  And as Mr. Publicness, I was very happy that he said that he was he wished he'd reveal this sooner.  He's gotten all kinds of good advice and support and help other people.  And as you said, we were sitting there in the audience.  Folks like us who have insurance can afford to do these kinds of things are the ones who probably are the best in the best positions to be public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought it was a let's let's start with the end.  And because that's not a feature, we're not talking about features.  We're talking about really more of a kind of a vibe of Gestalt of the whole thing.  I was really kind of moved by Larry going up there.  I felt like he wanted to come on stage not only to be seen, but also to set the stage for to kind of clarify something about what Google was up to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that he had to give this was the vision speech.  All appropriate to be behind the earth and all of space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But standing in front of a rotating globe.  Now, on the screen at home, you only saw a little bit.  But in this in the in the theater, it was it was patented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was the dark side of the earth, right?  With the lights on, it was beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can see the sun, the sun just barely behind an image from the new Google Maps.  It was just magnificent.  And so he stands there and what he's really doing is giving the the vision statement for Google and why they're excited, why they come in and build things.  And, you know, as somebody who gets smashed all the time for being an optimist, what I like to is he said that there was enough of a couple of ways, enough of being negative.  You don't build out of the negative.  You build out of the positive.  You build out of trying to do that.  Then he also went on talking about other companies that were a little negative.  But that was a different question.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And one thing I would point out, you know, he was slammed Oracle saying they're only in it for the money.  Yeah, money's more important than collaboration and cooperation.  He by extension slammed Microsoft and other companies who have sued them in the past.  But he also I think he he felt like he said it's not a zero sum game.  It's not a you win, we lose.  We win, you lose game.  And there's plenty for all of us.  And and he and he really said that what we're about here is not making money.  We're about changing the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he's trying to rally the troops.  He's saying there's tons of opportunities that you should try to build something that hasn't been built already, that we look back to the olden days when people spent all their time, you know, hunting for food and trying to feed their family.  We don't have to do that anymore.  Now we can free up free ourselves up to do new things.  And I think that was his really his message to developers.  Try to do something new, be ambitious, you know, that that whole kind of, you know, the moonshot kind of, you know, urging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He said we're not we're not thinking about what other companies are doing.  We're thinking about what we can do to to advance the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. And he said there's enough for everybody.  Interoperability is important to Google.  He said that that Google, you know, put put out an invitation to be interoperable for with I am recently and Microsoft only recently kind of took them up on that.  And it was important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to point out and I don't want to be negative because he said let's be positive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's a difference between constructive criticism and negativity.  And I can't lose our critical faculties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think there's many a CEO of a company to say, hey, stop being so critical of our stuff.  Just like it. But I also feel like this.  It's I'd love to hear and I would have loved to have asked a question of Scoble.  Give me a moment. I would have.  I would have loved to.  We'll explain that.  I would have loved to have asked him.  But Larry, for instance, when you turned off support for Microsoft's EAS, when you told Microsoft to pull the YouTube application from Windows Mobile, when you did, he's done things like that.  Did you not see that as any competitive?  Was that not a competitive move?  I mean, do you pay a little attention to what the other guys are doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's a fair point.  It's a fair point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've limited as a matter of fact, they've limited third party Jabber invitations.  I thought they fixed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They fixed it.  Yeah, I thought that they did fix it.  I thought that was a temporary security chat room.  You should correct me if I'm if I'm wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other thing is,  certainly made moves that have been questionable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I don't think that I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like what he was saying.  And I think maybe it's a pipe.  Maybe it's a, you know, aspirational quote.  But I like the idea of let's not fight among each other.  Let's compete if we're going to compete to try to all make the best stuff we can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think he's also talking about government regulation and such.  He was kind of saying we should be able to experiment.  I mean, somebody somebody said, you want to know, I believe he said, let's make an island.  We can experiment with things which is us.  We all say fine, experiment with us.  We're happy to let's play with this stuff.  And that kind of negativity of, oh, my God, what can go wrong?  It's terrible.  You know, but back to the competitive point, I think that the risk today is that  we were starting to count up all the companies that maybe died today.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, call it Sherlocking because Apple very famously when they put Spotlight Search into the Macintosh  killed a very beautiful little search company, a little search program called Sherlock.  Right. So there were quite a few apps that might be partially Sherlocked as of today.  Four Square, Yelp, Pandora, Pandora.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, Siri is committing.  And.  God damn it.  He's trying to get my pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did it again.  You know, I'm not drunk enough.  Let me. Yeah, both Tina and I have now spilled.  We're going to use tippy cups from now on.  Did I get your pixel? I'm so sorry.  So I for one, I think it's a if Larry wants to say, let's this is an aspirational vision.  Let's let's kind of forego the negativity.  You made a point. It's also about government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's also about just saying, oh, my God, what could go wrong?  What could go wrong? Let's try these things.  And, you know, in his own story about his health, he kind of realized he said that he thought this should be private.  That's where he started as a default.  But he saw the value of being public about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It felt very personal.  He started out talking about his dad and how his dad took them on a trip and supported technology and science.  It was very interested in those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He said computer science is a marketing problem.  And then if and then if we're going to move ahead, we have to get more young people interested in science and technology.  And he told that story about his dad, how his dad brought him to a robotics conference and argued with the guy at the door to get him in, even though he was underage.  And that how basically putting a call out to developers saying be that person who argues for that young person to to to get in.  And even during the Q&A, which, of course, piqued my interest, someone asked about women in technology and he said, you have we have to start when they're girls, when they're young and and and and that we need to do that because we need more people solving these problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really have to say, I mean, when you see somebody who's been ill and he was kind of his voice was a little shaking.  So he sounded ill. It's inevitable to say that.  Look at the echo of Steve Jobs here.  But and people were starting to compare him at least in our chat room to Steve Jobs.  But I think this is not while Steve was a visionary, a lot of what Steve was about was marketing product.  Yes, I don't get the feeling that Larry was really gone on about that.  No, he wasn't pushing Google products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He wasn't trying to do that. He came out after the whole hype.  He wasn't the hype master.  He did review what we did.  But I think no, I think what what he saw was, I think, a need for vision in our industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's a cup that I can't Leo's sippy cup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bring the bib over to play.  Yeah, yeah.  So I think that there's a need for vision in this industry.  And if he tries to take that up, he's been too silent, not just of his voice, but but to we don't hear from Larry.  Larry's Larry's hidden behind the scenes.  I think this was a coming out party that was very important because he is really smart.  He does have a vision.  The company Google, we've said this on the show for the last year and a half, has been taking on his vision.  He's been killing the things that don't work.  He's been you see the sense coming out.  You know, when you see the fact that Gina and I look at each other during the thing and the fact that he knows what your good pictures are is the same as doing what good pictures are overall for maps.  I mean, you start to see the spread.  That was amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The picture thing was amazing.  He he also did.  There were a few things that I thought I also found interesting.  No, no, no, Sergey Brin, who was very, very prominent last year at the keynote.  And he said, Larry said somebody asked him about Google Glass and how many they were going to produce.  He said, I don't know.  That's Sergey's thing.  Right.  Sergey does Adams.  He says, Sergey does Adams.  I do bits.  And I really felt like it was interesting.  It was Larry's company, wasn't it?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And we didn't see many Adams.  There were no giveaways.  We didn't see a new Nexus phone.  There was no hardware announcement.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They said, oh, there's a new Samsung, but you can buy it in a play store in a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, there was a literally one minute announcement.  Yep.  And that was it.  Yep.  I think this is Larry continued his step forward in putting his mark on this company and kind of setting a tone for the company about where he wants it to be.  And I, for one, am excited.  And I was watching the chat room very interestingly with great interest is we're talking about.  I think a lot of people look at Google and say, oh, no, but there was so much cynicism in the chat room.  You see, they're just gathering more information, just trying to find out more about us.  They're trying to spy on us.  They're trying to track us.  And I think that we're rapidly seeing a gulf, a division between people, people like, say, Steve Gibson, who say, you know, you got to protect your privacy.  I don't want anybody to know this stuff.  And those of us may be more like you, Jeff, who say, I want to give you my information because I got some real value out of this.  Google now is a great example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I so regretted not jumping up and get in front of those microphones as fast as Robert Scoble did, because if I if I could ask Larry and took me some time to think about if I could ask him anything, the question would be why should users trust Google with their data?  That's the question.  Why should we trust you?  Tell me.  Because what he's done is.  I wish you'd asked me.  Yeah, I wish you had.  That's what, you know.  That's the question.  Yeah, that's the question.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's two answers.  There's two paths to the answer.  The first half they've answered is because we're giving you value in return.  Yes.  They answer that in space.  Yeah, that's that's the next part of it is they've got to clearly be a protector.  Now, he was asked about a little bit of that, a kind of security question more.  But Google has to become it goes to do no evil.  Don't be evil.  It goes to saying that this we must trust Google or Google is is screwed.  And so are we.  I think he knows that.  I mean, I think that that he's got to say it more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he's got he's got to find the ways to say more than say it.  He's got to do it.  Exactly.  He's got to demonstrate this.  I think Google is an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What would be what would be an example of a way that Google could clearly demonstrate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the transparency report is a step in the direction of saying, look, we know  we know a lot about you.  We also know the governments want to know what we know about you.  And look how we fight for you.  Except they don't.  Right.  They so they need to step up a little bit more there.  They're being transparent, but they really also need to block more government requests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes.  And that's the thing is we see and obviously I'm a Google fanboy, but I've been most critical  of them when they came to their devil's deal with Verizon over neutrality.  And then today in the music thing that we'll talk about, the fact that they're charging  120 bucks a year for their music service means to me that Hollywood there was there were  just before they've sucked up to Verizon and telcos.  Now they were sucking up to Hollywood.  Well, I see that with YouTube, too.  There's very much sucking up to Hollywood.  So that's a question of whom do we trust in that?  Right.  Do they fight for us or not?  They've got to demonstrate they are.  They've got to give up some business because they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So do you believe, Larry, now that we're in it to change the world, to make the world  a better place, to make to facilitate this trans he began, you know, a hundred years  ago or a thousand years ago, we were all farmers or hunters.  Now, you know, we're doing other things and we want to facilitate that.  We want to use technology not for itself, but to let you live a better life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you think that's contrast him with Zuckerberg.  And I think that Larry's test is easier.  Zuck says it's better if we're all public.  And by the way, I'm going to make a fortune off making you public.  I don't think it's as cynical as that, but it's very easy to see him as cynical.  What Larry said today was the less time we spend doing crap, right.  The more time we can do good things in life.  I absolutely believe that he believes that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Live, love and learn.  Live, love and learn.  So cheesy.  That's what Vic said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what Vic said.  To live, love and learn.  And it was very cheesy, super cheesy.  It was.  It was.  But it was also like straight faced earnest.  Like we wouldn't have more time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Steve Jobs said Apple sits at the intersection of science and the arts or technology and  the arts.  And that's kind of what they're saying is we are not a technology company.  We're using technology to help you live, love and learn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're a knowledge company, technology and knowledge company.  Yeah.  And Facebook thinks it's a technology and sociology company.  And Twitter, I don't know what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like we're seeing the beginnings of a new Google.  As we were walking out we ran into Brad Fitzpatrick who is a big part of Google Plus, right.  Oh no, Bradley Horowitz.  Bradley Horowitz.  I'm sorry.  Fitzpatrick has taken out.  Bradley Horowitz was there.  And one of the things I said to him, and I was curious if he would agree with this, is  it feels to me as if Google has been building this foundation for 10 years, disparate parts,  that to those of us on the outside we maybe didn't see how they all fit together.  But I feel like we're starting to see, when we start looking at these new applications,  I think you'll agree, the outlines of the edifice.  And this is, I think, where Google is going to have a huge head start.  Because as soon as Apple or another company says Maps and starts to do it, they realize,  but we haven't been doing this for five years and Google has.  And while we weren't paying attention, Google was building this foundation in so many areas.  So many areas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  So even mobile fits into the structure.  Mobile means that we know about you locally, we serve you relevance, blah, blah, blah,  blah, blah.  And the other thing that really struck me today was it's still a search company.  The excitement, I'm sorry, who's the head of search?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nice man.  Amit Singhal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Singhal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, he was even probably the most, even more than Vic.  He was the most gushy about, you know, I got to build Star Trek Search.  Very personal.  Showing his three-year-old picture.  But what it was also saying was this is very much a search company.  We are moving to the next generation of search.  You ain't seen nothing from us yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Search, what was the phrase that he used?  Search his old hat.  It was something.  End of search as we know it.  End of search as we know it.  Yeah.  Wow.  For a company that is a search company, that's a big statement.  Yep.  Effin Dunn in our chat room said Google Education Play for Education is very important too.  We are going to talk about Google Plus, Play for Education, the new maps, the new mobile.  There's a lot of new stuff to talk about.  New developer tools.  And developer tools.  Gina will talk about that too.  IntelliJ, whatever the hell that is in just a moment.  You're watching this week in Google, the post Google I.O. conversation, and really a fascinating Google I.O. for all its length.  And you know, when Larry started answering questions, that was another, I don't know, half hour, 45 minutes.  And Robert Scobel leaps to the front, the first to ask a question.  We figured he must have seen the microphone and actually camped out there the entire keynote.  That's the way he thinks.  To be the first in line.  But I think this was, there was absolutely a message throughout this whole Google I.O.  And that was, I think we're seeing Google coming, it was a coming out part.  Yes it was.  For the, for the Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was truly Larry's company now.  Yep.  And we're starting to see his vision now.  And that's the message to the world I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll talk more in just a little bit about Google with Jeff Jarvis, Gina Tripani.  Thank you for being here on this week in Google.  Our show today brought to you by Shutterstock.com.  Man, Shutterstock is a great place to get stock photos, illustrations, vectors, video clips.  There's so many things to like about Shutterstock.  First of all, 20 million high quality stock photos there.  And many, many more all the time.  So it's always growing, it's always new.  Where's the number?  I think they wrote it down here.  How many new images?  10,000 a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  10,000 a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're good.  Look at that.  She scanned right there.  I know some stuff.  Shutterstock too.  Every day 10,000 new images.  The thing I like is the search.  This is a very sophisticated search tool.  It's not just a keyword search.  You could search for emotions.  You could search for gender.  You could even drill down by color.  This spectrum wheel they have, the spectrum tool, lets you sort images by color spectrum.  Not only a great way to find an image that you need to match your palette,  but also to get inspiration and ideas.  And that's where the light boxes come in.  Now you've got to create a Shutterstock account to use the light box,  but it's free to do so.  You don't need a credit card.  Once you do, you can start saving images to various light boxes.  A great way to work with a team to share ideas, to get inspiration.  It's even more beautiful.

You know, you said something about the Sherlocking of these apps.  I think what was interesting, unlike last year's keynote where there were little snide jabs at iOS  and everybody else, there were no real jabs until Leanne and Larry got a jab.  And again, about Oracle.  Well, the photos thing, too.  The photo resolution.  But you know, I thought, and the word didn't come up, but I thought all of this was a little jab at Facebook in a sense, especially the photo stuff.  Facebook now stores more photos than anybody else.  They're the number one place people put photos.  And I think this is Google saying, if we're going to have Google Plus take off, we need to.  And it integrates through maps because they use the images in maps, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It integrates through your phone because the photos go up there straight off.  All my images are up there now?  It will store, it made a big deal of the story in full resolution rather than these smaller things.  Fifty gigabytes of full resolution.  So for posterity, you want this to go on.  I think one of the themes today was that things last.  The conversation is too ethereal online, right?  Twitter goes off into the ether.  Google Plus has kind of blogs doing what they sort of talked about in terms of conversation is lasting and your photo is lasting.  Google sees itself as a permanent part of your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So let's I've got my pixel fired up.  This is the new and I just logged into my Google Plus.  And here's the tour of the new Google Plus.  It says navigate around Google Plus.  Go here to visit your profile, manage photos, communities and more.  OK, we we know about that.  Bring conversations to life with Hangouts, new Hangouts, new Hangouts app on Android, by the way, which replaces talk as well as IOS.  Send messages, share photos and make video calls for free one on one or with a group of friends.  Now group video calling is free even on the phone, which is really interesting.  And then make your photos look better than ever.  As you mentioned, unbelievable new tools will show some of those new tools that can back up, organize and the enhanced tool.  We've seen enhanced tools before.  One click enhance.  I photo has it.  Casa has it.  Yeah, that's a little bit better.  This seems way better, like scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like Trey Radcliffe had a little influence on this.  I was expecting Trey to come out on stage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I was I totally was.  Yeah.  So let me let me go to Google the home on Google Plus.  And the new layout is very much a kind of Pinterest layout.  You remember I complained about the empty gutter on the right of Google Plus and the misuse of space.  I make sure I'm showing this optimally.  I guess that's it.  So now there's oh, there we go.  There we go.  It finally filled up the screen.  So there's no waste of space anymore.  Right.  This is a Pinterest kind of thing.  Look at the size of that image of Pete Cashmore.  Is he happy?  Is he's happy about that success magazine he's featured in.  They mentioned if there's a picture of Paris, it'll know that or the Eiffel Tower.  It'll know it's the Eiffel Tower.  And you can how would I do that?  Let's see if I can find a picture.  Search for Eiffel Tower.  Did I know it seemed like I could do that from within a picture.  Right.  I could just recognize it.  I could just.  Yeah.  Anyway, what do you think of the new layout?  I like this.  To me, this is this is a much better use of the space.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's clean.  It's got that Google Now that card that card look.  It looks responsive and that the columns kind of fill in.  I have to say that I was pretty used to a single stream.  And now my eye is going horizontally versus just straight down.  But they talked about this.  The new design was it was about depth.  So you can click on one of those cards and I'll flip around.  And each one of the updates gets auto hash tagged as well.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's kind of weird because when I talked to the folks at delicious when they started delicious, they said, no, you don't want to do that.  You want hashtags to be humanly entered there because then you get it better than me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what is what are the choices?  There's this automatic hashtag.  Automatic hashtag.  There's the flip around.  It's you know, it's so strange.  We're running this on these Chromebook pixels.  And for for Gina and me using the stock Chromebook, it says your browser is not compatible over that was maps.  But I saw I was having trouble with mine as well on that.  So OK, I'm puzzled.  So what did you do, Chad?  You click the down arrow in the upper right hand corner.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.  So when I.  Yeah.  So you can hit the down arrow.  If there is something like this, Droid Life, let me manually zoom in on it here.  OK.  They have suggested a tab, so they have Android because they put tags on it.  And so if I click the Android tab, it will flip over and that one card becomes an Android search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so now, now at the bottom, there are these little dots which show you how many articles you can flip through, which you flip through at the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got to point out this would be a lot better with touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It would.  It would.  And in fact, if I could flip this over, my initial reaction was to use the two finger scroll, which is available on a Mac, to try to get to the next app or next card, I should say.  Isn't that interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's what I'm not getting.  So that's Washington Square.  I thought I get that.  I don't get the.  You don't get it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was that was really cool.  Right.  They showed somebody.  I know, but I click on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't get the tags.  I get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Well, maybe it didn't recognize Washington Square Park.  You ever think of that?  I think this is nice.  I like this.  And I think it's just showed up in my feed.  Somebody's taking pictures.  Who are you and what are you doing?  I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't even think I'm following this person, but it might show up in your feed.  This is because this is the Google the twig community.  So OK, good.  So I am correct.  Correct.  But now this does not.  Google cannot pull any information from here.  So there's no hashtag for me to click on and flip this card over.  So you can stump it, but there's a lot of like this.  This one is is hashtagged beer.  So and now we're going to see a lot of beer.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  I think this is pretty novel.  I think this is interesting show when you post.  Actually, I guess I could do that.  If I post here, doesn't this slide?  Yeah.  OK, well, let me let me go back.  That's schmancy schmancy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a little day Jackson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'll cancel that.  But here's share what's new.  So I click that.  And it kind of expands out.  I think this is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The killing thing that I thought that Vicks said from my perspective is he said that social  streams are flat like newspapers.  Ouch.  Right.  But this is a magazine layout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not only that, but but then the fact that there's depth behind each post potentially

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that there's smarts on top of it.  There's a categorization on top of it and that the conversations keep going.  Now, you're not stuck.  If you hate this, you can go back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I understand to the content.  I like this.  And given the success Pinterest has had, I think this is probably the right way to do  it.  Right.  Is this Web 3.0?  Sharpie says he's calling it Web 3.0.  It's pretty interactive web.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's very pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is all HTML 5.  Right.  Yeah, there's a lot of flashy flippy, you know, moving around.  But I don't want to go too far here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it does.  It also reminds me a little bit of Facebook's latest redesign.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The new speed.  Yep.  It's less common.  It's less common.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The new speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's less cluttered.  Facebook has all sorts of little gadgets and doodads and ads all over that page that are  missing on this page.  I think this is pretty nice.  One more sort of funny thing.  There aren't any ads on there, are there?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Do you see any ads?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't see any ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If there are, they are so cleverly hidden, I can't tell.  Well, you know, what's funny is once you get to the end of your card, it relates hashtags.  Oh.  And you were interested through Glass, you might be interested in.  Right.  It's almost funny because you could find some comedy bits.  SNL.  SNL is a hashtag.  Love that.  Now then, that also brings up the point of what if you post content and then it gets  unwillingly tagged to some other sort of...  Sorry.  Welcome to the World Wide Web.  And that might be some...  You can't control how people are.  A feature you don't want.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In terms of, you know...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  People make associations.  Or hashtag something like that.  People make associations, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So Google's just doing what people do.  You can't control that.  So that's the new Google+.  Here's why there's no ads.  They'll probably never be ads on this.  This is all about getting information and gathering signals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They will charge companies, I think, to create their better positions within Google+.  Their own positions.  Maybe the brands.  The brands have their own brand positions and they'll be charged something for something,  I think, there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But ultimately what they're getting people to do is put stuff into Google.  To use Google.  It's data.  It's data.  There's value to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google's getting value out of it.  They're learning more about you and your interests.  They're knowing who you're connected with and what they're interested in.  They're learning more about content and what content has value to people.  Right.  And that all has value to Google if you're set up to do that.  And I would argue with newspapers that they've got to start to learn people as people, as  individuals, not masses.  But they're nowhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good one.  She's looking at pictures of her baby.  I'm sorry.  Well, no, I was testing auto enhance.  Yeah, really?  Oh, yeah.  So the tools now are already in there for the photo tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  There was an hands button in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  You all can't see my screen.  It's subtle.  Yeah, it's subtle.  It's a great picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that is adorable.  Yeah, yeah.  Cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you.  Thank you.  I said something to Bradley Horowitz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I said, you know what?  I really want Bradley Horowitz.  You know how Facebook Home takes over the Android page?  I would love to see Google Plus have a little bit more prominence on the front page.  He, okay, he raised his eyebrow.  He looked at the other guy and winked.  Pretty much gave me the thumbs up.  And he said, we'll make it better.  Yeah, you said I want to have a Facebook Home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And he said, I'll make it better.  Yeah.  Better than that.  So they're thinking along those lines.  And of course they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It makes perfect sense.  It's not really a revelation.  Here's my dog.  Here's my daughter.  Oh, 16 years old and just as cute.  That's the scariest moment.  Given the keys to the car.  That is a scary moment.  All right.  So there's Google Plus.  Are you disappointed there's no right API?  No.  You're not.  No, this is good.  At this point, I don't even want them to give us the right API because you want to live in.  Yeah, because you get people posting their tweets automatically.  Yeah.  You don't want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you're right.  And now it's to the point where I'm just convinced that they need to, in order to expand Google  Plus, they need to do things like comment embedding and letting people interact in other places.  I don't think that that should be about getting people just dumping their content.  That's a common embedding is a great thing.  Yeah, I think that's a great thing.  Yeah.  So I feel like at this point, I've given up on the right API.  They obviously are not going to do it.  No.  You said that.  You said that a few months ago.  And I was just holding on.  It'll trash it up.  It'll trash it up.  And really, you know, we've all said, I mean, Google Plus is a great place for tech news,  right?  And friends aren't quite on it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we were talking in the car.  Is that that's the only, you know, I, when people think I hate Google Plus, and I actually  don't, I love Google Plus, but nobody, but nobody I want to see my posts.  Family isn't my audience isn't my son.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jake today said, wow, this really is impressive.  But his friends aren't there.  Now I, I have think I have made new friends here.  Sure.  Right.  Lauren Weinstein, I think is an amazing guy in Google Plus.  I'm looking at now Tim O'Reilly is here a lot.  There are people I know who are here a lot.  And so I like that.  I wish you guys were here more.  Well, I'm going to spend more time here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw someone on Twitter said that they had to write a script that would upload all their  photos to Google Plus, auto enhance them, and then post them out to Instagram, Facebook  and Twitter where people would actually see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, let's talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because one of the things, what if they did a reverse API in that way that I think they  should actually use more promotion of Google Plus posts on the likes of Twitter and Facebook  a big plus on it so that I can then draw people to Google Plus.  I would like that people were like tweet posts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Write it on Google Plus and then tweet it.  Twitter wouldn't like it.  But certainly there are ways to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are plugins that will do that.  Right?  Yeah.  Vic showed all his pictures from his trip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Vic really, he kind of gave us a window into his life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So many companies, even Google, solve problems that don't exist.  I think Glass is an example of solving a problem that doesn't exist.  But there is a problem that really exists with anybody that takes pictures, which is  there's too many and you don't have time to go through them.  I still have pictures from my trip to Australia a year ago that I haven't gone through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You haven't gone through and picked out the best ones, right?  So Google has automated that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it credible that they could do a good job of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I got to see this to believe it.  But they use certain criteria to sort out the highlights of your best pictures, which  are pretty obvious, right?  Blurry pictures they tossed out.  Yeah, it's out of focus.  Over exposed.  They do facial recognition.  Are people smiling?  That was interesting.  Which is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A good picture doesn't mean people are smiling, by the way.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they're making a presumption about that.  They also, they were as subtle as they could possibly be to say they're involving facial  recognition as well.  Because if, you know, your own family, they're going to emphasize that.  Because they know who your family is or are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then it just creates this great page with your highlight pictures.  And if you want to see the rest of them, they're still there.  They're not gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you can see the rest, right?  So they weed out duplicates.  That's awesome.  They also recognize landmarks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Recognize landmarks.  So that's your photo of the Eiffel Towers if we needed one more, but fine.  I think it's very important.  And I tweeted at the time, I said if Kodak weren't already dead, this would kill them.  You know, if you thought 10 years ago what your photo would be.  But it's aimed at Facebook.  This is aimed at Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because Facebook is the place people put their photos right now.  And they don't do anything this useful for them.  Plus, I have auto upload.  Facebook has auto upload as well, by the way, I might point out with their app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because that's the key, Leo.  Google sees itself as a service company.  Facebook doesn't.  Right?  So Google is trying to invent new services.  And that, by the way, is the ethos that Marissa takes away with her to Yahoo.  That's where an interesting war comes in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I've just gone on my photo page.  It says, what does that say?  All your photos.  I can barely read my screen.  Instantly organized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When you have a lot of photos, we'll start you off with a few of the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo has put his image on a monitor that's six feet away.  And he's old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm simulating Google Glass.  When you have a lot of photos, we'll start you off with a few of the best.  See photos from your...  So these are pictures that I took on the Nexus One and the Galax...  Look at the movement down there.  Low right.  HTC One.  And then there's the Zoe from the HTC One.  Oh, you did that.  Which means it was smart enough to preserve that.  Add new photos.  Yeah, blah, blah, blah.  So this is giving me a little tour.  Right, so highlights.  Getting an overview.  Exploring new futures.  So what's nice is it did pick pictures that I took from Google I.O.  That's what these are.  Decided which of the highlights are.  Some of these are with the HTC One.  Those are the Zoe's.  And that's why there's some movement in those.  But what I also like is it made bigger.  Actually, two of the better images that I took.  I hate to say it, but...  It also takes into account...  Actually are the two better pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it takes into account aesthetics as well.  Apparently it has better taste than I do.  Yeah, there's blurriness, duplicates, affinity, people who you know, landmarks.  But they also do aesthetics, which is like...  It'll try to recognize well-composed photos.  Like photos that human beings consider attractive for whatever reason.  And you'll notice that those two photos there at the top...  They are much more attractive.  ...are actually kind of artsy, you know, attractive photos.  Damn.  So those little animated gift deals, the Zoe's...  It will also do that, right?  If you take several photos of someone that are very similar...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is one of the things I...  The HTC One falls short in a number of ways.  Mostly because HTC oversensified it.  But the camera is spectacular.  And it does these...  And I usually do it by default.  Zoe's, which are three seconds, 20 images.  There's a movie plus 20 images.  And what I'm very pleased to see is that...  Google Plus got smart about the Zoe's.  Because it used to have 20 images.  And I don't know if it's...  I'm not sure what it's doing here.  But it's obviously figured out that those are...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it...  It's a GIF?  A GIF?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no.  It's a makes a movie and...  Now, that looks like a GIF, doesn't it?  Because the frame rate is very low.  That's you and Steven Levy, right?  Yeah, it's Jeff and Steven.  And there's a guy walking through the picture.  They should have really gotten rid of that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So highlights looks pretty good.  This is definitely something people would do.  Vic was saying, you come home from vacation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It also means you're going to take more pictures.  And taking more pictures, Google likes too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  More data is good.  Yeah, so Google's doing the work of curating.  And then there's auto enhance, which Vic showed us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So these are the auto...  Steven's saying these are the auto Google GIFs that I'm seeing.  But I think they are from the Zoe's.  So it's GIF-ifying a Zoe.  Google is getting the 20 images.  It's making a Zoe out of multiple images.  This is the best picture.  I should have highlighted this one.  I don't understand.  Wait a minute.  Enhance your photo.  Should I enhance this?  Sure.  Alright.  Share with the right people.  This is where you stole the tour.  So will it tag me?  Tag people for quicker share.  Oh, I have to tag you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's in more auto enhance.  Alright, let's see.  Which is strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  More auto enhance.  Alright, get ready ladies and gentlemen.  In three, auto enhance.  Center, enhance.  Center, enhance.  It's a little crisper.  No, it's still doing it.  Still working.  Back up a little bit.  And you can see the...  There it is.  Now it's done.  Infinitely better.  Lost wrinkles.  Oh yeah, look at that.  Boy, I've lost ten years.  My skin is smooth and soft.  Huh.  Alright.  And then I presume we can undo and so forth.  Cool.  And then of course I'd want to tag these.  It says enhanced.  That's nice.  It's showing me that it was enhanced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Showing that it did it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So to tag them, it doesn't...  Or do a recognition on you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I have to tag them by hand I think.  I mean that's one of the...  I'm sure they could.  Oh, you know they could.  One of the things that they...  They're recognizing landmarks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're recognizing...  And I could add this to an album.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they made the point that they're recognizing human faces and that they vignette them and  they soften skin and do red eye...  Red eye reduction is automatic.  Red eye reduction and they vignette photos to put the emphasis on faces.  So there's quite a bit of facial recognition going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is the highlights tab.  That's a new tab.  And then you can look at all photos, albums.  What's under more here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Auto backup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, your photos and posts.  This is great.  I have to say, this is pretty compelling given that I did not push a single button.  I just took these images.  I have Google plus auto upload turned on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, let's be clear, they're all private until you choose to share them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, none of these are public.  That's one of the reasons I'm not scrolling down any lower.  I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't show what's going on about the full level of the fold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have no idea what happened yesterday and I'm not sure...  You know my history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would you share one of the three of us, please?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Shall I share that?  Yeah, share that.  Well, let's see what that experience is like.  So I'm going to go back here.  I'm going to click the share button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Scroll up, I think.  Oh, there it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  Share this photo.  Of course, only on Google plus.  Is that the tagging?  Oh, that's who I know.  But I don't have to do that because I know who you are.  So if I put Gina plus Gina and then tab?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you just click on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Enter?  No, not enter.  Really?  Yeah.  Really?  Enter?  Plus Gina.  Let's do it again.  Plus Gina.  Plus Gina.  God damn it.  You didn't control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That might as plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry about all the profanity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now what?  Click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Enter, enter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Enter?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Plus Jeff.  See, the kids these days, you really know how to use that social networking thing.  And me at Google.  Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google.  Google.  Hi.  Hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh.  And now it added interesting added that, which is I think it always does that, doesn't it?  As your name.  Yeah, in fact, it requires that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You cannot take them out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you mention something, that person will see that you mentioned it.  Oh, I have to see the image.  This is nice.  Chad, can you I can't see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, hit control zero.  There we go.  There we go.  Because you I made it big.  Control plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we zoomed it in.  There we go.  Cool.  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a little data center is your dark room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was the line.  That was the company line.  Data center is dark room.  Our data center is your dark room.  And I can even have a little slideshow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we get that 15 gigabytes free storage, a full size.  Fifteen.  Fifteen.  Yeah, up from five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was 15.  I misunderstood.  Yeah, one is now actually they combined what Gmail I think yesterday.  Yeah, they combined a couple of accounts into one 15 one 15 flat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I want to scroll down as my son sitting in a bean bag.  We didn't really want to show that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, hey, hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Protect the private photos.  Protect the private photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It could have been a lot worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, back to Google+.  So that's all the new features at Google+.  That's the new Google Photos.  And there's the share.  That's nice.  You reshared.  I just did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's take a break.  Come back.  We're going to talk about maps.  There's Larry talking right there.  Harry McCracken's picture of Larry on stage.  There's nothing life threatening about his paralysis.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apparently at all.  It's just he got a virus or a cold when he was a kid.  He came back out of it.  And one vocal cord was partly paralyzed.  And then that happened again about a year and a half ago.  And that's what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In case you're just tuning in, we are running a little bit differently on the schedule because we just got back from Google I.O.  and our live coverage this morning, which will be on the Twitch specials feed any minute now.  Coming up, though, in about one hour, Douglas Rushkoff joins us on triangulation.  So that's going to be good.  So stick around for that.  Our show today brought to you by our friends at Two Cows.  Remember them?  The ultimate collection of Windows software.  Elliot Noss, who runs Two Cows, has decided that their job is to find businesses that are run crappily and fix them.  We talked about Ting, better cell phone service, Hover.com, perfect example.  Domain name management done the right way.  If you visit Hover.com slash twig, you'll get an idea of what I mean.  Hover believes that it's important that everybody take control of their online identity.  And the best way to do that is to have your domain name with your email going to your domain name.  And Hover takes all the hassle out of that.  Both registering, owning, managing your domains with smart, easy to use, friction free and powerful domain name management tools.  If you go to Hover.com slash twig, you'll see it's clean.  It's simple.  There's no upselling, no aggressive cross selling.  There's no extra payments hidden behind the scenes.  For instance, when you register a domain name at Hover, you get Who Is Privacy as part of the deal.  No upsell on that.  And by the way, you do want Who Is Privacy.  They offer all the big names.com, .net, .org, .tv, promo, .biz, country codes too, like .ca, .asia, .us, .uk.  Now a lot of times you go there and you search for fancypants.com.  What are you searching for?  Google.io.  Somebody's got it.  I don't know who would have that.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What?  It's available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's misspelled.  He missed an L.  Oh darn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chad's dyslexia serves us every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Snapping up domains.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Snapping up Google.io.  That'll be great someday.  Somebody will want Google.io.  So one thing, googlyeyes.com is available.  That's a premium domain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google.io.co.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google.io.me.  But you'll notice that a lot of times .net is available.  Just a little tip, if you're searching for .com, go for the .net.  That's pretty much just as recognizable nowadays as .com and just as good.  Hover has great support online and off.  When you call, you'll get no hold, no wait, no transfer phone support.  During regular business hours, you'll be speaking to a live person empowered and eager to help.  They've got great online help too with forums, tutorials, support documentation.  They've been around since 1994 and they're one of the largest domain name registrars in the world.  So you're dealing with a great company and a great service.  I highly recommend it.  I transferred all my domains over.  They did that for free, by the way.  You ask them.  Say Leo said you do the domain name concierge service.  Normally they charge $25.  Chadisdyslexic.com is available.  Just $15.  Chad, you should book that.  I just bought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What are you going to do with that?  Redirect it to my normal account?  Thanks, dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go.  What was I saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I moved all my domains over.  Now that's a $25 fee, but they've been waiving it.  So if you just say, hey, Leo on Twitter said that you wouldn't charge me to move my domain names over.  Now what they do, they do charge you per domain $10, but you get a whole nother year.  Plus the who has privacy and everything.  So it's a very good deal, I think.  Hover.com slash twig.  Give it a try today and use the offer code twig and you'll get 10% off your new domain name or names.  Register a whole bunch of them all at once.  Thank you, Hover, for your support on this week in Google.  All right.  So you're looking at your notes, Gina.  What else?  We kind of jumped ahead to Google Plus because I think that's important.  Let's talk about Google for Education.  This is a new play store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Play store initiative, yeah.  So it looked like you could buy, they said, you know, Google's, one of Google's missions is to get devices into the hands of kids in schools.  They said that they talked to teachers, Google talked to teachers and found out there's a big gap between what's possible and what's practical, was the words that they used.  Affordable is probably the right word.  Affordable is probably the right word.  But they did a quick demo.  It looks like you can easily purchase educational apps.  Well, first they're organizing the play store by grade.  So they had kindergarten through several grades.  And so you could go in and see curated collections of apps, which apparently are educational apps that are approved by teachers.  And then you can purchase like multiple licenses.  You can say, let me buy 30 copies of this app with one purchase order, say from an education system, install and I'll just get pushed down to all the students, students, tablets or devices, which look really, really, really cool.  I think it's the same with YouTube videos and books as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody pointed out in the chat room, this was Apple, traditionally Apple's realm.  Back in the day, right?  I guess they still do education.  I guess they do.  My experiences with our high school that my kids went to, actually Henry's a senior, he's still there.  And they have what they call a one-to-one program.  As you enter in the freshman year, you get a laptop.  And for years it's been a MacBook.  And last year there was no discount on MacBooks for the school.  They talked to a rep, the rep said, all right, gradually gave him a discount.  Now they're buying Lenovo Windows laptops.  And I know that was my reaction.  I know you're going to recommend Chromebooks and Pixels, yes.  Well, I'm thinking not Pixels, but maybe Chromebooks are the right way to go.  Chromebooks, they really are.  With tablets.  But here's the thing though.  One of the things the school worries about is kids playing games and chatting and doing stuff.  You can control it.  You can control it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We saw Sundar Pichai up there, now in charge of both Chrome and Android.  Not to go off here.  But really that's where it struck me, the education thing is where it struck me that it's a shame that  here you have Google pushing this Play Store for Android apps.  What if your class is all on Chromebooks?  You don't have that same, they ought to be able to go across platforms for apps too.  And they're not there yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a tension and they kind of took it head on.  They said, we've got two huge open platforms that we're working on right now.  And they kind of switched back between Chrome and Android.  And I agree, a Chromebook would be a perfect device for a student.  But what they demoed were Android play apps.  They're talking about tablets.  And the images they were showing were really cute kids holding tablets.  Right, exactly.  But you know, it was interesting in the end, during the Q&A, Larry Page did say,  developers should not have to think about what platform they're developing.  I think cross platforms are going to be a big story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody asked whether Chrome was the platform in the sense that Chrome also runs on Android.  But it's not there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that was someone from Mozilla.  Linux is the platform.  Linux is the platform, really, in Java.  Even though cross platform, and I saw this in the gaming part,  to the point where it's iOS included as well.  And I'm interested in that.  I think Google has a foothold in iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There were a lot of iOS releases.  Hangouts got released on iOS, right?  There was one slide where it was the Android robot and the Apple right up there together.  The cross platform-ness of Hangouts was a big part of the story.  You shouldn't have to think about what client your friends are using to send them a message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's a good story compared to Apple's messages, which is iOS only.  Absolutely.  BBM, which will someday be iOS and Android.  They've announced that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is part of Larry's interoperability speech that he gave in the end.  I mean, clearly this is something that's important to him that's on his mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Rightly so, because who cares?  Larry said you shouldn't have to think about what operating system you're using.  Why is that relevant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why should developers have to care about this?  Shouldn't care. Developers or users.  It's as primitive as hunting your food down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Slingshotting that rabbit.  I tried to hunt that cup of coffee, but it ran away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was faster than you.  It was faster than me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So education, I think, is a smart place for them to be.  We'll see what they do with that.  Let's talk about games.  They've got a game center that looks a lot like, in some ways, Apple's game center,  in some ways like Xbox Live.  The ability to run servers that start games that others can join.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The fact that you can across devices hold on to your status.  Yes, cloud-safe.  You gotta have cloud-safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Game state and player progression.  You can start on your phone and grab the leaderboards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's all game center stuff.  Apple game center stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's also for iOS and web and Android.  We heard iOS, web, and Android a couple of times.  Multiplayer.  Then the multi-screen game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was weird. The slot car game.  They lined up a variety of different screen sizes, one next to each other.  And the slot car track somehow magically went across all of the lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Each person playing on a device with their car.  So I had the green car, you had the red car.  But I don't see the use for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That seemed more like just about a demo.  But the demo fail was the multiplayer racing game.  Which popped and unfortunately,  Google Play Services has stopped dialogue box.  The dreaded FC, the forced close.  Which every Android developer knows and hates.  And the whole room just went like, ohhhhh.  But speaking of Google Play Services,  did you guys catch that Google Play Services  is actually going to get updated directly through Google?  So Google Play Services is the thing that developers  hook into to integrate Google services in their apps.  And they made the point to say,  Google updates this, we put it in the app,  and it's going to be updated.  So Google Play Services is the thing that developers  say, Google updates this, we push out directly to  everyone no matter what Android version.  So the version doesn't become a problem in that way.  So this is one way that they're  trying to take care of fragmentation.  They're pushing services out  to all installs versus...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Larry had, Sundar had an interview  in Wired  two days ago, and he acknowledged  that the fragmentation of Android  is a problem and they're dealing with it.  So they know this is an issue, so this is one way they can tackle part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the services layer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like cross-platform logins, cross-platform notifications,  or cross-device.  Cross-device notifications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you swipe a notification away on your phone,  you don't have to swipe it away on your tablet.  That's awesome. Sync notifications is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this also pushes the idea that they want you to  operate with multiple devices.  Once again, I will come back to, I have a Chrome device.  The same notification should be there,  the same ability should be here on the Chrome Pixel  as there are on my Android devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a multi-screen world. This is one of the first things  that Sundar said when he came out on stage.  I noticed that.  I thought, maybe we're going to get a watch.  But no, it was a Pebble watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everyone on stage, I saw some people in chat room,  they all had big watches on. Big square watches.  I leaned over to you and said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  what do you think, do you think, Wavy?  I thought maybe it would be the one more thing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  But, it's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see, what else?  There's so many. 900 million Android activations  in 2013.  Is that a big number?  He said there's still, what is it, 6 billion to go?  But you have Facebook,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  supposedly at a billion.  900 million Android devices.  900 million Android devices now.  Pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So next year is going to be the 1 billion.  Next year it will be blown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  48 billion app installs, 2.5 in the last month alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But, here's the big problem.  And my son Jake and I were talking about this  on email as the thing was going on.  The number of apps  is a huge problem. There's no discovery structure.  And I go in  and I don't play games.  And it's going to be nothing but games.  And that doesn't work very well.  And the weird thing is that I think that they  tackled the discovery issue in music  before they're tackling it in apps.  So it will now try to  be very personalized to me  and recommend music to me and show me all kinds of  ways to get to music and show me lots of paths to it.  And they're not doing that in the app side,  which is very strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would be nice to say what  the IRC client or my friends using on Android.  Exactly. All the things that they're doing in music

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they should be doing in apps. And that's where you're  directly supporting the developers.  That's where you're going to support the quality of the ecosystem  by getting better apps to rise  and better apps to be found.  If I knew you were operating on an app  then that would matter to me.  Leo on the other hand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well I'm using this new Pixel. What do you think?  I really like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know you wanted the coffee to go that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, actually I like it.  Let's talk about, since you're a developer  and that was one of the things they showed.  I liked it when they geeked out.  A new IDE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They led with this, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The first video was geeky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, the history of the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The history of the web, that was a great video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I get into that.  I'm a sucker for those videos. I do love those videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what is IntelliJ? Because that's what they're basing this on.  So I'm familiar with Eclipse, which is kind of  the free, easy to use, easy to download  Android development tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Eclipse is an integrated development environment  which means that there's built-in debugging and previews  and kind of wizzy wig tools.  Make it easy, not just a text editor.  A way to write code, an environment that's smart  about the code that you're writing.  So right now the standard for developing on Android  is Eclipse with an Android plugin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Eclipse is a free Java based open source app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, Eclipse is an open source IDE.  So it's cross platform.  It works very well for Java.  I believe it was built originally for Java  but there are plugins for Python and PHP.  I think it actually might be, you're right.  It was written in Java itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what's IntelliJ? Is that a commercial?  IntelliJ is also open source.  It's Apache.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is also an IDE similar to Eclipse.  But they announced today Android Studio  which will be based in IntelliJ  but it's a very smart kind of  Android development environment  on top of IntelliJ. So they're moving from  Eclipse to IntelliJ, which is a big move.  And I gotta tell you, I like Eclipse.  I grew up in Eclipse. But seeing some of what they  showed today on screen with IntelliJ  was really kind of exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Automatically filling in the resources.  So if you have a string, it will pull the string  from a resource file and show you what that's going to look like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. So when you do localization, every single string  even like the OK on a button  that's represented by a variable.  Because when you have localization  that variable can be depending on what your language.  So for example, if you reference that string in your code  it will show you what the string reads in your language.  Similarly, every single drawable  every single image resource  for example is also referenced through a variable.  So in this IntelliJ setup  those icons and those images  show up preview in line  with your code, which is really, really awesome.  The other thing I absolutely love, they had this  beautiful live preview layout.  So as you're composing your  app layouts on your screen, it will show you  what do we have? Six devices  up there. So the big screen, the tablet  7 inch layout, the 10 inch  the phone layout. So that way you can see  what's my layout going to look like on  these devices. And this live update. So if I say  hey, you know what, make this text  26 SP, you know, they  showed the demo, it would, you know, live  update as you type and it would  kind of show how big it would look.  And then you could see it in different languages. So all the German  translation wraps when this  text is a little larger. What do I want to do about that?  But that's extremely good.  This is a great development environment, gives you instant feedback  and shows you what you're doing as you're  doing it without having to compile and build  and launch the simulator. And so this is  what this is. I'm really excited about this.  This is, looks like available to download  right now and it's killing me that I can't install it on this  Pixel. And on the chat room they're reminding us about the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  alpha, beta rollouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, so this is, right, so this  is a bunch of improvements in the Android developer  console, which is the web based console like  that you upload your Android apps to.  There's several, several things  here. Beta testing and stage rollout.  So if I, so I build an Android app, I can  say, okay, I want to release a beta  to a limited number of users and consumers.  I can do that now. Which is out of either Google groups  or Google Plus circles. This is very similar  to what Test Flight does. I've used Test Flight  to do this. Talk about getting  Sherlocked. A couple, a couple of few other  things, things like  revenue graphs you can see. Right now  it's ridiculously difficult to see like  how much money did my app make on what day,  what's my total. So they're showing better, much  better revenue statistics. I actually use  an app called App Annie to do that now. So  App Annie also kind of got Sherlocked today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not cheap. It's $6.99  for commercial license. It's  $4.99 for standalone license. It's $199  for personal license.  Are they going to give this away?  It's open source. It's a project license.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting. So they've got to be giving away  for, they're not going to make developers.  There's a free community version. There is a free community version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's going to be available for. You can download that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The irony of course is you can't use it on the Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Well, that's what I'm saying. I would love to  install it here. But I can't use it on the Pixel. Because it's an app.  So it's available for Mac, Windows  and Linux. I could install Linux here

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and run it. I could see doing the app development  in the cloud, couldn't you?  As much as you could video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't debug in the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With Android development, it's Java.  So you want to have an IDE  that's aware of the classes and the functions  that are available and that can do debugging.  With Java, you compile to bytecode and then run.  It's not...  I got all that. I understood every syllable.  I'm not saying that it's not possible.  It would be a little complicated.  Last thing, app translation service  built right into the developer console.  So the developer console will say, hey, you know what?  You've got a bunch of Russian users. You've got a bunch of users  in Spain. But you're not translating.  Your app isn't translated to this language.  Do you want to buy a translation?  How much was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a marketplace. So that you can find multiple  translators, see how they're rated.  See what they charge. They're humans.  Remember how proud  Facebook was, rightfully so,  of putting in the tools that enabled the community  themselves to translate Facebook.  And now that structure is being extended  to be able to translate anything.  And also very important, one map they showed at the beginning of the screen  was in green  around the world, all the countries where  Android was less than 10%  penetration.  And it says large, large chunks of the world.  And so part of Google's bigger  master plan is to take over the world.  And this kind of translation.  And in a world where we care about diversity within a country  or worldwide diversity,  to be able to get more people in more languages  doing things together online is a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the map that Vick showed of  the green is  places where Android is less  than 10% penetration. So these are markets  like Greenland.  They're going to get Greenland, I think.  They can give away 10 phones. They got it.  That Google really could get into and could really help them.  Notice Chile is the one  country in South America that is a  big Android-using country.  In Central America there? Yeah, I guess it's Panama.  Sure. Australia.  But most of South America,  most of Central America, all of Africa,  and much of Asia,  including China, of course, and India.  So some big markets

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  out there. And translation is a pain.  It's a pain in the rear. I use a service right now called  Crowdin where people can submit translations  and other translators can approve or  offer suggestions. And it's not  easy. So this makes it  sound kind of not easy. It's a cost.  But you have a marketplace. And that's going to limit the cost

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and get more opportunities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what's unclear about  this Android Studios is  and Erin Newcomb was talking about this  in our coverage of the keynote. Is it a fork  of IntelliJ?  Is it  they can contribute back to IntelliJ?  What is the relationship  to the IntelliJ IDE?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got the feel. I thought that  it's a layer on top. So with Eclipse  is Eclipse plus an ADT  plugin. This is, Android Studio is a new  Android development environment based on IntelliJ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're working with JetBrains  apparently according to JBR in our chat room.  Actually in the JetBrains blog  they say  they talk a little bit about it.  So it's a fork.  It is free.  It's not a fork.  That's what I'm getting from the chat room.  So I just

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hope it's not a fork. That would make me sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not clear from the documentation here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. So  I think it's an important move  because the development tools have to look polished  and you're competing against iOS  where they have very polished free development tools.  Xcode is very  nice. It is.  Let's see. What else? Oh, I guess we should talk about  music. Let's take a break and when we do  we'll come back and talk about the music.  And the Google phone,  the pure experience that awaits you,  not what you thought it would be.  God, there were rumors like there was going to be this  flexible display.  The rumor mill went crazy.  Crazy on this one.  And it's nothing like that.  Our show today brought to you by  LegalZoom.com. If you've been waiting for  the perfect time to start your business,  you couldn't find a better time than right now, right?  But can I point out there are a few  steps you ought to take. Even I,  in my infinite ignorance,  formed an LLC when I started Twitter  and trademarked, thank goodness, the name  and the logo. And I did  all that for very little money. Not with a law firm,  but with LegalZoom.com.  to incorporate your business or form an LLC.  Just 99 bucks.  And it's a simple process. You walk through a questionnaire  on the website. You gotta  do it to protect yourself, to protect  yourself legally.  But you don't have to spend a lot of money  on a white shoe attorney. Is that still a phrase  people use? No.  Just pretend I didn't say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's okay, Gramps.  He's playing golf all the time.  I can't get a hold of him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When was the last time you saw white shoes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People don't wear them anymore. My mother tried to make me wear them.  She insisted that you had to wear  the blazer in the summer. You had to wear white shoes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and white box. After Memorial Day, before Labor Day,  but never. And I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  would not allow them on me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Got a white belt to go with it and maybe some baby blue pants.  She wanted that. She wanted that.  Look good. You'd be sharp looking.  Let's bring it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wanted to wear a Nehru jacket instead.  Yeah, you were a hipster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And an ascot.  It's not that there's anything wrong with that.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  Back to LegalZoom. Do you have a will?  You better make a will. If you've got kids,  you don't want the courts or the government  to decide what happens to your kids,  to your assets.  $69 for a LegalZoom will, or a living  trust. In the last 12 years,  over 2 million Americans have used  LegalZoom to do their paperwork.  You don't need an attorney.  LegalZoom is one of the nice things about LegalZoom.  Their legal plan now, they've negotiated  flat rate fees  with attorneys in most states. So if you have  questions or you need advice, you can actually  talk to an attorney.

LegalZoom.com  That was the one rumor that we  that came true was the  Spotify-like Google  Music Service. Subscription service.  We had heard that they'd made deals with two...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Who is that?  Just my shoes on a Google  search for hipsters. Those are sneakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what you got to search for is  white leather shoes. White leather  shoes? Not sneakers. Okay. Not sneakers.  We're talking patent leather.  Shiny white  shoes. White bucks. Search for white  B-U-C-S. I don't know if I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you may not want to search for that.  I don't know. Well don't show the screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  until you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, that was pretty good. I used to work with Pat Boone's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  granddaughter. There they are.  Really? Yeah. There you go. Yep. Yep.  You made those white bucks famous.  They're like hush puppies.  Only white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what are we going to be doing this week and  yesteryear? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I remember when you had to  dial a telephone. What did

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that mean, Grandpa?  What did that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  do? It's only a matter  of time before I'm too old to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the white bucks are quite charmed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I hear  you kids have something newer than the Victrola.  What do you listen to  music on now, Jeanor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's called Google Play Music  All Access.  So did they do deals with all the record companies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They had three. They had three syllables.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The big guys plus independents, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A uniquely Google approach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So one advantage they have  is that many of us have already uploaded all of our music  to Google or done the music recognition  thing. I've got 24,000

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  tracks. Yeah, me too. I just  sent the whole library up. And it's great because I could  stream it and all that. So that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is going to supplement if they don't, because  he kept saying millions. Now, most of these  services now are talking about about  eight million tracks, something like that. So Spotify  and Mog and RDO  and Rhapsody. They all have about eight million  tracks. So I  don't know if they've got them all or not.  But because you have your own music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have your own music and then you can listen to  stream music. It blends your own life story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Plus it also has a social end as well, obviously.  And this is a couple of times

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they've said this, a recommendation engine. They really  talked about recommendation. Recommendation  is something hard to do. It's never really worked right.  Netflix hasn't got it right, even though they've had the  Netflix prize for a while and really had some  smart people working on this. Amazon's recommendations  are terrible. They recommend  stuff you already bought.  So has Google  licked this? Because if somebody can figure out recommendations,  that's huge. I mean, it sounds like Pandora,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right? I mean, the Google's approach, right? Like, hey,  I want to listen to the song. I really like the song right now.  And then Google Music apparently, I haven't tried this yet,  assembles a playlist.  And then you can kind of flip through the playlist.  You can say, yeah, I don't want this and swipe it away.  So when I used to go to the record store,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there was a nice young guy.  You tell him, hey, I really like  that T-Rex band.  You got anything else like that?  And he'd say, oh, if you love T-Rex,  you'll love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because you only had 10 albums out of a week, so it wasn't hard to keep track of them.  But, and it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  worked, by the way.  Humans work. One thing Pandora does is they have this music genome project.  This is really important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, that turns out, from what I understand.  That's bogus.  That's bogus. They don't really do that.  Tim Westgren's just, well, they tried to make it work, it didn't work.  But here's the first business.  Here's a really fascinating thing, and the music announcement,  big deal. They have human  curators.  See, that's the way to do it. That's really,  pardon me, that's really important. That's not very googly.  No, it's not, because they don't do that in news, they don't do that in content.  So they have people who are going to curate  music collections.  We see that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple does that, they'll have like JZ  do my playlist and stuff like that.  Right, right. Celebrity curators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're basically hiring music editors.  What is my impression?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think, unfortunately, this is a hard thing to do computationally.  So maybe that's them saying  But again, I wish they...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, if there's anybody who can handle a problem that's hard to do computationally,  I think it's Google, right?  Right. In fact, that's why it's surprising to hear there's humans involved

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  at all. Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wish they'd put the same effort they put into music now.  Put it toward news, put it toward apps,  put it toward other areas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's available now, you can do it on the web,  music.... Is it music.google.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Music.google.com. It's  available now in the US,  launching today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When I launched the Google Music app,  it had automatically updated.  And it said, if you want to try it  free for 30 days due, it did  take my credit card number, it said,  as long as you try it free before  June, you'll get $7.99  a month after June 9.  We didn't say forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this is a Google Wallet purchase, it didn't actually end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a wallet purchase, so I'd actually press

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  purchase. Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Even with the trial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And in this case, Google sounded to me  like two things. One is  that it was playing up to Hollywood  and the industry, and second is they sounded  like a cable company.  $7.99 for now, and they don't tell you how long  before it's going to go up to $10, and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  before June 30. I don't really want to find myself

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  playing Google. You lie down with dogs, you're going to  get up with fleas, and I think that's the problem, is  they're now in the coffee?  Well, I'm not, yeah. I mean, you get  in bed with the music industry, suddenly  these things seem to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the companies where Google does not have  the ability to be independent, right now we've seen  two industries where this has happened.  One is telcos, two is music.  Three is  video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, YouTube. Yeah.  Every time that happens, Google gets

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  squirrely. Leo's running out of  batteries. I'm trying to find a head of battery

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in here somewhere. I don't know where it is.  Where the heck did I put it? I put it in here  somewhere.  Battery. So  the new phone,  there's no Motorola phone  we thought there might be. Yeah, no, no X phone.  There's no X. No Nex I,  no Nex I. The new phone from Google,  thank you sir, is  get ready for this, the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Samsung Galaxy S4. Samsung Galaxy  S4. But! There's something a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  bit different about it. It's pure.  No more touch whiz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they said check out the home screen, and it looked  like it was standard, fresh, and  everyone, and there was this like growing like  zzzzzzz in the audience.  Because there was a rumor they were going to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think this is great.  649 is a little pricey. It's at the  16 gigabyte version. Although I paid  for the unlocked 16 gigabyte  version, I paid $800.  And this one is LTE, right?  No LTE. This one does not  do LTE. This is  T-Mobile AT&T. And I  don't, is it LTE? Yeah,  it is. Chad wrote LTE, but I don't know. Are

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you right, Chad? Yeah, I wrote that down too. Bootloader  unlocked. It's the Nexus user experience.  On sale June 26.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  LTE on AT&T.  T-Mobile LTE is kind of  non-existent, but I guess you'd get it if you... It says in this  slide LTE support. LTE. Well, that's  different than what I got.  And that is good. I think the  Nexus user experience on  a premium phone. So should

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I replace my... I think  you'd like it. Should Gina replace her Galaxy?  I would want to, because this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  more cores.  It's a nice phone.  Great screen. 1920 by 1080.  Now that I can plug it in, I can show you.  Yeah, you  can hold it. Yeah, you can hold my phone,  lady.  Yeah, it's a bigger screen. As soon as it boots  up, I had to restart it because I took the battery out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, dig the little window, I gotta say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not part of the deal.  You have to buy that separately. And it's the back of the phone.  Yeah, they charge you through the nose for that.  Samsung sells the windowed  flip case  for, I think, 50 or 60 bucks,  which is ridiculous. It's a piece of plastic.  Thicker, heavier.  Battery life probably comparable,  not because of course you've got a much higher  resolution. I would suppose my Nexus. Yeah, you can't pull the  battery out of your Nexus, which, well, and you don't have LTE.  So probably it is a good upgrade for you.  Are you running yours on T-Mobile?  AT&T. AT&T? Well, then definitely  it's a good upgrade because you'd get

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  LTE. And I bought a Note 2  on eBay that I'll sell and that'll pay for most  of it. Well, and the Note 3's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  coming out and so forth. But I think the screen is  gorgeous. Let me watch  Google Plus for you.  It's a heck of a nice phone, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are there any of the Samsung  apps that you would wish if you had pure?  No, there's not a Samsung

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  app. I have to say, some of the Samsung  customizations I like. There are some  interesting things in the phone. I mean, the camera.  There's some interesting settings  capabilities. There's one feature.  It would be my pick if we were going to do picks this week.  It has a sound adapt  feature where you go, it actually does a hearing  test on you. You put your headphones  in. I know, that's crazy. You put your  headphones in, you plug it in, it says, can you hear this?  And it does it in each ear. Can you hear this? Can you hear  this? And you press yes or no. And then it makes  a curve based on what you were able to hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It says you are 49 years old. Yeah, I can tell how

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  old exactly how old you are. And then  it says, would you like me to apply the  adjustment to your calls,  to your music, to everything? And I gotta  tell you, it sounds a lot better to my old ears.  Fixes the loss of high end, cause I'm  older. Boosts the bass a little  bit. I'll show you my curve if you want to see it.  So that's something Samsung

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  added. It's pretty extreme, a lot of widgets.  Oh, it's crazy with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's so much stuff on this phone, it's  ridiculous. I didn't even know about this because  for the longest time, I didn't dig deep enough into the menu.  But if I scroll down into  Adapt Sound, you can see how different my curve is  from the optimal curve.  I guess we don't have that shot.  Too many ears. Yeah, yeah.  Headphones on.  Yeah, this you can see it rolls off the high end,  basically I only hear things in the  middle frequency there.  But they say after adaptation, that's what it's  going to sound like. It's going to be flat.  And they also ask what your dominant ear is.  So this is a Samsung feature that probably  Google won't add.  This is very hardware dependent, probably, right?  Well, no, but you get the  hardware. It's not hardware, it's just  TouchWiz. I would say Google's not going to add it  to... Well, it's the same hardware.  I guess they could.  But they're not going to because it's not the Nexus  experience. Yes.  Although I have to say that they did put  some of the camera features that you're seeing  in the late model phones and the new photo  features. Things like  they want you to share  your photosphere stuff  with Google Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The picture of melding  the pictures of everyone smiling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a feature that both Android  and the Galaxy S4 and  the HTC One have is the best  picture feature. I think stock  Android's not going to be the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a moment there where we're like,  this feels a little bit like the Samsung.  Lots of photo enhancements, camera  enhancements. Alright, let's talk about maps.  Let's cover maps. That's how they

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ended it. And I thought a good way to end it.  The new Google Maps in the browser  look different as well as  on the phone, right? The phone is really going to  enhance the mobile experience. So you'll be  able to get reviews  of the restaurants. You'll be able to  create your own custom maps, I guess. I'm not sure.  How is the mobile  different? Are you launching  it now as a download? I haven't  upgraded. Here's the new desktop  version of Google Maps. And the desktop, there's no menus

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  on the side. All the information is on the maps. Very  clean. I thought it was going to be awful, but it's not. If you search for  Starbucks, Leo,  you'll find, well, you got to go through this again.  But you'll find that... This is the little

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  tour. This is going to be a long  tour. And I couldn't click on it. Try searching  for Sushi Boston.  I don't want to. I don't really, I don't,  can I? Click VX. Let's get out of that.  And I'll search for Starbucks.  So this is the search box here. Or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  better. Italian restaurants maybe. Italian?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  Actually, there's a really cool feature. And I'm surprised  that they didn't use the voice.  It won't matter because you're talking to Google.  I know. Google's great for people like me and  what's his name?  Did you mean  Italian restaurants? Yes, I did. So now it's  filling in here. Places from top

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  reviewers or your circles?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What should I do? My top reviewers are my  circles. I bet you because I live in Petaluma,  nobody in my circles is...  Yeah, it's going to back away. It's like  oh, we got something. Well, maybe there's somewhere down there.  BCBC?  Actually, we like BCBC. There you go.  And then I could say top reviewers.  Let's search in there.  So,  this is nice. And they said we're going to a  five-star scale. Does that mean they're eliminating the  Zagat 30-point scale? I wasn't clear about  that. Zagat, of course, a purchase.  And you can,  in some of these cases,  I can just zoom right in. In fact, there's  the street view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then if the place has... Look how pretty this is.  Go look for Twit because it's going to go right inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Will it? That's what they said. I should look for  new media broadcast  entities.  What should I... Maybe just search for  Toy. We'll make it easy.  How does this pixel work? The same way

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  any damn computer does. How do you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  work? Not well, apparently.  W-I-T

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is right here.  Italian...  What if there were Italian Twits? Okay.  Now there it is. Now there's the street view.  I think  10 pictures.  See inside?  And then we just go whoop.  And it's really a pretty  display now. I mean, it's really a gorgeous  display.  I think they've done a very nice job here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are a couple of  API upgrades as well to maps.  Virtual fences around locations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Geofencing. I think that's so important  being able to do things like local news,  events at stadiums.  And walking into a store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they know your small...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, hear your grocery store, get some milk.  Activity recognition. So the  API can tell you whether or not you're walking,  biking, or driving. Which is awesome  for something like Glass, for example, which should basically  silence everything except Nav while you're driving.  For example.  And yeah,  what else? Oh, and they just said this  Fused Location Provider apparently getting location  for apps is faster and more accurate and  uses less of a power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is Fused? Is that a company?  Fused... Oh, it fuses multiple  location providers into one?  Offers in mobile.  You've got offers.  What I really liked is the Transit.  Apparently there's a standard for  Transit information.  But some cities are blocking this now because  they want to run their own Transit  app. They want you to buy the Philadelphia  Transit app or whatever it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That should be against the law. That is our  information. This is public data.  It's civic data.  You should get Code for America on that on the case  for any case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I have to say what Google's doing with Transit information  is showing you the buses, showing you  the timeline. Oh, this is fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It shows you the route versus driving.  What time it's going to be. And then it also  shows you for a different, for a given route  the whole schedule like some of the airline  stuff is now. If you want to go to  blank. That's fabulous. It's really quite  nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bill, they're architecting slowly.  You kind of feel these, the pieces all kind  of fitting in together. They're getting information  now from your photos, putting them in maps.  They're getting social signals,  putting them in recommendations.  You can start to see the  painting kind of fill  in. They also, the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  new Google Maps. Take that a little bit now  and zoom out all the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because that's when I'm going to see  the Earth. The Earth? All right.  It's, oh,  it says, thank you.  Thank you.  We've, we're excited.  Keep your eye for an invite. I already  got the invite.  Oh, I don't want  an invite.  If I just do maps.google.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  slash preview. Slash preview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see. I'm getting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  redirected now. You are?  Since I got, yeah, since I opted in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just your general maps is right?  Google.com. This is the image that  I don't want to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  see that. They're cookies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So let's do maps.  Pardon us, ladies and gentlemen,  while Leo Fumfer's around. Okay,  so this is the new one. So now how do I  zoom out? I pinch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think maybe minus, minus, minus. Yeah, look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pinching. Pinching  works. Let's see how much I can pinch.  I got the US.  I got that. You mean I can go beyond this?  No, I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Switch to satellite?  Yeah, that's it. Now,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  let's try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do not the Google Earth  solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do I need a plug-in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no minus. Maybe nevermind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nevermind. It looks so easy  when he did it.  All right, just one little pinch. That's all  it takes. Just a pinch between  cheek and gum. Not a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  thing. There's this new explore  UI as well. I like the explore thing.  Yeah. Yeah. So I can just kind of  click on pictures and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if you end up going to the Sistine Chapel,  they showed that they showed  pictures of being able to walk through the  Sistine Chapel all from  users' photos. Yeah, user.  And again, they now recognize the better photos  and they enhance them. As long as you made them  public. Well, that's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do I have to  get permission to do that? I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  wow. Oh, if you're inside a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. The 3D  is really spec. So this is  the Maps 3D rendering, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These, I think, are photos from consumers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think this is user generated. So this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  kind of like Microsoft's Photosynth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. This is so I'm going around  the... I'm in Florence.  And this  is the cathedral. This says

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this is light. 3D Earth View is not available  on your screen. Oh, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this is just pictures, photos.  Wow. Very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very nice. Very, very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What else?  We didn't talk about search. You're looking at the rundown.  Oh, now I think this is the most exciting thing, but we don't  have it yet, right? You have to be  participating in the beta. Yeah.  Search.  This spoken word search. Now, on  Glass, when you tap your temple, Gina,  you say... OK Glass.  And then you say OK Glass. Right.  Now, on Search, you say OK Google. OK Google.  Now, I don't know if that was a canned search.  It didn't feel like it. She was... that was mind-boggling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She looked... and she said  we're in a network hostile  environment. This might not work. And it worked  absolutely perfectly. So she was nervous.  This is Johanna Wright,  I believe, who's a, I guess, a product  director on Google Search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They had launched it that morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. She said they launched it  this morning. I don't know if this is going to work.  It completely worked. And what was cool... Not only... Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was amazing. She said, how tall do you have to  be to ride the giant dipper? Yeah.  I mean, this is... now we're seeing Hal  9000-style artificial intelligence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, right. And it was a series of queries.  Natural speech.  How do I get to Santa Cruz?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no. It was even more than that. She had searched for Santa Cruz.  And then she said, how do I get...  How far is it? How far is it from here?  It was... it had to know it and here.  It was contextual. It was contextual.  Holy cow. There was a big theory around context in Google.  Also in the maps,  there's some little driveway going in that has  no name. If you click on that place,  it will now fill in all the streets you need  to know to get there.  Context matters a lot. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When is my flight leave?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Brian in our chat room says, I'm in the  beta and it does work that well.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Brian, tell us how you get into the beta. What is it you signed up for?  Yeah, I didn't realize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we'll just have to sign up for it somehow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They mentioned, like,  if you opted into the Gmail field trial  where you let the Google search results  look at your Gmail inbox, it would see  your, for instance, flight reservation.  So when she said, when does my flight leave?  And it said, you gave on Wednesday the call.  It knew because it was looking at her Gmail inbox.  And people who have opted into the field trial.  Well, I'm in that field trial as well.  So we'll have to see. When I got to the airport, it said, hey,  your flight's leaving. She'll be leaving now. I got all that in Google  now because I was in that field trial.  So she was showing that. And there's a new voice action  for Google now, which is reminders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So is your... OK, this is going to terrify people.  Is your microphone always on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I believe that she tapped the microphone button.  No, no, no, no, that was on the phone.  On the computer, she just talked to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They call it Hotwords. Hotwords.  Hotwords was enabled. Hotwords will listen for certain words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, Google. OK, Google.  OK, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm waiting. I'm going to wait for  OK, Google, get me a date. Peacock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Peacock.  OK, Google.  Apparently, I'm not in that. Hotwords is not enabled.  We're sitting here. This is a Louis C.K. moment.  We're sitting here.  We're... we watched this movie  when I was a kid in the theaters  called 2001, A Space Odyssey.  And the guy's talking to the computer. He's talking back.  I kept waiting for that moment. It just happened, folks.  And we're sitting there going, well, I don't know  if I want that microphone to be in there.  Yeah, exactly. I don't know if I like that.  You're talking to the computer  and it's answering your questions.  It's amazing. It's amazing.  It's mind boggling. Yeah.  Mind boggling.  Nobody's happy.  Negativity is... we don't have the future through being negative.  And by the way, you know who shouldn't be happy is Apple  because this kicks Siri's butt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Siri did seppuku today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kicks Siri's butt.  I mean, seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, I'm sorry.  I think we saw Siri on 101  coming up here on the side of the road.  Roadkill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. I mean, I can't wait.  Do you want to be in that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. So I do think you have to tap the mic  to start your speaker search.  Much like with Glass, you have to tap the mic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, and the Macintosh has voice dictation  and you tap the function key twice to turn it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, to turn it on, right? Because the mic's not going to  always be open. That doesn't make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't need to be. Maybe that's a feature, though.  I wouldn't mind being able to turn that on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just having the mic on? Yeah, why not?  Well, speaking of, did you... I wanted to talk to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you notice these little cards around the...  Yeah, when we picked up our pixels, there were these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Google at I.O.  There are these cards with Arduino boards  mounted to them with sensors that...  And these cards say,  I'm collecting data here, which is really ironic  when you're at a Google conference.  Of course Google's collecting data.  All the time.  500 sensor modes and over 4,000 data streams  continuously monitoring temperature,  humidity, pressure, light,  air quality, motion, and both RF  and audio noise levels all through  the Moscone Sense center at I.O.  Because they want to get a sense of what areas  of the conference were most traffic,  were most popular.  So if you want to do it, you can write a simple app

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to find out which group has the most body heat.  You shared it on Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did. I shared it on Twitter.  Are you disappointed?  Well, I went to your Google+.  I thought, for sure.  So these were all throughout.  This is where we picked up our pixels, but they were all  throughout the Moscone.  What is that all about? What are they doing, you think?  This is Google Analytics for the conference.  This is Meetspace Google Analytics.  They're trying to see which areas of the conference  are people most interested in.  They're trying to get people into sensor data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They want to know which areas are most humid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which ones are noisier,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  whatever sensors exist, what could you possibly learn?  You could learn that more people are in this space.  Here it is, Chad. I don't know if you can see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm collecting data here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As Larry said, your phone is soon  going to have all those sensors.  Who knows what you could do with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It has a humidity sensor, it has temperature.  In fact, the GS4 will tell me what...  Does it give you your humidity track?  I don't have to wear a Fitbit anymore  because it's tracking my steps.  It also says there's a comfort  quotient.  It's very interesting what's going on.  I mean, this is basically the same  as that Arduino.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I just think it's funny. I think Google  just needs to have the sign everywhere. I'm collecting data here.  No matter what you...  And whenever you interact with Google, it should say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's my phone turning on.  I don't think it's charging from this.  It might need more draw than the Pixel can handle.  Oh, jeez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Charge is mine, just mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anything else?  There was so much. I don't want to miss anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're almost done here.  Yeah, we covered search, we covered maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That search thing was the thing that blew my mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the search thing was really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like we're  really watching the future on the floor.  It's very exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we're not doing numbers and tips?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's do numbers and tips.  I'm completely unprepared for that.  I'm completely unprepared as well.  Why don't you give us a number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google stock closed today at 907.07.  Up  19 points.  19 bucks. Wow.  Apple down 15 bucks.  Facebook down

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  24 cents.  I think that's pretty accurate.  We're afraid of Foursquare with the maps release?  Yeah, who got Sherlocked? Foursquare did, perhaps.  Maybe.  I like those guys so much.  Well, they moved away from gamification, which I think might have been a mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They call themselves the location layer of the net.  And this is very close to what Google is doing, right?  Did you see if you clicked on a venue,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  like if you clicked on a museum, it would light up other museums.  It would be a little bit more interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a little bit more interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a little bit more interesting.  It's a little bit more interesting.  If you clicked on a museum, it would light up other museums that were similar around the area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What restaurants your friends like.  What Foursquare friends do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like that content of my maps.  You could say, I really like this restaurant.  This is a place where, which is on my map.  And I measure things by how close it is to that.  It sounds awful, like Foursquare.  It sounds awful, like Foursquare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  What else?  Who else got Sherlocked today?  I think a lot of this is aimed square at Facebook.  It doesn't mean it's going to hurt Facebook.  But I think Google really wants to be an alternative for Facebook users.  But I think Google really wants to be an alternative for Facebook users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pandora. Did Pandora and Spotify get?  Or not? Pandora maybe.  What does Spotify cost?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  10 bucks.  That's the standard across the board.  Do you think that this will be enough to get people to move back to Google Plus?  Do you think that this will be enough to get people to move back to Google Plus?  Do you think this, you know, Google's not giving up on Google Plus.  Do you think this, you know, Google's not giving up on Google Plus.  And they continue to add features.  I think the new features was a great addition.  The new look is great.  It's not going to be, I don't think, anything itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that, for example, the fact that you can use Google Plus circles  for Gina's beta, she's going to want friends to be on there.  She's going to want friends to be on there.  So they can be beta testers on their apps.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's those little things that get you going there.  Plus isn't a product, it's the backbone of all the other products.  It's the social layer, right?  I think you have to not think about plus.google.com.  I think about plus as Android app reviews,  as, you know, gaming invitations,  as beta testing invitations, as comments on blogs or whatever.  And as people you actually enjoy talking with,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  which is what happens with me, I have a better conversation there.  I'm still frustrated as  hell, Google!  That, um...  We needed a Jeff Rant.  Yeah, that I cannot get my...  I had to sign on with a Google Gmail account.  That's what my plus account still is.  Everything else in my life is my apps account.  Right.  And a friend of mine, Rex Hammack, switched over.  And he lost a lot on the way.  He did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And, you know, Glass doesn't work with apps accounts either.  They got to solve that problem.  And they will. I saw it on the roadmap.  I just think it's a secondary rollout.  Yeah, it's a hashtag

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  rich geeks problem.  Waze. Waze might be a little bit of trouble.  Waze, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There were rumors that Google was looking to buy Waze for a billion dollars.  No, Facebook was looking to buy it.  Not Google, Facebook.  And now I understand why. Maybe this was a defensive move.  If they had known that Maps was going to start including not only traffic information...  Incidents, incidents, reports,  and reroute around incidents.  Reroute is an important thing. I got addicted to Waze.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had to go to a meeting a few weeks ago.  And boy, it was wondrous taking me around.  But if you're already using Google Navigation,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it does the same thing. You might be sensed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The thing I don't know is does Google also listen to signals on the phone  of where the traffic is? How is it getting where the traffic is data?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, maybe my memory is mistaken.  But I think  I saw him say you can also report incidents.  That there was a report feature.  Which is how Waze works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How Waze really works from watching your phone and how fast it's going on the road.  It knows the speed, but it wants you to report

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  if you see  road kill, a cop,  an accident.  All of that stuff. Google Navigation has never done that.  But I'm wondering if that's new.  And we learned that Larry Page is a burner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well that kind of  I mean, that harkens back to  when they founded Google. Didn't they put off a big release?  And like the first year, they were going to Burning Man?  Yeah.  We didn't talk about WebP and  H.2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is kind of an odd thing. They're pushing a new  and we've talked about this before, a new  photographic standard to replace PNG  primarily called WebP.  Facebook used it, but it's pissing people off  because only Chrome and  Opera can see it.  And worse, if you right click  and download the image, none of your photo  tools can open it because it's an unknown  codec.  Maybe, but PNG  is open. It's not like it's trying to replace  proprietary standard. There is an open standard  that has alpha channels.  There's 31%

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  less data.  Fine, but that doesn't really matter to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It matters maybe to Facebook, but you know what?  In the long run, if end users don't want it, it's not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it matters on your mobile phone, right?  It matters when you got a small pipe and a battery  that's dying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then this new  V9 video  standard, there's been a lot of back and forth on this.  I don't know how this is going to stand. It's ultimately going to come down  to if the folks at Firefox along with  the other browsers allow  a HTML5 style video tag  and then support that codec in it.  YouTube's going to support it.  If YouTube supports it, it's going to happen.  Well, only when they kill Flash.  They'll have to support it exclusively.  And then, that's  going to be interesting.  Somebody said you should also mention  the new Google  Hangouts. It's a new app.  We didn't really talk about that either.  It's group chatting. It's on the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's free. They didn't really make a big deal about it  being this unified messaging service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this what we thought Babel was going to be?  I think so. This is the Babel rollout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was no like, hey, this is going to replace  this or that. Although when you  install the app on your phone, it says  Hangouts replaces Talk. Right.  But it hasn't yet. So they haven't really  made a big deal about the fact that it's going to replace  all these other things.  But yeah, Hangouts is available on the web, which  you saw on EMPLOST earlier or you see  on Leo's screen now. And IOS and Android  today sync notifications,  which we talked about. But that  was it really. Oh, they talked about the history,  right? So it maintains  your history of conversations. Oh, that was cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's very, very important. Right.  Because the conversations don't just go off.  I do like that. I like that a lot too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I mean, I've got chat logs from years  ago, different programs. Who knows how to...  And they cannot connect to contacts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lisa and I use an app called Couple,  where we kind of can do romantic chat  back and forth. And that's permanent.  And this would effectively be that, where you'd have  an ongoing conversation.  You can go back, hey, what were we talking about six months ago or a year ago?  Right. With images and everything else.  I think that's great. Yeah, which is nice.  I think that there's some real value to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat room just said  we should probably mention that Google TV  wasn't mentioned. Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. Nor was the queue.  I guess... But you know,  there are announcements that happen in developer sessions,  right? Like not all the announcements happen in the keynote.  I mean, the major announcements happen. Well, in fact, somebody said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and I don't know, I haven't confirmed this, but somebody in the chat room said  they've announced that YouTube Live  is now available to any channel with  more than, I think, 1,000 subscribers,  which we would qualify for. So,  we'll investigate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought Aaron said that Google TV  made an announcement actually on their... ScooterX says

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google TV got an update today. I don't know how much  of an update.  And oh, what they didn't mention is Android 4.3.  No, not a word. Yeah, not a word.  In fact, they did say, and this is the only  word that the Galaxy S4  with pure Google experience will be  4.2. And that's next month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right. But you know what?  With all the cool tools that the developers got, I wasn't  even that disappointed. Oh my god.  I don't mind. I got a new ID. In fact,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  maybe it's even better. Let's stick with 4.2 for a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  longer. I think that they're just pushing developers. They want developers  to make their apps tabloid...  or tabloid. Tablet.  Whoa. Too much of a conker.  Tabloid ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tabloid ready, too. I don't know. I don't think they need  4.3. I mean, let's sit in 4.2 for a little while.  It's pretty good. Yeah. Yeah.  It's pretty darn good. It's pretty good.  And this will solve this issue of people feeling left behind  because, you know, frankly, this phone is  going to be behind and a lot of other phones are going to be behind  because the carriers don't want

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the updates. Just a few more. There was also  the Wallet Instant Buy  API where everybody's still trying to become  the Instant Buy. And they  listed 22 steps to do any  buy. They said that 98 or  97% of all shopping carts on mobile  are abandoned. Are abandoned, yeah.  Because it's too much of a pain. So they're trying to make that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  issue. Exactly. What? I have to fill something in?  Okay. See ya.  I believe that. Yeah, I believe that, too.  Totally believe that. All right. I think  you had a number. We don't have  anything. I think we're done. I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  better than you are. I did my homework.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You didn't do yours. Download all the new stuff. That's my tip.  That's good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you, everybody, for  putting up with us almost as long as the  keynote.  Normally, we do this week in  Google on Wednesdays, 1pm Pacific,  4pm Eastern Time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Three pixels in a row.  Wow. That's the last time that's going to happen.  Yeah, this is never going to happen again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is the  Easter egg you do?  Up, down, up, down, left, right, left, right. What is the one to make this  cycle? Or if you just shut it, it'll do it.  No, no, but it does a special thing.  So what is the  Nintendo code? Say that loud.  Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right.  And then possibly  B, A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, there you go.  It's a light show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now I like the pixel. Thanks for joining us.  We'll see you next time on twig.
