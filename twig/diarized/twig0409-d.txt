It's time for twig, This Week in Google.  Week two, I think of two, of Leo Laporte being out of the studio.  So I'm in his place.  Jason Howell, I'm super psyched to be back.  I have not one, but two amazing guests because both Jeff and Stacey are actually out this  week.  I had to get two amazing guests to fill their shoes.  First up, my longtime friend Ron Richards, all about Android and so many other things,  including a Twin Peaks podcast, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, my many, many podcasts.  It's great to be back.  I believe last time I was on This Week in Google, it was the same lineup.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, it was very close to this.  I think it was right around pixel time or hardware time.  Also joining us, Kevin Marks, KevinMarks.com.  How's it going, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's going great.  It's not, it's just turning sunset here in the UK.  I know.  Ready for an interesting chat about what's happened this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got to get used to this whole Kevin not coming to us from outside in the sunlight.  Like it's it's taking me a while to process this, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If we did a morning show, it could be in the sunlight.  But it's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll tell you what, I'm not doing a morning show.  It's too early.  I'm not down with that.  It's great to have you both here.  I actually missed last night's All About Android.  I'll get a chance to kind of talk about some of the Android Google news that you guys talked  about last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a bunch of interesting stuff and we missed you a lot.  And you can go to twit.tv slash AA to see us missing you real time.  Yeah, I believe at the top of the show I was pleased.  I was going, oh, Jason, why aren't you here?  But yeah, but I'm glad that we got we get our time in that now with this week in Google  and we can talk about Android.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why don't we kick it off with something that I feel like is pretty familiar.  Familiar space for all of us.  And I can't remember, Kevin, do you have a Pixel phone?  Are you Pixel right now?  I have a Pixel phone. Yes.  OK, so we're all so Kevin and I are the Pixel.  Ron, you're still hanging out with the with Robin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm still hanging out with Robin, although I have come to the conclusion that the moment  that the essential phone in that green color and that green and gold combination goes,  I'm going to put my money down. I'm going to do it.  So I'm getting ready to move on from the next with Robin, which, by the way,  I feel like it's not on the dock. I'm sorry.  I should have mentioned this earlier.  Did you see that Amazon is selling the next bit Robin for one hundred and seventeen dollars now?  I didn't see that. One hundred seventy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So would you recommend it for one hundred seventeen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, absolutely. It's a complete no brainer.  If you're looking for a phone, a low cost Android phone for anyone in your family  or just to get a test device or anything like that at one hundred and seventeen dollars from Amazon,  that you cannot beat that price. It's amazing.  So I don't know why it's doing it.  I don't know if it's a glitch or if it's a problem.  But literally right now on Amazon, it's both colors, both midnight and mint.  I don't know if they're just getting rid of dead stock as Razor is kind of, you know,  winding down the Robin for whatever is going to come next from next bit.  But but yeah, so it's a super cheap, good deal.  Search for it on Amazon. One hundred seventeen dollars.  Yeah, that would be my guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're probably trying to blow it out a little bit.  Because, I mean, are they coming out with another another Robin now that Razor owns it?  Or is it going in a completely different direction?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't know everything that I mean, everything that I've heard.  And I haven't heard much, to be honest.  Was that was that? Yeah, that Razor acquired next bit.  They were keeping it as an independent entity and that they were going to be.  Razor was going to get stuff from next bit.  Next bit would have the support to continue on.  So my guess is that there's got to be another device in the works  that they're going to unveil and that will be like the next one, you know, the next phone.  But they stopped selling the next bit Robin on their website.  They stopped selling anything on their website.  And all I've seen is the Robin being on sale at various places.  So, you know, I'm curious to see what the plan is.  But as far as I know, next bit is still an entity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, so then so then, Kevin,  you had said that you were a little bit out of out of out of tune with like the now news.  Did you catch the essential news from I think it was at this point a week or two ago?  Randy Rubin's kind of follow up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, yes, I did see that. Yeah, but that's kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The peak. I mean, is it something that you would consider kind of moving away from the pixel for?  I think this is the question that a lot of like Android fans are asking themselves.  Do you stick with the Google or do you go with the father of Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I had a sidekick.  So I've had Andrew Rubin design phones for what's that?  Twelve years now. More. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, 40 years now. That time. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  2003. So.  I'm. I'm not completely convinced yet.  I'm intrigued by it.  And I'm also intrigued by the the rumors about the operating system for the home and those pieces.  But that's all rumors. There's that paperwork at the moment.  So it's one of those wait and see things. Yes.  I do tend to buy the latest Google phone and keep that.  I don't and I don't change it that often.  Maybe maybe once every 80 months or so.  So when I moved to the UK, I got this one before that.  I had the the original Nexus 6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I don't know.  It's a pretty nice looking phone.  There was this news that I know you guys talked about last night and all about Android that I mean,  initially, when we heard about the Essential Phone, it was Andrew Rubin just basically saying,  we're going unlocked. We're selling it through our own channels.  We're not going to be in any carrier stores.  And now suddenly, Essential has an exclusivity deal with Sprint.  That basically means that you're going to be able to go into a Sprint store and find the Essential Phone.  It'll still work on all U.S. carriers.  So it's not like this phone only works on Sprint.  It's just Sprint, as far as we know, as of this point, is the only carrier store here in the U.S.  where you could actually go in and see it being displayed on the shelves and have the representatives point you in that direction.  And the Essential president, Niccolo de Masi, told USA Today, this is how the news broke.  We like to bet where we think the market is going as opposed to where the market was.  He says, I feel like we are a new brand and a new consumer electronics company and we are partnering with the network of the future.  Is Sprint the network of the future?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that was we talked about this last night on all about Android.  But Jason, I'm actually I want to turn around on you as the host.  What do you think of this announcement and this news?  Because I have thoughts and opinions, but I don't want to bias you with my thoughts.  So I want to hear when you when you heard this, what was your immediate kind of response?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, I mean, I think my knee jerk response was Sprint, really.  But that was my knee jerk response.  But I came around. I came around.  Honestly, I think any deal is good when you're talking about getting into a carrier store.  As a very US centric conversation, right, because the essential, you know, as I'm sure Andy Rubin has plans for this to be all over all over the world.  But in the US, I mean, in some ways you live and die by your availability and carrier stores for right or wrong.  And people outside of the US to a certain degree have a hard time sometimes understanding that.  But that's just the way it is here.  People will buy from their carrier, whether it's a good or a bad idea.  It's there. It's being presented to them.  It's being sold to them from a representative.  So that can actually really influence the sales numbers on your device.  So I think when you're Andy Rubin, you know, trying to guide your new brand to some sort of success, having a deal is better than not having a deal.  And it like expecting the general consumer to go online and to buy it unlocked and to be able to have that be your strategy for success over the next however many years.  I don't think that happens.  I think at some point you have to figure out your way into a carrier store if they can get into Sprint and they can prove that it has some sort of momentum.  They get Sprint's kind of money, you know, marketing muscle behind it.  Sprint's going to be pretty happy to have, you know, the father of Android's newest phone.  So they're probably going to at least make some sort of a big deal about it.  That could be really good for the essential brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So where I mean, that is one big after you, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, that is one big difference moving back to the UK is that here you can buy SIMs in any shop.  I mean, literally in a shop like shop, you buy your newspapers and sweets from that have a little rack of SIMs up there for a pound each and you buy them and then you can you can top them up there as well.  So pay as you go.  SIMs here.  We have phones.  You know, we have phone stores, too.  We have more carriers and there's much more interrupt.  Is there's much there's much less locked phones and so on.  You can do the full contract thing, but you can't just buy default.  You tend to get unlocked phones and the ability to swap SIMs in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the interesting thing about this, though, is that like my first gut reaction was like, oh, Sprint.  Oh, you know, and I actually I recounted this on all about Android last night as well, too, that I talked to two individual different people and they both had the same opinion, which is like, oh, essential is going to be on Sprint.  Too bad.  Nope.  You know, and just an immediate shutdown at the at the S word, as they said, it had Sprint being involved.  But then the news broke yesterday and I dropped it into the chat and the doc.  We want to show it Sprint's offering a free year of unlimited service if you if you switch to their service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, yeah, so I think that this is really interesting.  And that's I think Sprint's trying to breathe life into their brand.  They're doing whatever they can.  And they're like this offer of a free year is a very T-Mobile esque promotion.  Yeah.  Right.  Doesn't that seem very T-Mobile like seems like a T-Mobile's playbook.  Right.  And and I think that my guess is that they must have, you know, they must have dumped a bunch of money in an essentials pocket in order to get this exclusive.  I think that essential has to get into the carriers.  I mean, we've talked about this every time I talk about cell phones.  The great OnePlus is a great phone.  Grab somebody on the street.  They don't know how to get it.  No, you know, like we all know that you can go you can buy these phones unlocked.  It's not Kevin.  It's not like in the UK with Carphone Warehouse and places like that where you were, you know, there's a different there's a different approach to phones in other countries.  Here, the millions and millions of people go to the cell phone store and it's it could be Verizon.  It could be Sprint.  It could be T-Mobile's whatever is in their neighborhood and they buy whatever phone is there.  So if essential wants to break away from the OnePlus's and the next bits and all the other these other kind of, you know, in Huawei, like all these kind of, you know, one off hardware startups that are trying to break into the U.S.  market, they have to get with a carrier.  So if it's a Sprint, so be it.  Maybe maybe the sales are enough then that when the exclusive ends, then T-Mobile and AT&T want on board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  Yeah.  And if if yeah, I think you're exactly right.  Sprint Sprint needs eyeballs.  It needs it needs some sort of fire underneath their brand because they're clearly behind the other three at this point.  This is totally out of T-Mobile's playbook and T-Mobile continues to do these things and T-Mobile, you know, is is improving its network.  So it's it's it's able to kind of back it up at this point.  I think this was just this was an opportunity for Sprint to say, hey, here's what has the potential to be a very kind of eye catching, very I don't buzz worthy device.  And it doesn't have a carrier agreement.  We're willing to do what needs to happen in order to give, you know, bring them into our stores to make it comfortable for them.  We're there early on in, you know, maybe that ends up giving a little bit of extra cash to Sprint.  I just don't know how much how much power the essential brand will have out of the gate.  And I don't think it has very much out of the gate.  It has to build that. This is a way to start building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's got to start somewhere. Yeah, exactly.  And and with that Sprint offer, there are tons of restrictions and like not all phones and all this sort of stuff.  But still, even then, some people are going to get free service.  And so I think it's really interesting.  And hopefully people give essential a try through Sprint.  And like I'm rooting for essential just because I'm rooting for innovation in the space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you're you have said that you plan on getting an essential.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess, yes, I'm waiting.  I'm waiting desperately for for some date around the I think it's the was the ocean blue color.  What is it? Is that what it is?  We're not ocean blue or ocean green.  I figure out the color is.  But let's see, I'm going on the website.  Your standard black white.  I don't want the black or white.  No, I'm the thing that it's ocean depths.  That's what it's called now. Ocean depths.  It's the the green phone with the with the gold kind of bezel or, you know, kind of frame around it.  Yeah, like a black or white.  That's more after go after with the next bit, Robin, having such a unique looking phone.  I want to make sure I have unique looking phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, yeah, let's just hope that has that the essential has a little bit more longevity on the on the design,  like on the on the actual durability of the design than the next bit, Robin, because  your phone's showing a little bit of age.  I'm not going to lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've definitely I've definitely beaten that phone up.  I want to put the essentials titanium case to kind of give it the drop challenge myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So titanium is nice and all, but there's also a little bit of ceramic in there.  So just be careful.  Yeah, I'm definitely looking forward to the phone.  And I think it's an eye catching device.  And yeah, any any deals better than no deal.  I also really hope this sprint doesn't get in there.  And, you know, one of the things that Andy Rubin was really kind of very emphatic about was a very kind of  cruft free, true Android experience, no extra kind of bloat bloat apps on there.  And once you start making deals with carriers, at least in the Android space, not in the iOS space,  Apple's made the deals to where this doesn't happen, it seems like.  But on Android, it ends up meaning that you get a bunch of extra apps and icons that maybe you do or do not  want there. So hopefully that doesn't happen with this.  But I guess we'll see. So what I was originally going to talk about, but I'm happy we started with the  essential first is kind of this.  We suddenly have this influx of pixel news, which I'm a pixel XL owner.  Kevin, you've got the pixel.  Do you have the bigger one or the smaller one?  Oh, the big one. Yeah, the XL.  You've got the XL. So the rumors had been up until now, we've been hearing little bits here and there that  there were going to be not one, not two, but three pixel phones.  It was going to be the next generations of the ones we have and then a much larger one or something.  I got confused. It's all room.  It doesn't really matter, I suppose, when it's in the rumor world.  But apparently, excuse me, Android police is pretty darn confident that the successor to the pixel XL is  actually not happening.  The code name Musky.  I love their code names for these phones.  The fish is a fish, right?  All around fish. Yes, exactly.  In its place, they're going to opt for the even larger pixel than the XL.  So maybe the double XL or whatever they're going to end up calling it.  So and I don't I don't understand.  I don't get it. So the pixel XL right now, the 2016, which is what I have, is five point five inches.  So I would think that that would be a good kind of, you know, that's a decent size to go with the sequel.  From what I understand from this and correct me if I'm wrong, Ron, is that they're not going to be replacing this  size with a sequel.  They're going to be replacing this size with a larger one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that right? That's that's the rumor.  Yeah, that is going to be a larger version of it.  It's going to be a next gen.  And there's also a bunch of other rumors about the chipsets as well as that.  Did you see that hiring announcement?  Yeah. Oh, yeah.  Yeah. So lots of pixel rumors.  We're in the we're in the pre pixel announcement rumor mode.  Right. We are.  Yeah. We've done this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've done this enough, you know, a number of years now to the point to where we know the phases that we've gone into  and now that we're in summertime, it's like leading up to Google hardware time for the next couple of months.  Yeah, there's there's a number of things leaking around this.  One of them is that the successor will be larger, but that it'll be a narrower screen ratio.  So similar to what we see with the Samsung Galaxy S8, S8 plus.  It's a larger screen, but, you know, it's it's taller, essentially and narrower, less bezel, of course,  because everybody's going less bezel.  And that was a main that was a big complaint that people had about the pixel is that it was it was a it loved its bezels,  at least at the top and bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And what do I always say, Jason, the the future is bezel less.  Yes. I know how I feel about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bezel never bothered me.  I don't know, Kevin, you've lived with this device.  Did the top and bottom, bottom bezels ever ever stick out to you sorely?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I prefer I prefer it when I had one that was black around the edges rather than white.  But this was the one that they had in stock.  So I've got the one that's white.  But, you know, there's this there's dead space there.  Yeah, there's this.  I could I could use, you know, use a bit less space and be more useful.  But you still got the challenge of what you do with to do where you put the cameras when you when you shrink the bezel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. And I mean, if you take a look at what what essential did, they just notched out the display.  They were like, yeah, well, the the camera is going to go there.  We'll just put the display around it in a little U shape.  I think it looks a little weird. Ron, you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love it. I love it. I think it's great.  The weirder, the better. Yeah, exactly.  So that's going to that's going to work for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's up, Kevin?  As long as you like something you're trying to read isn't under it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, that's the yeah, yeah, that's one of the questions that I have.  Right. It's right up there in the notification pane.  Is that going to require some sort of custom like work?  You know what I mean? Like you can't you can't have your notifications  hidden because the notch is taken out and the OS doesn't recognize that.  I'm sure they'll have that figured out. But yeah, I got to imagine

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  there's more enough to figure that out for whatever reason.  But no, but I happen to I mean, like so if the essential phone hadn't come out,  I was eyeing the pixel as my next phone.  And I was in that mode of am I going to wait for the pixel to or not?  And maybe the pixel to get announced and get the pixel at a cheaper price.  That sort of thing.  But I got to admit from the few times I've seen the new Samsung Galaxy phone,  I like the longer, thinner style one.  I think the I think the fat big version is like I don't know.  It's something about the long Samsung phone that I think that's a good  aspect ratio for phones moving forward.  And yes, it's hard to get your thumb all the way down to the top.  But so you two hand it, you know, like it's not the end of the world.  But then usually I fall for the, you know, the five and a half inch kind of size,  the smaller size phone anyway.  So I doubt I'd even buy either of them.  So it doesn't really matter. But yeah, I do.  I do. I do like the longer version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would agree. I would agree, actually.  I would I would not be.  And we saw that from the six.  Like I had the the six before the six P, which was fatter than this one.  And I mean, you couldn't even you couldn't even reach across  to the other side of the screen with one hand.  It was definitely a two handed thing.  I've definitely noticed the slimmer they're getting,  even though they're they're increasing the screen size.  They're able to kind of maximize the size of the device around the display,  make it a little slimmer so it's easier to use with one hand,  but still have kind of the overall size and dimension of the phone.  One handable, you know what I mean?  It's bigger, but it's not because they're reducing the bezel.  So so there's that trend that is apparently potentially going to come  to this rumored pixel sequel.  Four gigs of RAM, octa core CPU,  which Snapdragon 835 is what's expected there.  And I mean, other things.  Let's see here. What was the next one?  LG is is apparently potentially going to be working on this device.  We with the previous with the pixel that we have now, it was made by Google.  But then when you really got under the hood, you realize it was made by Google  with HTC support.  And apparently that's going to go in the direction of LG this time  instead of HTC.  Very curious about that.  Why do you guys think that might be?  Any any many, I don't know, wild guesses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, historically, they flip back and forth between the different  builders, and they they the the.  Would you call it the Nexus was LG, wasn't it?  At least one of them was.  Oh, yeah, they had the Nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Nexus five was LG.  The legendary Nexus.  My favorite phone of all time. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. But but I mean, I think with the with the pixel universe,  you know, Google really wanted to make a statement and say, well, this  these aren't deals that we're making with anyone else.  These are our phones.  Like they want to put they want to pull an app and be like, we're doing this  all in house, which ties into other things that we're hearing.  This all kind of threads together.  Think about it again. What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Think about it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  Would that be a good thing or a bad thing at this point?  I don't even know.  No. So apparently Google hired Apple  veteran chip engineer Manu Galati after eight years with Apple.  Google has big plans to kind of move its chip production in-house.  Galati has 27 years of industry experience.  He worked 15 years at AMD and Broadcom before his eight years at Apple.  While he was at Apple, it coincided with the company switching to its own chips.  Using them in the iPad in 2010 with the A4 chip and beyond.  So big time kind of coordinator and engineer around Apple's  switch to in-house chip production.  Google's bringing him on.  They've also got a bunch of they've also got jobs posted  for other engineers on the SOC side of things.  And I mean, and what does that say for Google's hardware?  You know, when it's creating its chips, we heard  David Burke and other Google execs at Google I.O.  talking about hardware embedded in the phones that they create  that tie directly into things that aid in advanced artificial intelligence  and machine learning and all this kind of stuff.  What does it mean when Google brings all of this stuff in-house?  Is it good to have it all vertically integrated the way a company like Apple does?  Do you think that'd be a good thing for for Google's efforts, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they've they they do have some experience building hardware  custom hardware themselves, but they previously don't have a data center.  So they do have a bunch of chip experience in that realm.  But it's a very different realm than this.  So it would make sense to bring someone in who knows  this sort of low power domain much better.  I think I think they're they're big enough and they have enough money  to afford to do some of this.  So that doesn't make some sense.  It's the question of, you know, is this what they're going to  now they've been pulling back from lots of lots of the moonshot stuff?  Is this is this they're going to spend the money and become more like Apple  or something even like Microsoft?  Microsoft has been doing a little bit of this as well.  So it's it's it makes sense.  If you know, if you if you look at the sort of alphabet level,  it would make sense for them to do this as an alphabet company, I would think.  But if they're doing it as part of Google, that's interesting, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true. Yeah. What part of the umbrella  with this hardware or would it fall under Rick Osterloh?  Like is this firmly in the hardware camp or Rick Osterloh, formerly of Motorola?  He now kind of leads the hardware division at Google.  Does he oversee that whole effort, especially in the sense that it all kind of  ties into the hardware like the pixel line that they're creating everything?  Ron, it looks like something to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I was I was going to say, like, I think that I think the combination  of the rumor of LG making the next pixel phone plus this hire of Manu Galati  are all kind of indicators.  Like, I'm not surprised LG is being tapped for the next pixel phone,  because, like Kevin said, for years, they've spread the wealth like they've never  favored one manufacturer over the other.  And I think that has been done to maintain those relationships,  you know, to kind of keep everybody happy.  But also they're inching ever closer to the identity of the pixel  and the Google phone, you know, like the branding on like this past  time with the pixel was so strongly Google.  It was like, you know, like it was it was we knew what was under the hood.  But the average person thought it was Google.  And I think that hiring Manu Galati and looking into doing the chipset  and then maybe the hardware is again, like I feel like it's a repeat  of a couple of years ago, but it's Google dipping their toe back into the water  of saying, OK, well, what if we bring all this in house and we do this all?  We don't have a partner.  And I feel like it's a very it's a it's a tightrope that they're walking,  because on one hand, you get the sense that they really want to own a phone.  They really want to own the phone business if they can.  Right. They want to they want to compete with Apple and Samsung.  But on the other hand, with Android, they have all these OEMs  and all these partners that they need to keep happy.  And so it feels like they're trying to kind of keep both sides happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the other thing is to is to map this to the rest of the sort of  dual point of view on this.  You know, they've been building stuff for the data sense for a long time.  As I said, they've they've basically been building out custom machines  to be data center machines.  They've also built their own switches to control systems there.  And now they've moved to the TensorFlow, the TPU.  So part of this may be drawing some of that back to if they're taking this big  bet on AI, it may be that they're putting it.  They want to put a TPU on in the phone as well and get that to a low power  design as well.  So that may make sense for them to, you know, if you're looking at the next  generation of Android, the generation after that, that you're going to want  custom chips for that.  If they're going to keep up the VR stuff they're doing, they're going to want  custom chips for that as well.  So there's potentially a set of integrations that they want to do  to make sure that so hiring someone who's an expert at pulling multiple  subunits together into one chip and keeping the power low is a very smart  move from that point of view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  And it's the idea of holistic development of that.  Listen, we want a device that can do this on the software side instead of leaning  on Qualcomm or whomever else that's making chipsets or processors or, you  know, whatever components.  Let's just oversee the components ourselves.  And and who knows, you know, like maybe, you know, Menugulati and the team  that's working on this stuff designs the chipsets, but then they outsource the  production of it to like a Foxconn or whoever else, you know, like there's a  bunch of different ways this plays out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that, yeah, spot on.  And they even talked about that at Google, I know, right.  TensorFlow Lite what is not was is their effort to bring that machine learning  into the device itself.  David Burke had said, you know, silicon on the device that's dedicated to this  machine learning stuff going forward.  So if they're creating their SOC, I mean, right now, everybody in Android is  using, I mean, not everybody, but almost everybody's using Qualcomm chips in  their in their devices.  And while that's great, because Qualcomm obviously is doing a great job creating  their systems on a chip to power these smartphones, it also has there's a lot of  feature parity.  Like everybody's kind of offering the same things because the chipset offers the  same things.  Google brings in its own or Alphabet, Google, whatever, brings in their own  team to create this stuff on their own.  They can more tightly integrate that with their efforts like TensorFlow Lite and  really create something that differentiates the hardware that they're  creating compared to the rest so that they can coexist.  But we offer some and Google's already shown that they're fine with offering  things that other phones don't have.  You know, for years, that was the question is, Google doesn't want to  compete with its competitors because it might scare them away.  You know, they just they'd be too big and too dominant.  But now it's obvious like Google thinks that it can coexist with its competitors  and offer different things on its devices and, I don't know, swim in the same pool.  But so there's that also, by the way, LG, another aspect to that is that the there  was a rumor that that Google wanted to invest in LG's flexible OLED displays.  So maybe there's some sort of crossover there as well.  They all seem that would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that would be wonderful.  I do like flexible displays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I doubt that means you'd get your phone and you could bend it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I want a phone that I can roll up and put in my pocket like a newspaper someday,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ron, someday.  We're just not there yet.  I believe, Jason, I believe in it more than likely.  It'll be kind of the edging, you know, the rounded edges, which is what we see  right now with Samsung devices, which, by the way, allows for a less bezel in your device.  That's one way to kind of make that happen.  And that's one way that they're pulling that off.  So I feel like, oh, man, that was a that was a lot of rumor in one little one short.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the funny thing is, though, what I think is really interesting is that here we are  in June. And when is the pixel announcement going to be like we were betting last night?  Like I said, September flow, Florence, I said October.  Right. But we're still three months out.  So these are the rumors we're getting at least three months or so out.  What is August going to be like? Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the last hardware announcement was the beginning of October, if I remember correctly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if you were to follow the year and that was late, that was that that felt really late.  And it's like that was a little lame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And then just real quick here, Google has announced kind of end of life dates for the devices that you might have or that you probably have.  The pixel and the pixel Excel are going to stop getting operating system updates on October 2018.  So that's next October.  Yeah, I mean, those dates like I have to imagine they'd have their successor around when when these updates stop.  So it's probably October at the latest that you'd have the new devices and then security updates October 2019.  Basically, Google has has dedicated themselves on their devices to two years of OS updates.  From what I understand, from what I remember, three years of security updates, quite as long as you get on the iOS side of things, but better than before, where we just didn't know.  Exactly.  And then and then, yeah, six p five x, they're going to end support September 2018.  I think that's security support September of next year.  And then the six and the nine will stop getting security updates this October.  So just in case you have those devices now, you know, did I miss anything in that block?  I don't know.  Is this getting you excited for the next the next wave of pixel devices?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I need to see more before I'm excited.  I don't think I'm an excitement level yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're already all in on the essential.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I'm on the essential hype train.  That's for sure.  That's for sure.  But but also some of the you know, like the Google Google released the Android developer preview three.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  A couple of days ago.  Yeah.  And so like that.  And while that's still not like they say that was a big release because it has all the APIs now.  And apparently they squashed a bunch of bugs.  But because I'm not running it, I don't know if it's more stable.  So, Jason, I'm curious once you install it, whether it will make your pixel more stable, because I know you've been having stability issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So I updated to the Android.  Oh, update at Google.  I.O. basically when they announced it there, it was the official kind of move over to the automated system.  So I opted into that took a couple of days for it to happen.  But I but I got it on eventually.  And then, yeah, I was having a lot of weird bugs.  I try and install apps from my computer like, you know, how you can go to the Play Store on your desktop and say, install this on my phone and it would appear there.  And it just wouldn't install.  And for whatever reason, I would restart everything.  I couldn't get half the apps I wanted to install on.  I did get this update, though.  The OTA came a couple of days ago and I updated and I haven't had any issues since.  But I've also kind of been not looking at my phone a whole lot.  So there's that, too.  But so far, so good.  I'm curious, Kevin, if you've had a chance to like look at the Android O feature set or play around with any of the developer preview or do you keep your device clean and pristine like most people do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't normally go for the developer previews unless I've got something I'm specifically developing.  And if I would, I would do it on this one.  I'd get another one to try that on, I think, because it's one phone that's not falling over.  I did.  So I did I did upgrade to and early.  But that was basically because the previous software update managed to break my phone.  So I had to had to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I encountered that, too.  That's right. The only way to like update it was to go to the beta.  That's right.  Strange how that worked.  But it worked.  Hey, I was happy that it existed because otherwise I thought my phone was dead in the water for good.  But yeah, so far, so good.  I'm happy with with the change.  It doesn't seem to be crashing or anything like that.  So there's that, I guess.  But I mean, when I recommend it for like everybody, probably not.  There's probably enough bugs in there that that you don't want to jump into it unless you're cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I would say I would say to wait until like like at least four, if not release number five before you start thinking about the closer we get to September, that's when you want to do it.  If at all, because it's a developer preview.  It's not a user preview.  It's a developer preview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Real quick, I guess I guess what we can do, we can round out a little bit of the Android stuff and then I have to take a break.  But Google had just announced that they're highlighting.  Didn't they just do this?  They're highlighting Android excellence, basically apps and games that are really, really good in their categories in a program called Android excellence.  So their collections curated by Google.  They're picking these based on apps and games that follow best practices, have great design, performance optimizations, localization.  How is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How is this any different than the end of the year awards that came out six months ago?  Yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe maybe an ongoing thing.  I don't know.  I'm sure there's good apps to mine in there for the arena, though.  Yeah, that's for sure.  And then you guys, I know you guys talked about this last night.  I haven't had a chance to play around with a G board, which is the keyboard that I use on Android, because I think it's kind of like Google's default keyboard now.  Right.  Is G board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's really it's really the go to I don't know if it comes pre installed.  Does it come pre installed on the pixel or not?  But it should if it doesn't.  But no, this is the G board is interesting because it's also cross platform in that it's both Android and iOS, which I think is great.  But the recent G board app added the ability to suggest phrases, which is something that Swift key had about a year ago or so.  So as you're typing something, it's not only predicting the next word, but predicting the rest of the sentence based off commonly used phrases and then also the ability to draw an emoji and have it match the emoji and have that go in.  So if you feel the need to draw the poo emoji, you can do that.  I don't really know the drawing emoji thing.  I don't know.  I guess people want that.  I like just just click this tap the emoji.  Well, I understand it, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I understand it because I'm in this weird.  I'm old school.  Right.  Like I've realized, like if I want to do a smiley face, I do the colon.  Yeah, the colon.  And then I realize I'm totally old school.  You know, only only just lame people do that.  You got to step into the emoji age.  So then I go.  I'm like, OK, great.  I'll step into the emoji age.  And then I spend 10 minutes trying to find this stupid face that actually represents my feeling.  I'm like, what am I doing wrong?  Like, no one takes this long to find like a face that represents their emotion or do they.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if you draw it, you like I need to express myself by drawing this emoji that I'm feeling like if that's going to get me there quicker than yes, I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm down for that.  I'm fine with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, what I don't understand is that why.  Like, so I'm a I'm a heavy WhatsApp user and WhatsApp actually converts the colon and parentheses to the smiley emoji.  So like why G board can't do that?  I don't know.  But one other feature on G board that I do like is that they have enlarged arrow buttons to allow you to navigate text, which is fantastic because of someone with fat fingers and a small screen.  And if you're trying to do edits on like a document on your phone, it's a nightmare.  And so being able to go tap, tap up, up, up, up, left, left, left, you know, like that sort of thing is a great addition as well, too.  So I love the G board is my is my go to keyboard now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So where do you stand on Emoji gate, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I still use Swift key.  And what Swift key has is if you type a word or suggest an emoji that belongs with the words.  So that that that that is my my shortcut for him.  So rather than typing, you know, shrug or whatever, rather than looking for the shrug emoji, I'll type shrug, shrug emoji or train or pool or whatever it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Usually in my case, I'm trying to find the poo emoji.  You think it would like appear easier for me and know that I'm looking for the poo emoji because I use it so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like your go to emoji, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish that it were.  I just don't use emoji at all because I find it more way more inconvenient than it than I feel like it should be.  Meanwhile, we have guests here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why the Swift key is good because it you'll just be typing normally.  It'll suggest you an emoji instead of that.  Along with the two words, it suggests you as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the way to go about it.  As I was describing the hours and hours it takes me to find a face that represents how I feel.  Our guests here in the studio were like, yeah, that's that's what you do.  It takes that long.  That's just the way it goes.  So apparently I need to just like let go of it and realize it's going to take me a long time to get that face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What I've done in this emoji filled world now is that I just use nonsense emojis.  Like I'll be texting somebody and I'll end it with the with the smiley face of the cowboy hat or I'll end it with the with the volcano or like or the cactus.  And everyone's like, what does that mean?  I'm like, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got to be careful, Ron.  You might say something and you have no idea what you're saying in a mojo.  All the better. All the better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just sort of a Google G board feature.  What you should do is you should be able to pull a face at the screen and give you the right emoji based on your experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute. No, no, no.  They showed something like this off a few months ago.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Aloe rolled off.  I think it's an aloe.  It was facial recognition.  They made stickers based on your face.  So not necessarily emojis, but more stickers like, you know, the kind of, you know, the bitmoji type thing that was.  Remember, Jason, you did it and it looked kind of like you, but not totally.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'm not going to go into my aloe because there's a bunch of chats there and I just don't trust myself.  Not in this mind state.  But yes, there is a way to do that.  And it made a bitmoji thing.  I thought there was a way to interpret your face into an emoji, though.  And if that doesn't exist, Google, you're the ones to make this happen.  Do it.  Get on that.  That's important stuff.  Way more important than like shaming people into getting solar panels on the roof, which we'll talk about here in a few minutes.

So I guess it's by no means the top Google news.  But Project Sunroof, which is basically Google's map project that can tell how much sunlight is hitting your roof.  Basically, you can use this to see if solar panels might actually be a good fit for your home.  I would love to get solar panels on my home.  Actually, maybe not even solar panels. Solar tiles.  You know, the Tesla tiles.  Those things are hot.  But anyways, this is literally hot.  Yeah, yeah, you probably don't want to walk up there.  But this is a way where you can essentially Google is using their artificial intelligence as they use for everything.  They're machine learning algorithms to take a look at solar imagery, satellite imagery rather, and recognize solar panels  and be able to tell you if your neighbors are converted to solar or not in the hopes.  I don't know if it's the hope or not, but it's probably going to make you feel kind of bad that you aren't and then make you want to get solar converted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Didn't they do this last year?  I got a flashback.  What changed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the change is the analysis, the AI analysis.  That's what because I remember this too.  They released this a few years ago.  I think then basically what it was was a way to determine how much sun actually hits your roof throughout a given day to determine whether it would be a good idea for you to get it.  And now what they're doing is they're training their AI to determine who's done it and who hasn't so that you feel guilty and you get solar on your roof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But how do you feel guilty if you're not checking it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's true. Who's actually checking it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If I'm not aware of it, then how would I feel ashamed?  I think this is cool because maybe you see your neighbor and you're like, you've done it and you're like, oh cool.  If my whole block does it, then we can save this X amount and you want to talk your neighbors into it or whatever.  But this just looks like an evolution of what they did last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's pretty much what it is.  It's this growing trend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can it detect those Tesla roofs?  I know.  They look like ordinary roofs.  Oh man, those things are hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want those so bad.  But we don't need a new roof at this point on our house.  It's like I don't know if I could justify that.  I'd have to go with the solar panels.  Basically, Tesla says if you already need a new roof, this is the way to go.  Cost effective, you know, right from cost effectiveness.  You might as well replace it with this and over time it'll pay for itself.  If you don't need a new roof, you might as well stick with panels.  But man, they look nice with those solar tiles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, listen, just because that's the conventional wisdom, Jason, doesn't mean you have to stick to it.  If you want those tiles, I want you to have the tiles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they're expensive.  Yeah, I know.  Someday, maybe someday, maybe I'll win the lottery, although I don't play the lottery.  Who knows?  Anyways, that was probably not the top Google story.  Let's see.  What do we have in here?  There aren't really a whole lot of top Google stories, to be honest.  So I'll just kind of start up here at the top.  Google's, you know, the little self-driving cars, the really, the totally characteristic.  I think they had some promo videos, the little two-seaters.  People get in them.  They look like these little futuristic pods.  They're on their autonomous vehicles and they were basically Google's way of showing what the, you know,  autonomous driving future may look like.  They began testing on roads back in 2014.  Apparently, those are going away.  Yeah, those little guys.  The Firefly.  It was basically GovCon Sunday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  More than anything, that's probably what it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They only went like 25, 30 miles an hour, right?  So, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Top speed, 25 miles per hour.  You're not going very fast, but there is a stop and go button inside.  And I appreciate it for its simplicity.  Apparently, they logged in three million miles in three years.  And Google slash Alphabet has decided it's probably best to just focus all of its efforts on the thing most people have heard of,  which is Waymo, which is taking the roads by storm at this point, or about to.  And the courtrooms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  There's some stuff going down with Waymo and the courtrooms and Uber.  Yeah.  And a whole lot more about Uber, but we don't need to talk about that.  Google Drive, apparently, is I think this is a great idea, although I wonder how expensive it would get over time.  But Google is going to release a new app called Backup and Sync.  They're going to release it on June 28th.  And basically what it's going to be designed for is pointing it to any file or folder or sorry, folder, not file, folder on your drive or number of folders  and have continuous sync backup to the cloud.  When I read this, I was like, man, I just assumed that they already did that.  But I guess they don't.  I think they did that in photo upload, but not in just general file upload.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I don't think they've ever done the entire thing like that, like a true Dropbox style kind of backup kind of situation.  But hey, man, I was done with folders.  Yes, photos for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  You've got to go to.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, so then this is meant to be.  I've had that before.  Yeah.  So I'm really confused.  OK, so they say that they're replacing the Google Drive app and the Google Photos backup app on desktop with this.  So it's probably going to do what it's done before.  Also, the photos backup.  Yeah, I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I see. OK.  Because I mean, I've had the opposite problem, which is that if I install Google Drive, then my hard drive fills up because my Google Drive has got more stuff on it than my computers have.  Yeah, that's a problem.  Because I got a terabyte with whatever it was with the Chrome Pixel years ago.  So I just threw everything in it and then I bought a new Mac and it didn't have enough storage to sync to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you still have a terabyte from when you bought the Pixel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it expired at Google I.O. last year, so now I'm paying them for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, OK.  I was like, wow, you got off easy if you still have that.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was the irony.  It was like it was Google I.O. week and suddenly all my Google things were saying, you are out of disk space by a factor of 10.  You need to delete 90 percent of your stuff.  And it's like, it's I.O. week, Google.  Oh, right. Yes, my three year freebie just expired.  Now I'm going to start paying you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But isn't that how they get you?  Right. There's actually totally related news to this.  Amazon got rid of their unlimited file storage.  They had, you know, a few years ago rolled out their unlimited cloud storage plan.  They're ending that.  If you have an existing unlimited storage plan, you won't lose it until the renewal.  But then at that point, you'll be downgraded essentially to a one terabyte plan and you'll have to pay extra.  $59.99 per extra terabyte or $11.99 per 100 gigs per month.  And then if you don't purchase any extra data after like six months, all that data just disappears.  But it's but it's an interesting strategy that we're that we're seeing where I think there are there is a certain population of people that saw unlimited and thought unlimited forever.  But of course, forever never lasts forever.  It does not mean unlimited.  Yeah, exactly.  Forever is not forever when it's talking when you're talking about a limited nor is unlimited actually unlimited when you're talking about unlimited.  But anyway, so it's a great way to get you in the door.  But then what are you going to do?  All your data is up there.  Now you have to decide is it worth it for you to pay or do you just kiss it goodbye?  You chose to pay.  It was important enough for you to keep in the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it was it was either that I'll spend a week deleting 90 percent of my stuff.  Exactly.  Or about that.  I'll download local drives.  But put you to work.  But it's like I've already delegated photos and music to Google.  I mean, you know, those those two, they don't have a limit on you.  You just they just let you back stuff up.  So it's like, OK, yeah, all my photos.  Sure. All my music from that I've got downloaded lots of my machines, sync with that up to Google.  That's fine. Then my phone doesn't have to have it on.  Right.  And I trust them to back it up because they're Google.  They don't actually delete things unless they unless something terrible happens.  They delete things, you tell them to delete things.  So by default, Google has six copies of everything in more than and it's in more than one data center, more than one continent.  So it's quite hard to do stuff that you backed up to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As long as you don't lose access to your Google account, everything's OK.  As long as you don't enable.  Just said it's all wine and roses until you do something.  It's a long time. You can count until you get locked out of your Google account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's how that happened. That would never happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It would never happen, except that it did on this very show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it was it was two factor authentication plus Google Voice.  Yes, it was a toxic combination.  It's a deadly combination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. OK, so you brought up Google Photos.  This is not in the doc and it's totally not related to much other than Google Photos.  But this is something I was struggling with yesterday.  So Google I.O. we were given one of the one of the few gifts that attendees were given were was a 20 page hardcover photo book from Google Photos or whatever.  They're like a free photo book. You choose the photos.  We'll give you a free photo book.  And so I went into my photos and my wife and I were like, you know, we never actually got our wedding photos in a book.  So this is a perfect opportunity to do that. Let's do that.  So I go into Google Photos. I mean, I've got like we've got like a thousand photos.  We had a really great photographer that we hired.  It was one of the things that we spent the most money on was the photographer, because we're like, you know, this is the thing you're going to remember forever.  So you might as well have it look nice.  And it turns out that all of my photos, all of our photos from our wedding are duplicated and the duplicates are sideways.  So there's some of them.  You know, half of them are the right orientation.  Half of them are sideways. But but the same.  Google can do so much with artificial intelligence.  Is it is it difficult to like detect that a photo is sideways and automatically swap it up?  And if not, they have to have one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've definitely seen that in the assistant tab.  It says you're these photos are sideways. Should I rotate them for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it does that. But it does that automatically.  How do I do that? How do I say go back into my library?  Yeah, that's a good question. I'm sure you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe I can. You can ask them to do that. That's true.  Maybe I maybe I can. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you have you looked at the desktop version of Google Photos as opposed to the app?  What's that, Ron? Have you looked at the desktop version of Google Photos as opposed to the app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I looked at both. But OK.  And you know, there there's like a keyboard shortcut for rotating.  So that helped. It's shift R. If you're looking at a single photo shift R, that'll rotate it so you don't have to find the button.  But I just wanted to be like, look at all of these and rotate all of these.  And someone in chat posted a thing from the app. Is this a way that you can manually do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like fire. I've definitely seen one of the I've definitely seen an assistant thing that said the founder, because I had a bunch of old ones from like, you know, 15 years ago that were all the wrong way around.  It said these will retain the wrong way. Do you want to fix that?  And I said yes. And they were rotated. But the problem with assistant is you can't tell it to do things.  It is just like sitting there gripping your photos and making sure that if it can't detect it, it's not going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there must be something in those photos that is making it think it's not sideways.  Whether it could be the orientation of a face or something like that.  You know, like it's, you know, machine learning is great, but you can still fool it at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, man, there's there's no denying like the majority of these things are head to toe.  We're just standing sideways. So maybe it maybe it thinks we're all laying down.  I don't know. Anyways, totally random.  It looks like I mean, maybe I can go in here because I know sometimes you can go into the photos app and you can select a bunch of photos while you do it with photo books.  You select a bunch of photos and then you go into the menu and you hit, you know, photo book.  Maybe there's something in there to trigger an auto rotate and analysis or something.  But I didn't see it yesterday and I tried on desktop and mobile because I have I have gotten.  Received that assistant card before for rotating photos, but it obviously didn't get to these.  So anyways, a little bit of a tangent.  Thank you for coming along with me on that journey.  This was interesting. Alphabet finally found a buyer for Boston Dynamics.  I think they've been trying to unload their robots for about a year now.  And now SoftBank is the proud owner of a whole bunch of robots.  Also, not only Boston Dynamics, but Shaft, which was also an alphabet property that you probably heard a lot less about.  They were also creating robots.  They had released a bipedal robot last year, at least a video of one last year that was designed to help carry heavy loads.  So kind of doing some similar stuff to what Boston Dynamics was, but maybe maybe a little bit smaller, more compact.  I'm not really quite sure.  I think the first thing I thought of when I read this is that there's no chance I'm ever going to run into a Boston Dynamics robot at Google.  I know it's just not going to happen now.  And Ron, that makes me sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'm glad because the bipedal robots freak me out and or they freak me out almost as much as the quadpedal robots.  Like the dog robots, those freak me out the most.  But I'm more interested in it.  It just seems like every time something interesting is happening, it seems SoftBank is involved.  SoftBank is really involved.  SoftBank is really involved.  There's all this stuff about how they're restructuring this $93 billion tech fund and they invested in Sprint and they pulled the investment from Essential.  It just seems that SoftBank keeps coming up in these kind of interesting tech stories.  And I'm curious, what are they going to do with Boston Dynamics and Shaft?  That's really kind of interesting.  So who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Masayoshi San, chairman and CEO of SoftBank Group Corp, said in a statement,  Smart robotics are going to be a key driver of the next stage of the information revolution.  I don't know what that means.  Does that mean that these robots are going to be delivering my information on a platter or what that means?  But I mean, there's no doubt robotics are a future or a part of our future.  I don't know.  Do you have any thoughts, any theories on why a company like SoftBank might want robots, Kevin?  Who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, robots have been a sort of cool thing in Japan for years.  So it makes sense for a Japanese company to pick it up.  But I know it's one of those bizarre things.  It's like those robots seem really cool, but they seem really weird and off putting.  They're a bit too uncanny valley for me.  Yes, agreed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why they're awesome.  I know.  That's why they're awesome and scary all at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But if you look at sort of Asimo and Aibo and the Japanese style ones, they put a lot of effort into making them cute and friendly.  Whereas the Boston Erech ones, they were just scary.  They just look like evil robot dogs rather than cuddly robot dogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they definitely had a military edge to them.  You could definitely see those out on a battlefield somewhere.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just see the Star Wars prequels.  I don't want to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the future, Ron.  It's the future.  Well, I mean, speaking of Toyota, Asimo is Toyota, right?  Is it Asimo?  I think is what it's called.  Toyota had apparently been in the running, according to reports as well on on buying Boston Dynamics.  They just they lost out to SoftBank.  So Asimo is just going to have to be cute on his own.  Asimo was Honda, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, was that Honda?  Sorry.  It was Honda.  The world's most advanced humanoid robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's pretty cool, but not nearly as frightening as as big dog.  Oh, I just I really hope the SoftBank keeps up the tradition and allows Boston Dynamics to continue to release the videos,  because pretty much it's like Christmas anytime Boston Dynamics releases a new video of their robots.  Every time I open it and I watch it and I mouth agape and I'm like, this is actually happening.  This I like I once thought that this would just be science fiction.  But no, here it is.  Invading.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know how that's Christmas.  Or for me, that's like the stuff of nightmares.  Every time I see one of those new Boston Dynamics videos of the robot walking awkwardly and like not falling down and us or being kicked and it doesn't fall down and it comes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That one.  That one's a little scary.  If you like your material as part of your design, then you might like the fact that more material design is coming to Chrome OS.  Canary Channel apparently is getting a new material notification design, more streamlined, rounded corners, cleaner icons, condensed actions.  And that's not all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not like small, too gray and illegible like they've done on Android.  I want I want I want a high contrast, larger type back in my notifications, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true.  They're getting so elegant that you need you need a pair of bifocals to even read them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, because they're condensing all that.  Why is the main text on these things gray?  There's no excuse for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doesn't pop, but it looks nice.  If you want to get in on that action, you can.  You just have to enable a flag.  Just do a search for it.  Get on Canary, of course, and you can enable a flag.  And that's all there is to that.  I know you guys talked a little bit about local guides last night on all about Android, something that I still only sort of really understand this local guides thing with maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I didn't even realize that actually Florence Ion was like a level three local guide.  She's participating in this, which is crazy.  But yeah, no, but basically it's just kind of, you know, it's Google.  Google's kind of crowdsourced information about locations within maps.  And, you know, it allows people to add information and answer questions and things like that.  I do the things in Google Maps to answer questions about places, but I don't know what level I am.  I don't know that's even tied to local guides.  I know local guides have been around for a while, but, you know, it's clearly a program that's working well for them because here they are.  They're adding five more levels.  It brings it to a total level of 10 in hopes to kind of keep everybody incentivized to keep using it, keep the gamification going.  And they give rewards like you get free months of Google Play Music and discounted rentals and stuff like that.  So it's pretty neat.  But it's not something I have any like I barely have time to work on my projects, much as Google's projects.  Yeah, right. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A couple of free months of Google Play Music.  Don't they just offer that every other month anyways?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's kind of weird because it keeps nagging me to do that.  It's like, OK, you're this place. Do you want to tell me about it?  No, I don't want to tell you about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the way I look at it is that I participate in that because the way I see it is like this is information I would want to know.  Because I go to Google Maps all the time and look up like what are the dollar signs are, when is this place busy, like all that sort of stuff.  And so I figure you got to pay it forward a little.  I got to give some information as well, too.  So it's like, does this place take credit cards?  And I say, I don't know.  And then I move on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pay it forward with uncertainty.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've already done that with Foursquare, so it feels like I'm having to do it twice.  It's like, can you just talk to Dennis and get some data from him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  I completely agree.  I get that notification.  We all arrive somewhere and then I get a buzz and look down at my phone and there it is.  It's like, it knows that I arrived there.  It's one of those moments where it's like, but I mean, but, you know, props for it actually getting it right.  I just I never apparently afford myself the time to actually do very much with it unless it's a really quick like, yes, no.  But to like type out a review is just I never give myself the time to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's important to note, though, that those questions we're talking about are a function of Google Maps in terms of crowdsourcing information.  Those are not local guides.  You can go to maps.google.com slash local guides and you actually have to actually join and tell it what city you're in and agree, you know, kind of agree to their terms and all stuff like that.  You got to choose to join.  Once you do that, then you can submit information about places and locations and things like that.  And it's kind of like it's basically like Google's Yelp baked into Google Maps.  But it gives you that really kind of in-depth information.  And that's how they do the rewards and all things like that.  I think it's cool.  It's interesting.  I'm glad that they're doing it.  It's the kind of thing like, you know, Jason, you and I are so close to all this stuff and I just learned that right now in the past two minutes.  You know, like it's not something that's like widely popularized.  They don't bubble it up within the Google Maps app that much, which I thought they would do.  So, yeah, I mean, they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's pretty.  I see it all the time.  Do you not get that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you know, I get it.  I don't know.  I don't know that these people are local guys and what levels they are and things like that.  Oh, I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Gotcha. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like how you would even know to jump in there.  But I guess, man, is this the thing?  I feel like at some point I heard about it where if you are already contributing a lot, if you're just kind of that person that contribute a lot, then you get contacted and it's like you can be part of the local guides.  And that's when you get in on kind of these bonuses.  And for what I understand, like it was five stages before.  And the problem is like their best users would get to the fifth stage, the fifth level or whatever.  They'd level up.  And that's about as high as you could get.  That's about as high as you could get.  And it's like, OK, well, what is my incentive to continue contributing?  Now they've added five more levels that you can continue to get more as you contribute more.  And that gives other users more information to pull from, I suppose.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In our constant march towards an A.I.  ruled future, the New York Times apparently has listed Alphabet A.I.  to to help it moderate its comments.  Hey, more power to the A.I.  that can moderate comments, because I have to imagine that's not an easy task.  But but it's actually really interesting.  Only 10 percent of New York Times articles allow for comments at this point, at least prior to this, because the task of moderating all of those comments with the limited staff that they have dedicated to it, I mean, just take too much time.  So they could only allow comments for 10 percent of their articles.  Alphabet steps in with their jigsaw division.  They created a tool called Perspective that is allowing the New York Times to expand the number of articles that they're they're allowing comments on.  They plan to open up commenting on 80 percent of the articles.  And when you consider somewhere around 200 articles per day being posted, that's quite a lot of moderation.  New York Times articles get a lot of comments when you go to one that has comments activated.  So the A.I. algorithm essentially is scanning for known things that would trigger a flag and then it can kind of pass things off as need be to human moderators to make the calls or whatever.  But it's just trimming, you know, trimming the easy stuff, letting most of it pass if it passes and if not kind of passing the questionable stuff off to humans.  So A.I. taking one for the team in this case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If someone's going to read if someone's going to read the comments, it might as well be a robot.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I like the comment was that I like was the tool sometimes proven perfect missing some modern slurs.  The idea that we've got continually reinventing slurs on other people to get past the robots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, there's one thing we know about the Internet.  Can you be more creative in your abuse, please?  Right. Come up with something new and let's all jump on that bandwagon before the robot catches us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is I mean, it's like the Twitter thing now where Twitter will censor certain words unless you're verified, but won't sense a certain other words.  So somebody can be very rude to you and then you you get crossed back and then you're blocked for 12 hours.  Right. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And sometimes, yeah, sometimes that works effectively and sometimes it goes rogue.  So I guess you never really know what you're going to get when when the robots take over.  Let's see here.  I think let's see.  I know that there's more, but it's probably not in the Google section here.  We talked about the Amazon.  What am I missing?  Anything jump out?  Well, I guess Facebook has some interesting stuff along these lines and actually very, very timely right now.  There's obviously some pretty crazy stuff happening in London with the with the high the high rise.  That was on fire.  And yeah, it's just really devastating news.  Facebook has its safety check feature that it's implemented a while back.  That's basically all around kind of alerting other Facebook users whether someone is OK or not.  And they've basically pushing out a number of new features to this.  One of them ties into fundraising.  So essentially, essentially, I guess Facebook already kind of has a fundraising program integrated into its service.  So this is kind of tying it into safety checks.  So if safety check is activated for someone, this would allow someone to essentially kick off a nonprofit or a personal fundraising effort that might help around a safety check.  Thankfully, all of those efforts are vetted by by Facebook's humans, essentially prior to that actually happening.  But yeah, I mean, that's that's got to be a good thing in the case of of of a tragedy or a disaster of some sort.  We're seeing safety check happen more and more.  TechCrunch had an article that's really interesting.  I think it's kind of an interesting question because I hadn't really considered it.  I figured, you know, it's it's it's a network that has contact with a whole lot of people.  So it would make sense that they would know whether someone might be in harm's way or not, would, you know, be there to alert their users.  Whether they're OK or not, that seems like a great thing.  The article in TechCrunch is kind of asking the question, like, does it cause undue panic and undue worry, depending on how wide of a net it casts based on who is targeting for safety check or not?  I don't know if you know, if you've read the article, it's kind of like a question of how do you know, how do you know if someone is going to be in harm's way or not?  I don't know if either of you had a chance to take a look at this because it's a little bit of a dense read, but it's an interesting question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I do recognize the problem because we had that with both the terrorist attack in London and this fire thing where basically is asking, you know, a large proportion of the population of London whether they're involved in this.  Whereas, and those were both scary things, but the number of people involved in each was a few hundred at most.  But it's asking, you know, five million people to check in and give safety check responses, which is a bit bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, that's the challenge of a densely populated area like a major city like London where, you know, it's a combination of where the app picking up where you are from your location as well as where you tell it you are.  You know, so, you know, and then like the times I've seen safety check in action have been like during a lot of the tornadoes in the Midwest and things like that where people kind of mark themselves as okay.  Those are kind of cast a wider net and it's more you could there's more wondering if somebody in Kansas is going to get hit by this tornado or not than this localized terrorist attack that happened on it within a couple of blocks radius in London.  I don't know. I think I think for.  After you, Kev.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it is tricky because, yeah, you know, if it happens somewhere in central London, the terrorist attack on Tower Bridge and Borough Market, that is an area that I've been to lots of times.  Lots of people have been to my sons work near there.  So there's some reason was that they could have been in the neighborhood.  But the, you know, the idea that, you know, I was still seeing people marking themselves safe two days later and things which which is which was kind of weird.  So it felt like they've got the focus wrong.  And the other half is is when the disaster does happen, then everyone everyone who who knows you will check in anyway.  And we were living in California whenever there was a mudslide or a fire, our relatives would say, you okay?  Yeah, that's 200 miles away that way.  So there is that sort of it's behaving more like your sort of geographically confused relatives than Facebook.  Facebook is tracking where you are all the time if you if you're running the Apple Messenger.  So it could do a much more focused job of saying, OK, this person was very close to that neighborhood or was close to that neighborhood at some point in the last two days.  And that and do a better job than it does.  What I've seen seems to do is prompt anyone within a mile radius or two mile radius, which in London is a million people literally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. I mean, one of the examples from this article was that, you know, it's 120 flats in this in this London high rise that were on fire.  People as far away as eight miles were being prompted to check in.  And what kind of a signal does that send to the people on the other end that see this check in?  You know, where where they might not have been worried or concerned.  Now suddenly they feel like there is a need to be worried or concerned.  And it just kind of potentially spreads this kind of, I don't know, a feeling of panic where maybe it didn't need to be.  At the same time, like I'm conflicted because I'm like, yeah, but it's nice to use data that you have information that you have to do some to to attempt to do some greater good.  Maybe it's just not being used as efficiently or as effectively as it as it should be for this tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, well, I think I think the expansion of safety check, you know, in terms of with fundraising is interesting because I know that, you know, fundraising.  I saw an article recently like like what was something crazy about GoFundMe, how the majority of like 80 percent of GoFundMe,  I know more than half of GoFundMe's money that's raised through crowdfunding goes towards medical expenses.  Right. And so this idea, this idea of crowdfunding in need and around disasters and around when things happen and things like that, that's, you know, like clearly Facebook is doing that in order to help.  You know, but also there is there's there's a business there.  You know, so I think that's interesting as well, too.  Looking at the what they what other functionality they can build on around safety check as flawed as it might be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. I hadn't heard that news about GoFundMe.  Medical candidates make up nine hundred thirty million dollars of the two billion dollars raised on GoFundMe.  Yeah. Isn't that crazy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow. It is. I think that's crazy.  That's that's that says more about health care than than about safety check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So well, the power of crowdfunding, I mean, you know, which is and and that ties exactly right into what Facebook had announced with their changes or with their updates to safety check, which is in a time of need.  Sometimes, you know, personal fundraising is necessary, let's say.  And so they're they're including that into here.  It was it was in the TechWrench article was definitely an interesting read.  I just hadn't thought of it that way before.  I've been like, well, this is this is obviously a good thing, right?  Like tell people whether you're safe or not.  But if it's used and if it's used too widely, it can almost work in the opposite direction.  So apparently they have some work to do there to kind of tighten it up a little bit.  And then let's see here. What what other crazy things is Facebook doing?  Meanwhile, I wouldn't know. I haven't been on Facebook since December.  Just throw that out there. Facebook wants you to type with your brain.  This isn't weird at all.  They first announced this at F8 in April that neuroscientists and engineers apparently are a little doubtful that Facebook could pull this off.  But Facebook is investing millions of dollars in research anyways into the idea that we could someday share our thoughts to Facebook.  I'm guessing it's part of the greater effort within building eight, which is the incubator for moonshots at Facebook.  And if you remember, Regina Duggan, once a tap at Google has shifted over to this is one of her.  I'm assuming many products projects that they're working on moonshots to get us to get us wearing a headband and transferring our thoughts into Facebook.  That doesn't have any potential, you know, scary consequences whatsoever that I could possibly think of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wasn't this an idea? Wasn't this a moonshot pitch in Silicon Valley when Big Head was working at Big Head was working at Hooli?  It was like, yeah, wouldn't it be cool if whatever you thought just typed typed and like, oh, can we do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's like, I don't know. Maybe the moonshot department is about if you think we can throw money at it.  One question I had about this when I was reading through it is, do our thoughts structured like sentences?  You know, like if it could read my thoughts, is it really like I'm thinking about something and be like, I was thinking about whatever.  Like, I don't know. Like you probably have to learn how to how to type like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I suspect it's more like, you know, the suggestions you already get in alo or Gmail or wherever else is making up little replies for you.  And it'll just pick one of those from his bucket of pseudo human replies.  Yeah, I think that the more interesting thing is that about this is Charlie.  Charlie Stross, the sci fi author, wrote about a while back basically saying 2007 is when the human species accidentally invented telepathy  because we're now communicating through Twitter and Facebook and all these disclosure induction social media with little things in our hands all the time.  So basically all our thoughts are being sprayed out to the net and read to each other all over the time.  And his argument on this is, and this was he wrote this in January 2016, is that this is going to have really strange effects on politics.  And I think that's that's about right.  You know, if you look what's happened over the last two years in politics, yes, that is exactly what's been going on.  There is this strange ability because we can actually communicate thoughts with each other and therefore wrap each other up into these loops of I have a wild idea.  You have that wild idea to let's all spread it out and those spray themselves around social media and then spread into mainstream media and get taken up by political parties and all these things happen.  There's the world has got very strange very fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I had not thought of it like that before.  My mind is slightly blown because like when I think of telepathy, I think of it in the way of this article.  But I mean, you're absolutely right.  Like the the barrier for passing along a thought, I mean, it's just part of our daily nature.  Right. Like we have a thought, we act on that thought by pulling out our phone, punching out that thought into, you know, into words and sending it out.  And now everybody knows that thought.  That's just the way that life is in this strange technological world that we live right now.  It's not very far removed from just having thoughts be transcribed onto a screen automatically.  It's almost the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but no, but I think it's a little it's not far removed, but it's removed enough because if you've got I mean, because there's a filter there, there is a decision.  There's the there's the action of typing the letters and building the thought and doing it as opposed to the unfiltered kind of your thoughts being transcribed.  Because I'm feeling that if we could directly telepathically transcribed our thoughts and tweet them, the world would be much more disturbing than even as disturbing as it is now.  And as much as we think that some people are doing that now by just saying immediately what they think and tweeting it, there's still a level of barrier that happens.  And I would be even more scared to see what those people would tweet telepathically with no filter.  Just imagine what they actually think.  But I love I love this.  I love that they're investigating this as a moonshot.  I love this as a concept.  It's real sci fi.  But it's also like, you know, I hate handwriting because I because I've used computers for so much.  And I'm now at the point now where my wrist get tired and I hate typing.  And as much as I know, a lot of writers who lean on like Dragon Dictate and other kind of voice speech recognition stuff.  But to be able to just sit there and look at something and have your thoughts get transcribed into text would be a great way to do that.  And would be able to make writing that much faster and easier.  And just imagine what it could unlock.  You know, aside from just our unfiltered thoughts for Twitter or whatnot, the productivity, I think, would increase.  You know, could George R.R. Martin finally finish that Game of Thrones book?  If all I had to do was look at the computer and think about the story, right?  That's pretty cool.  But that's part of the thing is, if you're if you're writing a book, you're writing a book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's part of the thing is, if you're if you're a professional writer, even if you're not these days, you know, a lot of people are very fast at typing and have a very direct line between their hand, their keyboard or their hand and their touchpad.  Or, you know, or will they use voice dictation and have got trained themselves into a feedback loop with the computer to speak in a way that gets transcribed well.  Whereas, you know, if I if you try and transcribe me talking the pace I'm talking at the moment, Google falls over and I have to go back and correct it.  So I'm better off typing.  But the whereas if you if you've taught yourself to speak at that the pace that Google is happy with and space out the words a bit more, then it will transcribe it reasonably reliably.  So but the point is, is more that we have we have it's not just about the gap between the hard problem is not the gap between your brain and getting into the computer because we have four or five ways of doing that, all of which are pretty much close enough these days.  But the weird thing that's changed is the ease of anyone being able to see that and spread that to other people.  And that's the bit that feels more like telepathy where and also, you know, you will see the news and you will think of a joke and go to tweet it and find that jokes already trending because everyone has had the same thought as well, which is the other sort of bizarre mirror part of this.  That's really true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, that's that's another aspect.  Yeah, I had considered right like it's super.  And that's why you see a lot of this like reactionary behavior on social media.  It is so easy to see someone's thought and in a split second decide I agree with that thought.  Boom. Now everybody else knows that I agreed with it because I've spread it and that network effect extends far and wide.  And that's that's a direct tie right there.  That's fascinating.  Yeah, man.  More and more.  I'm just not sure.  I'm not sure about this newfangled technology.  This social media stuff.  It's ruining everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Am I getting old?  I'm getting old.  Is that what's happening?  I'm getting old.  Get off my lawn, you kids.  Just let me draw my emoji.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've got tips.  We've got tricks.  We've got numbers.  I'm not sure what we have, actually, to be honest, after this break.  But we're going to take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So IndieWeb is the group I help organize.  And basically the goal is to get people to have their own websites again and to find ways to connect between those websites.  So you don't have to do everything through Twitter or Facebook, but you can have your practical telepathy on your own website too.  And there are a bunch of IndieWeb homebrew website clubs tonight.  You've probably missed already.  The UK one is already finished.  But we have Bellingham, Washington, San Francisco and Fort Collins, Colorado tonight coming up at 530.  So check the link there for those.  The San Francisco one's at Mozilla.  Bellingham is at the Foundry.  I think a friend of mine is involved in the San Francisco one, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think my friend Tontek is involved in the IndieWeb stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So yeah, I strongly recommend IndieWeb.  It's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yes, Tontek is a great friend of mine too.  And he hosted at Mozilla when he can and is there tonight.  And so it's worth going down there because it's a it's a and it starts at 530 quite writing hour, 630.  You hang out and talk about you built your website.  It's not it's not quite website addicts cloud, but it's it's like I built my website and here's what I've done.  I need help with this.  Oh, have you thought of doing this?  It's like a sort of self-help group for web building.  And then the IndieWeb Summit is June 24th to 25th.  So that's weekend after next in Portland, Oregon.  And this is a full weekend.  This is basically you spend the weekend.  They use the Saturday is a an on conference.  So you get together and talk about things and have to have the conversations about different aspects of building your own website.  And then this Sunday is a building day where you get together and implement some of the things you've talked about or improve your site and so on.  And that's that's coming up.  And then there's a there's a drinks on the Friday night.  So that's coming up June 24th, 25th in Portland.  And there's there's still nine or ten places left.  And it's going to be live streamed as well.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that should be if they want to check on that is that that's the IndieWeb.org or 2017.IndieWeb.org.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  IndieWeb.org is the main site.  2017.IndieWeb.org is the summit.  Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There we go.  So check that out if you're in the area.  Great stuff.  Ron, I recognize yours, but there was some news associated with this yesterday, I think.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some news broke a couple of weeks ago and all about Android.  I brought to our app arena a new email client called Astro, which is available for both the desktop as well as mobile.  And folks who have seen me on this show are on all about Android know that I'm obsessed with finding the perfect email client.  And I don't know if Astro is the perfect email client, but I'm really enjoying it.  It's got an AI chat bot kind of tied into it.  That's what that's their big kind of thing that they were promoting the fact that you could like talk to this bot about your email and be like, who is Jason?  When did he write to me?  And things like that.  I don't actually use that, but it works with Gmail and with Office 360.  And I believe that they're adding other support for other email services.  It's just a really well designed, slick email application.  But they were in the news, I think, yesterday or the day before with the announcement that they've added integration with Amazon Echo and Alexa.  So you can interact with your email via your Echo.  And I hope Google Home is coming soon because that's what I have.  But then they also added a Slack integration so you can actually interact with your email via Astro in Slack, which I find very funny because Slack is meant to be the anti email.  So bringing email into Slack is a bit of a, you know, like, yeah, yeah, but still, sometimes you got to do it.  Sometimes you got to do it.  But it's a really, really well done integration is really sleek and elegant.  So if you're a Slack user and you're looking for an email client that integrates Slack, Astro is the way to go.  All in all, it's great.  I'm moving into it to it for my desktop as well as my Android phone.  So I recommend it.  It's at helloastro.com.  You can check it out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And do you integrate or do you I don't know, because you can chat with the AI bot from within the app.  Do you do you interface like that at all?  No, I don't.  I'm I'm I'm an adult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fair enough.  I just I just I just need my email.  But no, no, I actually haven't played with the chat about that much.  Maybe I will a little more.  I still need to load it in.  Like currently, I've only got I have like eight email accounts now that I'm actively going.  And so I need a client that can do all eight of them.  And that takes a while to load them and organize everything.  So that's my weekend plan is that I'm switching completely over after this weekend, especially like I was testing it.  I was playing with it with one email account and it's passed the smoke test.  And now that they have the slack integration, I'm like, oh, I'm all in.  So awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. That's Astro.  Hello, Astro.com.  Mine is just here to freak you out.  It's it's pics to pics photo generator.  This has been making the rounds the last couple of weeks.  It's with an F photo generator dot MPO cloud dot NL.  This is one of those tools where on the left you have your input.  I wish I could do it on my touch screen on my pixel, but it doesn't allow me to do it.  But you can use your mouse.  Essentially, what you do is you you can clear that image and you can create a little a face.  So I don't know.  You could do something very rudimentary or you can get really detailed.  Some people I think are are able to use a Wacom kind of interface.  I bet it would work really well on a surface or whatever.  Then you hit process and it takes it takes a machine and a algorithm on the back end that's been trained with human faces.  To take the face that you draw and and it basically turned it into a human life form.  It is the creepiest thing you'll ever see.  And the more detailed you get with some of these pictures, the weirder results you get.  I put a link to a an article in the dock underneath this with just some examples of of things that artists have done and non artists.  And this no matter how you how you do it, there's just a lot of really weird outcomes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You Jason, you love these kind of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is like like I'm fascinated by it and I don't know why.  What I really love about this is I love the idea of taking what it was like a stick figure like look at that.  That looks like a beast or something.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It looks like it looks like he almost a Toro type monsters.  Totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very it's very much the was the Google the deep dream stuff where, you know, suddenly, you know, you've you've feeded a picture and suddenly there are eyeballs everywhere.  But it's basically it's doing this conversion from stick figure art or, you know, or just trace trace art of a face.  And it actually turns it into a human.  What would the human look like?  And you can you can poke around and see some examples of what this thing has done.  I mean, look at that.  That's really cool.  Like that stick figure, you know, that that line tracing turned into an actual face with shading.  And I've just seen some really crazy results.  And it's just I wish I could come up with something half as awesome in my attempts to do this stuff.  Mine don't like that dog.  That looks really great.  I don't know.  It's a it's a cool thing to scare yourself with, I guess.  Horrifying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely horrifying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Horrifying.  Yes.  But fun at the same time.  Look for pics to pics photo generator and you can play around with it and see what kind of horrifying art you come up with.  It's just an interesting example of what A.I. is doing in this day and age.  And we're at the we're at the beginning of it all, it seems.  I think I think we did it.  I think we made it.  We channeled through the Google.  We dug ourselves through the Android.  And then we took a dip into the Facebook and Amazon waters a little bit as well.  And it was a lot of fun because I had both you guys on first, Kevin Marks, Kevin Marks dot com.  It's always fun to get the chance to do this with you, Kevin.  Thank you so much for staying up late with us.  Oh, I think your connection just just just went out.  I'll say bye to Ron.  I'll come back to you because I think I think it froze for a second.  Ron, we podcast a lot, but it's never enough.  Thank you for coming out of this week in Google today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My pleasure. Yeah, I know it was great.  Great to be here to talk about more than just Android.  Talk about Google, Facebook, all that fun stuff.  Yeah, thanks for having me.

Transcript:  Radical. And I mean, you're like deep in the current season of Twin Peaks, right?  At this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, we are. We are one third of the way through the new season of Twin Peaks.  Twin Peaks, the return on Showtime.  And we put out new episodes every Sunday night, Monday morning, right after right after we watch it, we record and we do our immediate impressions.  It's been a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right. I'm stalling, of course, also, because I'm hoping to get get Kevin back.  But I think Kevin might be lost to the wolves.  I think I think what happened is Kevin saw my pick and couldn't help himself.  And he got scared. He ran away.  I'm assuming if we get him back, we'll say a proper goodbye.  But I always enjoy podcasting with Kevin.  It's great to have my Kevin Marx dot com if you want to find out about all that he's up to in the open web,  which is very close to his heart, as you've heard on this show before.  So a big thanks to Kevin for taking time out of his night to join us.  And as for me, I'm Jason Howey.  You can find me all over the network.  Of course, I do tech news today every day with Megan Moroney.  Do all about Android with Ron and a whole lot of other things on the network and occasionally fill in here on this week in Google.

We had some folks in studio watching for a while.  That was a lot of fun. But you can do it virtually just by going there.  And of course, you can find the show on demand at twig.tv slash twig.  And big thanks to John, big thanks to Carson as well for helping out here in the studio and getting everything all coordinated with the show,  because I always have a lot of fun doing it.
