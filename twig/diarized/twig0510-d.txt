It's time for twig this week in Google,  the show we cover the Googleverse, which  means everything, including Facebook, Twitter,  and the president's tweets.  Speaking of the president's tweets, here's Jeff Jarvis.  He is a professor.  How did Ari Melber put it last night?  He'd said it perfectly, I thought.  Professor of journalism at the Craig Newmark  Graduate School of Journalism, something like that.  Yeah, he didn't do the whole.  He got it right.  Tao professor for.  Yeah, and then call you.  The whole segment would be over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, and he didn't call you former TV guide critic either.  That was somebody messing with you in the control room,  I swear to God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, or just I'm on the list of who the hell is this guy?  I don't know.  I'm just a TV guide, don't I?  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Look him up.  Google him.  What does it say?  Jeff, as always, welcome to buzzmachine.com.  What would Google do?  The books, many of them, at Jeff Jarvis on Twitter,  also with us from the Columbia Journalism Review,  where he's chief digital writer, Matthew Ingram.  Great to have you, cjr.org, n-a-t-h-e-w-i on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I always get confused, Matthew.  What's the British, where do you get in trouble in the UK  with the two fingers?  Which way?  Oh yeah, because Churchill first did this, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The reverse way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's okay.  No, that's not okay.  That's not okay.  That's bad.  So he did this first.  And then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That means up your kilt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and then one of, this was the best part  of the darkest hour, was when the secretary sidles up to him  and says, Mr. Churchill, I do not think that means  what you think it means.  And from then on, he did it that way.  Yeah.  V for victory.  We were doing V for victory backwards  for those just listening.  Backwards is wrong, forwards is right.  Your hand should be towards.  The peace sign, you know the peace sign.  Oh yeah.  Hey, I want to, before we get into the Google stuff,  today is the 100th anniversary of a very seminal event  in world history.  In 1919 on this day, there was a total eclipse of the sun.  But the reason it's important in world history  is because observations made during that total eclipse  confirmed Einstein's theory of relativity.  Ah.  Made him famous.  And it literally made him famous.  Yep.  Because until then it was like, oh yeah, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He was a patent clerk.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh that Al, he's always saying crazy things.  But imagine, I mean 1919, they proved that  based on measurements from two different places  on the earth of the eclipse,  they proved that relativity was correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It was the bending of the light, I think.  Yep, light bending.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Pretty neat.  Yeah.  Show that graph, Karsten, a little bit.  Keep going, there you go.  So the apparent location of the star  was different than the actual location of the star  because the sun bent the light.  You wouldn't have been able to see that  if you hadn't had the sun obscured,  which of course in its corona, the light.  Jeff, you were right.  So how did that prove relativity?  Well, he predicted light bending.  He predicted that gravity would bend light.  Would bend the light.  And everybody said, come on Al.  That's crazy.  That's crazy.  That's crazy talk.  Weird Al Einstein, they called him up to that point.  Verut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You saw that one right, Jeff.  You remember that.  I think you probably wrote it up in whatever,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the Tribune, the New York Herald Tribune.  All right, now we get onto the modern times.  A hundred years later, nobody doubts Einstein,  but everybody doubts global warming.  Meanwhile, tornadoes ravage the Midwest.  And you in New York,  well, I don't know if you got it in New Jersey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's coming through in about four minutes  according to dark sky.  We're gonna get a big storm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So first time I can remember New York City  getting a tornado warning.  And we just did Finish Windows Weekly,  Paul Thurotte, who's in the lower Mekongi Valley  of New Jersey near Allentown,  was on a standing alert during the entire show  that a tornado could pass through.  Oh really?  Yeah.  Wow.  And of course, many died in Alabama yesterday,  Missouri devastated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Did you see the clip of the weatherman who,  the weatherman who was checking social media  and people were complaining.  They were pissed.  They said, don't, we're watching basketball.  The Bachelorette.  Oh, it was the Bachelorette?  Yeah.  And he, so he was checking social media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He did a split screen, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, that was the other guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, too important for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But he said he was checking social media  and he said, we're getting complaints.  Can't we go back to the show?  And he just lost it.  He was like, no, we can't go back to the show.  People are going to die.  We're saving lives.  This is a tornado.  But this was a show some other time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This was Paul's reaction too is, well, I don't know.  I'm going to keep doing the show.  I'm saying Paul, go to the basement.  Weatherman snaps on live TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  When you live in those places, maybe you get used to it.  And so you think, so what?  It's not that big a deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, probably nine times out of 10,  you get a tornado warning, nothing happens.  Yeah.  It's pretty good video by the way.  The 10th time.  Should we play that?  Yeah, yeah, that's fun.  Let's roll the clip, Karsten.  Can you do that?  Do you have the capability or should I do it?  Something is technically, Twitter failed us.  That's not a good sign.  Twitter has failed us.  I haven't seen a Twitter error message in a long time.  That's a-  Yeah, where's the whale?  That's a, but that's the same, that's our friend Ming.  What's her name?  I forgot what her name is, but I have one  of her illustrations.  She was the woman who created the fail whale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  There we go.  Team coverage.  Whoa.  Twitter gets to everybody eventually.  I'm done with you people, I really am.  This is-  Holy cow.  Yeah.  Dangerous situation here.  ABC 13 WSET.  I'm just, it just really bothers me that we have people  that don't care about other people's safety around here.  That's just ridiculous.  New tornado warning here.  Wow.  People were dying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was serious, very serious.  Yeah.  But not as serious as the Bachelorette.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm trying to remember where it was,  but he was actually fired for breaking into a football game  with a weather alert.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, Jeff and I are old enough to remember  the Heidi incident.  Oh yeah.  Heidi.  That changed television forever.  I'm trying to say that with a serious face, but it did.  The networks had scheduled a running of Heidi during,  was it a Raiders game?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I forget who.  Yeah.  Jets Raiders, 1968.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Those Jets fans are really mean.  In the middle of the game, 1968.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Monica to Charlie Smith.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In the middle of the game.  Heidi comes on.  Touchdown Jets.  And they just break away.  Here, let me, let me jump ahead.  Well, wait a minute.  This is just the game.  Oh, oh, I get it.  This happened after the network started broadcasting Heidi.  Oh right.  That was it, yeah.  So the Raiders score, but nobody saw it  cause they were watching some girl in the house.  Nobody had internet to get.  Right.  No other way of knowing.  So people were furious.  Oh.  This was, this was an AFL championship game.  And of all things, Heidi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Somebody in the YouTube comments says,  what the hell?  I came here to watch Heidi.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Not that Heidi isn't great.  Ha ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But after that, the networks were very loathed  to preempt anything for anything.  The Heidi game, the world famous Heidi game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Wow.  I was six, I think, so I missed that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stop that, will you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Stop that.  He's just lording it over us.  Just stop it.  You guys born in the 70s.  The 60s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Whatever.  Whatevs.  All right.  Moving, moving on.  I'm sure there's actually some Google news in here somewhere.  Google's gold.  As long as we're talking science,  Google had a, they spent a pittance on it.  A cold fusion project.  Spent 10 million, which is nothing  in the world of cold fusion.  There, they found no evidence whatsoever  that fusion is possible at room temperature.  That's pretty conclusive.  It seems like they, you know, they came up.  Why would they do that?  Yeah.  In 2015, because there was research,  somebody claimed, a pair of scientists claimed that-  Yeah, it was Stanley Pons and,

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  what was the other guy's name?  Fleischman, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, Fleischman and Pons.  Wow, now you do have a good memory.  There was a news conference.  Universities of Utah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they claimed-  You were what, three years old then, Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  But he was interested in science by that time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They said, we've solved the energy problems for the world.  That's cold fusion is gonna work.  It worked in the lab.  And then it was just completely repudiated.  It turned out to just be a pond scheme.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ha, pond scheme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh.  So-  Well, this is just basically Google fact checking is all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oddly, because it was debunked almost immediately.  You know, it didn't, wasn't like,  well, they're still wondering, can it be done?  But they awarded $10 million, almost like an X prize,  to 30 researchers in labs around the world saying,  here, revisit these experiments for cold fusion.  Researchers published a dozen individual papers.  In Monday's Nature, they sum up the findings  of Google's investigation saying no evidence whatsoever.  But Nature, in an editorial, said,  Google's investment wasn't for naught.  The project has produced materials, tools, and insights,  such as calorimeters that operate reliably  under extreme conditions and techniques for producing  and characterizing highly hybrid materials  that could benefit other areas of energy and fusion research.  But whether the spinoff benefits alone  justify continued efforts and investment  in pursuit of a probable pipe dream is another matter.  Opinions are split.  Now, kudos for Google,  but $10 million to Google is nothing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, and I guess when you think about it,  if they had actually found evidence,  that would be pretty huge for Google.  I mean, their power needs are massive.  God, yeah.  Oh, do you think they actually,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  that was the real reason is that,  well, maybe we could use cold fusion in our server room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay.  There was a bit of a tempest in a teapot yesterday.  We saw that Google's new YouTube  was apparently blocking  Microsoft's new chromium-based edge.  And people found the offending string that said,  if it's edge, don't play.  Say your browser's not compliant.  However, they were able to change the user agent in edge  and get YouTube to work, so there was no technical reason.  It apparently was a mistake  because Google reversed the code and everything,  and it does now work fine.  So the question, a lot of people blamed Google saying,  see, we told you Google would never allow Microsoft  to base edge on a chromium.  No, no.  Even Paul Therotte said, no, that's crazy.  That was a mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It does seem like even if you were gonna do that,  you wouldn't be that obvious about it.  Like you wouldn't just put a line in saying,  don't play if it's edge.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was kind of blatant.  Yeah.  It was pretty obvious.  Easy to find even.  It was an unobscured JavaScript.  So, okay.  Big article in the New York Times  about Google's use of contract employees.  I wanted you to address this a little bit, Jeff,  because it's been my experience,  this is very common practice in all Silicon Valley companies.  Microsoft doesn't, and many companies don't hire employees.  They hire firms who hire employees,  and those contract employees save them a lot of money.  Although, this seems pretty egregious.  About half of Google's employment is contract employees.  Yeah, over half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's do things about this.  One is others do it, right?  Connie Nash did it.  Vox has a union now, and there's a confuffle today  about how they're hiring freelancers.  But the thing I don't know about the Google story is,  if it's the person delivering your groceries,  should that be the same permanence  as a software engineer at Google?  If it's the person who's answering customer service?  And I don't mean to degrade their work,  but to a Google, they're more interchangeable.  Yeah, this doesn't say much.  And so it's not just about saving money.  It's about potentially what the relationship is.  Now, there was a few years ago,  security guards on campus were not Google employees.  They were hired outside, and there was a confuffle,  and they were brought on to staff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, let me just say something about that.  Because we have an armed guard, a security guard,  Moe, who's great, you met him.  Really great guy, former Marine,  well-trained in the use of firearms, I might add.  But we can't hire him,  because our insurance would go through the roof,  because he has a firearm.  And so we hire a security company.  He works for the security company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would like to have him in a twit cop uniform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I want a twit cop, I do.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a good idea.  Maybe we should hire him just for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But that makes sense.  But if I look at the numbers,  this is the New York Times got an internal document,  and it said as of March, Google had 121,000,  yeah, it's more than 50%, 121,000 temps and contractors,  this is globally, compared to 102,000  full-time employees.  So it's gotta be more than just the security guard out front.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Do you remember what Kevin did for them?  I can't remember what he did.  Kevin Toffle was not an employee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And Kevin pointed out that when you're not an employee,  it's a very weird position if you're in the Googleplex,  because you can't eat in some of the cafeterias,  you can't come to the all-hands meetings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Your access card only gets you into certain buildings.  You're really a second-class citizen.  And I think if they have that many,  I could see, like you said, the occasional position  or maybe a few people in a division,  but that's over 50% of their entire staff.  Seems like a lot.  And they don't get any benefits, they get paid less.  I mean, that seems pretty egregious to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What do you think, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, again, I go to a place like Connie Nast,  it's common practice.  And the majority of the people who did work for Connie Nast  were freelancers.  I'm not saying that's right.  And indeed, US law is now such that,  I know when I try to hire people now,  it is really hard to hire somebody not as an employee.  I end up having to bring people onto staff  for a four-week gig.  Bring one on staff, I've got to pay benefits  to the university, I've got to do all that stuff,  because you can't come on as a consultant or a freelancer  unless you have a business doing that.  And you can prove it with a client list and business cards  and stationary and all kinds of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's an IRS regulation.  The IRS has for years been cracking down on this practice  because a lot of businesses avoided benefits.  That was the chief reason to do it.  Avoided benefits by hiring temps or contract employees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The New York Times story quotes someone saying,  you can save $100,000 a year per job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's, yeah, depends what you're paying them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So you've got 121,000.  That's a lot of money.  Contractors, that's a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This reminds me a lot of the Dutch sandwich  and the Irish wraparound  or whatever those tax maneuvers are.  They're not illegal.  That they're taking advantages of loophole in the law  to make more money.  And I guess on the one hand,  especially publicly held corporations  have a fiduciary responsibility,  their shareholders, to take advantage of these loopholes  since they are legal.  My tax attorney always used to say,  we don't use them anymore,  Leo, pay no, not a penny less than you owe  and not a penny more than you should.  Whatever.  The idea is if there's a loophole  and you don't take advantage of it,  you're not doing your job.  So I'm sure Google would defend this in the same way.  Look, this is legal.  And then the minute it's not legal, then we'll stop.  It's not right any more than the Irish runaround is.  But that's not how it works in the United States.  And the thing that bothers me is  the reason it's that way is because corporations  spend lots of money on political action committees  and lobbyists and elections  to keep the laws in their favor.  And it's too bad.  Anyway, we use temp employees.  You guys don't work for Twit.  But when you're in the building, you're an employee.  So I mean, I guess in a way,  you could say the same thing about Twit.  Probably half of our employees  or more than half are contractors.  But it's exactly as you said, Jeff,  they fit the IRS requirement,  which is they do this for a living with other clients.  That's why we never stop people from having other podcasts  generally, it's supposedly the schedule is your own.  You're not told you have to be here at a certain time.  That's not the case for you guys.  But on the other hand, when you have to be out of town,  you go and Stacey-  You're very forgiving.  I think that's the law.  You think I would let you take time off if I didn't have to?  You could dock our measly pay.  Yes.  Yeah, actually you don't get paid when you're not here,  but that's also a benefit of a temp or a contractor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of a temp, yeah, that's the thing.  That's flexible on both sides.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yep, you pay them only when they work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But it feels to me as though someone could craft a law  so that if 52% of your staff are contractors,  that crosses some threshold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and part of this is exacerbated by the fact that  the IRS has been significantly cut back  on its ability to enforce.  They don't have a huge enforcement ability anyway.  So the IRS has essentially been gutted.  So you can get away with it even.  Even if it's not strictly legal,  you have to get an interpretation.  You have to get the IRS, you have to get tax court  to say no, it's not legal.  You could say, well, I believe so.  Well, okay, the tax court says no,  but there's, I don't know how many judges,  there's eight or nine judges in the tax court.  There's not a lot of them.  The IRS has 9,000 auditors down a third from 2010.  Yeah.  Last time the IRS had fewer than 10,000 revenue agents  was 1953 and the economy was one seventh  of its current size at that time.  And it's still shrinking.  The IRS conducted 675,000 fewer audits in 2017  than it did in 2010, a drop in the audit rate of 42%.  So that's the other side of this is if it's not enforced,  you can, I mean, there's clearly a case to be made.  Although these are real contractors.  And then if the IRS disagrees, they have to pursue it.  And if they don't have the resources to do so, they won't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And the New York Times story says that  about 10 years ago, it was only a third of employees  and now it's over half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but again, the kinds of functions  that have been added.  Yeah.  They could be driving Waymo vehicles.  Literally delivering groceries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Or content moderation or.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, same with Facebook and their content moderators.  They've reportedly hired 30,000 of them.  I think the vast majority are through  contracted agencies, companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Email messages about workplace security concerns  that go to full-time staff are often not shared  with contract workers.  In a letter to Sundar Pichai,  temp workers complained the company sent security updates  only to full-time employees during that shooting  at YouTube's offices last year.  Contractors weren't told there's an active shooter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They were also.  I wonder if they even had a Google email address.  They probably had their own independent email address.  They weren't on a company group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  YouTube says that was an oversight.  Yeah, well, it was.  So yeah, I don't know what to make of this.  It wouldn't be, they wouldn't be doing it  if it weren't legal.  Or at least if there weren't a reasonable interpretation  that it's legal.  But since that interpretation stands,  unless the IRS is-  There's always a fight about this.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is a constant battle, I know.  And we're very careful.  We outsource payroll and HR to a payroll company,  and they are the ones who enforce,  and they have very strict rules.  And we always try to adhere to all those rules,  because nobody wants the Spanish Inquisition.  Huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here's another.  The New York Times blowing the lid off Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We won't question their motives in all of this.  But according to the Times,  and this is a great article by Brian X. Chen,  who we know well, he's been on our show many times,  and Cade Metz, two really good tech reporters.  A lot of times, Google Duplex uses humans.  In fact, maybe more often than not.  So you know that great demonstration  where Google Duplex made a booking.  Well, here's an example.  So what Cade and Brian did is they went out  and they made reservations,  but they went to the restaurant ahead of time,  because they're the New York Times,  and said, look, we're gonna do this.  We just wanna see what happens.  Here's a Google Assistant call with a Lao Tai kitchen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hello, I'm calling to make a reservation for a client.  I'm calling from Google, so they'll call me if you record it.  Do you think you're available for Sunday, May 19th?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh, yes, sir, and yeah,  we would love to take your reservation.  And for how many people, sir?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's just for a party of two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I'm sorry, can you repeat that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's just for a party of two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That's pretty good, right? Oh, for a party of two, okay.  And your name, sir?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The first name is C-A-D-E.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  C-A-D-E, K-D, I'm sorry, C-A-D-E?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep, that's correct, you got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And K-D, two people for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's amazing, isn't it, what AI can do?  Well... Except that's a human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Except that's a guy, yeah.  It sounded very real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They haven't invented Irish AI yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, I think it would use an Irish accent,  but in this case, it was a human.  Google later confirmed to our disappointment  the caller hadn't been telling the truth.  He was a person working in a call center.  The company said, Google said,  about 25% of calls placed through Duplex start with a human.  And in about 15%, a human intervenes.  So somebody's always listening.  We tested Duplex for several days,  calling more than a dozen restaurants.  Our tests showed a heavy reliance on humans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That makes sense, though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Out of four successful bookings,  three were done by real people.  It did sound good when it was a bot, but...  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Wasn't Facebook, remember Facebook M when they...  Yeah, that was all humans, too, right?  Yeah, except they pretended to be AI.  So they wanted you to think it was AI,  but it was actually human beings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So they did the same in Northern California,  and this was the only reservation  that used Google AI all the way through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Hello, Barcelona, may I help you?  Hello?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hello?  Hi, I'm calling to make a reservation.  I'm Google's automated booking service,  so I'll record the call.  Could I book a table for Tuesday the 21st?

Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Okay, hello?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd like to make a reservation for a client  for Tuesday the 21st.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Okay, actually, how many people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's for 10 people.  I think the bot's doing pretty well.  10 people, okay, what time?  At 7 p.m.  7 p.m., okay.  I need a table for 7 p.m.  Oh, that was a giveaway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Okay, 7 p.m., okay.  And then, is there any case?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm actually booking on behalf of a client,  so I'm not too sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not too sure?  That was a good answer.  It's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Okay, so please be on time at 7 p.m.  on Tuesday, right?  Yeah.  Okay, I can put you in the reservation book.  So, see you on Tuesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, would you like the client's name now?  Yes.  Ooh.  That was clever.  The first name is Cade.  Bot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Okay, Cade, okay, what is the last name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Last name, Matt.  Matt, okay, what is the telephone number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The bot announced Cade's name properly,  the human did not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, I'm impressed.  The restaurant's owner, Mr. Park,  said everything was perfect,  it's like a real person talking.  And he was very impressed with how it handled  the question about children and the kids in the party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It was impressive.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So.  This just seemed like a gotcha story.  I think the problem here is that Google  put a service out as a test  before they had enough capabilities,  so they had to supplement with people.  I don't think it's a,  I think it's a little bit funny,  but I don't think it's any kind of shocking event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I guess the issue is,  a lot of times tech companies will offer the moon.  They really wanna do the sci-fi,  isn't this amazing?  And it is always a little disappointing to know  that it doesn't really work that well  and that humans have to do,  like with them and with this.  Neither Google nor Facebook's really hidden this fact,  but they also don't mention it.  It's not like Sundar Pichai stood on stage and said,  how about that Google,  now by the way, half the time it'll be a human,  but,  cause I think they over,  I think this is the real complaint.  And I would share this.  They over, tech companies tend to oversell  what they can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think that's happening now with Tesla and the,  Oh yeah.  You know, there's been a lot of backlash  about how sort of automation is not,  it's not functional in the way that Tesla  would like you to think it is.  Well, and that's bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's bad because it can kill people.  Right, right.  That's not a minor detail.  So which story are you referring to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was one I saw today,  I was on the rundown saying that the lane change,  Oh yeah, consumer reports.  Consumer reports tested the lane change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, so consumer reports,  who has historically been critical of autopilot,  we should point this out,  tested this new feature.  So one of the features that Tesla started to roll out  is the ability right now when you use autopilot,  you really wait, you can't,  you could sort of do it on a back road,  but it certainly wouldn't navigate through town  because it doesn't see stop signs,  it doesn't see red lights.  You really use it,  I use it on the highway only when lanes are clear  and you just want it to kind of,  it's basically fancy cruise control.  You just wanted to stay in the lane.  Is your family okay with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  Or are you doing it alone?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I wouldn't see.  Lisa does not trust it.  She believes that the car has several times  tried to throw her into a guardrail,  so she will not use it.  I certainly don't trust it.  I mean, I keep,  and Tesla does a lot to make sure  you're keeping your hands on the wheel.  They do, yeah.  They'll actually,  they'll spank you.  And really?  Yeah, well, not literally,  but it's like being spanked.  I feel like I'm chastised like a child  because if you don't have your hands on the wheel  after the third reminder to do that,  it'll go beep, beep, beep,  and puts a big red thing on your speedometer  that says,  because you're not keeping your hands on the wheel,  you may no longer use autopilot until the next ride.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No soup for you.  I gotta take a picture of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  because I mean, I feel spanked.  I feel seriously chastised by my freaking car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Gosh darn it.  And my attitude is, I'm such a teenager.  Well, you didn't tell me.  What do you mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Anyway, it does alert you.  It says put your hands on the wheel,  show that you're using it.  I always keep my hands on the wheel,  but the way it's set up,  which is unfortunate,  is you actually have to torque the wheel a little bit.  It's got a torque sensor.  Some other cars like the new Cadillac  has a capacitance sensor,  so you don't have to turn the wheel  for it to know you're there.  It could feel your hands.  But the Tesla, you have to kind of slightly jiggle the wheel,  which is annoying.  It's ridiculous.  So you're sitting here,  you're driving.  It's like old movies,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  like making believe you're driving.  Yeah.  Doing this, yeah.  Yeah, you're going like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I do that,  but I mean, sometimes you forget,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  then they'll say,  come on, show us your here,  and then do it three times.  The third time, or second time,  it beeps at you.  But if you miss that,  then it gives you the,  and several times.  Then you hear Elon's voice.  You are not driving.  So in order to get the Holy Grail for Elon,  which is not level five,  but maybe level three,  would be that you could do it  as you're leaving,  turn on autopilot,  if you have navigation engaged,  and it would get you to where you're going.  So it would know how to get on the,  turn left here.  It would do all that.  That is a long way off.  But a step towards that is they've turned on a feature,  not on my car,  but on more modern cars with better hardware.  Normally when you're doing autopilot,  and you want a lane change,  you do the turn signal.  Theoretically, the car checks,  theoretically the car checks.  It speeds up a little bit and changes lanes.  It has been my experience that the car doesn't check well.  So I never do it without looking first,  and then I do it.  Well, you can now turn it off and say,  well, anytime you feel like it,  you may change lanes.  Consumer Reports says,  at least several times it cut,  it did it at a bad time.  It cut off the car behind it,  or it broke state law.  It didn't specify how it broke state law,  but they said it's dangerous.  You shouldn't use this.  And this is not anything new.  I think Tesla, even by calling it autopilot,

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  is perhaps-  Yeah, I think there's been a lot of sort of over marketing,  Yeah.  You know, or over selling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He also, last month at an event,  said that he thought Tesla owners  would be able to make $30,000 a year  by leasing out their Tesla.  He said, but this should happen by next year.  From our standpoint, if you fast forward a year,  maybe a year and three months, I like how-  See, this is one trick, by the way, kids.  If you want to lie, be very specific.  Okay, a year and three months.  Next year for sure,  we'll have over a million robo-taxis on the road.  He said this last month.  The fleet wakes up with an over-the-air update.  That's all it takes.  All we have to do is turn it on.  He says, Tesla owners, we know,  because we have all the numbers,  only drive their car two out of the 24 hours of a day.  So we'll have a switch that a Tesla owner can turn on  that makes your car a ride-sharing vehicle  that can be hailed.  We'll go pick somebody up, take them to where they want,  automatically charge them, just like Uber,  and you could make up to $30,000 a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I mean to ask you, boss.  This is not gonna happen in a year and three months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Plus, the sensors and processing power that's on a Tesla  versus what Google's putting onto its cars  with LIDAR and all this stuff.  I know Elon makes fun of LIDAR  and says it's unnecessary because he doesn't have it.  I cannot believe that he believes  there is sufficient technology on an existing Tesla  to be a self-driving car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, in his defense, he has said, he's tweeted.  I'm sad that we have to report tweets as fact,  but anyway, he's tweeted that he doesn't believe  LIDAR is necessary.  That's a very big expense.  He could just do it with cameras,  and everybody said, ha ha,  because there's no LIDAR on Teslas.  However, and I wish I'd had the source of the study,  but I just saw a study that said, no, Elon's right.  Cameras are sufficient.  You don't have to have LIDAR.  If you have properly configured cameras,  and by the way, Teslas also have some radar capability,  that's all you need.  You can do full level five self-driving,  so you don't have to have LIDAR.  That would save a lot of money.  In fact, one of the things Waymo works really hard to do,  and one of the things that they claimed  Corey Lewandowski stole from Waymo when he went to Uber  was this way to do LIDAR for a tenth the cost,  because it's about 10 or $11,000 for a car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wave says self-driving cars don't need sensors.  Experts aren't so sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No.  Mashable?  No, no.  When I saw the study, it was reliable.  Here it is.  Researchers back.  Oh, there we go.  Non-LIDAR approach to self-driving cars.  That's just one research opinion.  Well, let me show you.  The researchers found analyzing captured images  from a bird's eye view rather than  the more traditional frontal view  more than tripled their accuracy,  making a stereo camera viable  and low-cost alternative to LIDAR.  This is from Cornell,  paper called Pseudo-LIDAR from visual depth estimation,  bridging the gap in 3D object detection  for autonomous driving.  So because of that highly academic title, I believe them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you say it in a British accent, it's gospel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Cornell researchers are saying the data they captured  from stereo cameras was nearly as precise as LIDAR.  So I think Elon has a basis for what he said.  However, there's no way in a year, a year and a half,  two years or even five years, this kind of autonomy,  this level of autonomy will be available  to the owner of a Tesla vehicle.  I'm sorry, that just can't possibly be true.  Do you remember Summon?  I have Summon on my car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But the description, the initial description was  you could be across town.  Yeah, yeah, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And then when you get it, they said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  well, make sure your garage door is open.  And if you do Summon, it moves like a mile an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I've never used it, I have it on my car.  I suppose before I turned my Tesla back in in July,  I should probably try it once.  But I'm afraid, I don't want to.  I've seen too many Reddit reports of Summon bashing  into the car, the garage door,  the side of the wall or whatever.  You got a three ton vehicle,  even if it's moving in a mile an hour,  if it hits something, it's going to hit it.  And it might put, you know, it might bruise you.  Put a dent in it.  By the way, if Tesla owners turn their cars into robo taxis  and they kill somebody, who's responsible?  He says, Musk says, well, we would be, Tesla would be.  Not the cars.  Oh my God, I hope so.  Yeah.  He says, but the right thing to do is make sure  there are very few accidents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He also at one point said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  we're going to put a feature,  a more aggressive lane change feature in,  and there might be some fender benders,  but it'll be up to you whether you turn it on or not.  Maybe a few, what's a few fender benders?  I think we're more likely to get cold fusion next year  than we are self-driving Teslas, but who knows?  Elon, you know what?  Since we're bashing Elon, let's praise him for SpaceX  and these satellites that they put up.  This was pretty incredible, right?  Although astronomers say Starlink could be a problem  because there are, with 12,000 low earth orbit satellites,  we're not going to ever be able to do astronomy again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, what's the event that Daniels-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Kessler syndrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Kessler syndrome, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So this is an astronomer in Georgia saw this.  Remember, so just to recap, it was a week and a half ago now,  so I figure you all know that SpaceX launched  the first Falcon, was it a nine rocket,  with 60 Starlink satellites.  Eventually they hope to get 12,000 satellites  in low earth orbit and provide high speed internet  to every corner of the globe.  Right after the launch, the satellites deployed,  this is what a Georgia astronomer caught on video,  those are the satellites.  Now they're not yet fully deployed,  so they won't be all in a line like that,  but if you have 12,000 objects that bright in the sky,  astronomers are very concerned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They will only be visible at sunrise or sunset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, so this is the sun bouncing.  Oh, all right, that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  He's already said, Musk has already said  that the rest of them, they're going to coat  with something non-reflective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Should reduce the reflective.  Maybe like, you know, maybe they'll have  stealth satellites by then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But it's only when it catches the sun, right?  So in the middle of the night,  you'll be able to see stars, no problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They, of course, are all autonomous.  By the way, this is where autonomy becomes very important,  and they have Krypton jets that they can realign  their orbit because it's very important they not collide.  They, it would be, it would more than double the number,  I think it triples the number of satellites in orbit  around the earth, and the Kessler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  There are 2,000 satellites currently in orbit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So.  That's gonna be six times.  Six times more.  Yes.  There'll be 14,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And that is one concern is the clutter,  just the sheer volume of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's where the Kessler syndrome is a cause for concern.  This is an astronomer back in the 70s who said,  and there have been a number of science fiction novels  based on this, if you were to have a collision  and they would create more space debris,  at some point you'd start having a lot of collisions.  You'd have a kind of exponential increase  in the number of collisions, and pretty soon,  there would, the entire sphere would be, you know,  would be surrounded by space to the degree that  the planet would die, and if it didn't,  the bigger problem would be you could no longer  send anything into space because something would hit it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Remember the scene in Wally?  It's just like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There are seven eaves, which is a great Neil Stephenson novel.  I was just thinking about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, where the bits of the moon collide and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the Kessler syndrome.  Yeah.  And that brings us to another Neil Stephenson story.  He's got a, I cannot wait, I'm already, I pre-ordered it.  He's got a new novel coming out June 3rd  in a couple of days called Fall or Dodge in Hell.  The hybrid sci-fi fantasy novel begins in the present day  with Richard Dodge for thrust,  an eccentric multi-billionaire who made his fortune  in the video game industry.  When a freak accident during a routine medical procedure  leaves his brain dead, the family's left to contend  with his request to have his brain preserved  until technology exists to bring him back to life.  The near future world of Fall is full of buzzwords  and concepts, we know, augmented reality headsets,  next-gen wireless networks, self-driving vehicles,  facial recognition, quantum computing,  blockchain and distributed crypto all feature prominently.  Neil's always been great on that kind of stuff.  In fact, his novel Snow Crash kind of presaged  the metaverse, this whole idea of living in a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know he was a consultant to Amazon, right?  To Blue Origin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, still is.  Yeah, I didn't know that.  Whether he does anything important, I don't know.  So they asked him an interview, where is this?  PC Magazine asked him, how would you describe  the current state of the internet?  Just in a general sense of its role in our daily lives  and where that concept of the miasma,  characters in the novel refer to the miasma,  that's the internet and social media.  And he says, I end up having a pretty dark view of it  as you can tell from the book.  I saw someone recently describe social media  in its current state as a doomsday machine  and I think that's not far off.  We've turned over our perception of what's real  to algorithmically driven systems  that are designed not to have humans in the loop  because well, if humans are in the loop,  they're not scalable and if they're not scalable,  they can't make tons and tons of money.  Jeff, is that moral panic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Moral panic is more when you're blaming your problems  on something than that.  Yeah, it's not really when you're anticipating  some dystopia, it's just dystopia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We kind of do, I mean, he's kind of right about this,  that we've optimized the algorithms to such a degree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Does it count as moral panic if it's right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Maybe we should be panicking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's Karsten by the way, that ethereal voice  we should expect.  The voice of Harvard.  Yeah, the voice of Harvard weighing in.  Stevenson goes on to say,  the result is the situation we see today  where no one agrees on what factual reality is  and everyone is driven in the direction of content  that's quote more engaging, end quote,  which almost always means it's more emotional,  it's less factually based, it's less rational.  I think he's right.  Yeah, kind of destructive from a basic civic standpoint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So number one, that's what media has done for 100 years.  But Jeff, it's never done it so well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's worse now.  It's done it, it's never done it so well,  so it wasn't a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Two, research and I constantly quote  Rasmus Kleist Nielsen of the Oxford Reuters Institute  for the Study of Journalism.  Every time somebody says filter bubble, he says,  sorry, can't find any studies that say  there actually is a filter bubble  and he has plenty of studies that say that it's not.  So this notion that we're sent to this thing  that we already agree with and we dig into deeper,  the research is not to date showing that,  not that it couldn't, but so far it has not.  Now, okay, I take it back, it's moral panic.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But I think his point about the algorithm  prioritizing engagement is real.  Well, that's true, we know that's true.  I think that's real.  Yeah.  And so I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's exactly what media's always done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right, but this is much, much bigger and faster  and stronger than media has ever been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And saying that's what media has already always done.  Doesn't mean it's good.  Doesn't mean it's good.  Because of cable news, my kids,  people look at me funny when I let my kids walk to school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  Isn't that, you are nuts.  Don't you know there's stranger danger, Karsten?  Yeah.  The World Health Organization on May 25th  voted to add gaming disorder as an illness  to their diagnostic manual, the ICD, a behavioral addiction.  According to the World Health Organization,  it's not enough to be a video game fan,  nor does it count the number of hours spent playing.  A video game addict is someone with an inability  to stop playing even though it interferes  with other areas of one's life,  such as family, relationships, school, work, and sleep.  These problems would typically continue  for at least a year.  I think you could add Facebook.  Next year it'll be Facebook disorder, right?  Although here's a solution from Joe Pinsker  writing in The Atlantic.  And I think this almost makes me wanna go back to Facebook.  How I try to defy the Facebook algorithm.  The social network is predictable and dreary.  My quest to make it random and fun.  He says that because you follow friends and stuff,  you end up in, it's not quite a filter bubble,  but it sort of is.  He had a term he used.  Let me see if I can find it.  But basically you make everything kinda the same.  So what he's done, and I didn't know about this,  but there's apparently a,  I guess it's a Chrome extension called Noisyfy.  Which pop- It's a randomizer.  It populate, populates,  it adds noise to your Facebook activity.  It does random searches.  And then as a result, you'll start getting all sorts of  random stuff in your feed, which she says is,  or he says is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I actually did that on Twitter as well.  I started following people who were interested in things  that were completely different  than the things I was interested in,  or people who shared sort of random weird things,  because I wanted to try and randomize the feed  instead of seeing the same things all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So we need a new bumper sticker instead of saying  subvert the dominant paradigm.  It says, I don't know, subvert the dominant algorithm.  Randomize, yeah.  Randomize your algorithms.  I think this is kinda cool.  The guy who wrote it,  Max Hawkins apparently also built a tool  that had Uber drop him off at random locations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I read that one.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right, cause we always go to the same places.  I like that.  Then he built a tool that randomly picked Facebook events  for him to attend and he would go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, and didn't he randomize Spotify too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yep.  He tried listening to music picked randomly by Spotify,  wearing clothes bought randomly on Amazon,  growing out random styles of facial hair  and arranging phone calls with friends  on randomly selected topics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, and tattoos.  He got a random tattoo.  He got a random tattoo.  So he gets a bunch of random junk.  Got a random tattoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He says, I was really worried  it was gonna be anime porn or something  and I'd be stuck with it for the rest of my life,  but the computer selection was an abstract illustration  of a parent and child.  I super lucked out.  But he got the tattoo.  Hmm.  I don't know if I'd go.  Sort of an art project.  We should, Carson, let's try to get this guy, Max Hawkins.  I like him.  I would love to see the tattoo if nothing else.  You can compare tattoos.  My tattoo is not random.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Dropped off randomly in different places.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And I bet his is better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Every time I joined a group, Pinsker writes,  Facebook inferred that my new group mates  were people like me.  This is the algorithm at work, that I share their interests.  In other words, rather than being interested in them  precisely because I do not,  rather than being interested in them  precisely because I do not.  Even in groups, Facebook's not designed  to expand your social horizons.  It's designed to surface things that are relevant to you  and your offline peers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So another- That's right,  because you have the rest of the internet  for doing all the rest. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The more one pushes back against personalization,  the closer one gets to Max Hawkins' unfiltered,  randomized extreme.  And all the-  Otherwise known as mass media.  Yes.  Just why not, why don't we just go back to three channels?  Why don't you just read the New York Post  and you're there? Let's just go back to three channels.  Yeah.  There's a reason he says Chat Roulette  doesn't have the same market share as Skype.  My fellow serendipity seekers  had started to feel that exhaustion, it turns out,  even before I met them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Randomness is not the only reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Finally, he followed a baby rats groups  and he would just get pictures of baby rats in his feed,  which is a little unsettling, honestly.  The article, How I Hacked Facebook Ends,  "'It's certainly possible to battle the algorithms  "'and discover new vistas from which to assess one's life,  "'but the fight becomes wearying.  "'After a while, the baby rats start to look like,  "'well, baby rats.'"

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Meanwhile.  Meanwhile, back in the real world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have a new ability to get true random number generation.  Well, see, now that's a big deal.  I'm putting that up right now.  That's a big deal.  So- That is a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just as some background,  almost all computer programming languages  have a facility to generate random numbers for dice throws,  or there's all sorts of reasons you would use it,  but in every case, they're called pseudo  random number generators,  because it's very hard for a computer, actually,  to create something random.  And so there have been lots of attempts  to make a real random number generator.  Actually, my favorite is,  who are the folks who do 1.1.1?  Cloudflare.  Cloudflare has a random number generator  based on lava lamps.  And the reason is-  That's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Computers aren't very good at picking random numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's a little video from an English guy.  This is at Cloudflare's headquarters in San Francisco.  They have a wall of lava lamps,  because essentially the balls of lava are chaotic.  Yeah.  So what you need is chaos.  Steve Gibson has talked about using,  I think it was a diode to create, you need noise.  So this is an entropy wall  that is actually generating of lava lamps.  So what was the new way?  Quantum mechanics?  Yeah, well quantum random something.  Quantum entanglement.  You know, everything's better  with a little quantum entanglement.  And a little cold fusion while you're at it.  Yeah.  I think quantum entanglement is the blockchain  of the next couple of years.  So, Jeff, we're gonna take a break,  but when we come back,  I want you to talk about this Facebook workshop  you're about to participate in.  Yeah, or I was already there.  I can report from it. Oh, you did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good, I'd love to hear about it.  That's why I wasn't on the show last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, well, a report from the front.  From the field.  In just a moment, but first a word from our sponsor,  Capterra.  We love the Capterra.  I love it, not the least of the reasons I love it  is because people call me all the time on the radio show  and say things like,  oh, I run a yoga studio.  What software should I use?  I have to go, I don't know.  Because business software,  that's a whole different kettle of fish.  Line of business software is really important to you  in your business, whether you're a dentist,  a veterinarian, a plumber, a yoga studio.  But, you know, often we're using old, out-of-date software.  How many people still run Windows XP and IE8  because the software requires it?  Or worse, Joey wrote it.  He was the boss's nephew's first cousin.  Joey has disappeared, but we're still using this software.  No one knows how it works and no one can fix it.  People suffer, no need to go to capterra.com.  Capterra has tens of thousands of business programs  in 700 categories.  Some of the big categories like CRM,  IT project management, e-commerce,  link management tools, web conferencing,  search engine optimization,  and some more specific categories  like yoga studio management.  Choose the category you're looking for.  And then you can, first of all,  you'll find hundreds of programs in that category,  which is amazing, but then you can go a little further  by filtering based on ratings,  based on how the program works,  where it's stored if it's in the cloud or on your hard drive,  that kind of stuff.  Whether you can make appointments,  whether, you know, I mean, how many seats you can have,  all of that stuff.  Put them side by side.  And then here's the best part about capterra.  900,000 real reviews from real users  with a thousand more every single day.  That means you're gonna get up-to-date reviews  from actual users and there's no better way  to know if a program is right for you.  It is an amazing, amazing website.  And I kind of buried the lead.  You'd pay a lot for that, right?  It's free, free, absolutely free.  No, not freemium, no, you know, like, okay, now pay us.  No, none of that.  I hate that when that happens.  This is free and then they want money.  There's no, not at capterra.  It is absolutely free.  Go to capterra.com slash twig.  C-A-P-T-E-R-R-A dot com slash twig.  I'm gonna ask you a favor though.  Of course you could just go to capterra.com  and I think most people do,  but if you wanna help support this show,  use just that special URL.  You'll get the same site,  but that way they know you saw it here.  Capterra.com slash twig.  Capterra is software selection simplified.  We thank them so much for making this week in Google possible.  So Jarvis, what was this workshop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Facebook has held, I think, five workshops,  they call them, on their oversight board proposal,  which Zuckerberg talked about a few months ago.  Sometimes called their Supreme Court, Matter of Appeal,  but there's some debate about what it'll actually look like.  So they brought together, they did,  I think they've done in Asia,  they did the next ones in Berlin,  they did this one in New York  and they invited 40 people, including me,  academics, lawyers, civil society,  critics of theirs were there,  it was Chatham House rules, so I can't,  I'm not supposed to say names.  A lot of egos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But that's good, they had people who were unhappy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah, people who had been publicly critical of Facebook.  And then the idea was to try to sus this notion  of the oversight board.  And as is, Facebook's want, whenever they do events,  Matthew, were you at their local event in Denver, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Matthew, you're muted, is it us?  You're muted, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's not us?  No, no, it's me.  Okay, thanks.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're at their thing in Denver, yeah.  So they tend to overproduce things  and fill up the schedule  and I think that was the problem with this one.  But they took us through, interestingly,  what all they do now to try to moderate content.  And then took us through the oversight board,  they gave us a nice little booklet.  And in here, and they've already published this publicly,  the draft charter for the oversight board.  And then all of their current community practice,  community standards,  which amount to about 40 pages of statutes, basically.  So what they wanna do is have as many as 40 people  onto a universal board with,  they think three person, like appellate courts,  that would rule on things brought to the board.  Clearly there's an issue of scale here.  Facebook gets a million reports a day of things  that it then has 20 offices working in 50 languages,  24 seven around the world, judging this stuff.  And they judge it against the rules that they have.  I read a really good legal paper  and I think the Harvard Law Review by Kate Kloneck,  a really, really smart legal scholar  who quoted somebody else saying that what had happened  with the platforms is they went from a standards-based  structure to a rules-based structure.  Standards are, that's awful, that's evil,  we don't like that, that doesn't fit here,  we shouldn't have that, we know when we see it.  But that's exactly what Pinsker says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That doesn't scale, because that's humans.  Rules, scales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So rules scale, so they want rules.  But then the rules become ridiculous  and the enforcement becomes ridiculous  and you get problems like the napalm photo  and the child, yes, in danger, yes,  without clothes, yes, off.  So do you still need humans?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is that the final?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they have humans.  They have people in all of these offices doing this  and so they have three legs of the stool.  They have one division sets policy,  one division is product, they make the tools necessary,  and one division is operations, they enforce the rules.  And then there are appeals possible now  within that structure, but now they're looking  at having an external board.  And the good news is, well, all right, one more thing.  So the board's decisions would be final.  Facebook could not appeal them in turn.  And they can't fire somebody from the board.  I don't know how long it would take.  Oh, I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So this is the point of the board is have humans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, humans, but it's at a mental level.  So then we also ask, we spend a lot of time asking,  well, hold on, is this just about content takedowns  according to the rules you have?  Or is this about having an influence on policy?  Well, they're not gonna let an external board  make up policy, but they say it would have  an influence on policy, but what is that influence?  Unknown.  And so what struck me is the sincerity of what they do.  You talk to the people who are actually overseeing  the enforcement of these rules,  they gave us two case studies.  The whole thing was Chatham House Rule,  which I presume everybody knows what that is,  but for those who don't, you can take away any knowledge,  you can't quote someone without their explicit permission  and you can't say that someone who was there  without their permission.  They did try to get an NDA, I refused to sign it.  It was gonna be only about two case studies they had  because those case studies were real life  and they didn't want to get in trouble for privacy.  Instead, they didn't require the NDA in the end,  they just made it off the record.  I already agreed it was off the record,  you wouldn't use anything from those two case studies.  So they took us through those case studies  and then they had us say what we would think  and the room was split on both of them.  60-40 splits, these are not clear cut and easy decisions  and so they demonstrated that.  I had to leave to go to Hamburg  the night of the second thing,  so I left before the very final discussion.  And in the end, the problem here is,  so in the working group I'm part of  about internet regulation,  which I've talked about in the show before,  the one where we talked about the notion  of starting an internet court  to deal with matters of legality.  This in essence becomes a court  dealing with matters that are legal but undesirable.  And that would be within the company  or external to the company but not in courts.  So you end up having these layered structures of courts  trying to enforce rules.  It's all pretty complex  and the reason is, as you say Leo, it's scale.  Otherwise you can't have an algorithm find something,  you can't have staff across the world do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't see how that functions at the level of Facebook.  Just don't see how that's really listed.  I'm not sure either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think what it does Matthew is it says that it's not,  it is more of a Supreme Court in the sense that it says  that they're not gonna deal with nitty gritty appeals  but when they see an issue they wanna rule on,  it's almost like a Supreme Court granting certiorari,  we think that this is off and we wanna examine this  and we want some more research about the impact of this  and we wanna say no, that decision is wrong.  I think if you go back a few years,  breastfeeding could have come to the court.  Naked breasts are against the rules on Facebook period,  end of case, women come and say  breastfeeding or breast cancer, wrong, no, or art.  And Facebook says we don't know what to do  and then there's a court that rules,  it says no breastfeeding is no okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would not wanna serve,  because I'll tell you what,  you would end up being the scapegoat  for everything Facebook did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought so too Leo,  I asked a couple of really smart people in the room,  one major lawyer, one a kind of civil society person,  I said would you serve on this?  Surprisingly, except in conflicts and everything else,  they both said yeah.  They found the challenge fascinating.  Oh it's a challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh it's a challenge.  But I wonder, I mean yeah, I take it on face value,  they're all very sincere at Facebook and all this,  but in the long run, it's just a way of saying here.  Well okay, so there's this big steam pile of deliciousness.  Right, so many people to deal with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  Or yeah, it's either you're outsourcing problems,  it's a sincere effort to get input  from outside the place and accountability,  that's possibility one.  Possibility two is it's outsourcing the problems  and sloughing them off.  Possibility three is just PR.  It's all three, I guarantee you it's all three.  I think it's all three of those things.  Yeah.  So it depends on the mix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, now Zuckerberg can say hey, it's not my fault.  We have a problem solved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We asked our panel.  And by the way, it's interesting they chose  such a large panel, 40 people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, so you're talking to the whole damn world?  It's large enough that it will never come  to an agreement on anything.  Well, no, you have three person judges

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  deal on a given case.  Now how do they get consistency across all of those?  I don't know.  So you have a tribunal.  But this is also, they had to do this to get diversity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but who decides the three people?  Is it Lava Lamps at Cloudflare's office?  They haven't decided that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They haven't decided how to do that either.  Mark decides.  And that's an issue.  So now meanwhile, at the same time,  I don't think we've talked about this show yet.  The French came out with their regulatory proposal.  Which I don't think we've talked about in the show, have we?  It's actually very interesting.  And I met the guy who was in charge of it.  And I like him.  So what the French said was,  they did an experiment with Facebook  where they were embedded in Facebook for two months,  acting like a regulator,  trying to figure out how it would work.  No regulations underlying this,  trying to understand how it would work.  What they decided was that they did not want to try  to regulate what actually appears on a Facebook.  Instead, they want transparency and accountability  as to what Facebook warrants it will do  and whether it is effective in doing that or not.  And that's where they hold them accountable.  Which means that Facebook would have to have a set of rules  that they have, a compact, a covenant with the public.  Facebook would have to provide data to the regulator  so the data could judge what they do.  And the regulator could say,  you're not doing a good enough job,  you're not being accountable enough or transparent enough  against what you said you would do.  And what it would allow is for each service  to have its own standards, which I think is smart.  You're getting it in the UK and in Germany,  they're trying to get a universal standard  across all services, which I think is a fool's errand.  However, the French are only gonna deal  with the three or four largest services  with Facebook's companies, Google's and Twitter's,  pretty much, and not deal right now  with medium and small size.  But of course, that's where the bad guys are all gonna go.  And so they're looking at it in scale six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here's the diagram of how this works.  Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I complimented the person on his PowerPoint skills.  So simple.  So you have a lot of work.  Now, so one more point and then I'll stop,  which is a lie, but I'll promise you this.  Just like Facebook, I promise you.  What I, in the last meeting of the working group I'm on,  what really hit me was a strong argument  that no one should be, none of these services  should be trying, none of the governments  should be trying to regulate content.  That when you do that, you end up with forbidden speech.  Danger, danger, number one.  Number two, from the content alone,  you can't necessarily suss out the intent.  And so you have a choice of regulating the actors,  the behaviors, or the content.  And the content may be evidence in some cases,  but the belief of the group that I'm part of,  which includes this French regulator,  is that behavior is where you go.  And so, you know, was, because look at the Nancy Pelosi  video, right?  People who are saying they should take it down  because it's false.  That's a horrible standard.  That's an awful standard.  You don't want Facebook judging falsity.  And there have been plenty of videos  that slowed down Donald Trump to make fun of him  and make him sound drunk, but tons of those.  So is that content to be taken down?  Well, what does that do to the public discussion?  Is it instead of behavior that you say  is not acceptable on a platform,  if you're trying to manipulate people,  the public discussion?  That's hard, that's just as hard, if not harder to do.  That's what you're really trying to do.  And in the end, in the end, all of these efforts  are not trying to regulate platforms.  They're not trying to regulate technology.  They're trying to regulate human behavior  through an intermediary.  And it's the humans who are causing the problems here,  not the technology, and you've got all these efforts.  And part of the irony of this is  very little of this goes to the source.  What's happening now in Europe is that  when the platforms take down something that is illegal,  because in Germany, the platform must within 24 hours  take down anything that is manifestly illegal.  But what they're doing is they're taking it down  under their community standards,  and they're not reporting the illegal act to authorities.  So all we're doing is regulating the intermediary  and never going to the source of the illegal behavior.  And we're trying to get rid of human behavior,  but again, we're only doing it through the intermediary.  All of which is to say, we ain't there yet.  None of this makes sense, none of it.  And there are these efforts by government to step in  and say, in the case of the UK,  we're gonna get rid of illegal content,  but we're also gonna make you get rid of legal,  but harmful content.  That makes zero effing sense.  And so you talked earlier, Leo,  about how the platforms try to convince you  or the technology companies are gonna try to convince you,  we can deliver the world.  When all the regulators are trying to convince you,  we've come up with a solution.  Nobody has, end of rant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This editorial from the MIT Technology Review,  actually it's not an editorial, it's a story,  but it quotes a media lab researcher,  Hossein Darakshan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Darakshan, also known as Hodr, the,  well, that came on before that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Spent six years in jail for blogging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What?  He was the blog father in Iran.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, in Iran, okay, thank God, not here, okay.  Also part Canadian.  He calls it malinformation.  In other words, this is like the Pelosi video.  True information that's been subtly manipulated  to harm somebody.  I'm not fully happy with his final conclusion,  which is, Hodr agrees it's important to label videos  that have been fabricated in some way.  And by the way, I will give him standing  since he was in Iran.  He probably has a lot of experience with this.  But he says, the best solution  is nurturing media literacy.  That's where we always come down to is,  we just need a smarter constituency.  I think the point is.  Or one that is resilient.  Yeah, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So Alexios Manzarlis,  who used to run the fact checking network,  mentions that piece that the risk is if,  if you say Facebook should take down  a slightly manipulated video of Nancy Pelosi,  then you really give them free rein to take down  just about anything.  If it's, because it's not technically fake.  Do you think that labeling it as they did

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  was the right thing to do, Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So my issue was with the labeling.  I think they should have just said,  this is a manipulated video.  Instead, they said, there's further reporting  on this video click here,  which no one is ever gonna do in a million years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it is kind of up to the media, which they did.  It's kind of, it's funny because we were talking about this  before the show, when you were on Ari Melber yesterday,  I think, was it you or Ari who said,  there were only 300 people who saw that video  on Twitter initially.  That was me, cause that was,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yeah, that was quoting  Biz Stone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But after the media picked it up, of course,  everybody saw it.  On the other hand, so that's one downside  to media coverage.  On the other hand, it was the media that said,  was quick to say this was manipulated footage.  It was slowed down to make her look drunk.  I think that was probably what needed to be said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Also, it's worth noting that the other video,  the one that Trump retweeted,  the one where they cobbled together bits and pieces  of her mumbling so that it made her seem senile,  that was created by Fox News as far as I know.  So that's not Facebook's fault.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And yeah, you can't take it down.  I remember Dvorak very,  when he first got his Amiga video editing,  the video toaster, he took Bill Gates's keynotes  from Comdex, edited out everything but the gulps  because Bill, I guess, had a very audible swallowing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Nice.  So it was a lot of, all together.  Now, that's funny.  It's clearly manipulated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It besmirches Bill Gates, if you believe it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, that's the problem.  But this is also where the intent matters.  The behavior matters, not the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right.  If you edited a video of Trump  to make him sound even dumber,  is that, should that be taken down?  MSNBC does that every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is their stock and trade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right, plus there's satire, there's humor.  So 2000, I'm gonna put this up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  2016, we'll put it under other.  There was a lot of this stuff going on.  So what happened to Trump, slow Trump.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right, let's go to the tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  2016, and there wasn't a video.  Go to the video.  Not crying about this.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  $21 trillion going to $21 trillion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember this.  Not a trillion, $21 trillion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  But you can look at that and know it's fake, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody even knows what a trillion is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yes and no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And these guys are studying it.  You know what?  It's not that far off.  It's so close to,  did you ever get so close to a deal  or a job that you don't really see it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have to say, this is for the left as funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  as the Nancy Pelosi video is for the right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's the same thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there was this outcry.  We're heading toward a, what do you call it?  L'agéme giste?  How do you say that?  L'assé me giste.  L'assé me giste.  Where people were basically saying,  but it's the third most powerful person in the country  and they're making lies about her.  Yeah, that's democracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Welcome to it.  Welcome to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And lots of countries are trying to outlaw that.  I mean, Bolsonaro.  Yeah, we should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Remember spitting image, the British puppet show  where they had all the world figures  and made massive fun of them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, my favorite thing, Leo, now,  is that honest to God, the British government  tried to get McDonald's to stop serving milkshakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What? Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because they were throwing milkshakes  at the National Garage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They were throwing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they, honest to God, tried to outlaw milkshakes.  That's where we are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That was only for places when he was having a rally.  Not for the doctors having a rally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Near the rally.  Actually, my thought on that is,  let them throw milkshakes.  It could be worse.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, Vice actually published.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The tweet saying, we're still serving milkshakes,  then they got in trouble for it,  so there's a milkshake freaking war.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Vice published a recipe for how to make  a good throwing milkshake.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So, this one, it's thin.  You don't want it too thick, right?  Yeah, you want it to dribble down the suit.  Yeah. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he yelled at the security people,  they couldn't stop this.  Oh, and the.  By the way, this picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Have you heard the cheer?  This picture is captioned,  Nigel Farage dies of milkshake wounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So the motto is, lactose intolerance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, I like it.  You know what?  That's clever.  That's a lot we have to do.  That's clever.  Disobedience, I like it.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I wouldn't want to endorse anybody doing that,  but yeah.  Depends on the flavor, really.  We.  We've got to make people more resilient.  That's now called media literacy.  I don't think that's really the right way to look at it,  because that's about how do you use literacy.  Yeah.  But resiliency, if you live in Estonia,  or you live in Ukraine, you have a lot more resiliency.  You know that people lie.  You know you're going to be dubious.  You know what's going to happen.  When people say they don't trust social media,  I say that's great news.  That means that they're dubious.  That's good.  Good.  And to me the risk is.  You see the story about Finland?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No.  Go ahead, first, Matthew, finish your thought,  and then we'll finish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I was just going to say the risk is,  I think the point that Hussain and Alexios were making  was if we give Facebook the power  to take down things that are quote unquote untrue,  it'll start taking down all kinds of stuff.  It'll start taking down humor and commentary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All this should I point out, but they have the power.  We don't need to give them the power.  They are a private entity.  But if we cheer them on.  We should not encourage them to do so.  Yeah, I agree.  I mean that's what everybody says about free speech.  It means nothing to defend free speech  unless it's something you don't agree with.  Then it's meaningful.  You know, you've got to defend Julian Assange.  Exactly.  You may not like him, but you got to defend him.  And of course now the US is about  to throw the Espionage Act at him.  And that really does seem to have a chilling effect.  In fact, one media researcher, who was it, said this,  said he's doing exactly what every investigative reporter  in the world has done.  And to accuse him of espionage  and threaten him with a lifetime in jail for it  is chilling to the first amendment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And so the government's argument is  that he's not a real journalist.  Doesn't count.  And so therefore we can do this to him.  No.  But so now they get to define.  You don't define it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's a real journalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And what are the first thing they do  in authoritarian states, they give you a journalism license.  License, yeah.  Because if you've got a license, it can be revoked.  What do they do in Finland, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's on the run now.  But that wasn't the full story I found.  I'm trying to find the actual story.  What Finland can teach us about dispelling fake news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, you know, Finland can teach us many things  in many areas.  Finland against fake news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's basically media literacy.  I remember reading this piece.  Yeah, it basically is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In the classroom, Finland has an effective weapon  to fight fake news.  Education, the Nordic nation tops the list  of European countries deemed the most resilient,  there's your word, Jeff, to disinformation.  Denmark second, Netherlands the third,  then Sweden, Estonia, Macedonia, Turkey.  Oh no, sorry.  At the bottom of the chart, Macedonia, Turkey, and Albania.  I was gonna say that makes a lot more sense.  And they're doing it with high quality education  and having more educated people as a prerequisite  for tackling the negative effects of fake news  and post-truth.  The Media Literacy Index's authors wrote,  while some regulation is necessary,  education seems to be the best all-around solution.  Well, I couldn't disagree with that.  Yeah, no, it's fine.  We need to do a better job of education, I agree.  We're doing a terrible job getting worse all the time  in this country.  Makes me very sad.  We're taking money away from schools.  Teachers are poorly paid.  In fact, there's a real problem now  with teachers leaving the field  because they're paid so badly.  And I don't think that that's planning  for the future in any way.  Let's take a break, then I'll show you the latest billboard  in San Francisco.  But first, a word from ExpressVPN.  When you wanna protect yourself online,  I think you know by now the best way to do it  is a virtual private network or a VPN.  VPN runs on your system, whether it's a computer,  a laptop, a phone, a tablet,  encrypts all your transactions, all your conversation,  everything that's going out of that computer  from your computer through the open WiFi access point  past your internet service provider,  all the way out to the VPN server,  which then puts it out in the real world.  So it's very important that you choose a VPN server  and a VPN service that does right by you.  That keeps your privacy, that's fast, easy to use,  doesn't log, doesn't inject ads, that's ExpressVPN.  It is the best.  They do not log, they keep no information about you.

Transcript:  Fins.  Sorry?  A little more perspective on the fins,  just one more added note.  Yes.  The Wall Street Journal has a story  about how they have to teach fins small talk  because they don't know how to do it.  Yeah, fins are notorious, notorious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a bunch of, it's a nation of introverts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh my God, I wanna move to Finland.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I know.  That's why they invented this.  That's why this Ericsson, and that's, I mean,  that's why Selfa, that's why they pretty much started  texting because they didn't wanna see  each other face to face.  No, those are all misnomer.  It's also cold and dark a lot of the time.  Yeah, but I'll tell you what.  Fourth of July on Helsinki, man, that's a party.  That is a party.  The land of the midnight sun.  That's where I was in Helsinki in the middle of the summer  and it was several times actually.  And those fins know how to celebrate the sun.  Elizabeth Warren has put a big old billboard up  right in San Francisco's face.  Break up big tech.  Text tech to the short code to join our fight.  It's an interesting place to put the billboard.  It's a fourth in Townsend, which we used to,  right by where we used to work, Karsten,  down by, Tech TV was down there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Basically, that's where Yahoo's billboard used to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is it?  Do you think it's the, no, it's not.  It's not the exact place.  It's below the old Yahoo billboard.  Because look, in fact, when you look at it now,  I think I'm not gonna give you any money  if that's where you think a billboard belongs.  Oh, yeah, never mind.  Who's this HD buttercup?  Now, that's a billboard.  Anyway, you can't even see it.  Yeah, so.  It's behind a bush.  And it's facing the wrong way from the bus terminal  and well, I can go on and on.  Anyway, that's an interesting idea.  I don't know.  It's kind of baiting the lion, you know?  Going to the center of the big tech universe  and saying, you ought to be broken up.  But I bet it works.  Certainly got attention, got our attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what was,  so when I was in Congress two weeks ago,  talking about Section 230.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wait a minute, what were you doing in Congress?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We didn't hear about this.  My working group I'm part of on internet regulation  had a visit to Congress.  Oh, nice.  In the Senate.  So I met one senator and some staffers  and a lot of discussion from one of them  about Section 230, which I can talk about  at more length in a minute  because I just finished a book about it.  Sorry.  But that threw me off completely.  What was I saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Congress talking to senators and representatives about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The fear is that Section 230 is going to die  because you now have the right going after the tech platforms  because they're being mean to the conservatives.  So just to explain, Section 230 is the safe harbor protection

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  of the Digital Money and Copyright Act,  which means that platforms are protected against lawsuit.  This is something that in Europe has now been thrown out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's a new book out.  That was your footnote.  Called The 26 Words That Created the Internet.  Wow.  That's a good book.  By Jeff Kossoff.  It's a very good book.  Did you read it too, Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I have skimmed it.  I have not read every word.  So he really breaks down Section 230.  The thing that's really been irritating  over the last little while is that even some media outlets  have been getting Section 230 wrong,  describing it incorrectly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I got it wrong.  It's not the DMCA, it's the Communications Decency Act,  first of all.  It's all the stuff.  Apologies, yeah.  No provider or user of an interactive computer service  shall be treated as a publisher or speaker  of any information provided  by another information content provider.  In other words, platforms are not responsible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So it protects them from liability, effectively.  But there's this argument that the right, in particular,  has been trying to push,  that that requires the platforms to be neutral,  which it doesn't.  No.  Not at all.  It just says you're not responsible.  But I've seen multiple articles.  Senator Wyden was the co-author.  Sorry, Matthew.  Section 230 was the second one that they had to correct,  in which they said, Facebook is really  kind of walking a fine line because it's not being neutral.  And that's, I mean, Section 230 was actually created  to allow them to moderate things.  So it's the exact opposite of the standard story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ron Wyden, who wrote this, said what, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly what Matthew just said,  which is that they provided a shield and a sword  with the expectation they would use both.  The shield from the liability  so that they would allow conversation,  but the sword that meant they would take responsibility  for having a decent conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow.  I like Ron Wyden.  That's a very good description.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a really last smart thing Congress did, yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It also actually said that that would hopefully create room  for tools that users could use  to moderate content themselves,  which of course we have not seen any of.  But that's the kind of-  I put it on Twitter a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a footnote, yeah.  Exactly, I agree.  So the fear now is that with the right and the left,  both going after the platforms,  left because they're big, evil capitalist companies,  right because they think that they're being mean to us  and taking the stuff down,  that no one's going to stand up for 230.  And so recently, Fasca Sessa, whatever it was,  was a carve out of 230 about child pornography  or child sexual trafficking.  Thank you, trafficking.  The fear is there'll be a next,  the next carve out will be about opioids  and the next carve out will be about bullying  and the next carve out will be about terrorism.  And then there'll be nothing left of 230.  And then what you're going to find is that the platforms  that enable conversation, including by the way,  like Wikipedia, places like that,  will be so fearful of liability  that they will cut off the conversation  that the internet is in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So that was one of the arguments about Section 230,  like Facebook and Google,  can do whatever they want.  They're massive companies,  but Section 230 also protects everyone with a blog,  everyone with a website.  Everyone who has a newspaper.  Every newspaper with a comment section.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is a great infographic  from the Electronic Frontier Foundation  and Craig Neumark's Craig Connects on CDA 230.  It talks about the law, but then it says,  what if there were no CDA 230 to protect online speech?  And here's the consequences,  sites like Huffington Post, Facebook, Twitter,  Google Plus, and Reddit,  well, I'll have to take off the Google Plus,  could be sued every time a user crossed the line.  Need to update that.  Innovation would be diminished  as new social media platforms and products  would face new legal obstacles to getting started.  Sites would have to pay for lawyers to review content.  Every post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Every review service, every Yelp or TripAdvisor.  Yeah, good point, Matthew.  Even just a website about restaurants.  Even internet service providers

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  would have to censor content.  And they do have examples of countries  that don't have this protection,  Turkey and Thailand, and what the consequences are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And there actually was a case recently  that I was reading about  that I'm pretty sure involved a Yelp review.  I think it was a restaurant  or someone who provided a service,  or a dentist or something,  and they wanted to sue commenters on the site.  And that's a classic Section 230 case.  Yep.  Well, let's defend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I recommend the book, once again,  The 26 Words That Created the Internet, Jeff Kossoff.  I think it'd be a great triangulation guest.  Let the Harvard boy know.  What's his name again?  Jeff Kossoff, K-O-S-S-E-F-F.  He is an assistant professor  at the U.S. Naval Academy's Cyber Science Department.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow, interesting.  All right.  I'm all for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Make it so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll work on getting him.  That's great.  By the way, a little word of warning,  Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg,  do not go visit Matthew Ingram's lake cabin.  I know the canoeing looks fine, but you can-  No, they can come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They can come.  They just can't tell anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They might be arrested  because they snubbed international lawmakers  again at a committee hearing in Canada yesterday.  And was there a warrant issued for their arrest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So there was a subpoena.  Okay.  There was a summons.  And so the summons effectively is open-ended.  So as soon as they enter the country,  the summons takes effect  and they are to report to parliament.  Wow. And if they don't,  then they can be cited for contempt.  And what happens when you're cited for contempt?  Absolutely nothing.  Oh, right.  But yeah.  So it sounds a lot worse than it is in practice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Being in Canada, the parliament will apologize to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's okay.  We're so sorry.  Theoretically we could throw them in jail, but that's-  Well, it's not much different from the situation here

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  where people pretty much just say to Congress, yeah, no.  Yeah.  No, I don't think so.  Not today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  My favorite part was the guy,  the co-chair of the committee,  the grand committee it's called,  that was having the hearings.  The guy that Facebook sent,  the co-chair said,  but you're not even in the top 100 top Facebook executives.  What the heck?  I think they're hurt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're just hurt.  The committee's name is, what's the,  do you have the full name?  It's so grand.  It's so self-important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The International Grand Committee on Data, Privacy,  and- Wow.  Disinformation, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. The grand committee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  All capitalized, of course.  Yeah, because there's multiple countries.  It's not just Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So we've been talking a lot about the Huawei situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been wanting you to explain this to me more.  What should I think of Huawei?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I have one, so I'm concerned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that's really the real question.  Essentially at this point, Huawei is banned,  actually US companies are banned  from doing business with Huawei.  It started, of course, it started in 2012  when the Congress advised US companies  and the defense intelligence community,  just advised companies,  be careful about working with several Chinese companies.  Huawei was one of them.  ZTE was at Xiaomi, I can't remember.  Of course, the drum beat got stronger  a few months ago with 5G.  We went around briefing our allies saying,  really, you shouldn't use Huawei networking gear.  And then it really turned up,  the heat turned up last week  when a number of US companies were forbidden  from doing business with Huawei,  meaning Huawei couldn't get parts.  Google complied by saying,  okay, no more Android for you, no more updates.  There was a 90 day kind of relenting,  but it says temporary.  Qualcomm said, okay, no more chips for you.  Then ARM, a UK company said,  okay, you can't use our designs anymore.  Huawei said, well, that's okay.  We've been preparing for this.  We knew this was gonna happen.  We saw what happened to ZTE.  We've been stockpiling parts.  They even were forbidden briefly  from using SD cards in the phones.  By the way, that changed for some reason.  Panasonic batteries.  Oh yeah, that's right.  Panasonic said no more batteries for you.  So it got really serious.  There's some concern though,  because first of all, China has a nuclear option.  They can respond.  In fact, already, JPMorgan said yesterday  that because the Chinese people  are very protective of Huawei apparently,  their analysts said Apple should expect  a severe depletion in sales of iPhones in China  because the Chinese people will buy Huawei phones  in defense of Huawei.  And JPMorgan said probably your market in China  will be cut in half, Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That is 30% of Apple's iPhone.  So it's a big chunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And they would like it to be more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Then I saw a story today that,  and the Department of Homeland Security is warning  that drones manufactured by Chinese companies,  the DJI drone is probably the most popular drone  in the world, I had one.  A lot of, unfortunately, a lot of government agencies  apparently are using them.  The Interior Department tracked lava flows  to Kilauea, oil companies fly them over pipelines,  electric utilities use them to inspect transmission lines.  DHS says those drones could be gathering information.  Somebody a little smarter pointed out that,  well, you don't really need the drones  because we've got, the Chinese have satellites  over all of this stuff anyway.  And I think this is part of the problem.  The president muddied the waters considerably this week  by at first saying, well, it's a big security problem.  And then in the same sentence saying,  but if we can fix our trade problems with China,  all will be forgiven.  Right, will include Huawei.  Is it a trade problem or is it a security problem?  This is extremely unclear.  I don't know what to say.  We've yet to see real, A, I will say this,  there's lots of evidence from a lot of sources  going way back that Huawei has always been kind of nasty  and highly competitive years long accusations of thefts,  dubious ethics.  Father Robert told us stories about Huawei executives  wandering trade show floors with a camera,  taking pictures of competitors circuit boards.  But that doesn't rise to the level of cyber threat.  Yeah, I mean, well, I don't know.  But this is the real problem is that  if you're gonna pick one company out of China,  you're gonna have problems.  You still have plenty, for instance, Huawei owns  and has put in a considerable number  of the sub undersea cables.  So a lot of data traffic goes through Huawei cables anyway.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So there's A, there's not much you can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anything going into China is gonna be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, there's not much you can do.  Well, no, these cables aren't just to China.  They're all over the world.  Yeah.  So you've got a lot of issues.  This is a complicated issue.  We've never been shown evidence  that Huawei is engaged in espionage,  but it is the case that the Chinese government  has the right to tell Huawei what to do,  whether they own Huawei or not.  Huawei says a US blacklist of Huawei  will harm billions of consumers, including Americans.  They had a press conference today.  Talk about this.  Huawei's very upset about it, as you might expect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I just wanna know whether I'm gonna get updates  to my P20 Pro.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, for the next three months.  I thought existing users were grandpa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Next three months, but then you're out of life.  For the next three months.  If this goes through, you will not.  Google will not update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  A lot of P20 owners are selling their phones  at a great discount on eBay, which is too bad,  because that and its successor were great phones.  P30 is a great phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Actually, if you're looking for a graduation gift,  it's a great deal on them right now.  They're getting security updates, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's a Huawei PR guy who's come to me  a couple times over the years, which is to say,  I guess they're having no luck getting to real media,  so they're down to me.  And I mentioned this to you, I think,  about a year and a half, two years ago.  I said, they want us to come to coverage  something, and you said, nah.  I said, yeah, you're right, nah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But that's one of the things they're accused of is,  oh, and not only that, they would fly journalists  all around the world.  Everybody does that.  So does everybody else.  I refuse it, of course, as a matter of ethics,  but every company, I buy offers from every company  to go to Taipei, to go to their factories,  to go all over the place.  And yes, we got offers from Huawei in the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  We've gotten offers from LG in the past.  Everybody, everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They're coming out with their own OS, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, so they could still use the open source version  of Android.  They just can't use Google services,  but they don't in China anyway.  So they already have, in China, they have their own store.  They have their own services,  so they could easily roll those out worldwide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't, I think that they're-  Says their own OS is rolling out later this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  These same restrictions pretty much put ZTE  out of business last year.  I don't think it bodes well for Huawei.  But the real question, and I don't know what the answer is,  is this part of a trade war?  Is this even worse, maybe kind of anti-Chinese sentiment?  Or is there a legitimate cause for concern?  That's what I'm trying to figure out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Huawei does not seem like a very cuddly company.  No, there's a lot of reason to blame them.  There's a lot of reason, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Lot of reason to blame them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It feels like a trade war to me.  There's been no, unless they're just keeping it all secret,  there's been no conclusive evidence  that Huawei has spied on anyone, as far as I can tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But we should point out, there's a lot to be said  for the fact that Huawei could and might be ordered  to do so by the Chinese government.  I think it's reasonable to say,  try not to use 5G gear from Huawei,  even though that's the number one company  and the best, most affordable choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree on the-  Networking.  On the networking.  Yeah.  The phones, keeping them from selling phones to Europe?  Right.  I mean, we don't buy phones from them anyways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right, they're not, they don't sell in America.  They had planned to do that a year and a half ago  and they were cut off by the Commerce Department.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So are they evil empire or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's, I think both are true.  I think the administration is using Huawei  as a poster child and hopes that by bludgeoning Huawei,  Trump basically said this, hoped that by bludgeoning Huawei,  they could force the Chinese government  to make a trade deal.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He said that.  And if they get a deal, Huawei's back in.  Suddenly, oh, they're fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Nevertheless, it's completely reasonably concerned  about Huawei.  The problem I have with that is,  it's reasonably concerned with any Chinese company,  all of our stuff is made in China.  It's not a lot of, I mean-  No.  The worst thing we could do at this point  would be to cut off American companies selling to China  and Chinese companies selling to us.  To put up a big wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Like 80% of routers are Chinese made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, we might have a bigger problem.  I mean, and Ben Thompson pointed out,  China took the first shots in the trade war.  It threw out a bunch of US tech firms.  So maybe it's time that we respond.  I mean, look what companies have been thrown out of China,  including Facebook, Twitter, Google, Flickr,  Snapchat. But that's not new.  No, but that's the point is they've been doing this forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not just that they're thrown out.  It's made impossible for them to succeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  You can't use WhatsApp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Unless they agree to censorship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, that's, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But what if they just turn off one of those undersea cables?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Can we maybe set up some alternate  people in India before we do this though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know what the answer is.  I just know that this is messy.  And is unlikely to end.  I think this will all end in tears.  It's unlikely to end well.  China may not have a lot of,  and I'm sure the calculus in Washington is,  China does not have a lot of ways to respond to this  except to buckle and give in.  It's gonna, I mean, it's gonna cost us a lot of money  in the United States.  A lot of stuff's made in China.  Apple cannot reasonably move iPhone manufacture  back to the U.S.  Maybe it can move it to Brazil.  It already did so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It has moved some stuff to India.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In India, because both India and Brazil  have strong tariffs that prevent the sale of phones  not made in those countries.  So Foxconn has set up factories in both countries.  Still a Chinese company making them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is a really complicated story  and I don't know if anybody knows.  And whether you should continue to use DJI drones,  I don't know.  It's clear that the DHS is now extending the fight  to other Chinese companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And by the way-  So Matthew, how long have you had that phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's about a year now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That when you bought it, did you have any,  that said, oh, Huawei, China?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Not really, no.  Because I don't do anything on the phone  that I care about.  I just wanted it for the cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I asked Huawei about that  and the American representative of Huawei,  the PR person who's based I think up in Seattle said,  the data's routed through Germany, not China.  So don't worry about that.  But on the other hand, when I set up my P20,  the very first question was asked was,  is it okay if we send information back to the home office?  So they didn't even hide it.  I mean, but every phone does.  Yeah, I mean, Apple asks the same thing.  That was the P20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Was that the phone that asked for your location?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, it wanted to know what my location was  and is it okay to send it back to the Huawei?  But we just learned by the way  that the iPhone's doing exactly the same thing.  Great article.  Is this the New York Times again?  Man, they just, they hate technology.  No, it was the Washington Post.  Most of them.  The iPhone, and this was always the problem with the iPhone.  Apple can say, oh, we take your privacy very seriously,  but if you-  Unless you live in China.  Well, or unless you don't put it,  the problem is this minute you put third party apps  on your phone.  Apple can't stop this.  This is the subtitle, the article is,  it's the middle of the night.  Do you know what your iPhone,  do you know who your iPhone is talking to?  Apple says, what happens when your iPhone stays  on your iPhone?  Our privacy experiment showed 5,400 hidden app trackers  guzzled our data in a single week.  Basically any app, and by the way,  some of this is for good reason.  Any app you put on your phone potentially can phone home,  including Microsoft's OneDrive and Tuit's MintNite,  but all of these are cloud-based services.  Nike, Spotify, The Washington Post,  oh yeah, even our own app.  That's what they do.  The Weather Channel, one app, the Crime Alert Citizen,  that one is a really weird app,  shared personally identifiable information  in violation of its published privacy policy.  Okay, that's a big ding.  But that's, everybody knows that.  You're signing up, you even, when you install the app,  and Apple's really good about this, it says,  okay, can I send location information?  You have three choices.  No, only when the app is running all the time.  And even if you say all the time,  or only when the app's running,  Apple will again warn you a week or two later.  In fact, several times,  this app is still sending location information  and you want it to do that.  So Apple does what it can,  but any third-party app on any device,  this is the potential.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Someone also pointed out that that Washington Post story  loads something like 150 trackers and pixels  and sends God knows what kind of data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Everybody wants your data.  But I think this is another case  of tech companies promising more than they can deliver.  Yes, everything stays on your phone,  except everything that doesn't stay on your phone.  And we sign up for that.  What's the point of having one-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We get benefit out of much of it.  And we, yeah, what's the point of having one drive  if it doesn't sync your files?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the whole point.  Right.  Let's see, a couple more stories  and we can get ready for the picks and so forth.  Amazon's facial recognition ban taken to the shareholders.  Shareholders voted overwhelmingly 98% to reject.  No, what are you talking about?  We're making some good money on this stuff.  Are you nuts?  Only 2.4%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Full disclosure, I have a little Amazon stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did you vote?  No.  No, did you get your proxy?  No, actually, no I didn't.  It's weird.  Yeah, usually you get a proxy when it says,  I'll let somebody else vote for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amazon-  They just listened to me  and they knew what I would vote and did it for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I know what you'd say.  Amazon is up to something interesting  according to Bloomberg.  Poised to unleash a long-feared purge of small suppliers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That could be like a nuclear winter for small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  More than half of the products you buy on Amazon  are through the marketplace.  They come from the little guys.  Amazon's concern is apparently over counterfeiting  and they have a terrible counterfeiting problem.  I talked to a company that makes printers  and they said, you can buy ink cartridges  that have our brand, our label, everything on them.  They're not, they're counterfeit.  They don't work well and we hear about it  because people say, oh, those ink cartridges  were awful you sold me.  And they've complained to Amazon,  there's not much they can do about it.  So maybe this is time.  Two months ago, Amazon halted orders  from thousands of suppliers with no explanation  and panic ensued until the orders quietly resumed.  Weeks later, Amazon saying it was part of a plan  to weed out counterfeit products, but Bloomberg warns  and unfortunately I've reached the end  of my free article limit,  so I don't know what they're warning me.  Maybe one of you is willing to play Bloomberg  35 bucks a month for access to their articles can tell me.  I just can't bring myself to do it.  You can't do it either.  Well, cause they got the terminals.  This is an insanely profitable company.  I got a free membership.  Five bucks, I do it.  I pay wired.  I pay and Conde Nast is no broke company.  I pay for a lot of content.  Pay the Washington Post and the New York Times,  the Wall Street Journal even,  but I just can't bring myself to give Bloomberg  35 bucks a month.  Sorry, Bloomberg.  Jeez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cause you're not getting the value of the terminal,  obviously, which is, you know,  two million dollars a month or whatever it is.  Right, it's a lot more expensive.  You're getting business week,  which they've done a good job with.  Bloomberg's got it.  Everybody thinks they want to pay well now.  Everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And actually people still blame Bloomberg

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  for being the first to blow the whistle  on the Chinese supply chain spying  with that super micro story,  which they have never retracted, but never proven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, and they dedicated at least one or two reporters  to trying to re-prove that story  and nothing has come out since.  Nothing has happened.  You know what I'm thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know what I'm thinking now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Here's a short summary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Axios, I love it when people summarize Bloomberg stories.  Thank you, Axios.  Thank you, Axios.  So they're going to stick with,  Amazon's going to stick with Procter & Gamble, Sony, Lego,  but they're going to cut off a lot of these small guys.  You know, a lot of, I think a lot of business on Amazon,  I noticed this, I'll buy a, you know,  a consumer product, you know, deodorant or something.  And what I really think is happening is these small guys  are going to a big box store.  They're buying a lot of them.  They're breaking them up  and then they're selling them on Amazon.  Because a lot of the stuff I get is kind of like that.  Like they got a better deal and they sold it  and they're making whatever, 10 cents.  I'm paying basically for the convenience  because I could go to the big box store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When I was in LA, my Lyft driver,  his full-time job now, besides Lyft,  is selling fashion magazines to the rest of the world.  He just goes to the newsstand and buys them.  And vape stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's called, as the chat room is telling me,  Tan Danner in the chat room says, it's retail arbitrage.  Arbitrage, yeah.  That's pretty good, buy low, sell high.  I don't mind that.  Although often the condition of the things I get  is not great.  I don't think Amazon would be hurt too much  by getting rid of a lot of those small guys,  but I feel really bad for the small guys.  We had a story on MacBreak Weekly yesterday about a guy.  When Apple did the deal with Amazon to sell,  because Apple and Amazon were fighting,  but when they made it up and Amazon started selling  Apple gear, they got rid of a lot of small guys  selling stuff Apple doesn't even sell anymore.  Really old laptops and devices.  That people were buying for parts or for whatever reason.  And these guys are just, they're gone.  They're not on Amazon.  They have to go to eBay and other places to sell it.  And it's hurt their business quite a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, part of it, the fear of Amazon has been  that they would learn the business from others,  including big companies, and then make their own products.  And they don't need to advertise.  Well, they are doing that.  Whatever margin they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How many hundreds of in-house brands do they have?  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the cynical view would be that they're using this  as an excuse to get rid of those guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's take a break.  And Jeff, I want a number.  I have a number.  Matthew, anything you want to pick and show.  And I have something really cool to show.  No change log.  One question for you, Leo.  Wait a minute.  Yes?  Change log.  And then we'll do the change log.  I'm sorry.  Oh, change log.  I'm such a nitwit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's your question?  Question was that really long and recent Horowitz,  why we're investing in podcasts thing.  I just wanted your take on it.  Did you find anything there?  A new or a value or interesting or wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  A lot.  Let me pull it up so I can run through it.  Of course, I found it very interesting.  I sent it immediately to Lisa.  I said there might be some graphs in here we could use.  It's a substantively correct.  I don't think they're wrong.  I wish they'd talk to us a little bit.  They talk a lot to,  they never mentioned us.  There are charts in there we should show up on  that we are weirdly not on.  Let me just.  Have you ever interviewed Ben Evans?  No, I know I should.  You should, because that way he'd know about you.  Maybe that's my mistake.  There it is.  Investing in the podcast ecosystem in 2019.  And the good news is they're saying it's a good idea.  Podcast consumption is rapidly growing.  A quarter of Americans listen weekly.  Podcast listeners are consuming six plus hours  a week of podcasts.  Listeners are generally educated.  Millennials are slightly more than half are male.  The gap is closing.  Everything's very positive.  I wouldn't knock any of this.  Here's a brief history of podcasting,  which is essentially accurate.  Leaves out Dave Weiner though.  Leaves out a lot of stuff.  I guess Adam Curry should also complain  because he's not in there.  I'm not complaining about that.  I do complain about their top podcast list  because A, we're not on it in the place where we should be.  And B, it comes from a company that we work with.  But even the company that gave them these stats  says that this list is missing a lot of,  this top podcast snapshot is,  first they use iTunes.  They do explain that iTunes has nothing to do  with the number of listeners,  just how many subscriptions you got in the last week or so.  So why even publish this list?  And then they use this list,  which is also missing a number of significant networks,  including us.  But anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're losing the investment opportunities there  because it's old places like NBRI, Heart Radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, these are all owned by, these are all owned.  I guess Ball Sparstool Sports should get bought right now.  But essentially it's accurate.  I mean, I think it's a pretty good piece.  It certainly doesn't hurt podcasting  that companies like this are talking about it.  This is, we are at the peak,  I think of the podcast valuations right now.  Okay, thank you.  That's what I wanted.  We have engaged an investment banking firm, I believe,  to investigate these things.  And we've talked to some people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I thought the China,  the lessons from China were interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That was, oh, okay, you know what?  You're right.  That was the thing I didn't know anything about.  Apparently podcasting is huge in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They've got the Shimalaya FM raised 580 million  and is now valued at 3.6 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and this is a podcast.  This is not a podcast app.  This is more like a Spotify for podcasts.  It's three bucks a month.  You get audio books too,  and 300 top influencer podcasts and courses.  So yeah, this is a very interesting business in China.  It's one of the things.  Audio books are huge.  Yeah, yeah, isn't that great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They also, yeah, because,  and recent Horowitz said,  hey, don't just think of podcasts, think of audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's exactly right.  That's why I never liked the word podcast.  In fact, now that Apple is selling the last iPod.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think it's time maybe to drop that word,  but that's what I have to use it  because that's what everybody does.  Well, they have a new iPod.  Yeah, but it's the last iPod, guarantee you.  Oh, they definitely said that?  No, they haven't said that,  but they hadn't, so they just updated the iPod Touch  for the first time in four years.  You think in four years they're going to make another one?  I think this is the last one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And the updates were so minimal.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was like the updated version.  It's got an iPhone 7 chip in it.  Apple, unless they sell millions of them,  Apple's not going to update it again.  This is the last iPod.  They do talk about significant exits, major acquisitions,  and that's always interesting to see.  So yeah, so podcasts are big.  I like to call them netcasts, as everybody knows.  I'm the only one in the whole world.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, kind of didn't work with you, sorry.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It doesn't feel like Spotify's trying  to corner the market though, in a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, they can't, because that's fundamentally  against the nature.  It's like saying I'm going to corner the market in blogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right, or websites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Medium, by the way, there's starting to be a little bit of,  I wonder, do you still like medium?  Because there's starting to be a little backlash  against medium.  I see people, publishers, moving away from medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, there has been for a while.  Like they roped people in and then there was a backlash  and then they roped people in again.  All these dark patterns, subscribe, subscribe, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not a big fan anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I still use it, but I cross post on my blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  As long as you put it on your blog, that's fine.  I don't have a problem putting it in other places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's a lovely tool.  I like to write on it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, it's good, it's right until it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's fair, good CMS, yeah.  I wanted to be listed in this podcast production companies,  but they didn't deem to put us in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They didn't bring up something painful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I'm always jealous.  I'm just a jealous person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you're a pioneer and the pioneers get left behind  for the new kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, there is that flavor of the month thing.  Maybe if we took the lava lamp out,  that would help people think we're hip and with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Pioneers got the arrows and settlers got the land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I don't mind.  And honestly, this was a very good, I'm glad.  I hadn't brought it up because I thought,  well, it's kind of inside baseball.  But yeah, no, it was a very, I think a very good piece  for us and every podcaster.  All right, now we'll take a break.  No, now we'll do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was a nice, faint, fooling Karsten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So remember at Google I.O. and Google said,  you can ask Google what's for dinner  and order and all that.  Now they've turned that on.  French fries, lettuce wraps,  Massaman curry, chicken wings and cupcakes.  Now you can use Google search or maps  or the assistant to order food from right now,  it's door-postmatesdelivery.com, slice Joe now,  Zuppler and others coming soon.  Look for the order online button  in search and maps when you're searching  for a restaurant or a type of cuisine.  Let the Google assistant handle dinner.  You can also say, hey, you know who,  order food from your restaurant here.  It'll show you the menu.  And if you can get food picked up  or delivered from that restaurant,  it'll set it up for you.  It's the end of the line for another Google property.  That really part of the change like to write new  and stuff going away.  And dead.  And dead, new and dead.  And we're Canadian.  You know, if Gina Trapani were here,  I would mention this is the 10th anniversary  of Google Wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.  Mm-hmm, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I can't hurt her like that anymore.  I think she said that when she left the show,  you can't hurt me anymore, LaPorte.  Google has also sunsetted YouTube gaming,  which I didn't even know existed.  The YouTube game.  Did you know about this, Karsten?  The YouTube gaming app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, they were trying to go after Twitch.  Okay.  Oh, so it's for streaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's for streaming.  Oh, I got it.  Shutting down May 30th.  That's gotta have something to do with Stadia coming.  Oh, I love that, of course.  Maybe.  And they have a new hub.  But I have a feeling that Stadia is gonna replace this.  It's weird, though, to close something  before the replacement is fully ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Nobody uses YouTube gaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's why it probably doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Nobody listens to techno.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Nope.  Google Assistant gets New York subway arrival times.  And I can't wait to use this.  Here's the biggest thing.  You're gonna be able to pay with Google Pay or Apple Pay.  So I asked Mary Jo Foley.  She said the subways already have these little touch to pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The ones I go into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You gotta go to a higher class of subway, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's probably on the IRG.  Must be on the east side.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On the upper east side.  We've had these for years.  You just get the attendant to let you in  and he'll bill you later.  I'm gonna say all aboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Next week, those commuting between.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The current video, sorry, sorry for a second.  The current video that's driving people nuts,  I don't know if you can find it in the flash,  Carson is a rat trying to climb up one of the poles  and sliding back down.  Well, remember the pizza rat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Pizza rat has been around for a while.  This is now the new star of the New York City subway.  Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Subway Rat.  It's in a subway car, so that's kinda creepy.  Meet the pole dancing rat.  New Yorkers are treated to the occasional rat sighting  on the subway.  This is the worst shaky cam video ever,  but this is 3 a.m.  I was like, this guy's nervous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd be nervous too.  On the end train.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, is it nerves or is it 3 a.m. on the end train?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's also zooming so you can be as far away as possible.  Yeah, maybe that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Those poles are slippery.  A lot of grease.  There we go, that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Here's less shaky cam.  That was the New York Post's edit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He looks cute.  It's cute, rats are cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you can also get,  Google Assistant will now tell you  which cars have the rats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Somebody told me of the New York subway,  if the car is empty, there's a reason.  Do not get on the subway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Crowded car, crowded car, empty car, crowded car, crowded car.  Don't go in the empty car.  I just happened to find it.  That's a really good tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll have to remember that.  Probably the other New York tip is never hug an Elmo.  Oh God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wouldn't go anywhere near those guys.  That is, those things are disgusting.  You can tell from a distance.  By the way, for those who are not wise  of the ways of the big apple,  if you go down to Times Square,  there are lots of people dressed up in character costumes,  including Sesame Street's Elmo, but there are many others.  Not official.  They are a not official.  They've segregated them more and more.  They've slowly moved them kind of out of the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But do they still have the half naked people?  They snoot us.  They snoot us.  Yeah.  They snoot us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  The naked cowboy has many successors.  Who isn't naked.  There's a statue of Liberty.  He's not naked, he's wearing underwear.  It's tighty-whities, so you know.  There's lots of things you can hug.  Don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Or not.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't.  But I do like the idea of Touch to Pay coming to the IRT,  or the MTA.  Apparently, it will come first to, let me see.  This is the Google post.  The Grand Central in Manhattan  and Atlantic Avenue, Barkley Center in Brooklyn.  That's a pilot.  And then it will roll out to other subway stations.  And it will work with both Apple Pay and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My main credit card, my United credit card  still doesn't work with Google Pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So mine doesn't either.  That's up to the bank.  It's up to the bank, yeah.  TD Canada Trust does not support Google Pay,  nor do they have any plans to support Google Pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've asked, eh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They have us online statement.  It says we have no plans to support it, period.  So while.  They want you to use their app, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  While Congress is debating a law to ban loot boxes,  Google Play Store has kind of jumped the gun.  They're gonna start requiring games with loot boxes  to disclose the odds, which frankly is all I would ask.  Let's not ban them, but if you know the odds,  at least you have a chance.  This is also a policy in the Apple App Store.  So, loot boxes, which are basically gambling,  have long been considered a problem in games,  especially Fortnite.  I think it was when Fortnite really took off,  it got people that really.  What are the kids using them?  Yeah, that's the problem.  Kids are gambling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What's a loot box?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, it's a box that's, it's kind of like one of those,  buy the box and see what you get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, okay, see what you, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  A loot box is, in a video game,  you will get the chance to get a new weapon  or a new skin or something.  A loot box is a randomized version of that.  You might get a good gun, you might not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's not randomized is the cost of the loot box.  Just what you get for it.  Kids love that stuff, you know?  You ever go to a gumball machine?  You put it in your penny,  you don't know what you're gonna get.  Yeah, or the claw.  The claw is not randomized, you don't get anything.  Well, yeah, you don't get anything exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The claw decides who will stay and who will go.  No.  The claw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, you can, you can game the claw.  Can you?  Oh, sure.  There are videos you can go to online that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have a course of this at Harvard.  Yes, they show you the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  When I was.  You just watch, you have to watch and see when it pays out.  Yeah.  It is required by law to pay out at a certain rate.  So you just, you watch and you,  then you go and when it's going to pay out, you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You waste your life sitting there watching the claw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When I was at Elliot House, it was widely known.  The claws were gameable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Elliot.  Elliot.  Pardon me?  Adams.  Adams, pardon me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, oh, oh.  As in John Adams?  I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, I don't know if what.  Probably, right?  I don't know what Adams it was,  but I know that Elliot House was the enemy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, so don't ever say it was in Elliot House.  Let's see.  Is that the end?  Well, there's a few things.  I'll save, I have a number  and actually a really interesting pic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I mean of the, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's.  So that.  Change lock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So I picked something from the rundown  that I thought was fascinating.  Good, and we didn't do it?  I must have known.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know if you saw this, but.  I must have known.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure it was Samsung.  They took individual photos,  including a photo of the Mona Lisa.  Oh, isn't this wild?  And showed that they could animate them.  It's mind-bogglingly amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The key is on this, they didn't have a whole video  or a bunch of frames, they had one frame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And so they effectively animate the face  using the existing, yeah, scroll down to the Mona Lisa one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's pretty amazing.  So that's.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, look at that.  And actually, depending on which,  the base truth is always the same, it's Mona Lisa,  but depending on which video they use  for the kind of intermediate truth,  the Mona Lisa could have different looks, that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I just thought it was fascinating,  and that's a single photo of a face from one perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think Mona Lisa would look most like the one on the left.  I'm just saying.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mona Lisa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The one in the middle talks too much.  She's too, yeah, too candid.  Mona Lisa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Talks too much, her eyes are too wide open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the one on the right is nerdy Mona Lisa.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Isn't that funny?  But all three of them could be.  I don't know if that counts as a deep fake or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean, it's certainly the kind of technology you could.  We're gonna see a lot of this.  Generate deep fakes with.  Oh yeah, we're gonna see so much of this.  So I have another one that is related.  Yes.  I found a video, don't know if you can find it,  but it was, so a guy who specializes  in creating effectively deep fakes  morphed Bill Hader's face  while he's doing an impression of Robert De Niro  to make him look like Robert De Niro.  And then he did it with Arnold Schwarzenegger as well.  And it was an interview from, I think, 2005,  but his video clip just came out.  Yeah, that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's it.  Okay, this was on Conan or?  Yeah.  So here's Bill Hader.  So Bill Hader had literally just started.  Oh yeah, he doesn't look this, he looks young.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's actually funny.  Finally, the discriminating that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is that you, is that me, what is going on?  There, it was me, okay.  Nope, it's you.  You have too many tabs open.  Too many.  You've got the Samsung tab open and the Hader tab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  See, it just happened.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We got some lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wait a minute, go back.  Cause that's weird.  Now he looks like De Niro.  Go back, cause we gotta see Hader.  It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Come to that impression.  No, no, I watched him on his acceptance speech  on the Emmys for Angels in America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He looks like Hader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And as soon as he starts the impression.  Just totally into the peripheral and weird things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So he's like, oh wow.  Isn't that amazing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We got some lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You have to see, this is a video for folks listening.  You can Google that, but that is wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's creepy.  Yeah.  And it's almost impossible to tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can't see it.  Yeah.  That's what's scary about all this stuff.  But what we need is a smarter, better educated  group of people who can.  Fins, we need a bunch of fins.  The fins.  Jeff, do you have a number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do indeed.  So Axios, using CrowdTangle, a Facebook tool,  looked at the effectiveness of Donald Trump's tweets  and found they had lost their potency.  I won't say that they're impotent.  But his interaction rate, which is likes and retweets  divided by total audience, has gone from in,  the election time, .55% down to .16%.  So it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, does that, you think,  have something to do with the number of tweets?  Because his tweet count has gone up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've built that in a little bit.  But, you know, generally just the interaction  is going down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think this is generally true across the board.  I wonder though.  He's not as fascinating to people  as he was two years ago.  We've had.  Twitter's got an algorithm now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh.  I mean, are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think though that you could say the same thing.  And I wonder, here's my question.  I wonder if all of, you know, when Trump got elected,  there was a huge spike in tech news,  not tech news, political news shows.  And especially like the daily.  The Trump bump.  The Trump bump.  And I'm wondering if that's starting to slow down  a little bit because, in fact, I think it is.  My guess is it is because they've doing  a lot less Trump coverage in the daily for one thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, I also just know that, you know,  I refused to follow him.  So I had a column devoted to him in my tweet deck.  And I used to go every day.  I went, I was just thinking a couple days ago  before this story came out.  Yeah, I haven't gotten a look at the Trump column  for like four or five days.  So I think there's a lot of that.  I think we've heard kind of everything he has to say,  which is part of this too, is that you look at the numbers.  Since April one, no collusion 54 times,  no obstruction 30 times, witch hunt 20 times,  hoax 19 times, you've got to heard it all.  His pace of tweeting has picked up  from 157 times per month during the first six months  to 284 times per month over the last six months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just wish Twitter,  we're not the national forum.  For discussion of serious political matters.  I just think that's the wrong place  for these discussions to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but what really happens here is that  it's media's amplification that makes that effective.  People who call Trump, Jay Rosen argues that he hates it  when people say Trump's brilliant at Twitter  and I agree with Jay.  He's not.  Media are chumps.  And so they take everything that gets said.  No, I don't take away credit to the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  because the Donald's got a real nose for how to get coverage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He always has.  He can say anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, yes, but he knows how to get coverage.  That doesn't mean he's brilliant at Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, he's brilliant at media.  Brilliant implies intelligence.  It's about manipulating media.  He's very good at getting the media to pay attention.  He's a sub-mult.  Yeah.  Brilliant implies there's this thinking process going on.  I don't know if that's the case, but he's very adept.  He knows exactly what buttons to push to get coverage.  Yeah, so that's what I'm saying.  And in fact, from now on, every president better  because that's clearly the new bar for getting media coverage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I always use a Bain analogy.  Trump could say, you like to think you can live in fake news  in the tabloid media.  I was born in that.  I mean, he was.  I was born in that.  He was created out of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, no, he was.  So, and Twitter just made a perfect little foil for him.  Yeah.  And it just, you know, the times were perfect.  This is, again, I go back to this great Zeynep Tufekci piece  in The Scientific American about sociological  versus psychological.  And it started with, this is why people like Game of Thrones,  but ultimately, it's why we have a hard time understanding  what's going on in our world in technology  because we look at it from a psychological point of view.  We look at it from the person point of view.  Individual.  Individuals, like what if Mark Zuckerberg did this  or Evan did that.  But really, we should be looking at it from a sociological.  And she says, that's why you can't say, well,  if you go back in time and kill Hitler,  would the Nazis not have existed?  Of course they would have, because it was sociological.  It was a response to economic and other conditions in Germany.  And I think we'd have a Trump right now,  whether his name's Donald or not.  I think it's both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's also anthropological.  It's about communities that want each other.  I think it's also psychological.  Yes, you can't ignore psychology, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  But it's a mistake to, the great man theory is a mistake,  I think is really the point of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is also why I argue that in journalism,  we've got to reconceive of journalism from that basis.  I just had a conversation with an anthropologist.  I want to bring the anthropologist  into the journalism school and say,  if communities aren't getting along,  what do we know about communities  from an anthropological structure?  What do we know from sociologists?  What do we know from psychologists?  What do we know from- We just love,  and I'm seeing it already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm seeing the horse race coverage already on the media.  That's how we like to see it, it's a horse race.  And it does such a disservice to the real serious issues  that we have to solve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It sells newspapers.  Right, it works.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd expect better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm reading it now.  The book I mentioned on the show,  I'm reading it now.  It's pretty wonky, Leo.  I hope I warned you sufficiently.  No, I like it.  It's fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  A lot of books, and this might be one of them,  could really be better served with a long article.  Yeah, I would agree.  Cause I feel like I kind of got the premise.  I got it in the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But he had to prove it to you.  Yeah, but I got it.  Yeah, I described it in my post about it.  And he said, you got it right.  So I was glad to hear that.  But I kept on, I needed him to walk me through the process.  There needs to be a freemium model to the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Far too many books are written  that really should have just been nice long reads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I do agree.  Some of them, not Jeff's obviously,  but some of them sort of pad them out  because they think this has got to be really thick  or people aren't going to take it seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's frustrating to me because I do audio books.  And unlike a paper book, it's not really a way to skim.  You can't skim.  So if a book like that, you can say,  okay, let me look at the next chapter.  Okay, let me look at the next chapter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is he saying?  What speed do you listen to the audio books on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Normal, maybe I should listen fast.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Very, I'm starting to realize-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Very few people listen to our podcast at 1.0.  They almost all listen to us sped up.  I must be so friendly to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How do people get up with me when they speed me up  to double what I talk at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, don't talk like that.  The problem is they come here and they sit in the studio.  We all sound like Nancy Pelosi.  They think we're all drunk  because we're talking at normal speed.  This show takes so long.  So damn long.  Let's end it now, but I'm going to end it with a number  and a pick.  How about that?  The number is $1.3 million.  That's what this crappy Samsung laptop  went for at an art auction because-  Nice.  Oh man.  It's called the persistence of chaos.  A cheap Samsung NC 10 loaded  with the most potent viruses of all time.  The six viruses that cause almost $100 billion in damage.  It was created by artist Guo O'Dong  and it was sold by Sotheby's.  Wow.  Some art collector for $1.3 million.  Why didn't I think of that?  Honestly, I could have done this.  Isn't that what you say about modern art though?  I could have done that.  And my pick of the week will protect you  against those viruses and a lot of other stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why don't you sell an iPod  with the 10 most dangerous podcasts on it?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'll call them netcasts though and really get your attention.  So I have to do more research on the provenance of this  but I'm really impressed  and I think it's something people should pay attention to.  In the past we've recommended services like OpenDNS.  You replace your internet service providers' DNS numbers  with OpenDNS.  That means all your DNS queries out to the internet  go through them and it means they can do things  like block stuff that's not good and so forth.  It's really an interesting way to do it.  Cloudflare has one, it's 1.1.1.1.  It protects your privacy so that you use them  instead of your internet service provider  thereby keeping your internet service provider  from learning about every single thing  you're doing on the internet.  This one, they say combines the privacy of Cloudflare DNS  with the ad blocking and malware blocking of Piehole  which is a Raspberry Pi project we've talked about.  It's called NextDNS.  It's NextDNS.io.  It's a simple thing to do.  You replace your regular ISP DNS with their numbers.  Actually they support IPv6 too  which makes it really powerful.  And then you can customize it.  Let me just, you can create a configuration  without actually signing up for it.  So let me just show you what you see.  So this is how you would set it up  and they show how to do it for Windows, Mac, Android, iOS  or the best way to do it in your router.  And they talk about how to do it in a regular router  or if you use PF Sense you can use that as well.  And then they show you what you can do.  So you can turn on security  which will block malware, phishing attacks, botnets.  You could turn on ad blocking.  It'll block it at the routers.  That's what Piehole does.  You can also block porn.  If you really have a problem with social media  you can block all social networking sites, gambling sites,  crypto miners, that's a big problem with malware  that does crypto mining on your system  without your permission.  Fake news and click bait.  How do you do that?  Because they're lists.  Here's how you do that.  And you can actually go into it.  You can see what lists.  Oh, that's dangerous.  Well, don't turn it on then.  You don't have to turn it on.  So is Fox News on there?  Well, what you can do is look at what lists they're using  and you can even modify them.  VPNs and proxies, peer-to-peer networks,  piracy sites and gaming sites.  So obviously you're gonna use it in a way  that perhaps wouldn't make it so complete.  You can look directly at the lists if you want.  So various people create various lists  and you can use those instead of those gross switches.  If you wanna get smarter,  you can actually modify the list and so forth.  And there's quite a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is-  Or you can just go to the porn list and use all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or, yeah, you could turn it the other way around  because you do have the ability  to both blacklist and whitelist sites.  You can also turn off access to a bunch of services,  including Fortnite parents.  You have that ability.  Analytics are there to show you  how many queries have been blocked.  And what I really like is you can create  multiple configurations.  So you can have a configuration for the kids,  a configuration for home, a configuration for work.  It even works on mobile devices.  So I have an Android configuration, an iOS configuration.  I think this is- Who's behind it?  The Chinese government.  The Chinese government.  I don't know.  And that would be a very important question.  Ask before you sign up for it.  I did read up before I recommended.  I did read up on the people behind it  and you probably should do so as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It says director of engineering at Netflix.  Yeah, it's good people.  Former head of mobile at Dailymotion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's network gurus, guys who understand this stuff.  It's not that hard a thing to do.  But it is a hard thing for most users to do.  If you're smart enough to be able to change  your DNS settings, this is a very interesting service.  I've recommended OpenDNS in the past.  I'm testing NextDNS.  I've put it on at home and on my phones.  And so far it works and it works imperceptibly  and it absolutely will speed up your surfing  in a lot of interesting ways.  And the ability to block fake news.  Wow.  I couldn't download this show though.  They should have a filter for long podcasts.
