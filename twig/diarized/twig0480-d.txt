The show where we cover the latest news from Google and hail hail the gang's all here.  I'm so pleased to see Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York at BuzzMachine.com in his lovely home.  Will trick or treaters be pestering us this evening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We live on large acre lots, so they have to be really good coming down a long hilly driveway.  It's not worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I never buy candy because we're in a cul-de-sac in the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you guys, it's the best part of Halloween.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's Stacey Higginbotham and she will be leaping to her feet.  She's monitoring the front door with her Nest Cam.  And at any moment she may have to run in.  What are we what are we doing for candy this week?  I put a sample up here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have Sour Patch Kids.  Also Swedish Fish, but I didn't bring those up because they are not.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would eat those if I had them.  I thought you were going to say I'm not going to bring them because I'll eat them.  Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I have both peanut and plain M&Ms.  Yum.  I would eat those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I want Stacey to do to the kids what she does to her husband with her IOT stuff.  You know, use the ring doorbell to scare the hell out of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you can have your Hue lights play spooky sounds, motion sensitive, all that.  We do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we have done Halloween lights.  One year Anna and I did set up a Halloween thing at our door.  So when you triggered a motion sensor at the bottom of the steps coming up to our front door,  it would turn on a blow dryer that would make a ghost go, whoo.  That's good.  There's a lot of latency.  So really what happened was the ghost just would randomly to the kids perspective,  just go, whoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know, latency is the death of a great Halloween scare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  Because everything's about timing when it's Halloween.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I find latency scary all the time on the show.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  Since latency is hard when you're doing Skype as well.  Well, Jeff, is there anything that's happened over the last few weeks that you that we we might have  talked about but you didn't get to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, God knows.  Don't say that.  Don't remind me of the last few weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what about here's one.  Jimmy Wales firing the journalists at his journalistic startup, the Wiki Tribune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yep.  And I haven't actually heard from him yet.  And I was a funder of Wiki Tribune.  So I should find out what's going on.  I think that Jimmy's model of having the professional journalists work with the public, I think, was him trying and it kind of didn't work.  And now he's giving the keys to the public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because professional journalists were dismissive of the public.  Some of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We have one of our social journalism students working there, graduates working there, and he wasn't.  He wouldn't be.  No, of course not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, journalists, in some ways we are dismissive because we have a very real culture thing.  Like I remember hiring someone who was not a journalist who I didn't find out until like and actually someone else hired him.  I didn't until and I was this managing editor.  He actually owned shares in Apple and was our Apple reporter.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there's this which I miss the journalistic standard, to be honest with you.  And I do think that I mean, you can come.  It's not hard to communicate that and put it in writing and have them sign something that says you don't own shares in companies you cover.  You know, I mean, there's some basic tenets that I think aren't that hard to communicate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, well, there's there's so I'm involved in the Reporters Without Borders Journalism Trust Initiative.  Ooh, that's scary Halloween stuff.  And me in Paris, that's the nice part.  But I got shouted out of the room practically when I said that's our job to listen to the public and understand the public and be responsive to many communities, diverse communities.  And all this.  The journalists are still in this many of them this naughty mode that we know best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's not going to serve them well in the new no, it's not fascistic era that this kind of I'm reading right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Paul stars creation of media rather a rather magisterial history of media in the US.  And if I may class, I found it really interesting that before the Bill of Rights, when the fight was going on between the federalists, the others, but the rights that the original versions kind of now I'm not going to find it.  I'm not going to find it.  The Pennsylvania Bill of Rights, for example, I'm not gonna find it right away.  But it said, here we go.  The Pennsylvania Declaration of Rights stating quote, that the people, the people have a right to freedom of speech and of writing and publishing their sentiments.  Therefore, the freedom of the press ought not to be restrained.  What comes first there?  The people.  The voices of the people.  Yeah.  Mooshed together and rewritten and added in and made into a First Amendment.  That spirit that was very much part of the founders view those who believe in the first in the Bill of Rights got kind of lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Journalists are people first.  And they're right.  The people we cover are people for.  But that's the point is that the journalists have rights because the people have rights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, exactly.  And it's the job of the journalist to help the people to be heard.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, we've done our, we've done our, that's our obligatory, obligatory journalistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I hope we haven't lost the entire audience in the first three minutes.  Yeah, I was like, that's brave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Starting off with journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about we start with sexism?  Andy Rubin paid $90 million.  And we, I think we had some suspicions about why Andy Rubin, the guy who created Android, left so abruptly, left Google, started Essential.  Larry Page in his farewell, his public farewell, said, I want to wish Andy all the best with what's next with Android.  He created something truly remarkable with a billion plus happy users.  But what Google did not make public, we've learned from a report in the New York Times, was that he had been accused of sexual misconduct.  Google investigated, found the claim credible, and asked for Andy Rubin's resignation.  But instead of escorting him out the door, they handed him a $90 million exit package, $2 million a month for four years.  Google said, this apparently has happened in a number of cases.  Google said that the New York Times story contains numerous inaccuracies.  Actually, Andy Rubin said.  Well, Andy Rubin's about to die.  I'm sorry.  Numerous inaccuracies and wild exaggerations about my compensation.  And he denies the sexual misconduct allegation.  After the publication of the article, Sundar Pichai, Google CEO, wrote an email to employees with Eileen Norton, their vice president for people operations,  that the company had fired 48 people for sexual harassment over the last two years and that none of them received an exit package.  Not addressing specifically the Andy Rubin case.  Stacey, you're first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, because I have some things to say about this.  One, Andy Rubin, unfortunately, we've decided to make Andy Rubin a poster child.  And his issue, while not great, was not actually, to me, the most problematic.  So his was consensual sexual contact, I guess, with a colleague.  Whereas I found some of the other allegations, such as the hardware, the head of Google X hardware, I found his allegations way more troubling.  Now he's out, by the way.  He just resigned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And without apparently compensation.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good.  And I also found, so what's interesting here is there is the degree of stories and how they kind of fall across the spectrum of incredibly egregious, such as the hardware dude.  Propositioning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sexual misconduct covers a broad range.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that guy propositioning a 24 year old during a job interview feels like, hey, buddy, that's just not cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's even worse than that because he says he knew she wasn't going to get hired, but he misrepresented it and invited her to Burning Man with him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Is that worse?  I think it's worse just to proposition someone in a job interview.  I'm going to go with that.  I mean, had she gotten hired in this situation?  Would that have been great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's bad too.  But she didn't get hired.  And was it because she turned him down?  We're talking about Rich Duvall.  Rich Duvall, he is the guy behind, one of the founders of Project Loon, and he did not receive an exit package when he resigned today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yay.  And then the Drummond case was also troubling in a different way because it showed how men get protected in a way, even among a consensual relationship between people in their departments without a policy put in place by HR dealing with dating between colleagues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He apparently fathered a child with a subordinate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which, again, that's totally consensual, which is very, you know, which...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so some of this is a violation of company policy because you're not supposed to have a relationship with a subordinate, a direct report.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they moved her from being a direct report, but unfortunately they moved her and she went down in the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She got moved out of the legal department to sales.  She was a contract manager on Google's legal team and she felt like she was kind of pushed aside, basically.  Yes.  And he continued as chief counsel or general counsel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In this fall, I mean, that is unsurprising to me, but it follows along with an entire culture of...  Promiscuity is the wrong thing, but the founders of Google, the CEO of Google, the former CEO of Google, sorry, they dated people within the company.  They had a well-publicized kind of laissez-faire attitude towards relationships with people, which is not in and of itself terrible.  But when you pull all of that together, you see how this happened and it is incredibly frustrating.  And that is that sort of culture is terrible for women because you never know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amit Singhal, who was the head of search at Google, was forced out, went to Uber and then got fired at Uber because he didn't tell them he'd left Google over a sexual harassment allegation.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One thing that I found interesting in the story, I think the time story was very good, is that part of the compensation of Annie Rubin is that Larry Page saying that Annie Rubin didn't get full value for what he brought to Google in Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google made billions and billions and continues to make billions on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But what's interesting to me in that is that there's a screwed up structure here of kind of the star system and the person versus the product.  Right. In a proper world, Annie Rubin should have had, I'm being simplistic here, but such appropriate ownership in Android, if he was that valuable to it, that the compensation came through that instead of saying that he's the star who deserves the money.  Right. The money should flow through the company and the creation in a way, if that makes any sense at all.  But it became kind of a guy guy star star thing where, well, he brought such value.  He didn't make such a friggin fortune on what he brought.  Let's wave goodbye to him, but pay him a lot of money.  To my mind, he should have already had that compensation built in somehow.  And it was a judgment of Android's value versus his value.  If that makes any sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it does.  Now, when you buy a company, you it's kind of like investing in a house, right?  When you buy a company through M&A, you are making an investment in most cases.  So they invested in that in Google and Android.  The value accelerated.  And yes, his his current compensation should reflect that.  But once he's pushed out, you have to you have to draw the line.  You have to say, hey, I know it would be awesome as as we keep making money on Android, you keep making money on Android.  But A, the deal wasn't set up that way in the first place.  And B, you shouldn't be able to benefit from an investment on something if you've been kicked out of the company for sexual misconduct.  I don't know. I mean, we don't let felons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I guess really for us, the big story is not I mean, not these individual cases.  But is there some sort of corporate culture, toxic culture at Google?  And does it persist today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are we asking that question?  Because yes, yes, and yes, and there has been and there will be until we get people to actually clean it up.  I mean, this is actually probably a really good sign.  And I think this reckoning that's happening across Silicon Valley is it's really a good sign.  And I'm glad that companies are doing this as painful and as excruciating as it is for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think Google's reformed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they're trying to reform.  They're trying. I mean, how many employees does Google have now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Lots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the official answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tens of thousands.  Yes.  So you don't you can't change that overnight, but they should be trying to change that.  And hopefully they can and will.  I think hiring, you know, hey, more women broadening your hiring pool will probably help.  So, you know, maybe you don't go to the same universities or maybe you don't take recommendations from certain people.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. And the other question is with with a lack of diversity, I think you're right, Stacy.  The diverse hiring is the key solution and diverse promoting more important is key solution.  And and one wonders with such low numbers on race what the situation is like for people of color in the company, too.  But it's it's it's Stacy's right. It's endemic, not just to Google.  It's it's the valley.  But it's the valley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like Google is kind of the same as Uber in this respect.  When they started, it was small.  It was a bunch of graduate students.  They had very loose kind of yes, pump practices and they didn't mature.  The company as it got bigger and more valuable and more importantly, had a greater impact on society.  They didn't mature.  They still kind of maintain that party atmosphere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there is a culture of immaturity across most of the startup world.  And part of that is the I mean, we can call it the bro culture.  I don't know if it really is, but it is the work hard, move fast, break things.  Right. That is very much an immature philosophy.  Right. It is it is very cavalier in a way that maturity tends to change you and make you less cavalier about the world.  And that that has its pros and cons. Right.  And I think the other thing to think about here is how Wall Street has rewarded the tech community.  And as the tech community became such a hot commodity and generated so much wealth,  a lot of the people who went to who used to want to work on Wall Street went to tech.  And I think you have to think about the type of person who values incredible amounts of money  and is willing to risk it all. We portray this as like geeky engineers trying to do things.  But that's actually not entirely true.  It is a geeky engineer who is willing to do maybe cross some ethical lines.  Maybe it's a geeky engineer who's willing to work, you know, 100 hours a week.  There's a very similar persona at work there, if that makes sense.  Did I not explain? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's on the one hand. On the one hand, there's a an optimism and an empowerment that I so admire about the technologists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think that's actually true. I think they come out.  I was about to say the other hand. I was going to. Sorry. I'm like, OK, on the other hand, I think there's I think the architecture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There is that these tools are are empowering.  And and that is what I admire about Silicon Valley.  But the problem is you have to have a little and boldness to reinvent the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you have certain arrogance, too, right? You have to. I mean, you've got a male.  The thing that changed his life was realizing that the world was created.  The rules are created by people not any smarter than himself.  And he could do whatever he wanted. And look at Elon Musk.  And look, I think that that kind of world changing vision.  I mean, you might not want to be friends with these people, but I I so fundamentally disagree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think that is the the mythic founder.  That's a founder myth that we put up there. Right.  But there are founders who are not.  There are founders whose companies do well, who actually treat people well.  And so, yes, you have to be willing to take risks, but you don't have to be willing to take risks at the expense of an entire population of people or at the expense of like doing knowing that you're doing something wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, I think you see Mark Benny off trying to be a model in that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But honestly, even running the small business that I run, one of the things that's hard about running a business is that sometimes you have to kind of be an ass.  You have to do things that as a human you wouldn't want to do, like fire people.  You wouldn't want to do that. But OK, there's a good business for often for the good of the business.  You have to be a little ruthless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is a difference between being a little bit of an ass and being an ass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm hoping that I'm only a little bit of one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're going to have to bleep this episode ten times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you can't you can't I mean, firing someone for cause is actually not being an ass.  I'm sorry. It's someone saying.  Let me give you a different scenario.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK.  And, oh, I was just I was just reading about a company and I can't remember what it was where a longtime employee just didn't have a role anymore in the company.  I think it was Amazon. And and I think he Bezos just, you know, kind of, oh, no, Netflix.  This was the Netflix debate. OK, we can we can bring that Netflix culture, which is radical, they say.  And I don't know one way or the other radical transparency and honesty.  But it sometimes it looks pretty ruthless because the the founder of Netflix, Reed Hastings, had to fire.  I think it was a high school friend because he he just no longer was of use to the company, not that he did something wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that is an OK reason to fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to if you know, Steve Jobs always said you don't want any you need all employees because you bring in one employee.  They may not do anything wrong, but they bring the whole level down because everybody stops performing.  You have to be a little ruthless in those. By the way, I am not that ruthless.  But I have a lot of work for you as an a. I know they're always is it.  But I have had to at times let go of somebody, not because he was bad or wasn't a great hard worker, but because we didn't have a role for him.  Yeah, and that's very, very hard. It is hard, but it is fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's ways you can do that. So at Giga, we had a person who in Giga may not be a shining example because it did implode.  But we had a person who their role just disappeared and that's killed, gave them two months and said, hey.  We we don't have a spot for you. Please go use this time, still contribute to the company, but also find another job.  And that's what this person did. And it's because we had trust among our employees.  And I guarantee you a place like 37 signals. No, yes, that's the name of the company.  Yeah, they used to be 37 signals. They've changed their name.  But now there's something there. I mean, there is a way to do this.  And maybe, yes, you're not going to generate all the profits. That's what Giga is a terrible example.  Because right now we are cutting costs in people you put making more money in front of how you treat people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And a company is a company. Here's the Wall Street Journal.  Here's the Wall Street Journal article from last week about Netflix's ruthless culture.  People who speak highly of Netflix's culture say the company's critics included former employees were fired for performance reasons and are disgruntled about their personal experiences.  They talk about the keeper test. Several formal colleagues describe Mr. Hastings in complementary terms as, quote, unencumbered by emotion.  In just the past year and a half, Mr. Hastings has employed the keeper test.  That is, let me see if I can get the keeper test. Is this person a keeper? Is this person worth keeping? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And are they worth fighting for? That's the other thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, employees are encouraged to give one another blunt feedback.  Managers are told to apply a keeper test to their staff, asking themselves whether they would fight to keep a given employee a mantra for firing people who don't fit the culture and insuring only the strongest survive.  In other words, if you wouldn't fight to keep that employee, then we're getting rid of him.  Last year, Hastings fired Neil Hunt, the longtime chief product officer who had helped create Netflix's famed algorithm that curates programming for viewers.  He was one of Netflix's earliest employees and had been Mr. Hastings' close friend for decades.  Mr. Hastings told Mr. Hunt a lot had changed. And one of your underlings, Greg Peters, is now better for the job. You're gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that's pretty ruthless. Well, look at GE, GE, which was vaunted. Now GE is nearing death practically.  But GE at its height, the belief was you constantly called. Yeah.  I consulted for a company for a while. I think that seems like a horrible environment and I wouldn't want to run a company that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But honestly, this isn't the most successful company ever.  And if you want to be an Amazon or a Netflix or a Google, you might have to be that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was in a company that was acquired.  And part of the rule when it was acquired was you have A, B and C employees and you need to get rid of your C employees.  And B is the new C. And that wasn't wrong in an acquisition.  Stacy's earlier point, Stacy, the thing that's even worse than what you describe is where I've hired the wrong person.  I made a mistake. Well, it's always that way for me, right?  Because it's all people I've hired. Well, sometimes people just screw up and do the wrong things and you can say, well, they're not doing the job anymore.  But I feel awful when after the fact, I realized, well, I shouldn't hire that person in the first place.  They weren't right for it. And it's my fault that they have to uproot their lives now.  That's what it feels the worst to me. Oh, it's horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's never ever, ever. Even if it's for cause, it's never a pleasant thing ever.  And actually, I take pride in the fact, and Lisa does, too, that we hate it because that tells me at least I'm not a horrible human.  It breaks my heart. Oh, I had one employee cry.  One guy burst into tears.  And then I said, OK, this was my mistake.  I said, OK, you can keep your job.  And then we had to fire him a few months later because he continued to screw up.  Oh, Leo. Leo. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't want to be that guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's my point is that sometimes this kind of brutal culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, wait, OK, I think you guys are confusing some things.  And I think it's really important to not confuse those.  There is brutal culture where you're like, you know, fight club, call everybody who doesn't perform 100 percent or even 95 and above all the time.  Right. Which I think is a pretty harsh culture.  Brutal. And there's firing someone or having a culture where you expect people to perform most of the time.  And if they don't, they're gone.  I mean, having fired people, it is not fun.  And you have a duty to do it in a way that is is respectful of what they've given the company.  But it is not brutal to fire someone if they're not performing.  It's not brutal to fire someone if you're going in a different direction.  It is brutal to fire someone if you are callous about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But, you know, in its culture, talk overdone, Stacy, Stacy and Leo, so much talk in the Silicon Valley is about instilling a culture and instilling the culture and all your new employees and doing all these things.  Is that a bunch of who or is it real?  I don't think so. I think it's I think it's maybe more talked about in Silicon Valley because it's a culture of its culture there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm saying it's a there are a lot of engineering people.  They're quote unquote data driven.  So anything that's fluffy or not, you can't put metrics to.  I think that becomes kind of culture.  And then you can use it poorly and say, hey, this person isn't a culture fit because their name isn't Jared.  And they didn't go to my college.  Or you can say, hey, the people at this company tend to behave a certain way.  And we value the following things.  So in corporate America, instead of culture, we say mission statement.  Right. That's in Silicon Valley, kind of the way I think it is.  I think you're going to get a culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, you're going to get a culture where the other always behave one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're going to get a culture.  So better to make it conscious or at least attempt to make it conscious and consciously an appropriate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And see, the problem is the human beings aren't businesses, even despite Supreme Court rulings to the contrary.  And the business is really a very different thing and is I don't think particularly humane.  I mean, I don't know.  Right. I'm a terrible businessman.  But it strikes me that you'd be better if you were a business person.  It strikes me that you'd be better if you were completely ruthless in business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And no, because no one would want to work for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but in the sense that you reward excellence and that you let go anything less than excellent.  And people would want to work for you in the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  And you know it going in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the way the place and Netflix apparently is that way as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's true.  And as I mean, in some cases, as long as it's advertised like Netflix has this quote unquote brutal culture, would I want to work there?  Probably not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you'd be happy working here, I think, because we're very.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, because apparently if you fire me, I can just cry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You cry and I'll go, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make you cry.  But I don't know where I was going with that.  This is a candy break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I fantasize about working for you, Leo.  I would be a good boss.  I fantasize about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that would be an enjoyable life.  Well, in a way, you both do, right?  I mean, you're hosts on the show.  We pay you to be on the show.  And I mean, you're not employees, you're contractors.  But yeah, I mean, I think we have good.  We try to we try to make the people that work here happy.  We have massages once a month.  We used to have weekly.  We fed everybody lunch today.  Every Wednesday you get lunch.  We're not Google.  You don't get lunch every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you think about business, most companies think about business only in terms of profit.  Right.  So how much money you've made?  There are other businesses out there.  I know it is.  But that is not the only way to think about a business.  You can actually I mean, there are social social.  What are those corporations called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I feel like we have a family here, but we're a small business, too.  It's only 20 people.  So yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And when you think about making money, if you think about not just making money, but making optimizing for every penny, you're going to make different decisions than if you were a business that was  going to optimize for worker productivity.  Right.  So you've got to think about that.  And part of this will depend on the type of industry you're in.  In tech, where there's high margins, it makes sense actually to invest in productivity and maybe kindness.  So you hire a different and wider worldview.  I don't know.  Tech is also highly competitive, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In some areas.  And there's this huge amount of paranoia.  Andy Grove, CEO Intel wrote, only the paranoid survive.  You have to always be looking over your shoulder.  The other guy's catching up with you.  Those are the kinds of things that make a culture ruthless in a company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I mean, I'm always looking over my shoulder for my business.  I'm like, oh, shoot, what's happening?  What kind of trends do I need to keep aware of?  So I'm always looking over for that.  But it doesn't.  I still have a choice in how I behave towards people.  Like if I look up and I say, hey, IOT is only going to be hot for six more months.  Kevin's not any good at AI, which is the next big thing.  So let me just fire Kevin and bring on someone else.  Watch out, Kevin.  Kevin, are you watching?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Kevin, Kevin.  Better put that resume out.  Get on LinkedIn, Kevin.  That would be a hard thing to do, wouldn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But when I look over my shoulder, let's say I'm looking.  I'm paranoid because I am.  I'm like, I never think I'm like, oh, my God, tomorrow everything could dry up.  So if I'm thinking along those lines, then I might say, oh, crap, Kevin, hey, I'm seeing this coming.  What do you want to do about it?  Here are options.  And Kevin can say, Stacey, I hate AI.  I hate industrial IOT.  I'm going to go work on my Chromebook site about Chromebooks.com.  And that's a nice, not nice.  I think that's a human way of looking at it versus me saying, oh, this is coming and freaking out and then killing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe I'm I mean, I'm never going to be a multi-billionaire founder of a media company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's exactly my point.  But I also don't want that.  I don't want it either.  Fortunately, at least it does.  And you're fired.  I don't know.  I mean, I just I understand why corporate cultures kind of can be different and that sometimes they can be ruthless.  And I think Silicon Valley in particular kind of lends itself to that.  It's also different when a company is big because it's not as personal.  And so the less personal becomes easier.  It becomes to do the quote right thing rather than the humane thing.  I don't know.  It's an interesting.  I didn't expect to get into this conversation, but I think it's a good conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like from sexual harassment.  Was that what we're talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We started with Andy Rubin and that's how this became.  Let's let's take a little break.  You guys pick your next story.  Oh, we got to work for our money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I work for your money now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I have so many good ones and I don't know where we want to go next.  But I'll let you each pick something that you think is worth studying.  While I mention privacy.com, I said new sponsor, but a company I've been using for a long time.  I can't remember when I set up my account almost a year ago now because I wanted a way to use a credit card online and feel good about it to feel secure about it.  Now, how many times have your credit card been stolen online?  Mine, half a dozen times.  And it's kind of a pain, especially because you have your credit card attached to a variety of accounts and you've got to go change and everything with privacy.com.  Privacy.com, I never use the same credit card twice.  You don't use the same password on every site.  You know that's a bad idea.  Same thing with a credit card.  Privacy.com generates a brand new virtual Visa card number for every purchase you make online with one click.  The minute that number is used by a merchant, it locks to that merchant.  So only that merchant can use it.  You can set a limit on spending per charge per month per year.  And it's easy to freeze or unfreeze cards.  So you'll never worry about being billed twice or upgraded without your consent.  It's easy.  I always use it for subscriptions.  You don't have to worry about forgetting to cancel subscriptions or free trials.  Just cancel the card and on the dashboard, you'll immediately know.  In fact, you might know that a company has been hacked before.  The company knows thanks to privacy.com.  Another feature I really love about privacy.com is that I don't have to use my real address when using the card.  So when I create a credit card and I use it, I can use any address I want.  123 Main Street, Anytown, USA.  And privacy approves the charge.  The merchant does not get my address.  Complete anonymity.  I love that.  Privacy.com is easy to use because they have an extension for Chrome.  They have an Android and iOS app that will quickly generate the cards easily on demand within the browser if you want.  The cards are tied to your checking account or your debit card account.  So these are not credit cards.  It's a debit card in effect.  That means no interest, but it's also no cost to you.  They make their money on the charge card fees to the merchant.  In fact, they make so much money.  You even can get money back up to five percent back depending on how much you use the card.  I just love this.  I just think it's the best way to go.  Privacy.com is PCI DSS compliant.  That's the same security standard your bank card is held to.  They use, of course, high grade encryption.  In fact, they use split key crypto so that even at privacy.com, no individual employee can see your account.  The partial keys are held by separate employees.  So access to the data on the server requires multiple keys to decrypt.  It's kind of like the nuclear codes.  I think this is brilliant. I use two factor authentication.  Of course, they provide customers access to transaction data via Webhook API so you can write your own little tool if you wish to scrape your privacy account.  I get text messages.  There's a great website with all sorts of information.  One hundred percent free to use.  So do it now. Just go to privacy.com slash twig.  A little incentive will give you five five dollars off your first purchase, a little credit towards your first purchase.  If you go to privacy.com slash twig, privacy.com is saved to customers over one hundred million dollars in unwanted and unauthorized charges due to compromised cards, hidden fees, forgotten subscriptions.  It's the only card I use online now.  I love it. Privacy.com slash twig.  You know, I could show you actually I did the other day.  I could show you all my privacy.com cards because you can't use them.  Only the merchant that uses the card first gets to use it.  It's locked into that merchant. Love it.  Privacy.com slash twig.  Stacey Higginbotham, Stacey on IOT.com, the Stacey on IOT podcast with Kevin Toffle.  Apparently who's on the chopping block.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We might be watching this. No, we're teasing Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, you're not on the chopping block.  Actually, I could see a move towards AI. Isn't AI kind of the next big thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, A, it's the current big thing and it's an integral part of IOT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm not. For instance, it's not hard.  Here's my story. Google and Roomba are working together.  Because Roomba is that vacuum cleaner.  We have one that goes around your house vacuuming.  It has a map of your home. Google and Roomba want to share that data.  The aim to make smart homes more thoughtful by leveraging the unique data set collected by iRobot, a map of your house.  You must have covered this on the IOT podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We did. We did talk about it this morning.  Yeah. What do you think?  So one, it's opt in. Two, the data that's pulled from this is not going to go to Google's advertising business.  So from our perspective, there's a couple of things that are important to note here.  One, Google's actually letting you say you want to share this data.  They're also offering consumers something in exchange for this data, which is, and I don't know how valuable this is.  You get to make that call. You can say, hey, gee, send the Roomba to the kitchen.  Yeah. So that's like, oh, is that worth it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I might be. And then Roomba, get the hell out of my room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So with this information, though, Google can start providing context in the smart home,  which is actually really important because right now we don't have context or good context.  And we suffer for it because we have to program all this stuff and explain all these things via weird nomenclad  like turn on movie night or all of that. So and if you don't want to do this,  you are not automatically opted in. So you have to opt out. So that's really important.  I agree. And this is only a certain type of Roomba, by the way, y'all. I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And Stacey, how does it work in the story? Sorry, as a question I saw in the story,  it also said that it could it could help in terms of things like saying which light to turn on and what part of the room.  And how does that work? Not just with the Roomba, but with the rest of IOT?  What could Google bring you in its home suite?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so if it knows that there are lights on in a room and it knows you're not home,  maybe it can send you a thing saying, hey, you're not here, but all your lights are on.  Do you want me to turn some off? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're going to need this kind of information if you want a smart home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you want a smart home, you will need this. If you want a home that can do this for you,  what I really don't want to see, though, is I would rather and we'll see this is going to be a really arduous, crappy process.  Amazon does this already with hunches where if you do something, it's like, hey, by the way, I see this is happening.  Do you want to fix that? I don't actually want my home to talk to me so much.  My home has never talked to me. Yeah.  So I wanted to get good really fast so it doesn't actually require my input.  But we are going to go through this awkward adolescent space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So let me ask a couple of things here.  What was the the Google cell phone thing where you could map the room for AR and stuff?  Tango, Project Tango.  So is this this is a less ambitious version.  Is this data almost as good as what Tango would deliver?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know, actually. So these cameras, they have low light, low light.  They have low resolution cameras on them and they have an understanding of depth.  I don't know if they can identify the brand of dishwasher using, for example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But here's the other thing about this that I keep on fantasizing about and that I'm surprised I haven't seen more action in this is imagine the utility of this for blind people.  I've long thought that you know you have something in your ear that says that you know that or that gives you a kind of a sound thing.  You follow the sound a little bit of left a little bit right to get to go where you want to go.  Yeah. But if you map environments, internal and external, I just think that could be incredibly freeing.  And I'm shocked that I haven't seen more efforts to do that.  Maybe I'm just being naive. Maybe they're out there. I don't know.  But this kind of data makes that possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're muted, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry. So focus on this for a moment, Jeff and Leo, you talk and I will tell you in a moment once I look it up.  The company that is doing this for blind people, yeah, a pair of glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I've seen stuff kind of like that.  Anyway, I think it's a good idea.  It's a good idea.  And there is an AI. I had a caller on my radio show this weekend.  ARIA.  ARIA.  A-I-R-A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  IRA.  IRA. Sorry. Yes.  Augmented Reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's neat. Using AI. Wow.  Wait, is this the same thing?  I think this is what the guy called me on the radio show to tell me about.  Oh, there you go. See?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it connects them to a trained professional agent who is dedicated to further enhancing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is like Be My Eyes. Be My Eyes does this too.  But there is one that will, there is an Android app that will read money, tell you what color something is,  will give you a lot of feedback about your environment.  And I think it's just the next step is to say you're on Main Street.  There's going to be an intersection in 30 feet.  The button to press the walk sign is on the left, that kind of thing.  And maybe, and I have seen, maybe it's sticks that have sound as you move it around.  But I have seen stuff like that.  It's out there.  There's a cane with haptic feedback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's it.  It was a project though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you consider what you can do with driving now,  and you consider the level of data that exists around environments,  and you consider the abilities to give various forms of feedback, words, sounds, haptic warnings,  it's not a big market.  There's not a lot of money to be had there.  But it just strikes me that it could be so life changing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the, thanks to the chat room, this is the app.  It's called Seeing AI.  And it is actually, maybe it was Johnny Jett told us about that,  a free app that narrates the world around you.  So as you walk around, the app will tell you what's going on.  So that's, let's see how this...  Oh, is that a face recognition too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks like it had face recognition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, folks, a good use of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Seeing AI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  An experiment to describe your surroundings with Seeing AI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Seeing AI is an ongoing research project.  And in the app, we've also included some of our more experimental features  that you have to turn those on in settings.  One of these is the ability to describe a general scene.  Let me see if I can find this at work.  The algorithm to take more things in the earlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Processing.  Probably a man sitting on a couch using a laptop.  Wow.  Take picture.  Processing.  A bus that is parked on the side of the road.  Button.  Take picture.  Processing.  Probably a box filled with different types of food on a table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is kind of what we were talking about the other day with the bananas.  Seeing AI.  It's microsoft.com slash seeing dash AI.  And it is available for, it looks like iOS only.  I misspoke.  It's not Android.  Of course you can scan barcodes using audio beeps to guide you.  Speak text, point at a sign, read text.  Recognize friends, Jeff.  And describe faces and emotions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow.  Well, the other use of that is for autism.  Right. Emotions.  Is being able to describe emotions and give cues.  That someone can't see.  It's just, it's just, when people get all moral panicky about, oh my God, all the bad things they can do.  They just, I just want a constant refrain of yes, but look to what this can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, here's one to keep, keep in mind.  And you can totally see how with spectacles and augmented reality, this could be huge.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It can also be a little.  We'll have to adjust to this because I don't, for example, want to walk into a bar and have everyone look at me and know instantly who I am.  Right.  I mean, that is, that is describing and it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But that's a matter of norms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If the blind person can find you and it's only somebody in your contact list, presumably.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, there's ways you could say there's, there's appropriate uses and inappropriate uses of any technology.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But we tend to in the tech world, open it up to everyone, realize that, oh, maybe that wasn't a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And then because that's up to us as the people to know the tech world shouldn't police us.  We should police ourselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, think about something like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's pretend that I had a stalker or, no, I understand why you don't want this.  I think it's absolutely legitimate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's in Jeff.  I would encourage you actually.  So I in college, I did have a stalker.  It was a very scary experience.  And I will tell you that I come to technology with a very different perspective because of that experience that is not techno panic.  It is really a matter of self-preservation.  So just run when you get excited about something, run that through the hands or run that through the scenario of if I am a person who does not want to be recognized because it's actively dangerous for me, what are the tools in place to make that safer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Good advice. Good advice.  Yes.  But I also want to say that before we get regulators ready to ban something as a German regulator was going to ban the use of GEO and facial recognition, the same thing.  Imagine the benefits at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and that gets kind of back to this whole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that gets back to this culture thing, right?  Like, there's lots of people in the world of Silicon Valley that have never had a stalker, right?  They're not thinking like that.  Whereas if you get, yeah, if you get more people involved to have that, then this is one way that diversity actually helps improve technology in a way that maybe makes regulation less necessary.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. I said you guys could pick stories.  Stacey, what's your story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My story is from the Atlantic.  Oh, we want to talk about techno panic.  This is about the Amazon selling machine.  And I liked the story to a certain point.  I think it's really important to draw people's attention to how Amazon's ad business works, where it gets its data from and how we're increasingly buying products like Kindles and tablets and God only knows what else that are showing us highly relevant ads and why people, why advertisers are really excited about it because Amazon has so much data.  And this comes from Amazon's quarterly result, which said that they are a huge ad company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They are now number three after Facebook and Google are selling digital ads.  Yep.  Wow.  Brands will spend $4.6 billion in advertising on the Amazon platform this year, according to eMarketer.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think it's going to reach 16 billion by 2012.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  16 billion by 2020.  Eight billion this year, 16 billion, according to Piper Jaffrey.  And in fact, that means it will make them more money than its big profit center right now, Amazon Web Services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That assumes Web Services stays still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway.  But there is, I guess the point is that Amazon now has a huge incentive to beef up its advertising and obviously has been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's less an incentive.  It's more that it's drawing attention to the fact that Amazon has this huge advertising business that none of us really think about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  And the key to that is data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  They have so much data.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and they have the most important kind of data.  So search data used to be the best data because you're like, well, someone's looking for it.  They really want it.  Right.  Amazon has purchased data.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Purchase and intent.  And intent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When I search Amazon, I'm searching for a product that I actually want to buy.  I don't just window shop on Amazon.  OK, I do.  But anyway, but the reason I was I picked this story is because there is this is the perspective to make all this sound really evil was, oh, now Amazon has ads everywhere.  And we're going to move to this era of hyper consumerism.  And that's bad.  And it's in the implication is that it's Amazon's fault because they're showing us more ads.  And I think going in with the social like changing our social habits and more as as we advance technology, this is a really important thing to talk about the role that consumerism needs to play in our lives as people become more adept at marketing to us.  I think most people realize that just buying random stuff is a fairly hollow thing.  I think we need to start having those conversations.  We need to start talking to our kids about it.  We need to start practicing what we preach on this front.  And so I thought the story was interesting.  I didn't love how it approached it, but I do think it's an important thing we should start talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And like everything we talk about, this is exactly the kind of thing you talk about, Jeff, where you could see some real benefits to consumers.  If Amazon knew that I was running out of laundry powder and said, do you want some more?  That would be a value.  There's a lot of valuable things Amazon could do that would be advertising, as well as many things that would not be so good and like encouraging rank consumers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What still gets me is right.  And you could put in preferences.  You could say that I want only things that come from renewable sources and start rating things, all kinds of good things.  But what gets me is that is the stupidity of programmatic retargeting advertising.  That is to say, you look at the boots on Amazon and they follow you around for months.  Yeah.  Amazon knows you bought them.  You buy the boots on Amazon.  They follow you around for months.  Exactly.  So that it's stupid.  I've been pounding the desk.  Yeah.  It's stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It figures, hey, you bought it before.  Maybe you want another pair.  Yeah.  Well, they're not thinking like people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, yes, that's a thing.  But I think the issue to think about here and what we should start talking about more is how do we teach our kids?  How do we internalize within ourselves that we don't need to buy as much stuff, that we don't need to buy everything we see, that it's not going to make us happy?  Because I think the real risk here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not up to Amazon.  Yeah.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This story portrays like it's Amazon's fault, but I think it does illustrate an issue that we actually really do need to start talking about.  And, you know, there's the idea of like, is this like tobacco?  Is it inherently addictive?  I don't think so.  But maybe if you show it, I think for children it might be.  You could weaponize it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would never put it beyond Silicon Valley to figure out a way to skinner box Amazon purchases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You get gold points.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that what SNH Greenstamps were really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they have those now for like loot boxes.  And can I just tell you for children today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, loot boxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's not just loot boxes.  It's like every toy now has a secret.  I guess it's kind of like Cracker Jacks, but you buy like a six or eight dollar figurine and you having and you have no idea what is inside.  And my daughter is like sucked on these like little unicorn things.  I don't even know what they are.  Unicornios, unicorn mermaid combos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the good news.  She will grow out of it.  I hope so.  Oh, yeah.  My daughter, you know, we went through Beanie Babies, Weebles, American Girl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some of them are just basically like, oh, here's a mystery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we're like, no, that's what loot boxes are.  You bet.  You know, it's going to be something good.  It's gambling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's it's training them in a way and it's it's kind of affecting their brains.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Reuters article from the chat room.  Kids apps may have a lot more ads than you think.  Those cute little apps your child plays with are likely flooded with ads, some of which are totally age  inappropriate, according to researchers at the Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics.  Ninety five percent of commonly downloaded apps marketed to or played by children ages five and under  contain advertising.  Ninety five percent five and under.  Wow.  That's because it's free.  It's free.  The kids often can't tell where the game leaves off and the ad begins.  There's science to show that children aged eight and younger can't distinguish between content and advertising.  They can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's I mean, there is like when you advertise to children, you are really you have we should have much stricter  regulations about that, I think.  Yeah, just because I've watched.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we had them on TV, but I guess we haven't gotten around getting them for.  Do you remember?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, they're bringing all these back now.  But I just watched the Care Bears movie with my daughter because she was feeling nostalgic.  And I was like, wow, this actually has content.  But I rewatched T-Man and I was like, oh, this was terrible.  This this was really bad.  And I love that show.  And I had Castle Grayskull and all the sheet rows and everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This stuff is not new.  No.  I'm sure that SNH Greenstamps is new.  But it's been weaponized.  It's become so much more effective than it used to be.  All right, Jeff, your pick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I the one that the one that kind of I really loved this week was the dot new domain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dot new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So so that now if you want to start a new doc, you just put in doc dot new and Google knows in Google Docs to give you a new doc like doc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you want me to call up Andrew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  Andrew doesn't like this or is he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, he's he's I mean, it's just Google using a top level domain.  So it's a good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's all it is.  But why wasn't it done 10 years ago?  It seems it's one of those things that seems so obvious in the top level domains.  But how long have you had top level domains?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is where we have to ask Andrew only for the last few years.  But we've had a few years.  You're saying you ask Andrew, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're women, if you're saying if I go to this week in Google dot new, it will create a no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you if you simply in on Chrome type doc dot new.  Yeah, it opens up a new Google Doc for you.  Oh, you got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, doc dot new.  And and then because I'm logged into Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Exactly, because it knows you.  And you can do doc dot sheet and doc.  Yes, I can.  And there's various forms of it.  Yes.  It's just the question.  Andrew's coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What if you want him?  What? Tell me why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How does he know all about this?  Because he's a domain name person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this gives me a chance to go check in on Halloween costume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is this is what is the daughter going to be this year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She is going as a bodyguard for one of her friends who is going in as a pop musician that I can't recall.  So she's got all black and a bubble gun.  And that's she's going to stand most of the time.  She and her her other best friend are going to stand on each side of her other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I noted this is a trend this year in Halloween is these group costume.  I mean, it's not fun.  It's not that new.  But yeah, we went to a haunted house that was attended mostly by high school.  And younger, but mostly high school kids.  And one popular one, which I was thought it was a little sad, was the Playboy Punny and Hugh Hefner.  So a guy would wear a smoking jacket and they all they were like a half dozen of these groups and a little yawning cap.  And then he'd be surrounded by three or four women or girls.  They were really girls in bunny ears and various forms of scanty costumes.  That was a little weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that is weird.  I went as a chicken one year in high school and my friend went.  No, I was a giant chicken.  And my friend went as a farmer with a machete.  Oh, that's a little fake.  A machete. That's even better.  But yeah, chicken soup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Anybody scared chicken?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was. Yeah, I stayed far away from him.  It was it was fun.  But they don't.  Yeah, that's not a sexy costume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are there other things I can do with this stock dot new thing?  Here comes Andrew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here comes the hubby system.  I'll be back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is the Halloween exchange.  Stacey is putting on her costume as Andrew Higginbotham.  And boy, it's a really good costume.  Stacey looks just like her husband.  It's it's hey, Andrew, we've not met.  Well, I've met in person.  We've not met on this show.  Well, you've been on the show once, I think.  Oh, has he been on before?  OK.  Well, maybe with a guest host.  OK. Yeah, exactly.  So we were talking about this weird thing Google's doing with dot new.  And Stacey says you're a domain name expert.  Why? How are you a domain name expert?  That's what I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's I blog about domain names on domain name wire dot com.  And it's a little niche, but it's kind of exciting, I guess.  Probably not to most people.  No, that's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should be on the show sometime.  Domain name wire dot com.  Yeah.  So what is this dot new and how does that work?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is actually pretty clever what Google's done.  So back in 20, let's see, when was it 2012?  You could apply for these new extensions.  And that's when Google got a dot app, which I believe might be what I talked about on the show when you weren't on it one time.  OK.  But they applied for a lot of these names.  They got dot Google, for example, which they use for a few different things.  And so dot new is one of the ones I got.  I don't know why they got it.  Oh, Stacy's going to laugh.  My last name is not Higginbotham, but oh, oh, she's laughing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You could hear in the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can we hyphenate it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's it's Alamon.  Alamon.  But you're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know how to spell that.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can just say Andrew.  Andrew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think he should be Andrew Higginbotham.  I really do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mr. Higginbotham.  I think that's the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So keep it in, Andrew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that new is one of the ones that they bought.  And so this is pretty pretty clever, I think, creating a shortcut out of these domain names.  So a lot of people are creating forwards from one of these new domain names to another.  But for example, I just just this afternoon needed to create a new Google Doc.  So I typed Doc.new into the browser and it's essentially a web forward.  Right. That's it's forwarding it to a web address that's then opening up a new doc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's so in the DNS, they it's a script or is it simply a DNS?  Is it like a an A name entry or I imagine it's just like a URL forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  So to kind of a generic URL that creates a doc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But because you're logged into your Google account, that doc is saved under your Google account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly. Exactly.  So I think that's all they're going to go right under that structure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They could have had a different name wasn't that new or something else.  But to use the URL to do a function within Google because because because starting a new doc is a pain.  You've got to open drive.  You've got to go to the thing.  You've got to say what is new.  What is it? It's a new blank document.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just give it to me.  Now it's it's it's in.  I think it's incredibly clever.  I think it's just elegantly clever.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, right now I keep WordPad and Notepad docked on my PC so that if I need to make some quick notes, I just do it in there.  But now if I can just type new doc or new dot sheet and open up a spreadsheet, I think that is pretty clever.  And you're right, Jeff.  I mean, they could have done that for a long time.  They didn't need a new top level domain name to do that.  But I think they're probably looking at it and they're like, what are we going to do with this name?  Now that we own it.  Yeah, that that new you know, originally these companies thought that people there just be a lot of demand for for these new top level domain names so that people would we go register, you know, twit dot new or something like that or twit dot app.  And the demand hasn't really been there, at least to the level that people expected.  And so I think this is kind of a clever way that also brings awareness that there's more than dot com to the right of the dot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And Andrew, what's fascinates me too is that we tend to we in media think of everything as content.  So a domain is going to point to content.  The fact that a domain is used to launch a function is just a different way to think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Have you seen anything like that from anyone else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can't think of anything.  And I think I would have heard about it.  I mean, there are a lot of people that are taking names and just forwarding it somewhere else.  But you're exactly right to have it do a function, which I guess is made possible by the fact that there are web apps.  If you want to call Google Docs that.  Yes, I think that's I think it's clever and I think it's novel as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That only works within Google, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, see, I'm going to I'm going to do this.  I'm going to create a incognito tab so that I'm not logging in Google and I don't think I think this will still work.  I think the redirect.  Yeah.  The first thing, though, is going to have me do is say it says sign in.  Yeah.  So the other way they could have done it is a redirect that creates a doc.  But until you save it, it doesn't.  As soon as you save it, it says, OK, but you got to save it to your account would be another way to work.  It's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Docs. So I like that.  That was my thing for the week.  I thought that was that was that was Andrew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you. Nice to meet. Nice to see you again.  You bet. Take care.  He's waiting back there.  I see you're on the Pilates reformer.  Stacey, can you can you do a couple of little?  Yeah, no, she's not going to do that for us.  While Stacey and Andrew are rearranging, let me let me talk about our sponsor.  How about that?  Wordpress.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The key part.  The key part is done.  The key part.  The getting on of the wig.  I was going to have a purple wig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I was going to have a purple wig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My daughter decided she wanted the purple wig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, so you're going to do a costume, too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, because I'm not going trick or treating.  You have to do candy.  I do have an Elsa costume in the closet, but it's not 2014.  So nobody would know who you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it Elsa the lioness from Born Free?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That Elsa?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really?  Really, Leo?  It's it's really.  Let's just let this go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's time for the Google change log.  That one.  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did this this morning with the Google keyboard.  You can use it on iOS or Android.  And I set it up on Android.  I'll show you my new my new Google.  Gmoji.  I don't know what you call it.  Sticker.  That's me.  Gmoji.  Oh, my.  Gmoji.  You take a selfie and the Gmoji turns it into you.  And then you can use it as a sticker.  Or did I do it on the other?  Maybe I did on this phone.  Let's do it on this phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Somewhere on the rundown, I have mine that I made.  Did you?  Yes.  Under other, is it?  OK, we'll find that.  You guys all made Gmojis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it just happened.  So you have time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You won't be.  So how do I make a Gmoji?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I was just about to show you if I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I got a first.  I got to find somewhere to type.  OK, here we go.  OK.  And then I get the keyboard.  And then, boy, I can't remember now.  Is it this sticker here?  Search stickers.  Oh, let's add a new sticker.  Yeah, yeah.  And here it is.  It says your minis customized stickers based on you create.  So I have to get a picture of me.  OK, ready?  OK, now it's Gmojiing me, creating a mini.  So you need to be using the Gboard on Android or iOS.  And that kind of looks like me, right?  Do you like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where's my sticker option?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I can, of course, add different hairstyles.  I can add a little bit of hair.  It knew I have gray hair and kind of grayish eyebrows,  so that's kind of cool.  Got my face a little dark.  I'll make it a little lighter.  I don't have facial hair, but I could add it.  Facial marks, yeah.  Old man marks.  And then I got to have some glasses.  How about a monocle?  Oh, how about it?  And now I'm going to save that out.  Now what it's done is it's created a bunch of stickers based on that.  I'm done.  I'm not seeing this option.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel so bereft.  I see what I want this now.  This is actually something I would use.  I'm an active sticker user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's nice is they're not they don't have the uncanny valley of the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, someone pointed out that if I'm in Texas because of the biometric stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you're kidding me.  In Texas and Northern California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  More old panic.  See what it does to you.  You can't do a Gmoji.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, yes, but the reason why I can't do a Gmoji is because they don't want my face being used to unlock weird things.  So can you do me emoji on your iPhone?  I don't have an iPhone because because I'm not a fan of Apple.  We can talk later about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That seems that seems rude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Doesn't it though?  Maybe I can do it on my my computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe you need a VPN to pretend you're somewhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have one, but if I turn on the VPN, our connection goes to heck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then apparently how well did Jeff do is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's not it's not what you just did.  It's something different than what are you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've got a cat.  Look, you look like Mark Zuckerberg in that picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I saw no way to put it going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff, I got bad news for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, that's bitmoji.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's yeah.  Well, this is yeah, this is not I guess bitmoji is another company and you can do that.  I can.  That's owned by Snapchat.  Yeah, that's owned by Snapchat and you can do bitmoji in your Snapchat app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can get to it.  You can get to it through the Google keyboard now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice.  Oh, that is that's the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you guys.  This is just like emoji.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Emoji minis are emoji size stickers that look to you like you.  Okay.  Yeah, that's what I that's what I did is an emoji mini.  It's gotten the nomenclatures out of control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I don't even know where to check on which keyboard I'm using.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should have your show me your keyboard.  I'll tell you if it's G board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, we're going to do a keyboard diagnostic.  The first time ever on national podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Of course, it's too much contrast.  You're not going to see it.  It's too bright.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  So you go into your app.  Oops, sorry.  Go, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you just go into my settings, go into settings and then search for keyboard.  Oh, I guess search.  Okay.  Search is your best friend in settings and then it's under languages and inputs and the  virtual keyboard.  You should have several choices.  But on an Android, I mean, I picked Google device G board should be the first one.  But you can add keyboards if you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which is what I think I do have it then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the default on pixels.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Can I let's see.  Can I for it?  Oh, go back to me.  No, no.  I'm going to see if I can force the update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe that's all you need is an update.  Meanwhile, the change log continues with a improvement in capture.  Let me see if I can pull this up.  This comes from the Google Webmaster blog captures of those really annoying things.  Oh, that buses in the pictures.  Yeah, I really hate this one.  So this is Google's version of it called recapture.  They bought the recapture tool Carnegie Mellon first created.  And initially, recapture was used to in effect get people to do text recognition on books  that were poorly scanned or couldn't quite be recognized.  So you'd get two words.  Remember this in the early days?  You'd get two words.  One that was identifying you is not a robot, but the other was helping them with book scans.  Then it turned into street signs.  Remember that it was street numbers.  Same thing.  You were helping Street View figure out where it was on street numbers they couldn't easily read.  So there was recapture one, then recapture two, recapture three.  We are fundamentally changing how sites can test for human versus bot activities by returning a score  to tell you how suspicious an interaction is and then eliminating the need to interrupt users with challenges at all.  This would be nice.  Recapture version three runs adaptive risk analysis in the background to alert you of suspicious traffic  while letting human users enjoy a frictionless experience in your site.  We're introducing a new concept called action, a tag you can use to define the key steps of your user journey  and enable recapture to run its risk analysis on those steps.  So users won't get a pop up.  But if they're doing things like clicking too fast or acting in an unhuman like way,  it might be more suspicious than you might.  You'll get a score and you might as the site decide to pop up something more difficult.  So I'm completely not clear exactly what it's doing, but we've already seen with Google.  Sometimes you'll get a checkbox that says just merely I'm not a robot  and it doesn't give you anything else.  Remember that?  Right.  Lately, they're doing this terrible ones where you get eight, nine images and you have to pick the street signs out.  Oh, awful.  Horrible.  This one is apparently better because you won't get interfered with as all as a user,  as long as you're acting like a user.  Remember, Google knows so much about you.  They know whether really that the owner of the phone is a human or not, you know, that the interaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They know if you are human, they know you're just a bot.  They know if you're going to buy something and maybe you are hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ooh, took it weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You went weird with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's appropriate for Google, I guess.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, hot or not.  Supreme Court is hearing right now, today, an Internet privacy case involving Google.  It's an eight point five million dollar settlement that's been challenged by an official at a Washington based conservative think tank.  And apparently, the well, I'll give you the case first.  A California resident, Paloma Gauss or Gauss, filed a proposed class action lawsuit in 2010 claiming Google search protocols violated federal privacy law by disclosing users search terms to other websites.  As you know, when you do a search, the referral from Google will include how you got to that site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I've used that was incredibly useful for apps and other sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And now we can't believe Google, a lower court upheld the settlement.  The company agreed to pay in 2013 to resolve the claims.  The settlements known as see prey awards are unfair, says critics and encourage frivolous lawsuits, conflicts of interest and collusion between both sides to minimize damages for defendants while maximizing fees for plaintiffs lawyers.  Google did agree in the settlement to disclose on its website how users search terms are shared, but did not change its behavior.  The three main plaintiffs got five thousand dollars each.  The attorneys, two point one million dollars.  Under the settlement, the rest of the eight million dollars would go to organizations or products projects that promote Internet privacy.  Stanford, double AARP, but nothing to the other millions of Google users who the plaintiffs were to have represented in the class action.  See, Prey Awards apparently are rare.  They give money that can't. And you know what? I think this is probably a good thing because how many times have you gotten a postcard?  I got a postcard from a pop chips class action lawsuit that entitled me to a free bag of pop chips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would have taken it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or sometimes it's like for a buck fifty, right? Because they spread the class out over so many people.  So see, Prey Awards give money that can't feasibly be distributed to participants to unrelated entities as long as it's in the plaintiffs interests.  So the judges are hearing arguments about whether this see, Prey Award is legit.  And apparently some of the liberal justices.  Remember, the court is now split five to four conservative liberal emphasize such settlements can funnel money to good uses.  In other words, that it makes sense.  Justice Alito, one of the conservatives raised concern the money would go to groups some plaintiffs might not like.  So how could that be a sense of the system?  Justice Roberts, another conservative said that AARP engages a political activity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that was actually when I saw the AARP on there, I was like, they don't fight for privacy.  They fight for like, I actually thought that was kind of a questionable use of sending this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Robert's also said it was fishy that settlement money could be directed to institutions to which Google already was a donor,  including the alma mater of the lawyer involved in the case.  Brett Kavanaugh noting that one.  Ruth Bader Ginsburg said at least at least plaintiffs get an indirect benefit from the settlement.  Seems like the system is working, said Justice Sotomayor.  So you can see how the fault lines of the of the court are falling out here.  Although, you know, it's really hard in arguments to know how the court's going to go or even what the justices think.  Often I've listened to enough.  By the way, these are all recorded and available online going way, way back.  And Supreme Court decisions.  Yeah. Not decisions, hearings.  The arguments.  Oye, oye, oye, I think is the site.  Let me see if I can find it.  Oye.org. O-Y-E-Z.org.  A multimedia archive of Supreme Court cases.  You can listen to Brown versus Board of Education if you want.  Apple versus Pepper.  Yeah. Isn't that cool?  Let's go back in time.  Let's see how far back this goes.  Oh, yeah. Eighteen fifty.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do they have recording mediums?  Maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe some of these don't have media, but you can see a lot.  This is I love Oye, by the way.  Great site.  So not all of them have media, but many of them do.  They do record these arguments.  So you can actually listen to them.  I really like Oye.  O-Y-E-Z.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like saying oye.  Oye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what they say at the beginning when you let all who have business with the Supreme Court of the United States of America.  Oye.  What does that mean?  It means come and see and be seen.  Something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really?  Oye is like ear in Latin languages, but I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  A traditional interjection said two or three times in succession.  Yeah, we know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In the court of law.  It means hear ye.  Oh, that's exactly right.  Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.  It's Anglo-Norman.  The plural imperative form of oye.  From the French oeir to hear.  Oh, because French used to be the language of government.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Guillaume Le Conqueriel came wandering over the channel and took care of those savages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You want to hear it?  You want to hear what it sounds like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oye.  The honor of all the Chief Justice and the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States.  Oye, oye, oye.  All persons having business before the honorable, the Supreme Court of the United States,  should manage to draw near and give their attention.  For the court is now sitting.  God save the United States and this honorable court.  It gives me chills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I second that.  Does that not give you chills?  It does.  I get chills when I hear that.  It does, and it's also oye.  Oye, oye, oye.  I love it.  So yeah, that's a great site, by the way.  And so I guess you probably could at some point.  The arguments were heard today, so they probably aren't up yet.  And that, with a little side bar, is your Google changelog.  Here's one that'll make Jeff see red.  You don't like it when I start a story like that, do you, Jeff?  A blockchain site, a crypto site called Breaker Magazine, noticed that they were getting,  and I've been getting, I get these every day, and I'm sure you do too, Stacey,  lots of solicitations to put stuff on your site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Even I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've got no audience left on the blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know, here's an example.  Hello, I'm representing a blockchain PR company from Moscow.  Would like information on the rate for advertising on your website.  Thanks, Nikolai K.  Except that this was not, this was written by a phony person, Nikolai Kostarev,  a journalist created by Breaker Mag, to see how many Bitcoin news sites would accept paid content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The Bitcoin content world is nefarious.  If the outlet replied, yeah, well, it's a test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not entrapment if it's not by the cops.  The outlet replied to that email, then they would send another one saying,  hey, thanks for the reply and information.  Many of my ICO, initial coin offering clients, want coverage written about them,  but some would like it not to be marked sponsored.  Is that possible?  Of the 22 outlets who replied, 12 of them, more than half, were willing to publish pages  or willing to publish paid content without disclosing it as such.  The prices quoted range from a low of $240 for that was crypto ninjas to a high of $4,500 for NewsBTC.  Now, I have to admit, this is from a competing site that created this Breaker Mag.  So, yeah, but it's not a surprise.  And it is the case that we all get these solicitations all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You were going to bait me with the story about the journalist telling Twitter to get rid of the RT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we could do that one too.  Twitter should kill the retreat, writes Taylor Lorenz in Atlantic.  The future derails, I'm sorry, the feature derails healthy conversation and preys on users' worst instincts.  I don't disagree with this.  In fact, I told you some time ago when I still was using Twitter that my trick to make Twitter more useful  was to turn off retweeted content.  You could do that in what you tweet to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You just follow jerks is the problem you had.  I follow smart people and I find the RT is extremely valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK.  They tend, though, to gin up more controversy, right?  Because thousands of retweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, there are certain retweets.  I mean, like, look, I retweet stuff often.  I'll see a cool study.  I see someone making a really good point.  And I'm like, oh, hey, look at this.  And I mean, people seem to like it, but I can see.  I mean, there are people who retweet crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So yeah, I figure I'll see the original.  I'll see the original without seeing the retweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't like I like it because I follow a really diverse group of people and they retweet stuff from their social circles.  So like, that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I recuse myself on this topic not having any knowledge thereof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think if you follow really awesomely smart people who are really passionate about particular subjects, you'll get some really cool stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I deactivated Leo Laporte, but I did have a links for Twitter account that I used to use to put all the links that as you see on this page that we were going to talk about.  And I took that and that wasn't following anything.  And I only follow news accounts like like journalists like you guys, but also mostly like news.  And that's actually been fairly useful.  And I preserved that account just in case somebody I hear that somebody dies and I want to find out if they really did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You want to up your game? Yeah.  Follow. And I don't know if there's a list of these.  Someone should totally create it.  Follow the PR accounts of universities, research offices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You get all kinds of cool stuff.  Yeah.  I mean, maybe you don't love that, but it's it's I love it.  Yeah. Just like, oh, look what people are doing.  They're making crazy stuff.  Yay.  Science.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's fun.  Lists are very useful.  If you can find good lists, that helps a lot.  It does get rid of if you follow like legitimate news sources, it gets rid of a lot of the spam and bot activity.  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I yawned.  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that was just a yawn.  Oh, that wasn't a no.  That was so ignorant.  I don't know how you live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I took I took some Sudafed and it was a bad mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Street a streetcar streetview car was swept away by a flood.  I want to see those images.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the UK.  This is from the independent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The video takes forever to get going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, a car used to map roads for Google Street View.  Oh, West Texas.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we had a bus go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The problem is the guy there goes, decided to go around the barrier because I guess, you know, I'm busy here.  I'm Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry.  I don't know time for barriers.  Waters will part for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm Moses of the modern age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is OK, guys.  We may mock this.  But as someone who's been in defensive driving several times in Texas.  Well, we just had a school bus actually try to go around the barriers as well.  Now, are you still boiling your water in Austin?  No, I was so mad that the Times did not cover that story.  I was like, we're a city of like a million people having to boil our water for a week.  And that was due to floods.  That was due to floods.  Unintended unthought of consequence of climate change, for my opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I probably shouldn't bring this up at the end of the show, which because we are coming to the end of the show.  But I'm just that kind of guy.  New York Times, a dark consensus about screens and begins to emerge in Silicon Valley.  Here's the pull quote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm convinced the devil lives in our phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, talk about moral panic.  That's exhibit a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exhibit a.  The devil lives in our phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it does.  It does talk about a lot of people in Silicon Valley.  Well, that was Athena Chavarria, who works as an executive assistant at Facebook and is now at Mark Zuckerberg's philanthropic arm, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, who said, I am convinced she doesn't talk like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The devil lives in our phones and is wreaking havoc on our children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She does not let her children have cell phones until high school.  Even now, bans phone use in the car and severely limits it at home.  And so this article talks to Chris Anderson, who is, of course, for a long former editor at Wired, geekdad.com is now as well known as being anti tech on the scale between candy and crack cocaine.  It's closer to crack cocaine.  Mr. Anderson said of screens, we thought we could control it.  And this is beyond our power control.  It's gone straight to the pleasure centers of the developing brain.  This is beyond our capacity as regular parents to understand.  I didn't know what we were doing to their brains until I started to observe the symptoms and consequences, he said.  This is a scar tissue talking.  We've made every mistake in the book, and I think we got it wrong with some of my kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mr. Anderson, that was my favorite part is where he's like, some of our kids are totally screwed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we have this is my this is a great quote.  We have glimpsed into the chasm of addiction.  And there were some lost years which we feel bad about.  His children attended private elementary school where he saw the administration introduce iPads and smart whiteboards only to quote descend into chaos and then pull back from it all.  Cook said he wouldn't let his nephew join social networks.  Bill Gates banned cell phones until his kids routines.  And of course, Steve Jobs famously wouldn't let his kids anywhere near iPads.  I think there's some merit in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you do have to.  I mean, we I sit in restaurants sometimes and I see families.  Oh, yeah.  But so I sit there and I say that and, you know, it's easy for me to judge.  I don't know the situation.  I will say that having a 12 year old, she wants to be on the computer all the time.  And we actually started monitoring what she's doing on there and measuring the time because I think that's really important.  And we just have a conversation with her because I noticed she stopped reading as much.  And, you know, I it is really easy, though.  I mean, I don't know if we've ever had something that will captivate your kid so much for such a long amount of time as parents in parenting, especially young children is freaking hard.  And, you know, I feel like we don't there's a lot of things to think about here.  There's the why is my why am I or my husband the only person with my three year old, for example, she's not three now.  But, you know, we don't have these group settings.  They're harder to get to with your kids where they could be entertained.  We also have this constant message of like, you must be doing something with your child to engage their brain.  Ah, you know, so there's a lot here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I still remember some you know, you read too many books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Back in the day. Oh, yeah. Get outside, get some fresh air.  You'll spoil your own. Oh, yeah.  What are you going to do?  Play video games for a living.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So I think it's hard to though that a lot of parents don't know how much screen time their child is actually having.  And like, I mean, I gave my daughter a laptop and she can take it wherever she wants.  But sometimes that's not the best strategy.  And that's why we actually started implementing.  That's why I started measuring things and starting to implement harder rules for this.  And she will go for it.  And she will go for it.  She will sit there for hours and hours if we don't stop it.  And, you know, is she going to turn into like some sort of I don't know this is Chris Anderson's bad child.  I feel like he's got some bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's got a bad kid. Oh, we lost one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was broken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm trying since you baited me, you got to give me a plug.  OK.  So we think I was in California a few weeks ago to do.  We announced today. Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Finally, yes, we were wondering what you were up to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes. So we announced a project disclosure funded by the Facebook journalism project by independent of Facebook.  And I received no money from the platforms myself.  And a disclosure to aggregate the signals of quality in news and make them available in more usable, we hope, form to platforms and add networks and agencies and such.  So I was out in California meeting with Twitter, Google, Search, Google News, YouTube, Mozilla, Microsoft and such.  And so we announced the project today.  And it's an incredible it's a white paper, which is another way to say really long blog post incredibly long as I try to go to the details of what it is and what we're doing machine.  No, it's it's at the town. I'd say it's on the run down.  It's the third, the last and other.  OK, so the town night, it's a project of town night.  This is so boring. We lost Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's going to feed some candy to the neighborhood show.  Yeah, because they just won't stay on their screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, so anyway, so it's a it's a project to try to drive more attention and dollars in the long run.  We hope to quality news and to help the platforms and advertisers understand what quality news is, because frankly, they're not very good at it.  And I think we need to help. I like it.  So I just wanted to announce that. Congratulations.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was my thing for your announcement there, Jeff. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thank you. I noted it bored you so much you had to leave the room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacey's got my dog was whining. Stacey's got candy to deliver.  I have things to do and and I've got my Pikachu costume to put on and it's going to take a while because it's inflatable.  So we're going to we're going to.  Awesome.  I should show you. But honestly, it takes a while.  We're going to go to our break and get our picks of the week so we can wrap things up.  Jeff Jarvis, town night foundation, the post aggregating signals of quality and news is at medium dot com.  And his blog is Buzz Machine dot com. Stacey Higginbotham, Stacey on IOT dot com.  And our picks of the week coming up at first.  I want to show you my belt, my slide belts from Brig Taylor.  High quality, comfortable ratchet belts that are easy to adjust.  Many of us, many of us don't like belts because they just don't do the job they're supposed to do.  Hold their pants up.  And I really had a battle with belts over the years, especially because most belts have a couple of holes and you just they don't.  They're not flexible enough.  That's when I found these slide belts.  This, by the way, this slide belt has a brass.  No, I don't think this is brass buckle.  Which one is this?  This one is a vegan belt, which looks just like leather, vegan leather belt with a beautiful, I think, gunmetal.  It looks like chrome more to me.  And you see how I've engraved it with twip.  Let me show you how the slide belt works.  So when you first get the slide belt, you can cut it to length if you want.  It makes it the buckles are very easily changed.  So you can easily change the material or the buckle on your belt du jour if you choose.  I'm going to lock the end in here.  And then this is the key is the ratcheting mechanism on the other side.  Patented, patented ratchet design with 32 adjustment options.  So you always have a belt that fits just right.  This is the sound you'll hear in the morning as I dress as I ratchet my belt in.  Just right.  And this is the sound you'll hear later in the day after a big meal.  I silently expand the belt with 32 settings.  There's always a perfect fit with my slide belt.  And they look great.  A wide selection of straps from full grain and top grain leathers to high quality canvas.  I'll show you one here.  This is a this is I call this my Cub Scout belt.  It's an antique brass buckle with kind of the blue canvas.  This is this is kind of a grown up Cub Scout belt, but it looks great.  And because you could change the buckles and belts very easily, it's kind of like an Apple watch.  You always have new looks to try out.  They can be worn casually around the house at the office.  They're great for date night.  They've got all kinds.  It's also a great travel belt because it's very easy to take off at security and put right back on.  And I have to show you this is my favorite buckle.  This is the slide belt survival belt.  All right. Get ready for this.  How about a bell call?  It looks like a normal everyday belt buckle, but contains an ultra sharp knife, beer opener.  Let me close the knife for hurt myself.  Flashlight.  And it's a right, really bright one, by the way.  And fire starter.  This is the belt you wear out in the wilderness.  I wouldn't recommend wearing it into court, however, it is.  But that's nice.  You just change the buckle and you can wear something else.  They have unisex survival belts like this, colorful belts for kids, skinny belts for women.  Coming soon slide belt watches with swappable watch bands again for ultimate customization.  And they offer a one year warranty, free exchanges and no hassle returns.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  He's got a bunch of them.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sad that now twit gets 20 percent off.  I'm like, oh, you could have saved lots of money.  And they have a big range.  I mean, I, you know, the leather belts are, you know, fairly pricey.  I don't remember how much I paid like 60 bucks, but then they have very inexpensive ones, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've all kinds.  Even my gosh.  Yeah, that is not pricey.  I pay hundreds of dollars.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is not pricey.  I pay hundreds of dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know.  Ladies belts can be very, very expensive for little tiny thin belts.  I know.  Much less leather.  Little beads.  Terrible.  Stacey, how about a pick of the week from you, my friend?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  My pick of the week.  Yes.  It's because it's seasonal and it also tells you something really good.  And you may have seen this because it was pretty big.  But the New York Times did an AI costume explainer by actually one of my favorite bloggers in  the whole wide world.  It's an opinion column by Janelle Shane.  She goes to AIweirdness.com and she runs like recipes.  She runs all kinds of things through neural networks just to see what weirdness they generate.  But this article did an excellent job like being funny, which she is a trademark her,  and also explaining how neural nets work, which is really hard.  Wow.  And it's remarkably depressing how quickly sexy starts running up in the, it helps you  pick your costume basically.  And it's sexy ends up there like the second or third iteration of the AI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's poorly trained AI, don't you think?  Well, or maybe AIs are horny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This talks about how you, because it's not necessarily poorly trained.  It's just how it's training itself.  So this explaining it.  Although I loved the New York Times diagram for sexy printer, which is a printer that is putting out a pixelated image.  I was like, that is my Halloween costume.  Sexy printer.  So if you haven't seen this yet, go read it.  You'll learn something.  You'll also be heartily amused.  And if you really want to get bonus points, visit her website because it's freaking awesome.  Wow.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very cool.  And I had it up here and now it's gone again.  Let me pull it up again.  I must have opened something on top of it.  It's Halloween.  Let your Janelle Shane, let your algorithm choose your Halloween costume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So scroll down and you'll see the process.  So at epoch one, it shows like it's just looking at words.  Oh, wow.  Like the letters used in the costumes, they fed it.  So epoch one has like if you keep scrolling down, those are the first iteration.  So that's what came out.  You're like, what?  But then go down to epoch three and you start seeing Captain Kirk in Doroth Vader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  With a K.  A rat.  Wow.  Jashmashk.  Epoch five.  Sexy the baby.  Khapper.  Frog.  Shadown.  Ficking.  Cisteria.  Regun.  It's getting worse.  Princess Leia.  Well, that's good.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Dulk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hucka your leg.  Hucka your on leg.  Dodge chick dancer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Robot B was one of my favorites too.  I'm like, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now I have to point out that the illustrations are human driven, not AI driven.  So Strawberry Clown by epoch nine, we're actually getting things.  Gummy Cow.  Ruth Bader Hat Guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Buttery Classic.  Little kid, Ruth Bader baby costumes and stuff.  Nice.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We love Ruth Bader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's Ruth Baby Ginsburg, Jeff.  Baby Ginsburg.  Vampire Chick Shark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sexy Beta Marks.  Kevin is a vampire chick shark today.  Centaur Magi.  Dragon Ninja.  This is getting pretty good by epoch 11.  What is an epoch?  Is it a bunch of training?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the next, it's each iteration where you tweak it and then you run it through again  to see what it comes up with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is related.  It's Google's Frightgeist at Frightgeist.withgoogle.com.  This is Halloween's most popular costumes.  Fortnite trending up.  Number one nationwide.  Video games make up 4% of all costume searches.  Spider-Man trending up.  Number two nationwide.  And you can see what regions.  Unicorn, dinosaur, witch, Harley Quinn.  That's last year's.  Superhero, pirate, rabbit, clown, wonder woman, monster, ninja doll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm surprised we don't see Trump on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I think it's just too scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we're living that reality.  It's done.  Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, so this is related to Stacey's.  But it's a kind of a contrast.  Stacey's is AI for what?  For stupidity?  For wasted time?  For yucks.  Now we have Google.  Google is starting a $25 million fund, AI for humanity.  Oh, nice.  A global competition.  And that solved big problems.  Included in the examples that Google gives on its own post is wildlife conservation,  employment in South Africa, a program matched 50,000 candidates with jobs, flood prediction,  wildfire prevention, infant health, solving problems.  I would imagine the the verge story says like racial bias and other biases in in AI.  So, yeah, I don't have to be scary.  It doesn't have to be trick or treat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It can just be a treat.  I will say to you, I actually think that story that I did was a great thing to show your journalism students because it's a fun way to engage people about.  Oh, yeah, I just really.  I was like, it wasn't just silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, no, it was purely a joke.  Yeah.  No, but that is that's a good point.  I was trying for a segue, you see.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I was trying for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was trying to tie into yours.  But but no, no.  Your standards are just too high.  Too sincere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  Yes, you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My pick of the week came from last month, but I actually did it last night.  Coach Tony on Medium from the Better Humans Medium section.  How to configure your iPhone to work for you, not against you.  Now, I'm not saying everything Coach Tony recommends in here is what you should do, but there's well, a lot of good things in here, including turning off almost all notifications.  Notifications are just a way to steal your brain.  Hide social media slot machines.  I did coach Tony one better by deleting them entirely.  Disable app review requests.  Done.  Turn on.  Do not disturb all around the clock.  See, Apple allows you to say only allow phone calls from favorites or contacts if you want.  If you want to be a little broader.  And you know, that's the best way to fight robo calling is just only only get rings when it's people you know.  Everybody else goes to voicemail.  And guess what?  Robo calls never leave voicemails.  He says, be strategic about your wallpaper.  Actually suggested black wallpaper, which I'm using, he says, because it makes your phone less interesting.  It's it's it works.  And of course, a lot of phones now have techniques, both Android and iOS to improve downtime, to limit screen time and so forth.  He's got some good app suggestions in here as well.  This is on the medium blog.  The title of it is and you can just Google how to configure your iPhone to work for you.  Not against you.  It's long with lots of details, and I don't think anybody's going to do everything he suggests.  But there's some there's some really good ideas in here.  If you're using an iPhone, even some podcasts you should subscribe to.  He doesn't mention ours.  Oops, that link is dead.  But frankly, I think subscribing to Twig is a very good use of your time, and I encourage you to do so.  If you want to hear Twig, you can come by, watch it live.  We do it every Wednesday, one thirty Pacific, four thirty Eastern, twenty thirty UTC.  Actually, it's going to be twenty one thirty UTC next starting next week as we go back to daylight standard time, not daylight Pacific standard time on Sunday.  So we move UTC doesn't.  But that means we'll be at twenty one hundred UTC, twenty one thirty UTC next Wednesday.  Go to twig.tv slash live to watch.  You can't watch us on YouTube live as of right now because yesterday YouTube dinged us for a copyright violation because we dared to come on an Apple's stream.  We've appealed and I'm sure it'll get reversed as that's fair use.  Right. You journalistic types.  We I would say so.  We always run the commentary.  And then we always run their thing, but we don't run it alone.  We run it in a in a box with our explanations of what it means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Our our exit mean that Apple complained or is an automated process.  It happened so fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It happened during the broadcast.  I suspect it was automated, although it did identify the offending content is from Apple.  So I don't know.  The appeal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe Apple preloaded something to to do that.  The appeal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've never done that before.  And we've done this for twelve years.  They the appeal will I think go to Apple.  You know, usually the copyright holder then is notified and they get to decide.  So if we're no longer on YouTube live, thank you, Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, does YouTube do a verification process for legitimate media entities?  Are you? Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And in most of the almost always when we get dinged, we appeal it and we say it's fair use.  And they say yes.  They say, OK, sorry about that.  YouTube Live is tough because you doesn't take more than one strike to to ban you from YouTube Live.  So how long is the appeal process?  I don't know. It's underway right now.  It could be a few days.  I'm just saying, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  We're going to the Supreme Court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here in the case of Twitter versus Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, but you still plenty of other places to watch us at Twitter TV slash live.  That's why I recommend that site because it has a list of all of audio and video, by the way.  You can watch either way.  You can download shows at Twitter TV slash Twig.  Best yet, subscribe in your favorite podcast app.  No one will ever prevent you from getting it there.  And you can watch and listen to every show every week.  The minute it's available.  Thank you so much.  And Stacy Higginbotham, good luck with Halloween.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you. I'm excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
