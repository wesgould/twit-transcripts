Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're up at an eight. I think you need a little bit of art on the wall behind you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh please. There's art over there. If there were art on the wall behind me, it'd be too much.  There's art up there. There's enough art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, but I don't care about your world. We care about the presentation of your world to art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He fancies himself.  Here, hold up. Hold up Mr. Roomerater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now you can see a little bit more of my art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There it is. Yeah, I see it. It's just sticking out of the shelf. It looks fine.  Don't listen to him.  We're fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It looks great.  Andrew Weissman's room? Oh my God, I want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this another one on, by the way, that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know if they did it or not, but oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you can see the art in the big view. See?  Yeah, we see it. We see it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's good. All right. Okay. That's better. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That there's a professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate  School of Journalism at the City University of New York. Mr. Jeff Jarvis, who has a,  he's just because he has a 10 out of 10. That's all. He's just, you know, so  So, and by the way, the winner of the scoop award.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Congratulations. Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was fun. They showed I somewhere I have that video. I should actually show it.  They showed a video of all of Jeff's friends saying how great he is.  The kind of things you usually only hear at your funeral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's nice to get that when you're still alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is nice. I was going to be in Hamburg last week. I was going to have good fish  and a little award and nice meetings. That was scheduled.  I got up for Zoom at 630 in the morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not laughing. I'm just like, no one should have to speak German at 630 in the morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's just too much to ask. Too much to ask. And there's Ant Pruitt, my friends.  Pruitt grew it. He's the host of Hands on Photography and Hands on Wellness.  And it's very nice to see you. Welcome.  You too.  We came in to do a fun little Google event this morning, all jazzed.  It was the lowest energy. Did you guys watch it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did a really cool event beforehand and I can tell you all about it if you want. But  I clicked over to this and I was the only thing I ever come to Google events for is  Mark Spates's outfits and he did not let me down. Thanks, Mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm glad you got something there. He was the guy with the red, was it the red  lapels on his high collar jacket? It was wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exceptionally well put together, maroon over the white button down with his,  and I've seen his jacket before a bunch, but the thick velvet, it's not velvet, it's a  thick tweed, gray blazer. But the overall combo was like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a super layered look.  Well, now can we see this? I want to see this now.  Oh yeah, let me play the video for you. They called it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was teaching class when all this was all...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you didn't get to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have called him the best dressed man in IoT and I think I am totally right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because he is put together.  You're not talking about Matt Lethal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, I'm not talking about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, they apparently found somebody who could talk really fast.  That was the most energy on the entire event. It was a very...  It was a weird event, don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It started out with just the name of it. Was it Launch Night?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Launch Night Inn at 11 in the morning. Here's Mark Spates' segment.  Well, the whole world is the Pacific time, you know, you people.  The Mark Spates' segment was with the oddly loopy Mark Ronson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the Beatles and Motown, they have a sound.  And it's such my childhood.  The 808 drum machine.  K-pop.  Analog and digital.  So many great songs.  Hey Google.  Personality.  Times a million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right.  Awesome.  That's already winning.  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just a little bit more of the sound of Mark Ronson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Jacket matches the Nest audio device.  Yeah.  It's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll tell you, even on the stream, the Nest audio device sounded really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It could be the center of your whole home audio system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The whole idea of this is it's a better speaker than the little Nest.  It's only 99 bucks.  So it's just somewhere in between really the little Nest Assistant and the big Google Home Max.  Right?  I like the Max a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but the Max hasn't been updated for like three years.  And I'm actually in the market for...  Because I have a large open floor plan.  I was either going to get an Echo Studio, but I was also waiting to see what this was going to have.  So I could do an Echo Studio or two of these, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, physics gets involved.  When a speaker of that size can only sound so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Especially the low end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But it's still good enough for just...  It probably is.  ... to fill in a room.  Unless you're an audiophile or whatever, you just want the audio to fill your  living room, fill your kitchen or whatever.  You're not trying to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, without distortion or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I get that.  We'll have to order one to hear one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know why that outfit was such a great combo, by the way?  Because it echoes the idea of a cravat kind of thing, but it's not.  That's what it is.  I think it's really like a...  It really was a good...  ... shaman on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I didn't pay that much attention to it, but especially the mix of the  burgundy or the dark red with the gray.  The burgundy and gray is nice.  Yeah, very pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How many layers does he have on?  Three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He probably is wearing an undershirt, is my guess.  So four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One less than Steve Bannon.  I am clearly doing this wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I mean, truly, he always...  I mean, I've met him before in person.  Just impeccable style.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You told him that in person?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  And I tweeted out...  I mean, I am like his biggest style fan.  I don't even care.  I've known him since he was at Logitech.  So I'm like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So one of the things these speakers do is multi-room sound.  Sonos took offense.  They actually on Monday sued Google for infringing five more of their wireless audio patents.  Their first suit was last January.  Wow.  The federal cases put on hold while the International Trade Commission receipt  reaches a decision on whether to block Google's allegedly infringing products  from the U.S. market.  The new case filed in the Western District of Texas.  Always a red flag if you ask me.  It's getting better.  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or rather, it's changing a little bit, but yeah, it still has a well-deserved reputation.  It was the Eastern District of Texas that was bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tyler.  And this is in the Western District.  According to The Verge, an emerging patent lawsuit hotspot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the Eastern District may have dialed it back a little.  Yeah, we're getting so...  We don't have any economy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Our opportunity.  Yeah.  There's nothing out here but sagebrush.  Apparently, Sonos says they actually infringe 100 of our patents.  So Google countersued.  So we'll see.  You know, it's one of those things.  But it is the case that Sonos' secret sauce was that multi-room sound.  So if Google's doing that now at $100 a speaker,  that might be a little bit of a threat to Sonos' business.  We'll get some and we'll hear them.  They're not yet available in the...  Let me see.  I'm checking the Google store.  I also got...  We also got a new Chromecast with the new...  Used to be Android TV.  Now it's Google TV once again.  I remember in the early days, Jeff, it was Google TV in the beginning?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I do.  I had a Logitech review of Google TV.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely loved it.  And then it became Android TV and now it's Google TV again.  So don't know what's going on with that.  All of this stuff, by the way, was...  Nothing was a surprise.  All of it we'd seen either in rumors, sneak releases from Google,  or most likely in the stores.  For instance, the Chromecast, which has been available in some Walmarts  and Best Buy's for five days.  Really?  Yes.  So it wasn't much of a shock.  The price is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Home Depot had them too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Home Depot, yeah.  I was a little confused because I'd heard you were getting six months  of free of Netflix.  We would have made it at a remarkable deal.  But in fact, you have to pay more for the...  Including the Netflix bundle.  That's $89.99.  It has a Netflix dedicated button, which probably explains the bundle.  It also has a YouTube dedicated button.  I gotta play you, though, the video from it.  Because they likened it to a bowl of the remote control.  It has remote control, which is a first for Chromecast.  That's how it has a button.  And the remote control has a button for Netflix and YouTube,  which you can make either YouTube or YouTube TV.  But the funny thing is they likened it to a bowl of candy,  which is not the first thing I'm looking for in a remote control,  especially since the kids might eat it.  The new YouTube TV's new interface, but basically the same functionality.  They did mention a lot about HBO Max.  We were missing so many technical details.  HBO Max currently won't work on my Android TV from NVIDIA, the Shield.  But maybe they've made a deal and maybe that's what they were trying to tell people.  They didn't really make that clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Did you know the Nest, the new Nest speaker thing, the Nest Audio,  it's got the same machine learning chip as the Nest Mini from last year.  It's got one tera ops of processing power.  Wow.  It's entirely new.  And so it allows you to access and command your things faster.  But they didn't talk about any of that, which,  which I guess is part of this point of all these virtual events.  It seems like they're talking more to the buyers as opposed to the tech press.  It was just an ad.  It was like a television ad.  We're going full Apple on these and it sucks as a reporter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even Apple says more than this.  Yeah, I just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How long did it last?  Apple is a little more proud.  It was 29 minutes and 59 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was exactly.  That's nothing.  30 minutes went very quickly.  It was just an ad, basically pre-recorded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which is what the last Apple was to.  Once you take the screaming roaring geeks out of it, it's an infomercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why I'm a little disappointed because the fun of.  Well, as a member of the tech press, I want there to be something for us.  Fine if you're going to do an ad, but then I need to have some content around this that  actually tells me like, hey, this is new.  This is exciting.  And all they're doing is just giving me a reviewer's guide, which I'm kind of like,  and they're not even that awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So you want something a little more hands on in these demos?  Because they could emulate that, right?  Or simulate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, better demonstration or just meteor.  Like I've got a I am doing a call on.  Let's see.  What day is it?  I don't know.  I'm doing a call Friday with Google to dig deep into the technology.  But like, that's what you want.  You know, you want that as part of these events because otherwise I'm just sitting  through a freaking ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's what it was.  It wasn't even a very energetic or enthusiastic ad.  It was kind of like, I don't know, maybe that was just me, but it felt a little  innervating to me.  It was like, oh, well, we got some stuff.  For instance, the phone, which is very look, the phone strategy, please ask them  about this.  It's very confusing because they basically announced a pixel 4a 5g version, which  pretty much seems like the pixel 5a.  It has the same camera as the pixel 5.  You know, the 3a was this.  It's very confusing.  I don't understand what this role is in this whole thing.  Will there be a 5a?  What would it be?  It's very similar in every respect to the pixel 5 with 5g, but it's just less expensive.  That is one good thing.  The pixel 5, there is no XL, but the pixel 5 is $699.  So they were able to get the price point down.  Two lenses, a wide angle and a regular lens.  I think there's some new features, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, can we talk about the best feature?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you talking about the wait for me on hold till somebody comes back?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would buy a new phone just for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I suspect you'll get that on your old phone because that sounds like a software feature.  It's all software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're pulling back from thousand dollar phones.  That's nice.  I'm actually okay with that.  I don't know about everybody else.  Me too.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The form factor has been stable for a while.  I think if you look, what we're going to see is it's not worth it to put out a full new design.  It's a lot of manpower and testing and things to do something like that.  When really, you could probably just cram some software updates and  slightly tweak the hardware in a way that's necessary, like adding a 5G radio.  So I kind of look at this as at least they're not putting a lot of effort in and rewrapping,  I'm going to say old technology, even though it's not really that old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It has the new Snapdragon, not the plus, but the 785 regular every day.  I think it says C or something.  The Qualcomm 785 regular Snapdragon.  Regular every day standard version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is this still worth $700 though?  I don't know.  Maybe it's just me.  I don't think phones these days should be over $600 tops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are plenty of good choices even at $400 and $500.  So maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's the difference?  It was what you were going to, Leo.  So the difference between the $400 and the $500.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me pull up their comparison chart.  You need the comparison chart to figure out what you're getting.  So the 5 is $699, the 4A 5G is $499, the 4A is $349.  The biggest of the three, by the way, weirdly is the 4A, which is 6.2 inches.  The 5 is 6 inches and then a little smaller the 4.  I'm sorry, the 4A 5G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Those three images are the exact same size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know they look like it.  Yeah.  They have gotten rid of the chin and the bezels at the top and the bottom.  It's pretty, they go edge, almost edge to edge.  So the displays are both $1080.  I think you're getting 90 Hz only on the 5, up to 90 Hz.  HDR support is available on the 5 and 4A 5G.  But not on the 4A.  Battery life is going to be longest, I think, on the 5 because they put a pretty big  4080 mAh battery in that 5.  8 gigs of RAM in the 5, the 4A and 4A 5G have 6 gigs of RAM.  All three have 128 gigs of storage.  The 765G with octo-core is in both.  Now this is where it gets confusing.  Why would you buy the 5?  Yeah, well, good question.  It's in both the 5 and the 4A 5G.  No, they're both 5G.  Yeah, they're both 5G.  And who wants 5G, really?  Cameras are identical in the 4A 5G and the 5.  A little bit less of a camera in the 4A.  Now it really feels like the 4A 5G should have been the 5A,  but I think maybe they wanted to reserve that for later this year.  Oh, there's no audio jack.  Oh, no audio jack.  There is an audio jack on the 4A and 4A 5G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is literally it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which I would consider a premium feature that there's an audio jack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but in fact, the premium is they took the audio jack off  and they made the screen a little smaller.  This is really confusing.  I just don't get what Google's up to.  I really don't.  I feel like we were even asking on Twitter on Sunday,  should Google even bother making phones anymore?  They can't sell them.  Well, the sales figures are very low.  It's apparent in the way they announced all this  that it's just their heart's not in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, they're shrugging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But see, doesn't this type of development take a couple years?  Is it safe to assume they've stopped development?  Because this phone was probably in the works two years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is just inertia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The train hasn't completely come to a halt yet.  One more thing.  And again, I'm asking, maybe it was just me and I'm projecting on this,  but it really felt like they weren't enthusiastic about it at all.  Even the late night, the night in thing was like,  yeah, put on some socks, get some popcorn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe it feels wrong to be excited about things  that are as silly as gadgets in the midst of what is arguably a trying time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, that's an interesting...  Maybe it's a corporate decision to be sensitive.  They're reading the room.  Maybe they're reading the room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe that's it.  Oh, that's interesting.  That is interesting, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I give them a point for that.  I still don't want to pay 700 though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They didn't read the room well enough.  So maybe you will when I tell you that Hold With Me apparently is not available  on any other phone.  It says specifically, I don't think there's any reason for this except sales,  specifically only on the Pixel 5 and 4a 5G and only in the US.  I would buy that.  Just for that feature.  So we've all done that.  When did I buy my last phone?  You call Comcast and they say,  your call is important to us.  An operator will be with you in 27 minutes and they start playing Kenny G.  And then you just sit there as if the company has suddenly put you in suspended animation  and you can't do anything because if you miss it,  then you've got to start it all over again.  So this way, apparently...  Now, I'm not sure I would trust it,  you let the Google Assistant wait on hold for you.  And then when somebody comes on,  it'll say, hey, hey, they're on.  And after your call, you can share your audio and transcript to help improve Hold For Me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, man, I bought my 3a last August.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're not still a year away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can actually turn this on when you're on a call.  Oh, but important, Hold For Me may not detect when the representative returns to the call in every situation.  You can't do anything with your phone, like play music or other audio when Hold For Me is active.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think I'll hold off on this for a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think they were trying hard to find one.  Yeah.  Anybody got an idea?  The intern has an idea here.  Old people hate hold.  We don't think about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I hate being on hold.  Isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really, I feel, yeah, that feels like somebody had a bad experience with hold.  Right.  And it was like, I totally could do something about that, which I would totally do if I had the K.  I'd be like, oh, screw you, Comcast.  I am totally engineering my way around this problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here, this is actually good.  They even have the video.  Your call be answered in the order it's received.  And it says, oh, somebody's talking to you.  I presume the assistant comes on and says, hello.  This is Leo's phone.  I'll get him.  He'll be right there.  He'll be right with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I like the idea.  But let's think about the customer service rep on the other end of that call.  Say, they're waiting for the likes of Comcast.  That's been getting their butts chewed on for the last hour because their service is so bad.  They get the opportunity to hang up and clear out that queue by one more call.  Oh, on the other hand, if customers are just 10% less angry when you get them on the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's true.  Just 10%.  It could be nice.  Yeah, I give you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had to try really hard not to take out any of my frustration.  I always take a deep breath before doing anything with a customer service person  because it isn't their fault.  That's true.  So I encourage everyone, even if it is frustrating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Based on what we just saw, would you pay $200 more for the Pixel 5?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That would be no, sir.  I feel like not.  There's nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  $499, that's a price you like, right?  Yeah.  Is that okay, Ant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  $499 is reasonable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Honestly, the 4A 5G has features over and above just the 5G.  It really is the 5A.  They really should just have called it the 5A.  Yeah.  That's it.  I don't get it because it's got more battery.  It's got a bigger screen.  It says, in fact, it's got the biggest screen Google offers now, 6.2 inches.  Bigger than the 5.  Very weird.  It feels like, hey, we got 100,000 of those screens left.  Why don't we make a phone?  I was just thinking about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Maybe they could only buy certain parts in bulk.  So they were like, ah, just jam it in there.  I don't want our warehouse to be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's not as bad as Canon with their R5, the way they marketed that piece of equipment to be a  cinema camera when it clearly is a cinema camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It stops working after 30 minutes, et cetera.  So I have to say, I loved the Pixel phones.  I loved the Nexus phones and I love the Pixel phones even more.  I think the original, the OG Pixel.  I loved the clean Android.  Yeah, they were great.  But what's happened is Samsung and others, you know,  OnePlus and Motorola are very clean Android now.  Even Samsung is barely modified.  I love the Pixel phones, but I don't know if I'm definitely not in the market for a new one.  I like them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, see, now you know where...  In a year, you're going to know how I feel now with no Pixelbook.  I held out the tiniest hope.  They'd say one more thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you see Kevin's story from like...  Last week?  Last week?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Kevin's an optimistic, civilized, decent person who tries to find the positive things in life.  And I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He basically said the Pixelbook goes fine.  Just get it, Jeff.  He might as well have put that, just get it, Jeff, in the article, to be honest.  I'm getting the go.  You're getting the go?  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's happening to mind right now is the battery gets down to about 40% and then suddenly  zoop zero.  Yeah, yeah, you need a new battery at least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  The new Chrome...  Okay, so they announced the new Chromecast.  We talked about that.  Doesn't work with Stadia.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is just Google all over.  It's like, oh, we couldn't get in touch with that team in time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we were wondering during the event because Stadia, if you got the Pro version at the  beginning, you'd get a Google Chromecast Ultra to play games on your TV with Stadia.  That's great.  But this new Chromecast is Google TV and Google TV, formerly Android TV, never worked with  Stadia.  So Jason and I were wondering, well, what does that mean?  Is this going to...  Well, now we know.  It's Dieter Bohm asked and he said, no, no, the new Chromecast will not support Stadia,  not at least at launch.  Sometime in the first half next year it will.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, that makes sense.  Just fix the code down the road, please, for the four people on Stadia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm thinking people increasingly are going to say, I don't trust Google to stick with  anything.  I just don't...  Now, I love the Nest stuff, by the way.  I might well get those little Nest because I love my big Google Home Hub Max and I love  my Google Nest Hub Max.  Can they fix the freaking naming?  So what the...  The Max speaker I like, the Max display I like too, actually.  So I could just say I like the Max's.  Both Max's I like.  The Maxi.  Maxi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are we going to talk about Amazon's devices at any point in time?  I know this is this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm getting the Google announcement out of the way.  I think we've done it.  Sure.  We've actually spent more time talking about it than they did.  That's just us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That does not surprise me at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, wait, wait, you didn't do the new more helpful editor for Google Photos.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's right.  Where you could take pictures in the dark, which was exciting.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they have a new lighting in the Google phone, a new light.  You can move the lighting around.  I don't know if that's going to be in photos or not, but they said, and you can even do  this with a five-year-old picture.  So I suspect it's actually in photos that you could pick a lighting point.  That's a nice feature, right, Ant?  As long as it doesn't look like you're doing that.  Yeah, just do it tastefully.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Some people will...  Tastefully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, they'll have the light on one side and the shadows on the same side of the light.  And stuff like that.  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's a good point.  Pretty cool.  I've watched it now.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that on the...  Should I show that?  Is that on the page?  Apple has done a similar thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They have a little demo of the latest...  In the way Apple presented it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's pretty cool.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there you have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There you have it.  You sound so thrilled, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's been nice.  It's over now.  We've talked about everything with Google.  The show's over.  That's it.  It's done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you celebrate Google's 22nd birthday?  Maybe that's it.  They're just getting old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  22nd isn't old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is for Google.  They had a giant socially distanced...  They did a Zoom call...  Oh, I'm sorry.  Google Meet call for their birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Stacey is the official definer of old.  So 22 is not old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We should bring in my daughter for that.  We would all be old.  Yeah, you're old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oldish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  We can take a break and then come back.  I think we got...  I think we launched night in.  We got everything.  All...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, you just compare that...  If we go back like five years to these kinds of announcements...  It used to be so exciting.  It's...  There's a new fall TV season.  You can't wait for these sitcoms.  It's like that actually, isn't it?  You know what?  There's a new Buick this fall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember those days?  It's sarcastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  Let's watch.  This is...  I might as well do this because if you missed it,  they made a little video, 90 seconds total,  to get the meat of the show in here.  You want to watch just...  Just...  Yeah.  Yeah, a little 90 second interlude.  There was a kid playing drums.  There was lots of people in their houses.  There was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's so much wonderful content out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She was unaccountably looking off camera the whole time.  I hate that.  She was looking over my shoulder.  I don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I hate it when they do this.  She's looking at a cue card.  To someone else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they didn't...  Okay, so just a tip.  You can put the prompter on the camera.  Just a tip.  I'm just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, that's what they were doing.  No, no, that's what they're doing.  It's style.  They're trying for multiple...  So they're doing the...  I'm talking off to here, which is really kind of rude,  but that's the way they record this stuff.  But you know what's...  Yeah, okay.  So I know that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've never seen your profile before.  I know that thing, but this is the thing.  They did that.  Big nose.  Huge nose.  Even the straight-on shot was over your shoulder.  Well, that's...  She's looking over your shoulder.  So they did...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the...  As if she's talking to someone.  Yes, but who?  I know.  I hate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Silhouette belongs on a coin.  What?  What did you say?  No, it looks good.  I like it.  It's very distinguished.  Patricia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you do belong on a coin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want the Jeff Jarvis quarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right.  That's the thumbnail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff, when you die, I promise I will work  to memorialize your profile on a quarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What would I die?  Thank you very much.  I don't get a silver dollar.  I get a damn quarter.  Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to say, you should put him on a wood nickel.  Don't knock the quarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wood nickel, I can guarantee, actually.  I'm sure I could find someone who can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I want it to be scowling.  Let's see.  Perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, Jeff, you don't have to be angry.  He looks like our eighth president.  The little-known Jeff Jarvis, President Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which is my...  Wait, wait, wait.  Which is my better side?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That came one or two or two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You need more of a 50%, not a three quarters.  Or one.  One.  All right.  We'll go to two and show us the actual profile, not the...  Yeah, yeah.  Don't look straight ahead.  You're looking too far.  No, you're looking too far to the right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Lower more to the left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But closer to us.  Turn a little bit more to us.  Smidge more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff, you have quite the schnoz there.  One's better.  I do.  Let me see.  So the figures in the family...  Can you do a two-shot and see?  Who's got the bigger schnoz?  Oh, okay.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Jammer B is going to kill us all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We'll do it in post.  We'll do it in post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like, Leo, you have a...  Jeff, your nose doesn't slope down as much as Leo's does.  And Leo's, yours has more of a slope happening.  A slope?  What do you mean, slope?  There are words.  I don't actually...  I didn't even know what a strong jawline was until forever ago,  or a craggy facial features.  So I don't know how to describe it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh my gosh.  So my kids...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, your nose is bigger.  Your whole...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I win the schnoz award.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Leo's nose is bigger than mine?  I have a big nose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a big nose too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My kids deny having the Jarvis nose.  Okay, Jeff.  Which way do I turn?  This way or...  This other way.  Other way.  Other way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, okay.  Okay, yeah.  Stay looking there for a second.  Don't look at the camera.  I really still think Leo's is bigger.  What do you think, Ant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I'm going Mr. Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's so hard.  All right.  I'm going Mr. Jarvis.  And Jeff's hair is definitely bigger.  Much poofier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Much poofier.  It's the schnoz show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Meanwhile, back with Google.  Mr. Jarvis on the coin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, look.  The schnoz show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The schnoz show.  These are the three colors you can get.  Doesn't this look like some sort of medical device?  Like maybe, I don't know, a heating bag or something.  It's very ugly.  It's a lot larger.  It's pink.  I mean, it's still just the dongle.  It's just hanging off your TV.  And then they likened the remote control to a French macaron cookie, which was kind of...  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that is not like a macaron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, actually, they said a bowl of candy, but next to it was not candy, but a French  macaroon.  So I don't know what they're going for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't agree with third.  I don't like their whole design philosophy.  I'll be honest.  I don't like the las in shape of the speakers.  I don't like...  Oh, Selena Gomez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you just missed her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I watched the event, so I saw her.  You saw her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  There's your buddy and his gray and burgundy.  And then this guy played drums with some kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, the kid's famous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, the kid's famous?  Like on YouTube famous?  Yeah.  There's Mark trying to keep his head up.  Here's these phones.  We don't know why they exist.  And then there's hold for me, extreme battery saver, which kills background tasks.  And then some guy was playing in the park on his phone, Stadia.  Pixel 5 and Pixel 4H.  Cinematic pan is interesting.  Here's the portrait light and the night sight.  Mark Lavoie is gone.  So again, you feel like they're just running on inertia at this point.  Did you like the camera features particularly?  Or was there anything you saw?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Didn't really do much for me because it's just something that's going to roll out to  all of the phones anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I figure a lot of these features are just software.  They may hold off as they are with the hold feature, but I think ultimately anybody will get them.  All right, well, there you have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Who has the confetti?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought you were going to say the bigger schnoz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it was a split decision on the schnoz?  Yeah.  What does Karsten say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Karsten, I think gave me the bigger nose,  which I can't decide if that's good or bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We could make you stick a ruler next to your nose and decide.  I mean, empirically, we could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's the tease for next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I could count it in picas or points.  Oh, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have one of those in my desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't have a pica ruler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Problem is how do I get past that?  I guess I go this way.  I go through my face.  Never mind.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This, ladies and gentlemen, Gutenberg moment.  You have an assignment for next week.  A pica pole.  A pica pole?  Yes, a pole because you'd pull the type.  Because it's got a little hook.  It's a ruler with a little hook at the end.  It's got a hook and it's got inches and agate and six and 12 point and points.  Points are how type is measured.  I never.  12 points.  Everybody puts 12 points in their Microsoft Word.  We use those measures going way back, my children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's an agate?  I own one of these that I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, agate in most nomenclature was the it's not this is not the proper but we call the  tiniest type for like sports that was agate type because it was it was very small.  What's it mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The agate measurements.  What's it mean when you say I was busting my agates?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've never heard that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Boy, Leo, that that just went nowhere.  No one understood that joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I heard during these trying times some people are actually hiring right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I heard that too, Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, there's lots to think about these days as an employer.  Hiring can be challenging, can it not?  That's why you need ZipRecruiter, right?  ZipRecruiter, our sponsor of the hour.  Actually, we're big fans.  We use ZipRecruiter ourselves.  So did Monica Starks at her construction company, GES Group.  She had a hard time filling a key role because there were so many candidates out there.  She wasn't sure if she was getting the right person.  She actually switched to ZipRecruiter.  Her problem wasn't that she didn't have a lot of candidates.  It was figuring out which of those candidates is the right one to hire.  ZipRecruiter's technology makes it so easy.  They identify people with the right experience for your job and actively invite them to apply.  That's one of the great reasons we use ZipRecruiter.  And you should too.  You can try it free at ziprecruiter.com slash twig.  Monica found Lamont Jenkins.  She said ZipRecruiter sent her Lamont's profile  five minutes after she posted the job because he was such a great match for the role.  That's actually not at all unusual.  We had that experience too.  I've told the story.  Lisa posted at breakfast and by lunch we had three or four really good candidates.  She was worried.  She thought, I can't fill this job.  I'm going to have to do it myself.  ZipRecruiter is so effective that four out of five employers who post on ZipRecruiter  get a quality candidate within the first day.  Of course, we've mentioned before, one of the things ZipRecruiter does that's so awesome  is it posts your listing to over 100 of the best job sites on the web.  So you're immediately casting a wide net.  But they don't stop there.  They're that matching technology is so cool.  It scans thousands of resumes to find people with the right experience and then says,  hey, you should apply for this job.  They reformat the resume so it's easy to read them.  They even will star the best candidates and say you should look at this one.  It's like having a really good assistant working with you on this, doing all the hard stuff.  So you can do the important thing, which is hire the right person.  You got to see this for yourself.  Try ZipRecruiter free, absolutely free at ziprecruiter.com slash twig.  That's ziprecruiter.com slash twig.  ZipRecruiter really is the smartest way to hire.  Okay, Pixel 5 event in the books.  After 30 minutes, it was like, you're done?  Wow.  Okay.  We've been waiting.  Was it last week?  I think it was the week before that all the news was, oh, the DOJ is about to sue Google  for antitrust.  Nothing.  Crickets.  We keep seeing that story though.  It's going to be next week.  It's a few weeks out, just a couple of weeks.  In that weeks.  I wonder maybe if it's now going to be after the election.  I'm not sure what's going on.  Feels like there's a hold up here.  The DOJ money, you think it's money?  The DOJ is telling the state's attorneys general about it  because they would love to line up 20 or 30 of these guys, maybe 50, who knows,  to get involved.  So maybe that's what the holdup is.  Meanwhile, Google, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to say, or maybe the state's attorneys general are worried about suing  the Department of Justice for various election issues.  So they could just be busy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like we're just about a month from the election.  Probably a lot of stuff's on hold at this point.  I would think.  But anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Too many people are shoveling trying to unearth some things.  Or cover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, or cover them up or dig them out.  Google, as you know, and Jeff, we've been talking about this,  is upset about the Australian government's plan to make them pay for the news they put  in the snippets at Google News.  Is that official now they're going to do that?  It hasn't passed yet.  It hasn't passed yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that's why each tech company is threatening pretty harsh responses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like they could walk away.  Google's not hesitating to lobby.  In fact, they hired an Australian comedian, Greta Lee Jackson.  This is Google's Australian Twitter account, Google Down Under.  We asked comedian Greta Lee Jackson to help illustrate something serious.  Google isn't against a code of conduct that governs how we work with Aussie news publishers,  but the draft code is absurdly one-sided.  True that.  Let's watch the video to learn how that works.  Google explains arbitration under the news media bargaining code with comedian Greta Lee Jackson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Proposed laws can be confusing.  So I'll use an analogy to break it down.  Take a seat.  So this bus we're on picks up people at their homes  and drops them off at restaurants all across town.  Sure, people could have walked or driven themselves, but the bus is convenient.  Under a new law being drafted, the bus driver  would need to pay the restaurants for delivering those customers to their doorstep.  Sounds weird, huh?  But that's not all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a little different.  It's as if the bus was serving them a little bit of food from the restaurant  on the way to the restaurant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that is an oversimplifying temptation to make you happy and want to be at the restaurant,  which is good for the restaurant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The restaurant's point is, but maybe they're going to eat so much of the sample food on the bus  that when the bus arrives at the restaurant, they'll say, take me home.  I've got it.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All that happens is they spray the smell of bacon.  Well, that's where the dispute is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are we getting on the bus?  Well, let's continue on.  That's the smell of bacon.  This labored metaphor continues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Negotiate how much she should pay.  Nothing that she brings to the table is counted as part of the negotiations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stop there for a second, will you?  Not the thing.  Is this about the arbitration?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is, yeah, because what happens is, and I've talked to somebody at Google about this,  they are not, Google and Facebook are not allowed to argue that they have anything on their side  of the equation of value.  They're not allowed to say, but we send traffic.  Shut up.  You can't say that.  What?  The only thing that has value in the arbitration is the snippet, the content, the soul that they're stealing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the content, the bacon or the smell of bacon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They want the content is the parsley.  They want the bus to pay for the smell of bacon on the way.  And the bus driver can't argue.  Yeah, but the restaurant, I'm bringing the restaurant customers.  They can't argue that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'll give you a different one.  So if you go to a concierge at a hotel, something I never do, and say, what's a good restaurant?  They're going to send you to the most desperate worst restaurant that of course pays the concierge  to send you there.  Oh, that explains a lot.  So the bus driver says, this is a good restaurant.  I'll drop you off.  In the normal world, the restaurant pays a kickback to the bus driver.  Right.  Vice versa.  In this case, it's vice versa.  All right.  They're telling the bus driver, you got to pay for having brought us a customer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So let's watch this again.  Now that you understand what they're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not all.  Even when she agrees to pay and starts to negotiate how much she should pay,  nothing that she brings to the table is counted as part of the negotiations.  Not the fact that she's delivering customers to the restaurant,  not the cost of running the bus, nothing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Restaurant owners putting a bill on the windscreen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's more absurd?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She'll also be asked to cover some of the restaurant's costs too,  like half their electricity bill.  Is this a joke?  No, mate.  I may be a comedian, but this is no laughing matter.  Google isn't against a code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're just asking for a fair one.  Hashtag that fair code.  So, okay, maybe not the best analogy.  Yeah, but they try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but they try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because the real issue, I mean, all of that stuff is actually at issue.  I agree with Google on that.  But there's also this issue of does the food you're serving people on the bus  satisfy them to the degree that they don't end up at the restaurant?  And that's kind of, isn't that what the publishers are claiming is  that snippet satisfies so you're not driving traffic to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's true for some of the people.  I think probably some people will be satisfied with the smell as opposed to the bacon.  And some people won't.  And I think everyone's trying to grab everything they can.  So it makes sense.  And this is where, this is why we have these discussions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is where, so what we're hearing is the first step in any negotiation  where both side kind of intransigently says, well, here's our attitude.  And both cases are a little bit off.  Like what they're going to do is figure out something in the middle.  Is that what you're saying, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, they're not because Google cannot.  I think it's a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis.  Leo just asked me a question to clarify.  Oh, yes, you.  You were late.  Oh, I didn't hear that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  Boom.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will answer on her behalf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  So.  Apologize.  I'm going to get 20 angry emails.  I apologize.  That was unintentional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Aren't we at the point where both Google and the Australian publishers  are stating the most extreme version of the case?  Stacey Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a good question for Jeff.  You were just asking my thoughts to clarify my thoughts and Jeff just was like, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You.  You should answer this because you know.  I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  All right, Jeff.  Not good.  I mean, is there a is there a middle ground to this where like is this just  a preliminary negotiation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My answer, my first answer is no, but.  But reality was, let me first first say that different different analogy here.  Yes, I walked by a bakery.  I smell the wonderful bakery.  I rarely go in to buy that croissant, but I've smelled it.  It's just saying.  Yeah.  Should I pay for that?  Should the you should pay for the smell?  No.  Did the smell stop me from buying it?  No.  You're trying to prove a negative.  Right.  Oh, if I hadn't smelled it, I would have bought the croissant.  No, because I did smell it.  I buy the croissant.  Maybe sometimes I don't because I'm lactose.  No, lactose.  What are you?  Anyway, the publishers are almost the publishers are almost saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google should pay us for the advertisement.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Like I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I unplug myself of my excitement.  I didn't hear you.  It's OK.  Go ahead, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I was going to say in cases of justice in proving a negative is really difficult,  but sometimes it's worthwhile.  And so I would say that even if they are trying to prove a negative here,  that's not a reason not to try.  So I just you keep using that phrasing and I see the point in it.  And I see the point in the publisher side.  So I think it's worthwhile to try to prove that negative as part of these negotiations  because we are trying to establish rules for something that's really important to  both sides going forward.  So that's what we need is research.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  So we need data to prove that.  And I'm surprised that I've never really seen.  I did have some data back in the day with a company that I worked with  that was doing embeddable content.  And the funny thing about it is the data clearly showed them showed that plural.  Yes, that the bigger the snippet, the better the click through.  Oh, that's interesting.  Bigger the sample, the more your content was an ad and people would go through from an  embedded or a full embedded article and would click more often than from a snippet.  And then in turn, engage with more articles.  So we're doing this very speculatively.  It's like it's like the filter bubble argument where the research says there isn't such a  thing as a filter bubble, but we still argue as if there is now back to your question, Leo,  in terms of negotiation.  My first argument is no, Google can't pay for it because if somebody says the news people say  pay for my content, then everybody will say on the whole Internet, pay for my content if  you're looking to me.  And that kills the business model.  On the other hand, Google has already, I think, and I've said this out loud, I've written about  this and Facebook have both set a very dangerous precedent by in fact paying for news.  Facebook is doing it now in the US.  Google has said they will do it.  They've said in Australia, we're willing to do this.  But if you pull this law, we're pulling out.  You're not getting the penny.  You're not going to get anything.  So I'm pulling out in one definition or another.  So yes, you're right.  There is a negotiation going on.  And but I think it still sets a very dangerous precedent for Google, especially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought Google's explanation was pretty good, but missed a little bit of the  nuance of it.  It's hard.  And it's interesting because what they could have said and I think probably wisely avoided is,  and there's a risk if this law passes, we're just going to stop doing news and sending any  traffic to newspapers in Australia.  Which is what Facebook has said.  Yeah.  They decided not to go.  That's the nuclear option, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, Google has nuclear options, too.  We just don't know what one they might choose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I'm just saying they didn't even mention that they had them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not yet.  Not yet.  But I think private what I'm told is that privately things are hinted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm sure there's nudge nudge, wink wink.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You wouldn't really, would you?  Want to try us?  It's a shame that nice internet you have.  Too bad if something happens to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Too bad if everybody's using big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, sad news.  I didn't know and I probably had I known this would not have left Facebook.  The original Farmville is still on Facebook.  What?  Yes.  But not for much longer.  It's going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's all that fake hay that's rotting in the field.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Disappear at the end of the year because it's a flash game.  I had no idea that Farmville, which I spent many hours harvesting phony wheat.  I had no idea.  This was back in 2009 where it had more than 10 million daily active users  in fewer than two months is according to the verge.  30 million people at its peak played Farmville.  Zynga became, this was the creation of Zynga, right?  Record revenues.  They started racking up.  Zynga now owns the old tech TV building.  So they've dated.  Okay.  Do you play Farmville, Ant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, sir.  But I remember when that came out and that's when I started to notice the addiction of a phone.  Oh, it is.  Yes.  Yes.  Holding that phone in their hands and they're talking about planting this and doing that.  And I'm like, you know nothing about farming, but yet you cannot put this phone down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I played it so obsessively.  My wife at the time said, are you farming again?  And I said, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And she said, why don't you take up knitting?  At least at the end of it, you'd get a sweater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. You get something productive out of it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Stacey, did you ever play?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She has a sweater as a result.  Look what she's wearing.  I don't play like video games so much.  Not because I just, they don't interest me.  It's not because I have any highfalutin.  I'm better than other people.  It's just that they don't have my attention.  Like your daughter.  No, she's kind of wear the same way.  We'd rather read a book.  That's good.  Or knit a sweater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, it was nice to see words with friends catch on and people were addicted to that.  Oh, I played that.  You know, this vernacular vocabulary, you know, it's...  Well, and you're playing with a person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was fun.  You'd meet your friends and you'd play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That I could see.  I didn't have as much of a problem with that,  but the whole Farmville thing and just seeing how people were so addicted to it, it bugged me.  And I was, I was like, nope, that's not going to be me, but the phone away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Last game I played was on CD-ROM, literally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was it missed?  Missed.  Yes.  Was it?  It was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  Stacey Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what?  If you guys like gaming and you're of a certain age,  my, and I'll just, because we're talking about this, my friend does a newsletter called 40-Bit.  And it is game, it's a gaming newsletter written by someone who's about  designed to like evoke that nostalgia.  And it's just talking about gaming from a casual old person gamer's view.  I don't know.  I like it.  Wait a minute.  Oldish.  Sorry.  40 is oldish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oldish.  Oldish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think I'm actually too old to listen to that old gaming show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a newsletter.  It's not a, it's 40-Bit gaming.  So read 40-Bit.com is the place.  It's a newsletter about video games written specifically for people who are  older with many responsibilities and not much time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Older than what Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it ends with like class of 90 rules.  So that's a little older than I am, but you know, it's, it's just fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But he covers newer games, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he covers the news, but he covers it from the standpoint of like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  somebody who hasn't played anything since Jenga.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's the idea that you don't have time to like, because a lot of gaming publications  are super intense.  So this is like a, I'm interested, but I'm not that intense about it.  So it's like, Hey, how much does Stadia cost?  Is Stadia better than Luna is, you know, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I see.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, cool.  Well, and he does, he does quote Kevin Toffle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So Kevin actually occasionally will write for him just because yeah, it's a guy I used to work with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice.  I think I like the concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did play Mist.  And did you play Mist?  That also may be the last game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No idea what that is, sir.  No, Mist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's a shocker.  That was a classic game.  He might, I don't know.  Ant's funny.  I wasn't, I wasn't a gamer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  I played Nintendo and Sega and PlayStation and I played Oregon trail, but most of the time.  I was, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This wasn't about games though.  This was about kind of like, look what my computer could do.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was, it was a pretty like PC thing.  It was kind of puzzling.  You know what though?  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can play it in an Oculus Rift now.  You can go to the Rift world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't raise that.  It's going to set them off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is nothing like the original.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not because it was required, but because he, he was astonishing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's from the same company, Cyan, that did the original Mist.  They're still alive.  Yeah.  I think the original Mist wasn't a hyper card stack.  I feel like it might've been.  It was very limited by the technology available.  This is better.  And this will give you what it looked, what the problem is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's pre web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it was a puzzle game.  So this would, in a real game, look like you could, you know, press the buttons and do stuff.  And you could, but it wasn't animated.  It would just, you know, it would, there was a little bit.  It had some animation.  It was a little bit of animation and sound.  So it was, you know, for our age, but it was beautiful.  I mean, look how gorgeous it was.  It was pretty.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it was to play.  I mean, you get kind of hyped up about the puzzles, but overall it was not like, you know,  doom or something that you're like, your heart rate would get up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here you are on the Mist Island.  Yeah.  So Oculus Quest is going to have a 3D.  That will be kind of fun.  I'm starting to think I should have a Facebook account, not because of this,  although that's one reason.  But because basically now if you have any Facebook, you can get all Facebook.  They're taking Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, and they're merging it into one big,  not one app, but one account will serve you on all of those.  I thought they did that years ago.  Not with Oculus.  There was some, there was some,  there were some walls, I guess, I don't know about the personal information, I'm sure traveled  completely porously, but they wanted some autonomy for each of the groups.  But they've, you remember the, the Jan Kuhm and the creators of WhatsApp kind of left and  Yeah, they didn't care for it.  these people left.  And so all kind of the tables cleared so that Mark could unify it.  Fast Company article by Harry McCracken talks to Stan Chudnovsky, who came to Facebook  and is running this.  He talks about the Zuckerberg Manifesto we talked a lot about last year on,  you know, encrypted privacy focused social networking.  And that's, I guess what's going on.  Yesterday, Facebook introduced Account Center, which is a single hub where you can view  change in settings across all the Facebook platforms.  You can log into each service, you can automatically cross post.  I don't think they had that before.  On all of them.  So you could push out something on Messenger, WhatsApp, Facebook,  and Instagram all at the same time.  That gave Instagram messaging features, which it had lacked before.  Well, they had this little weird messaging, but now it's based on WhatsApp,  or I'm sorry, Facebook Messenger.  And if you're on Instagram, you'll be able to chat with friends on Messenger and vice versa.  You're right.  This is in the face of antitrust.  This is interesting choice of timing and privacy and privacy.  Well, but everybody's kind of known.  You have any one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But used to be that used to be, oh my God, they're going to do that.  We have to shut them down.  This is awful.  And now it's kind of people's.  And all right.  German word of the day.  Datenschutz.  Data protection.  It's the only word they have for privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.  They don't have a word privacy.  I wonder if some of this.  I've been wondering, you know, we're a month from an election.  We're three months.  If President Trump doesn't win, we're three months away from a transition of power.  I wonder if between now and January 20th,  we're going to see companies saying quick,  do this, do things as quick as you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So they're in there as a precedent.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For the new regime.  Not that the new if there's a new regime, the new regime couldn't,  you know, still say, hey, antitrust.  But right now, where it may be is perhaps a more favorable antitrust environment.  So what else are you going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Amazon, I would imagine would do things too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Amazon is.  Let's in fact.  Are they not already doing talk about what Amazon's doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're welcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well done.  A nice segue.  We've been waiting for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I have been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  Well, then I'm going to make you wait a little longer.  Let me do a commercial.  And then when we come back, the tea, I do like doing that.  When we come back, we will talk about all the things Amazon announced,  including a new gaming service to compete with Stadia, Google's gaming service called Luna.  But first of all, you know what?  You're not going to mind this ad because I know you know Stacey all about Twilio.  Twilio's.  Yeah, see, I knew I would get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just wrote about them today.  Aren't they awesome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They just actually did something new, didn't they?  And it's not in the ad copy, but they just announced something.  I'm trying to remember.  I saw the news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Their IoT platform.  That's what it was.  Microvisor.  You can go to my site and read all about it.  It's like ready.  Twilio Super Sim had a baby with electric imp.  And they created an IoT platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's really cool about Twilio is platform is the perfect word for Twilio.  It's a communications platform.  And if you're a developer, but you want to add all these great communications features  to your app, to your tools, the place to go is Twilio.  I even do it because I just love being able to engage with the global communications network  in my programs with just a few lines of code.  Twilio lets you engage customers on any channel, anywhere they are, from text messages to emails  to phone calls to video and more.  One single powerful platform.  And yes, now an IoT platform as well.  And let me tell you, they do this at scale.  Twilio powers 795 plus billion interactions across all channels with five nines of uptime.  That's 99.999% uptime.  Three billion phone numbers available across more than 100 countries.  Twilio lets you do anything you want.  Blue Apron powers their newsletter emails with Twilio SendGrid.  Netflix uses Twilio, you probably do too, for two-factor authentication.  We love Twilio's authy, but Netflix uses it on their side  to make it easy for you to really secure your account.  If you ever order a ride or groceries from Lyft or Uber  and you get a text message, it's on its way.  Guess who? Twilio.  Product and operations teams use Twilio to create new ways to communicate with their customers  inside their applications, ranging from account notifications with text messaging to chat bots  to securing online accounts with two-factor authentication.  Marketing teams love Twilio to get the word out.  Connecting with leads over text messaging and phone calls.  Send campaigns over email.  Build chat bots to answer questions.  Customer service teams build global contact and support centers with Twilio Flex,  a fully programmable contact center application platform.  Twilio gives you the tools to add communications to whatever you're doing.  It lets your developers control the global communications network with just a few lines of code.  You don't need to be some specialized telecom network engineer.  That's why Twilio is such an important innovation.  Because it used to be you really had to know how this stuff worked.  You had to be a super guru.  If your developers already know how to build web applications,  you've got the exactly skills you need to build apps that can text, call, chat,  video conferencing with a few lines of code from Twilio.  It's because Twilio is built by developers for developers.  Strengthen your customer relationships by uniting communications across your entire business.  Go to Twilio.com to learn more today.  Twilio.com to learn more today.  It's time to build with Twilio.  So the SuperSim module, which is Twilio's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's their connectivity module that you basically buy and they give you  access to whatever cell network you need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they bought an IoT platform provider, Electric Imp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That does security updates that basically gives you it.  They made a module that had Wi-Fi or cellular on it that was designed to automatically check for  security flaws and it would...  Perfect.  What's the word I'm looking for?  It would automatically update those and keep that consistent for you.  So your team doesn't have to do it.  And that was the key with Electric Imp.  So with this, their platform takes all of that and brings it down to microcontrollers,  which are the tiny embedded chips and things that like sensors and your washing machine, maybe.  So what they're doing is with this platform, when you buy a module from them,  you get the remote debugging, remote vulnerability checking, and the ability to program in whatever  language you want without having to, again, worry about what the cellular provider is doing.  So you get to do all of that and you get to do it for one price for 10 years,  which is really awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, so this is nice for consumers too.  This is not just an enterprise play because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's nice for people making consumer devices.  Yes, this is why your Mellow or your PetNet goes out.  Right.  Why you have to buy a Wink subscription now.  Because they don't make enough money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When they just sell the hardware, now you got to keep supporting it forever.  So this makes it much more doable for them to continue to provide firmware upgrades and  security support on these products without charging a subscription or even maybe a lower  subscription fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this still feels like an app, but it is actually a big deal.  Oh, no, that's huge.  It competes with Microsoft Azure Sphere, but Azure Sphere only works with  A-Class processors and other things.  So this is for my protocol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anything that makes IoT more secure, I'm all for.  And cheaper.  I did finally, I was talking about this the other day, upgrade my whole home  network. We put in ethernet everywhere, but I also put in Ubiquiti gear, Ubiquiti Dream Machine.  Pro Switch.  I mean, actually that's more the router and then a PoE switch and a bunch of...  I thought you had Arachnids.  Yeah.  Well.  Well, I got rid of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's a story behind it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I wanted...  A week for a week?  For a week, I had Arachnids.  I wanted all along, I wanted something like Ubiquiti or Ruckus, something I could control.  But the installer who's putting in the wiring also does home theater and all that kind.  He talked me into it.  He said, oh, no, no, no.  Look, it's the same hardware.  But here's the difference.  This has a capability that I can...  If you're having a problem with your network, I can log in and fix it.  Oh, he's got the hook in your mouth, huh?  And he said, and I'll never charge you for that.  I said, oh, well, that's good.  Because part of the main reason we're doing it, I was saying earlier, is Lisa now works at home.  She was complaining about stuff going out and stuff.  I'm at work.  I can't help.  So I thought, oh, nice.  Basically somebody else will be doing the IT.  So we put it in.  And by the way, this gear is not cheap.  It's much more, twice as much as Ubiquiti.  It's premium priced.  I'm sure there's a huge markup.  And it worked great.  It's not that it worked great, but then the installer disappeared.  And there's lights on in the bedroom from the access point.  I want to turn it off.  I can't.  I want to change the password, the default password on the gear.  I can't.  I go to the support site.  I leave a ticket.  Crickets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This gets better.  I email them.  They're never going to charge you because they're never going to do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like, I don't want, I mean, look, I appreciate you keeping, if you would do it,  being my IT guy, but if you disappear.  So I called him up and said, finally, I found his phone, his mobile phone.  He said, well, you should just call me on my mobile phone.  I said, but dude, you set up a support site.  You email all, you set up all this stuff.  And I have to call you on your cell phone.  What if you're not home?  What if you don't answer?  So I said, come get it.  This is not working for me.  So he took the Arachnids stuff out and I had to pay restocking fee, but at least  he was able to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There was one more thing with that.  Well, it cost me.  Hey, give it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had to pay to give it back.  But I understand that it's not brand new gear anymore.  It's, you know, so there's a restocking fee and I just put Ubiquiti and it's so much better.  And you know what, Stacey, doing the VLAN for your IOT stuff.  Trivial.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ubiquiti is everybody's favorite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, so simple.  So I'm very happy except that I can't get in right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  So you may not stay happy forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't want to sound like a malcontent, but I don't know.  You know what?  Here's the problem.  This is why I wanted him to do it.  I think I did some security thing that now I can't get into this.  I have to probably be on site to get into it because I'm logging in and it won't log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll have to figure that one out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I might have to reboot everything.  Is Lisa able to work now or is she?  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's all working.  I just can't get into it, which is good.  Probably that's security.  They have a, there's a lot of security in that Ubiquiti gear.  And the other thing that's very interesting and I never really knew before, constant scans.  They're a constant.  So I turned on, they have a AI threat protection tool,  which you could turn on and I'm getting scanned maybe 10, 15 times a day by,  from all over the world for tour, mostly for tour exits or tour nodes.  Apparently they're looking, there's probably some hack with a tour node or an exit node.  So I'm getting scanned for that.  A couple of times it got scanned for a NetBios port 139.  So there's, there's people there.  Most people, you just don't know because your gear is not recording it or not telling you,  and I, by the way, this, this gear is all a hundred percent stealth.  They went to shields up, Steve's site and it's not responding back.  So we're just getting scanned.  They're not being, the attack doesn't go on because they don't hear anything back.  But still the fact that they're scanning on these ports,  I'm sure they're scanning the whole internet on these ports all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I remember years and years and years ago when I was trying to  muck around with networking and things like that in the house and put FTP software on a computer  to see if I could transfer files and watching those logs on that FTP software.  Oh my gosh.  It's like, where is this coming from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.  You know, amazing.  All right, Stacey, you've been extraordinarily patient.  I gave you a little Twilio.  Keep you happy.  Just like, just like Chris Wallace said,  here's a question you're going to like, Mr. President.  Tell me if you don't have to answer it.  But you don't have to answer it, but here's what you're going to like.  You'll like this one.  It's okay.  Amazon's 2020 hardware event, which I didn't even know about.  I was kind of perturbed.  It's like, wait, they had a hardware event.  They didn't tell me.  Well, it wasn't streamed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It was.  And you would have known about it if you had, if I had been on the show the week before,  because I would have been like, guess what's tomorrow, y'all.  So it was very exciting.  Last Thursday.  Last Thursday, it was, I was actually surprised because Amazon had been releasing all of this  really interesting news ahead of the event.  I was like, oh, maybe they're just not going to do the September event where they like  release 120 pieces of news all in like an hour.  But no, that still happened.  So, so how was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How did you join the event?  Was it them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If it wasn't streamed, how was it an event?  Did the tree fall in the forest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was an invite for the media and this virtual private conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there was a stream, but we couldn't watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was on Amazon chime.  So, you know, how many times have you used Amazon chime?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that like their doorbell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's their teams slash zoom slash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh my God.  Okay.  Tell the truth.  Jeff install it just to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cause nobody knows there was a web version.  Actually for this one, you didn't have to.  Okay.  I lied.  I had an interview that was on chimes afterwards.  So maybe the whole event was on chimes.  Okay.  Scratch that whole thing.  I'm unsure, but they had a platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They did stream video.  Was it live or was it like the Google event today?  I just kind of can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was pre-recorded.  It was pre-recorded in the places that the event is normally hosted.  So David Lemp came to us from the spheres and talked to us.  And that's where they usually hold the event, which again is not streamed.  It is only for the press.  All the previous ones have not been streamed either to my knowledge.  And unless last year's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And how many, how many things did they announce?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't remember.  You know, I just, I gave up, but they did say  they had some really nice stats, which was that like, oh crap, hold on.  Let me just pull up the story.  Cause there's a lot of data here.  Cause they released a bunch of news, the biggest news items I thought.  And I did a story about this and it's worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not, it was really about the data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So they announced a bunch of products.  So some of the products they talked about ring had some interesting products, including  the always was it the always on cam?  I can never deal with their names.  Always home.  Always home cam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the, that's the one that got the most attention.  Cause it was a drone that flies around your house for the camera,  checking things out when you're not around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  So everyone was like, what the heck crazy.  It was crazy.  Is it $249, $249.99 ring doorbell on a drone.  And, but they also announced a ring camera for your car.  They announced a ring connect, which is an API that connects your car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Stay there.  Yep.  So it can report you.  What way your car externally, externally.  Okay.  So it's dash cam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was actually a dash cam.  Sorry.  Yes.  And they also actually have a way so you could say,  madam, a, I'm being pulled over and it would automatically start recording,  which people kind of glossed over, but I was like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had the owl cam for a long time and that was another feature.  You had to say, okay, presto.  Actually would take the recording from the last, it would start backwards.  Cause it was always recording, which, cause if you have an accident, you know,  you want to record the things leading up to the accident.  It didn't have the, the cop cam cause that would,  cause I don't think you could just say record everything from now until I tell you, stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. That's basically what that is, which I thought was an interesting,  one, it was an acknowledgement of ring has historically been working with police.  And this is like, Hey, we're working with you too.  They also announced encryption for ring cameras and the data that is pulling.  So the idea being that,  hallelujah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Can't believe they didn't have that.  They were just streaming in the clear.  I guess.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.  That's horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they couldn't have been streaming in the clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They, they, they basically, they probably, let me, I don't remember.  Cause nobody paid attention to that part.  And again, these are like in this event, it's one cent.  Oh, it's end to end encryption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they don't have access to it.  That's huge.  Cause they really got a lot of criticism because that video can be shared.  Because that video can be shared with the police, although not without your consent.  But I think there are people were kind of nervous about what happened to the video  that your ring doorbell took.  I actually took my ring out and replaced it with a hello door from Nest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And the biggest news for most normal people is that the echo now has a new form factor  and that form factor is a round ball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's an orb.  This actually, this is exactly  what Google with its, whatever they call their nest speaker is going against same price, 99 bucks.  It's a smaller fabric covered form factor offering supposedly better sound, three inch woofer,  dual tweeters, Dolby sound processing.  We're going to have to get both and just do a head to head.  I think.  Sure.  See which one sounds better.  Although really your decision shouldn't, should mostly be on which platform you're going with  echo or Google voice, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I do.  I do both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but we're weird.  Is it interesting that it supports Zigbee, BLE and wifi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  And it also adds a new radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So to me, this was the announcement that had the most interest, not the sensor that  you put on your mailbox so that you know, you've got mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They didn't actually announce sidewalk though, at this event, they announced sidewalk  that Monday beforehand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Did we talk?  You weren't here?  I wasn't here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You mentioned on Twitch Sunday a little bit.  Oh, we did talk about it.  I was still, and I was still a little bit confused about it.  Oh my gosh.  We didn't have Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You got something.  We got the person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Before we do that, Stacey, turn your head sideways.  I want to see your profile.  Oh, no, go ahead.  I won't make you do that.  I have a bump in my nose.  No, you have a petite nose though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well I've broken it at least, well I broke it once.  It healed broken because when I went to the ER, they were like, it's not broken.  Bastards.  I went up.  Later I was like, it is clearly broken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you know, it gives you, every beautiful person has some unusual feature that draws the eye,  so it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  You don't want to have regular features.  Right.  My facial features.  Let's talk about sidewalk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I hope when you got in that street fight that you gave it as good as you got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh no, I passed out and I fell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you didn't have to tell me that.  You could say you should have seen the other guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just, I had a health thing where I passed out a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I know, that's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of the downsides of passing out a lot is you make out with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sometimes you land on your nose.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So sidewalk.  I'm really excited about this.  And all of this, so what Amazon's basically said all the way back in 2019, they were like,  hey, we have all of these ring devices that we want to stick on the outside of the house,  but connectivity out there really sucks.  So we need to solve this problem.  So what they did is they invented a technology.  It's a wireless protocol called sidewalk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Low bandwidth, right?  Doesn't transmit a huge, it's not another Wi-Fi.  Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Save your questions or comments.  Hold it, buster.  Don't hit me.  All right, so sidewalk.  So what it is is it's this protocol that lets you send tiny amounts of bandwidth  and data back and forth, and then Wi-Fi is the backhaul to the internet itself.  So these are not directly connected to the internet.  They're connected to some sort of hub in your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ah, that's important.  So you have to have a sidewalk hub,  but most of these ring cameras would be, almost any ring device you'd have would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And what it's going to do is it's going to, so, and then it uses your Wi-Fi to get back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even these echoes, even these echoes are hubs, sidewalk ridges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's the idea.  At the time, they launched a dog collar because they were like,  hey, here's a dog collar that you can use to track this dog all around the neighborhood  because it's shared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but that presumes that your neighbors are also installing this, right?  Hold up, dude.  I'm just going to go have a cookie.  You take over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ease up, Johnny May.  Ease up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what happened last week is Amazon said, hey, that test we did with the dog collar  in like 700 ring cameras and stuff in LA, that was great.  We're going to announce that we're going to do this everywhere.  So the new Echo devices that you buy have a sidewalk radio in it.  The new Eero routers that you buy will have a sidewalk radio in it.  Several of the new ring devices will have a sidewalk radio in it.  And what they're going to be doing is the giant mesh network that transmits data.  Again, not a lot of data, just a little data.  And they're going to use people's wireless Wi-Fi networks as back calls.  So you have to agree to do this, right?  You have to say, yes, share my bandwidth because it is going to take just a little bit of your  bandwidth, but not much.  Jamie Siminoff was like, it's like borrowing a cup of sugar.  And the net result of this is there is a huge network for things out there now that people  can use.  So I can have my dog tracker.  Tile actually said that they were going to put tiles on this network.  And so this is a big deal because a lot of IoT devices don't need a lot of data, but  they also don't want to spend a lot of money for a cellular connection, which is a usual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Disconnected IoT.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  This gives you a low cost, highly available network.  And because Amazon's embedding it in their devices, they can create this network everywhere.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How many...  So I'm trying to figure out what neighborhood is going to be available in or not.  Because how many devices...  Does everybody in my neighborhood have to have some device that's a bridge?  And how does it get to the street?  My Wi-Fi doesn't get to the street.  That's the whole point.  So I would have to have not only an Eero or an Echo or something in my house, then I'd  have to put one of those sensors because it's mesh.  Right?  So if I put a sensor on my mailbox, for instance, now I've extended it out to the street and I  could conceivably be part of a mesh network.  But how nearby does the next one have to be?  What's the density required for this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Amazon hasn't talked a lot about this and I apologize because somebody is trying to  get into my iTunes account from Madrid.  So I'm kind of like, what's happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My name is Tethi Higginbotham.  Hold up.  You're cuter than my father.  No, you're going to die.  It's not me, I swear to God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I have a suspicion to it is.  It's not nefarious, I hope.  Okay, you asked a question that was a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All of this depends on a certain density of network so that it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is they're using sub gigahertz.  The theory is this is going to be 915 megahertz.  And this can go roughly about a mile.  So from a density perspective, most cities, as long as people have Amazon devices,  I mean, you're probably going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If there's somebody within a mile of me with another Amazon device, we have a network.  Yes.  My dog, you wouldn't be able to keep my dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They opt into sharing.  They have to say they want to participate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But my dog, you wouldn't have the granularity of location.  You know it's somewhere within that mile.  You'd have to.  I don't know.  Well, it's a triangulate.  Does it triangulate?  Oh, like triangulation.  How does it determine location?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm assuming.  Is it by strength?  Okay. I don't know if they're doing RSSI or they're just saying, hey, this Amazon's located at this  address. This particular node that it talked to is at, you know, 1415 Avenue A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you don't have to have the sidewalk mailbox or the side.  You don't have to have any sidewalk external devices.  You're participating if you turn it on in your Eero or your Echo or whatever.  And now you're part of the larger mesh.  This is interesting.  So we talked about this on Sunday.  I hypothesized that really this is because Amazon's a logistics company.  And the real benefit to them is in delivery trucks and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It could be for that.  I mean, it's like.  Oh, sorry.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, you go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I was just going to say it will help with asset tracking for anything.  But it also gives Amazon.  This is a problem that we have yet to solve with IoT.  So now there can be lots of low cost connected devices that report back occasionally.  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  See, that's my question.  This sounds pretty cool.  But what would give people the incentive to actually opt in when they think about the  larger scope of all of this?  This isn't just their.  That's going to be the trick, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The trick is going to be you've got to have a tile tracker or a mailbox sensor,  one of the other devices that uses this.  Then you'd opt in because you want to participate.  What's the lowest cost tracker?  That's the good question.  So can you imagine that Amazon puts one of these in every package?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's where I was heading.  Every box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so you know exactly where your package is, if it's arrived, if it's been stolen,  you know all of that information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this is still too expensive for that.  Oh, it is.  Unless you're doing something really like unless it's a higher value item.  Because it needs a transmitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It needs a battery transmitter.  You've got a battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You've got a microcontroller.  All of that.  This is not like a passive RFID tag.  That's like five.  So, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it is conceivable that you could have an RFID reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's where I was going to go with that.  I was like you could put an RFID reader on like your package box or so instead of taking  a picture of my package when you just dump it in the thing, it's like boop, arrived.  So that is an option.  What might be interesting, ideally if you're a thief stealing packages,  you probably aren't going to be running around with rig and camera devices in your car,  but maybe you do.  And if you pick it up, maybe it reads your package there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That would be awesome.  Amazon is going to have this in their trucks, Stacey, right?  Sure.  So what does Amazon learn by driving around with their trucks?  What you know, like the old Google got in trouble for sniffing your Wi-Fi for mapping purposes.  What can Amazon's trucks learn as they go by?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, they could learn who has Amazon devices in their homes,  like but Amazon already knows.  Yeah, because you usually I mean, when you log into an Amazon device,  you usually give it your address so it can tell you things about that address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Another thing Amazon is doing is they're putting in an AI chip in the AZ1 neural  engine edge processor and all of their devices now too.  What's that all about?  What's their goal with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, so we're off sidewalk, but I wanted to make one more sidewalk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, more sidewalk.  I'm coming back to the drone before you leave all this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, we're not done with the drone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Having Amazon, because this is basic infrastructure,  think like AWS has now become basic infrastructure.  What Amazon is doing is providing basic infrastructure for an IoT network.  You see Apple doing something similar with Apple tags, which I know they haven't announced,  but what I think, and I'm surprised, and I'll bring this back to Google,  that Google isn't doing something like this because Google's usually fairly  astute about infrastructure.  It kind of signals to me that Google's, I don't know if they're just not thinking this way,  but they're like, eh, IoT connectivity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They also don't have the range of IoT products that Amazon does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google's Google, they could figure out a way to, I mean, they've got Android phones out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Business.  Oh yeah, you could put it in phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I just wanted to try it back to Google for everyone who's like,  why are we still talking about Amazon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, this is a huge story.  I think sidewalk is really interesting.  By the way, I should have been paying more attention to it because they announced it last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I paid attention to it this whole time.  I know.  Stacey did.  Which means I should pay more attention.  Before they announced it, I said, because Jamie actually came to a conference,  a chip conference that I was at, and he talked about what they were going to do.  And then they announced it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think this is Jamie Siminoff's idea or he's just in charge of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Jamie saw the need.  This is not a need that we have all in the IoT space seen the need for this.  Jamie, I think with Amazon's scale, suddenly realized that he could make this real.  We've seen, and I'll give you a sneak peek because my IEEE column doesn't come out till  like November, but what's happened in 2020 is a big business model shift for low power,  wide area networks for the Internet of Things.  And so we've seen a bunch of companies come out with options that we haven't ever had before.  So I think we're actually going to get like always on trackers and the ability to track our dog and  the ability to track our kid and sensors that I could, if I am a, if I want to test my  neighborhood's air quality, I could just stick them in trees and make them work,  gather all this data.  So it's going to be really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So when low bandwidth, so how much data can you send or you just send it over a lengthier  period of time, I guess?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I am begging, I've been begging Amazon for three weeks now to give me something,  give me a person to interview on Sidewalk because I have had,  when they announced it back in 2019, because I'm such a nerd, I was like,  tell me more, all the limitations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You immediately saw what was going on with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because it is, it's a whole new network.  It's really exciting for me.  Sorry.  No, I'm very, no, no, no, no, no, you're not alone.  Tone it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, this is really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's the standards piece here, interoperability with anybody else, pros and cons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interoperability.  So Amazon is using their own proprietary thing.  They're probably going to tell you they're using it because it's more secure.  Their rival networks, Senate just raised $16 million.  Their rival network that's doing this in the utility space.  I've got the Helium router behind me.  They're doing a basic, they're doing both LoRaWAN and also just a proprietary,  low power, wide area network.  There's less satellite options, but those are super expensive.  So we're not going to count those here.  There's Sigfox.  The telcos have NBIOT.  So right now there's no standard.  Amazon is not promoting a standard.  So we're all hosed on that front, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thank you.  I knew you'd know.  Sorry.  I've got two things.  The Ring mailbox thing, which I actually like.  Do I have to have all kinds of Amazon hardware to make that work or can that operate just kind of independently?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Only your neighborhood has to really have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but you need this little sensor.  Something.  Oh yeah, you have to buy this sensor.  You put it on your mailbox.  On the mailbox.  I put that, I buy that in the mailbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I buy that.  Do I need any other?  Let's say the rest of my house is all Google.  Can I use the mailbox sensor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you would need one Amazon.  Well, even then, how would it report back to you?  You have to have an Amazon app and the A-word app on your phone and an Amazon piece of hardware  to get the notification.  Do you have to have an Echo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't think you have to have the hardware, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's your A-word attached to?  It's attached to the sidewalk, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your A-word is attached to your app.  So if you download the Madame A app on the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you say, I have a mailbox sensor, that's enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know the answer yet, Jeff, and I'm sorry for not having the answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Amazon, would you answer Stacey's call and give her somebody?  Come on, come on.  We all depend upon this.  Hurry up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are lots of other people.  Let me, Casina did the story about the thing, because this is actually the number one  thing that people ask us for on the IoT podcast.  And we haven't had a great solution except for like, build your own LoRaWAN network  and get a LoRaWAN sensor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You say LoRa, L-O-R-A, what does that stand for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Long range?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What does it mean?  I guess so, long range, yeah.  This is the 900 megahertz.  Yeah, I don't know what LoRaWan stands for.  Yeah, LoRaWAN.  Low power wide area networking protocol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so that's a networking protocol for these low, sorry, these long, sorry, LPWANs,  low power wide area networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to bet, I mean, maybe it doesn't require it, but I'm going to bet Amazon expects  you to have at least one Amazon device in the house.  Let me see.  That supports Sidewalk, Jeff.  I would think so.  We might do that, get one little Echo sphere or a, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yeah, let's talk about the new Echos and the smart chip that Amazon developed to build  into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, this artificial intelligence chip that's in them.  That's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so if you buy the 50, so if you buy the new Echo Dot, the cheapest one is $49.99  right now, or I think there's a discount and it's about to be Prime Day and blah, blah,  blah.  So if you have that plus the sensor, you should be good.  But inside all of the new Echo devices is a new Amazon machine learning chip.  What's it called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The AZ-1.  What is it?  I just had it in front of me and it's gone right out of my head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  AZ-1.  And this is a neural edge processor designed by Amazon.  This is interesting because there's a ton of companies trying to edge processors for  machine learning.  And Amazon was like, none of you are any good.  We're going to build our own.  And what this is going to do is allow faster processing, so faster response times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And on device, on device processing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And on device processing for the natural language processing.  So it's going to understand what you say locally and deliver responses if it can.  You know what I hope it'll do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'll let me create my own trigger word.  So I don't have to say the A word anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like we should be getting there.  Well, you can also just say computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you can say Amazon computer or A-L-E-X-A.  But I feel like if it has this chip in it, there's some hope  that it could recognize a different word.  Just a little more smart.  It's a little bit smarter.  Yeah.  What is an edge?  When it says neural edge processor, what does that mean?  Is it a lower power processor designed for edge devices?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So there's two things to know about machine learning models.  One is the training, which is super power intensive.  It happens on GPUs in the cloud.  The other is inference.  This can happen in the cloud or on the edge.  And the edge is basically any device that is not a server in the cloud.  And what you're seeing in that inference is when they run the model,  they take in the data that you're giving it.  So the new data and they run it against the model they trained on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it can't learn.  It can't build a new model.  It can only apply its inputs against an existing model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the edge stuff, though, is interesting because it used to be like you'd need,  if not a GPU, and Nvidia does make lovely GPUs for the edge.  Intel makes lovely CPUs for the edge.  But what you're seeing is a lot of companies  doing even lower powered stuff at the edge.  And this is important not for like the Echo devices as much,  but like a battery powered Echo device.  Or maybe something that has a battery in it or is even plugged in  and you just don't want to use as much power.  You can do things locally that allow it to run faster, like recognize a person.  Or maybe it's your video doorbell that doesn't have access to a lot of power.  It can actually do image recognition with an edge processor.  Does that make sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. By the way, another thing they announced that you might want, Jeff,  they have a car alarm that uses Sidewalk.  $60, it goes on the OBD-C port, which means it gets power from the car  and it has no monthly fee and it senses broken glass.  Why do you think I want this?  Because your car gets stolen all the time.  Oh, don't you park in New York City?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I thought you were in those mean streets of Jersey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When you park again on the mean streets,  I mean, I think that's really interesting.  That's a $60 car alarm.  It doesn't make sounds, but it uses Sidewalk to send you an alert.  Yeah, thank goodness.  It will also know if you're being towed.  Yeah, don't you hate that?  It will know if you're being towed, Jeff.  So it can say, hey, you're being towed right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, these are the kind of things you can start building when you have  a reliable network connection anywhere you go.  And they don't require subscription.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That is exciting. It's very exciting.  So also in a tile, what is the cost of the relevant hardware in a tile?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A tile goes for between $12 and $20.  So my hunch is the bill of materials on a tile is probably, I don't know,  what's divided by 10.  So $1.20 to $2?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  See, I wonder how cheap does it have to get?  Because that would be sufficient to do the Amazon box thing.  A tile.  $0.05, $0.01.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the goals that you're trying to get to in the RFID or the disposable space.  Well, any sort of packaging or disposable.  Now, there are companies, Jeff, that do returnable electronics that you stick into a package.  And then when you're done with it, you just drop it in the mail.  So there's, I can't think of a company, but I interviewed their CEO and it's a cool device.  But again, that's more for, that's not for your bottle of Windex that you bought from Amazon.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So by the way, I'm surprised we went so quickly over the home drone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We just got sidetracked by sidewalk.  Oh, is that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's interesting you say that.  So here's the drone.  It's got a base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What two words I'm going to bring up that I've heard about?  Moral panic!  Oh, here it comes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the drone.  Actually, I was so surprised because Lisa, my wife, won't let me have a camera in the house.  She says, well, I might walk around naked and I don't want that video on the internet.  So, but she immediately loved this.  What?  Yes, I know.  I said, we're not going to get that, right?  She said, oh, no, we should definitely get it.  250 bucks.  It is because the camera's not on when it's in the base.  Right.  It's controlled by you.  And it only leaves the base when you're not home and you say, hey, what's going on over there?  It'll fly your home.  It'll scare the cat.  When you, you know, terrify them because it's noisy.  When you, when you intentionally so, by the way, they're not trying to make it stealthy.  When you first get it, you have to map your house out.  You have to teach it where you want to go.  You actually, and this is maybe moral panic territory because you're basically saying,  here, Amazon, look at everything I've got.  Here's my home.  Have a look.  But you need to do that.  Yeah.  But this is, you actually have to show it everything.  It has, you know, obviously it has obstacle avoidance.  It's not going to fly into anything, but you want to say there's the kitchen.  There's the living room.  I want you to go here, here, here.  Take the tour.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So that's, that seems reasonable.  And it's, it only records when it's in flight.  It's loud.  So there's no sneaking up on you that actually has a deterrent effect too,  because it might scare bad guys away.  It would scare me away if all of a sudden I'm robbing the house and he goes,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  he's coming after me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It also helps Amazon develop more contextual intelligence about your home.  So Amazon knows that you have a,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, as in saying, oh, it looks like you need a new Breville.  That's a nice way to put it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm just saying like Amazon knows you have a kitchen, right?  Cause you've labeled a room kitchen and your Echo devices if you have them.  So it knows you have a kitchen.  It knows that you have maybe five lights in the kitchen.  It knows you have.  She spent that much money for a June oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, she's a mark.  We're going to sell her some stuff.  Sucker.  We found another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it is less about product marketing, although that's it's,  I thought they should do that with the cameras that they did have.  But it's also a way to give Amazon more data about context on what's in your smart home.  So you can control it in a way that's a little bit more intuitive.  So I think we're going to start seeing that.  So like, remember when I robot announced their kind of smarter version of the Roombas that  you're like, Oh, go under the table and clean up the crumbs.  And the robot would be like, I know where the table is.  I'm going to go.  Amazon's going to give that ability.  Well, it will have that ability.  I don't know if it'll give that ability to others, but it will certainly use it in their  own devices.  And that's really, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Tuesdays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot of this stuff is very futuristic and honestly kind of cool.  I mean, I mean, and also fitting a need.  It's not like some of the stuff like the, that Amazon band that they announced a couple  of months ago is like, we're just going to throw spaghetti on the wall and see what sticks.  But this all like the car alarm, the car alarm for 70 bucks or this Alexa guard, which is  actually a new kind of home security feature, which can call a helpline and get an ambulance  or the fire department.  All of these things are very aggressive in, in targeting established markets, you know,  but doing it in a way that only Amazon could do because of sidewalk, because of scale.  I could see why you might look at this and say, yeah, I think we're going to be an Amazon  home.  Do you think, Stacey, have you heard people be scared about this or

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  feel like it's a, so I did a poll actually on my, my Twitter followers who are obviously  self-selecting in, you know, that they follow me.  But I had, let's see, almost 500 people answer and I was like, Hey, will you buy the 250 for  the 249.99 ring camera?  And let's see, 87.9% said no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  12.1% said yes.  Oh, and there were 489 votes.  So this is obvious.  I mean, again, this is not statistically relevant, but people really did not want this  thing.  The use cases that people did want it for actually were really interesting.  Like a second home they wanted to be able to go through after a hurricane and see what  leaked.  For the normal person, I feel like it's kind of overkill just because I mean,  how often are people coming into your house to rob you and you're going to notice that  like that feels like a, such a manufactured thing.  It's very rare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  People who are very US rate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The only use case I can think of is back when Kylo Finn was a little bit younger and every  now and then I wanted to know what that little turd was doing in the house and I could just  fire it up.  And he's talking about his dog child, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I was like, you can't when people are, because you can't use it when people are home,  right?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you could, but it seems like a bad idea.  Yeah.  It's not a spy device and they were very careful to make it not be.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I just looked up because I was curious who's more trusted.  So Casey Newton in March of this year, I just put it in the bottom of the rundown under  other.  So Amazon 91%, Google 90%.  So they're both right up there as to who you can trust your house with, who you can trust  the stuff with, right?  YouTube 90, Netflix 89, Microsoft 89, Sonos 86, Apple 81.  That's so surprising.  Way down there.  Why don't you trust Apple more?  Instagram 72, Facebook 71, Twitter 61.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why do you trust Facebook so much?  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But the point is that Amazon and Google are right up there tie to top.  And so, yeah, I'm going to trust them with my phone.  I have Nest here or I'm going to trust them with my phone.  I have Madame A here, right?  And then all the things that can come out of that if they don't ruin that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wish we had more time today.  There's so much to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  And speaking of Google, just for a quick bit, they did a deal in Europe, so the Fitbit deal  can go ahead.  So they made more privacy concessions on that.  So that's what follows the same.  I don't know, Stacey.  You have to actually actually actual facts.  You want frigging facts, not just a headline.  I'm just a headline guy.  I'm just a Twitter guy.  I don't know.  I think it's on the window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am going to just defer this week on the changelog because really the biggest part  of the changelog we are.  You want to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You've been wanting to do that.  I know.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We spent the whole first half hour talking about new stuff from Google.  I think we did the changelog.  There's little things like for a while they were going to turn off the unlimited Google  Meet stuff.  They've said, no, no, no.  People are still using it.  So we'll keep that going until March.  But most of the changelog stuff is minor compared to what we just did.  They're reading the room.  Yeah.  I'm reading the room.  Thank you.  That's the new phrase.  Everybody's using it.  Be careful because robots are hanging from the ceiling.  I just want to mention that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's what I saw today.  It was so awesome.  Okay.  Toyota Research Institute showed off all the robotics research they were doing.  And the coolest takeaway from it, bar none, was the fact that in Japan they realized that  the robots could not navigate people small in somewhat cluttered homes.  Don't make them walk around.  They built a gantry in the ceiling and the robots hang from them like bats.  This robot is cleaning things like a bat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because robots don't know up from down.  They don't care.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I just wanted to share that because instead of the launch or the whatever launch night in,  I skipped the first 15 minutes because I was still listening to this presentation.  It was so much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They can even get these bat robots to load the dishwasher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, the whole thing was so amazing.  I feel like the work they're doing on unsupervised learning,  teaching the robots in virtual environments is really cool.  They have put massive pads.  And we've talked about with robots how they're trying to make it mimic humans.  So one, they're safer in case they go crazy and try to kill you.  But two, they put cameras in the pads so they can check how hard a robot is gripping.  Because otherwise a robot doesn't know how hard it's gripping something.  Crush the cup.  And so yeah, it's just so much fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Your first robot might be a Toyota.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  Thank you for bringing that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm always looking for stories that will make Stacey squeal with joy.  How about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Stacey, Stacey, I'm going to answer your last question.  Basically, Google says that they will not use Fitbit data anyway for advertising.  Let's get closer to a deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They said no, that's what they said the last time.  And that's a stupid reason.  That is a dumb reason because Google doesn't want to use it for advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They said their pledge was insufficient.  Okay, hold on.  I'm trying to read this quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacey's point is well taken though.  That's the least of the value of the data that they were getting from one of these devices.  There's a lot more they could do with it.  Especially if you had Sidewalk and you could know where everybody is at all times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe Google won't get Sidewalk and Apple is going to have their own thing.  And that's stupid because network infrastructure should be a public utility  or at least standardized so everyone can use the same thing.  Because otherwise we're locked into these ecosystems.  And that is how I really feel.  I do hope-  That is my version of Jeff's moral panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do hope you did not buy the iKettle from Smarter Technologies because  apparently Smarter's iKettle had a vulnerability it never fixed.  So as an experiment a researcher at Avast  reverse engineered one of the older coffee pots to see what he could do.  And he turned it into ransomware.  The coffee pot demands Bitcoin.  Watch out, Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh boy.  Before it gives you a cup of coffee,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you could trigger the coffee maker to turn on the burner, dispense water, spin the bean grinder,  and display a ransom message all while beeping repeatedly.  And the only way to stop it is to unplug the power cord.  Look, it's got a little devil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Basically IoT is not going to let you into your house until you pay up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Want your machine back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go to this address and give me Bitcoin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That chip has actually been...  So it's using a chip called the ESP8266 which has a known vulnerability that can't actually be updated.  Oh, it can't be fixed.  Well, there you go.  Yeah.  So any device with this particular, the ESP8266 and the 32.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So now it's spitting out hot water.  It's grinding beans and it's saying, give me money.  Thank you very much.  That's...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We talked about that on the show.  Did you?  Yeah.  It's a good story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love it.  It just shows you.  Boy, there's so many wonderful stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's...  The chat room was talking about the Wyze headphones.  Is that old news?  No, Wyze...  Oh no, they came out with a new change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wyze is going...  I got notified about that a day or so ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They are going crazy, man.  They are releasing new products.  I just went to the Wyze site.  I can't believe all the stuff they're selling now.  Headphones, video doorbell, thermostat.  We love these guys.  And I know Stacey especially because they're in the Pacific Northwest  and they're offering products at a ridiculously low price.  Most cases without subscription.  They've got scales.  They've got smart bands.  But we've always loved the cameras.  The $20 Wyze cam, the $30 Pan cam.  They've got bulbs.  Do you...  How much of this stuff do you have, Stacey?  Look at the lock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I have one of everything.  The only thing I don't love is the band.  I just thought the band was stupid.  You don't need that.  It's $25 is the advantage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of a fit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's good for $25 as mentioned on Hensall Wellness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, did you try it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sorry, sorry.  Did you review it?  It's good for $25.  Yeah, the price is right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you review the scale?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That will be this week, actually.  Oh, good.  Oh, hey, there's a pro tip for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For a smart scale.  On the scale?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you set it up with two users and they're in the same weight class,  which my husband and I are apparently within 10 pounds of each other  because we're the same size.  He set it up, which means anytime I step on the scale without my app to be like,  I'm uncertain about my weight, so I'm not going to record it.  It automatically thinks I'm him.  So when he stepped on the scale, all of my weight data went over to him.  And he was like, what is happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I've seen that similar behavior with that other scale that I reviewed.  I believe it was cardio.  Cardio based.  I came across that with the boys.  It sort of freaked out whenever the boys got on it because they suspected my weight.  And then it's like, wait a minute, dude, you just lost 100 pounds.  What just happened here?  Oh, no, this one knew that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this one did not freak out about me losing 100 pounds.  I'd forget about that, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mine definitely knows the difference between me and Lisa.  But then we're not in the same weight class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm trying to get my husband to eat more so I don't have to eat less, but it's not working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's a flyweight and you're a welterweight.  I don't know why it can't tell the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, yeah, good on wise.  Do not count them out of it.  But I have to say, this sidewalk thing is really intriguing.  That's why I asked about the standards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because if you can't sneak in on it, then you lose some real value.  You lose the network value.  It's the facts problem, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sidewalk thing, again, it's still a little bit over my head.  But you were talking about the packages and having tiles and packages and things like that.  But isn't Amazon pushing some sort of like a new wave delivery system,  whether it's the electric vehicles and talking about autonomous and also to make sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it does.  For whatever you think about Jeff Bezos, he's definitely strategic.  He is playing chess 10 moves ahead of anybody else.  All right, a long game.  Yeah.  Yep, he's good.  And actually, the only thing over your head, Ant, is those robots.  So I'd watch out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you're going to have to.  In those tiny Japanese houses, those robots are going to run right into you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I wish they'd clean up in here then.  Jeez, something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff, just a little note from me.  Carson, the new Taco Bell quarterly is out for fall 2020.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That was my pathetic error.  I put that in there.  I'm on it.  It's very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that a taco, a fine art rendering in the oil of a taco?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, that's the actually that's the scroll up.  That's the crunch wrap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The title of the painting is Adoration of the Crunchwrap.  Crunchwrap.  Oh, Lord.  It's really in this is fiction.  What is it?  It's everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's poetry, it's art, it's short stories, it's essays.  It really is.  They are so good at marketing.  No, no, this isn't them.  This is nothing new.  No, it's not them.  It's not them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is just his simple pleasure.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When the world wants you dead, Taco Bell can keep you alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's do a dramatic reading for a few stands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You learned the price of your life when you changed your name and gender  in Nebraska's cold wilderness.  Your fear was always Chick-fil-A's shadow and to a lesser extent,  Cracker Barrels.  There's proof in geography, you say.  How the closer you live to a Cracker Barrel, the more likely you are to die  trans or queer or any shape or form, but God's sanction sits in straight.  At least you say you'll always have Taco Bell, a Baja Blast,  a place to be as open and vegan as you need to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's vegan food at Taco Bell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I never realized Taco Bell was so progressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is why you see some, like a lot of vegetarian Indians love to go to Taco Bell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Your life dissolved like a cinnamon twist on your tongue and all you had left  was the sweetness and shadow of a life.  Taco Bell, refuge for the vegan stoner and trans woman,  even if tonight's meal is just rice and beans and lettuce on a limp tortilla.  Even if we're together here in my beat up Buick,  scarfing down seven layer burritos in the death throes of Nebraska's capital city,  debating whether or not marriage is a viable system.  This is bizarre, but I like it.  That's Lane Chasick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's wonderful.  It's America, damn it.  It's America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, she's got it going.  Clearly a talented poet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Cheese quesadillas and the thing about parenthood by Adam Shaw,  trying to decide that one year old that they had to have their one year old eat Taco Bell  and decide what would the appropriate dish be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Please don't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hands still raised by daughter squeezed her fist,  cheese squirming its way out from between her fingers.  The screams started back again, beginning at mild and making it where it passed hot  and back up to fire.  She slammed her hands against the high chair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, that's not right.  By the way, good news.  Here comes hard topo Chico.  Stacey, I know you'll enjoy this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We talked about this.  I am so pissed and coke.  That's it.  I'm done.  I'm done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Molson Coors is going to work with Coke to bring the alcoholic version of Topo Chico  hard.  It is sacrilege.  I might actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The benefit of Topo Chico was that it was wonderful to mix in drinks, not that you needed  to have.  You wanted that.  You could have bought White Claw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, gosh.  I have no interest in either of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, I was interested in this story.  We'll quickly and then we'll wrap things up.  Starlink was actually used in Washington state after wildfires to give disaster relief  workers online access.  SpaceX, Starlink.  I think this is the first rollout of Starlink.  This is the one with the satellites that they're launching.  They plan to be 10,000, I think 12,000 Starlink satellites in the next few years.  Right now, there are enough up several, I think almost more than 100.  I can't remember how many launches they've had to actually provide connection to the  town of Malden in Washington state.  It's being organized through the state's emergency management division, which is pretty  cool.  There's the little Starlink dish and it's attached and you have a phone there and Wi-Fi  and there's even a little charging station there.  Oh my God, it's such a 1980s phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  It's hanging on the wall of the fence.  They need a longer cord though, really.  To do it right.  Where are you going to go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's in the middle of nowhere.  You don't need a longer cord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's not whether you're going somewhere.  It's so you can wrap yourself around with a cord.  Oh, okay.  Talk.  It depends who you're talking to.  All right.  Okay, coming up next, I think.  Unless you guys see another story that you really want.  There's so many stories and there's so many things I wanted to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I got a quick question.  Have you heard of permadotcc before?  No, what is permadot?  Permadotcc.  So for academics making links to web stuff and link rot, you go into permadotcc and I  guess what it does is must copy the page as you had it.  It's a permalink.  Some kind of fight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do they tie into the internet archive?  I don't know that.  That's what I was asking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it free to use?  Somebody's paying for the server.  Wow, this is great because frequently I would always use a permalink if I could because  you know stuff frequently changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Writing a book, I've got footnotes with links in them and I went back to what would Google  do and some of this stuff's gone.  So they say libraries, faculty and journals, courts and everyone.  And I had not heard of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had not either.  It's from the Harvard Library Innovation Lab at the law school.  It's managed by a consortium of libraries.  Anyone can sign up by creating an account.  It's free for anyone associated with a registrar organization.  So the theory is you would then go through somebody else, maybe academic libraries and  courts could become registrars for free and then other organizations would charge  and then users would have access.  So you wouldn't probably go to permac.cc.  You would have a short link from say your local library.  Links will be preserved as part of a permanent collection of participating libraries.  We can't guarantee these links will be preserved forever.  We are hosted by university libraries that have endured for centuries.  We're planning to be around for the long term.  That's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I thought that was really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So in order to use this though, you'd have to find a group.  There's an individual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, you can create an individual account.  You can.  Yeah, if you go back to the bottom and it says for anybody.  No, go back.  Go back.  Go back to the homepage.  Homepage.  Homepage.  Okay.  No, right there.  No, sorry.  Go home page.  Homepage.  Now go to the bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sign up and use permac.cc.  No, go to the bottom.  You don't listen to me.  You don't listen to me.  I'm doing it.  I'm doing it.  All right.  We would be the funniest old couple, wouldn't we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My nose is big and the yard's nose is jammin'.  Which one of us is Felix?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll be Felix.  I think you're Felix.  You could be Oscar.  I'll be Oscar.  New users can create.  Does that know how?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Any idea what we're talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Noel Coward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Noel Coward.  How about Neil Simon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Neil Simon.  That's it.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  New users are able to create 10 free links on a trial basis  and then you have to get a paid subscription.  So it isn't free but that's okay.  Cool.  It shouldn't be free for that to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So anyway, I just want to mention that.  Any academics in the audience?  You should have made that a pick of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's awesome.  Did we mention?  Well, I don't do picks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I do numbers because Carson won't let me do picks.  Carson has no say in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would you like to do picks?  I'll do numbers.  You want me to do numbers?  I'll do numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know.  Why do we?  You're the only reason we do numbers.  In the very first show, I pointed to some numbers  and Leo said we should do a number a week at Biggo ever since then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Just fun.  Ever since then.  I've been stuck with the numbers.  All right.  Did we talk about number 92?  Row 92.  Row 92.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The wheel spins round and round and where it stops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Palm recognition for Amazon Go.  This is their new store.  Moral panic too.  So instead of...  So you wouldn't have to use your phone.  It would already know who you are from your palm.  Right.  You have to train it with your car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You train it.  Well, you go to the store and you train it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's nice because I don't have to carry my phone with me all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  But then Amazon has an irrevocable biometric device that is biometric attached to you.  There we go.  Moral panic.  That's like a step too far.  That's not moral panic.  That's just being smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't change your palm, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you can but it's going to be very painful.  You're not going to like it.  It's going to involve some dune level box action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, but you know what?  You know what?  That's why I brought it up.  You are the Kwisak Cheddarak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I knew it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  See if you all would freak out about it or if anybody even cared but I'm with Stacey.  No, you're right.  It just seems like it's stepping over the line just the bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was a time when at Disney World or Disneyland you could use your thumbprint for a pass.  Steve and I talked about that because that's giving Disney forever access to your thumbprint.  So use your knuckle, we said.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think we're going to be in a world where nobody wants to touch anything.  We're already there in restrooms, right?  I go into a restroom and I put my hands under the faucet and say,  why won't the water come out?  Because it still has a thing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't touch with an Amazon Go store.  All this is doing is saving you an extra 20 seconds of fumbling for your phone, opening the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wish Whole Foods would do this too because I always have to open my app and take the Whole  Foods app.  That's a pain.  That's a pain for my $0.53 discount.  Next, your picks of the week.  Poor Jeff has to do a number.  Poor Jeff.  All right, let's start with Stacey though.  Your pick of the week because I'm sure you have something.  I do.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, this is just data.  This isn't an actual thing, but it's CloudFlare.  Just launched today a service called Radar.  And all it is is data about how the internet is performing, how traffic is performing.  You can filter through by country.  You can see top domains in certain areas.  It's basically just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is good.  At this point, they know everything that's going on in the internet.  So much internet traffic goes through CloudFlare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Including ours, I might add.  DDoS attacks.  And there's some really good things like, hey, 75% of global traffic right now is HTTPS.  Yay.  Sadly, only 20% of our traffic is IPv6.  And I also thought that the amount of bot traffic was like, dang, ho dang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, I'm going to tie on to that because they also just announced  a competitor to Google Analytics that is privacy forward.  So CloudFlare now does analytics as well.  I presume it's the same ID, JavaScript, snippet on your website and so forth.  Privacy-friendly web analytics and it's free.  So it's just came out.  You have to get on a wait list.  But I think this is really interesting.  Almost everybody, we use Google Analytics and we get flagged  for having a tracker on our website because we use Google Analytics.  So I think this is great.  This is CloudFlare's new...  I bet you it goes hand in hand with Radar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I imagine it's pulling data in from those trackers, but I could be wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, you install a JavaScript beacon on your site, start collecting metrics.  So this is really good.  Actually, it also points out you don't have to do that if you're  putting your proxy on your website behind CloudFlare, which many, many people do.  So there you go.  Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right, this is a good one.  This is a good one.  So at Jack, just gave $10 million to the anti-racist center started by Ibram Kendi,  the author of the wonderful How to Be an Anti-Racist at Boston University.  Very smart to get Kendi and to start the center.  And then Jack was smart to say here is no strings attached, 10 million bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to give Jack a little credit because he's been pretty generous with his money.  Quietly.  Well, not that quietly.  He does treat you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, no, he endorses things.  He uses it to endorse, but he doesn't make all kinds of no brass band with a check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mr. Ant Pruitt, you have something I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yep, I do.  I just want to give another shout out to a friend of mine and a creator, Mr. Steve Brazel.  He has a show called Behind the Shot TV where he sits down with some of the great photographers  all over the world and walks through some of their iconic shots.  When last week he sat down with Mr. Joel Grimes, Canon Explorer of Light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love this shot, this cowboy shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, he shot that in Arizona.  What's it called?  At the actual where all the cowboys usually are, that movie set.  I can't think of the name of it now, but that's about  four or five different lights in there.  You could tell.  But we sort of could tell.  He shot a bunch of different shots and just composited all together to make that one  beautiful shot.  The thought process behind that was just amazing.  Even down to looking, if you look below the table,  look at how the shadows fall up under the table.  So smart.  Just thinking about that kind of stuff.  That's something I love about a lot of the photographers out there.  The show that Steve does is outstanding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's allowing me to pick their brains.  Rick Salmon's got a wildlife photography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The 49ers photographer was just on there.  And he did one with a gentleman named Jeff Harmon.  I think that was the one before the Joel Grimes episode.  Jeff Harmon is a hobbyist photographer, but he's freaking good at it.  He's so good at it.  But it was an astrophotography shot, I think is right there on the front page.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I see you're photographing the Milky Way.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And he did that with an APS-C camera.  No, it's gorgeous.  He's so good.  Yeah.  Really gorgeous.  Behind the shot.tv.  Check him out.  That's my man, Steve.  Very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  What a show.  What a jam packed full of adventures, excitement, nose comparisons, and more.  I can't wait to see the shnazzes.  Nor do shnazzes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Shnazz to shnazz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Drones, robots, shnazzes.  Everything.  Drones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's it.  That's the T's.  Drones, robots, shnazzes.  And a little bit of sidewalk.  That's Stacey Higginbotham.  Of course.  You can see how valuable she is to this show.

And thank you for being here.  We appreciate it.  Thanks, y'all.  Yeah.  Jeff, what were you saying?  Did you have something to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Shnazz is one Z, I think, Kirsten.  Not two.  Only one Z?  You know, for a short time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gosh, I thought shnazz had two.  Really?  All right.  Jeff is, after all, a professor of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have it right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Something or other.  Somewhere or other.  Something or other.  He is the director, after all, of the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism  at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  Scoop award winner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're going to do our own award soon.  Right?  Like the Pulitzer.  It's just going to be this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  You can make a coin, a big coin.  That would be like an Antoinette Perry award to Tony.  It's got a...  That's right.  It's a big coin.  Yeah.  I should play the video that they made for you at the Scoop Awards, actually.  Maybe I'll do that at the end, after all the acknowledgments, so people can see it.  I think it's okay for me to play that.  Yeah.  It was pretty cool.  I didn't know they gave it to you.  Yeah, they sent it along.  And they actually will...  You will see because you're in it.  I mean, they show your reaction to it and all of that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They do.  Oh, that's nice.  That's nice.  I didn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'll find that.  We'll play that at the end.  Thank you for doing that.  Yeah, it was really cool.  And I met...  I recorded it much longer.  We did about 40, 45 minutes.  I don't know how great you were.  They only used a few seconds, but it was...  Just take my word for it.  That's Ant Pruitt, host of hands-on photography and hands-on wellness.  That's great to see you, Ant.  Thanks for being here.  Thanks to all for being here.  We do this show every Wednesday, right after Jeff gets out of class.  That's around 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern, 2100 UTC.  Live streams available at twit.tv slash live.  A couple of notes.  For some reason, TuneIn has decided to ban all international podcasts from TuneIn UK.  UK only.  It was a court decision that they decided to honor extremely.  So we're not available on TuneIn UK.  So if you listen to the UK, use Spreaker.  There's other ways to listen to our audio.  That's at twit.tv slash live.  The other note is I know, and I've really been meaning to talk about this,  a lot of you watch on Roku or used to because we had a Roku app.  That app was not updated for some time.  The guy who wrote it for us, great, Houdini7, you might run into him in our chat room from time to time,  took a real job and couldn't write software for anybody else.  So it didn't get updated.  We knew that Roku was going to change their API.  It took them a while, but in the last couple of weeks, that app has now stopped working.  And so I'm hearing howls of pain.  I didn't realize so many of you watched on Roku.  I'm thrilled.  There are still other ways to watch YouTube, Twitch, both have Roku apps.  So there are other ways to watch, but I apologize.  It's kind of out of our hands.  They changed the API and the guy who wrote it's gone.  It's not gone.  He's just not working with us anymore.  If anybody wants to write a Roku app, let me know.  Let me know.  We'd like to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I used the YouTube app on my Roku.  I think it works fine.  Works just fine.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's one of the reasons we didn't run out and get a new one made because there's YouTube,  there's Twitch, there's Ustream.  There are lots of other ways you can watch on Roku.  I realize a lot of people liked Roku a lot.  Twitch's app is defunct too.  Well, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  There you go.  Wow.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The wheels are coming off the bus, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
