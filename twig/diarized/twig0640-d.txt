Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This show is an affront to the musical spirit.  The Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  Between our theme and that...  The theme is worse.  Is the theme worse?  Is it?  OK.  No.  The theme just makes me think of Monty Python.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You want a great TikTok account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anna Lapwood organ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe I should get Anna Lapwood and her organ to play our theme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, boy.  I don't think I should get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anna Lapwood organ.  I think it's one word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  OK, well, I just I'll search for three and see what I find.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, Leo, I will tell you, I found...  We were talking about coffee makers before the show.  Yes.  I found a Cuisinart that grinded brew single serve system.  Perfect.  That will support cake cups, but also will grind the beans if you want.  And put them in a recyclable cake cup to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, so let's do this.  By the way, she's an organist, conductor and broadcaster.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, she's quite amazing.  And let's...  There's a lot of fun on TikTok.  Here's a little bit of organ.  You got to start it over again.  The sound. You check your sound.  It's not working.  We check the sound and it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She's like in a big concert hall.  That's like an opera house.  Albert Hall.  Oh, wow.  Albert.  Yeah, because I can feel that.  Now, that is music.  Should we have that as your intro?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Play another one.  She does the foot one.  That's great.  She's amazing.  Festive feet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There we go. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's quite a feet.  Fe-18.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So, Mr. Jarvis, this is the TikTok you should recommend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, so you're okay with this?  You like this, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, do one more.  One more. Find one more.  This is the TikTok, not that musical stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, don't get me going.  I'm going to start crying about Sondheim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I love Mr. Sondheim.  Of course.  Here's one that at least I see a lot of motion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I learned the organ when I was a kid.  Did you?  Instead of the piano.  I remember you saying that once.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did you have one of those Hammond organs that every living room in the 50s had in the house?  The cat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe. It was from my grandparents.  So, possibly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They bought that in the Encyclopedia Britannica.  Yeah. Yeah.  World book.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So between 1880 and 1900, the number of pianos in America went front and homes went from 800,000  to 4 million.  One in every 15 homes to one in every five homes.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow.  Figure that out.  And then the radio came out and they got rid of it.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I tweeted that and everybody said, I got a piano.  I'm trying to get rid of it.  You can't get rid of it.  You got to pay to get it taken away now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I miss...  I miss...  Every once in a while you'll go somewhere where there's no TV, there's no internet,  and people have to entertain themselves.  And it's wonderful because people will do that.  They'll sing, they'll burst into song, they'll do little skits, they'll play charades.  It's so much...  It's nice.  It's wholesome.  What do you do on your cruises?  No, cruises, they got all that stuff.  You don't have to...  They got people to do that for you.  That's the whole point of a cruise.  All right.  Big story.  Big story.  Broke a couple of days ago.  Jack Dorsey very suddenly leaves Twitter.  This is his tweet.  Not sure anyone has heard, but I resigned from Twitter.  After 16 years of having a role at our company from co-founder to see...  We should say, by the way, I think a lot of people think Jack Dorsey invented Twitter.  Right.  That is not the case.  Not the case.  He was at the company...  Jack and Biz.  Jack, Biz, Ev.  And then the guy who invented it is a fourth person who thought...  The fifth Beatle.  Yeah.  I've forgotten his name now as everybody else has.  But they were swinging on the swing sets at South Park in San Francisco.  They were trying to figure out what to do because Odeo, which was...  Here was a good idea of what he said.  Why don't we do a company, a podcast company, not make podcasts.  We'll just have a directory and tell people how to download them called Odeo.  That was such a flop.  He ended up paying the investors back.  He gave the investors back.  Wow.  Which is pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Noah Glass.  Was that his name?  Noah Glass.  Noah Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's the man.  Yeah.  You know what?  You could probably get that from...  The best book about Twitter is Nick Bilton's book about Twitter.  He talks about that.  Yeah.  Is that the name of it?  Hatching Twitter.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.  Very good.  Boy, you've got a good memory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sometimes.  Noah Glass was the guy who thought it up, but these guys were all there.  Anyway, 16 years having a role at our company from co-founder to CEO  to chair to executive chair to interim CEO to CEO.  Jack says, it's time for me to leave.  Why?  Well, no one knows.  No one knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, actually, Dan Premack had a really good story talking about...  What's the theory?  So his theory is that Elliott management was unhappy with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That happened last summer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Last March in Twitter, they gave Elliott a board seat.  They accepted some things.  But behind the scenes, Elliott had wanted new management and more product innovation.  I think they just kind of influenced the ask until they got it is kind of his theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They pushed it and pushed it and pushed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or Jack just said it.  And finally it made sense to other people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, one of the things Elliott, these folks, Elliott management are  what they call activist investors.  They buy a stake in a company, big enough stakes that they listen to,  and then they go in and they really do try to shake things up.  Clean house.  And one of the things they didn't like was the fact that Jack was splitting his time  between Twitter and Square.  His other company.  So he's going to stay at Square.  I think also there's something to be said.  Let me see if I bookmarked this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Did you see how he says the whole founder led is pretty much a problem nowadays?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or becomes one at some point, kind of, right?  Wasn't he kind of saying that that it's okay for a while?  Who said that?  Jack?  Jack said it.  Nice.  In his message.  In that statement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's also, there's also, I can't remember where I read it, but it was an article saying,  it's interesting that all of these people are leaving just as soon as it becomes hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Exactly.  Stuff is hitting the fan and there's all kinds of controversy around your platform.  And people are calling you out because everybody has a megaphone to do so now.  So yeah, taking that money and running.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The new CEO, it's funny, the stock market, when they saw the rumor that Dorsey was leaving,  Twitter stock went up.  Then as soon as they heard who was replacing him, Parag Agrawal, they went, oh, and the stock  tumbled.  He's a CTO.  And the reason, the thinking is that stock market didn't like it because he's an insider  and they wanted fresh blood.  They wanted somebody who'd come and figure out what is really the challenge for Twitter,  which is given its success, its position in the mind share of America,  not necessarily the number of users because that's not really growing,  but it should be doing better.  It should be making more money.  And why isn't it?  That's what the stock market's asking.  And they figure, well, Agrawal is just going to do the same thing.  Agrawal.  Is that how you say it?  Agrawal.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Agrawal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's A-G-R-A-W-A-L.  So I'm saying it phonetically, Agrawal.  Agrawal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, Jack founded Square.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, along with Ev Williams.  No, no, no, no, no.  It's not Ev.  Oh, Square.  Yeah, yeah, Jack.  Square's Jack's baby.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So he's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a famous story of him going to a makerspace and actually 3D printing the first,  because the whole thing about Square was you got the...  When it first started for free, they'd send you the card reader that would go on your iPhone  into the headphone jack.  Remember those?  Headphones.  And there's the story is he would go to the makerspace, I think in the East Bay here,  and 3D print them until he came up with it.  I mean, he was very involved, in other words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but I'm just saying that because he was complaining about founder-led companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Well, he's still the one.  How was Square versus Twitter?  Isn't he much younger?  Square was founded in 2009.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, not that much.  He's going to stay on the board for a little bit, but he really wants to leave.  And he says, I'm going to leave because I don't want to be overseeing.  You know, I want Parag to have his...  And by the way, this is a weird transition because usually there's months of preparing.  I'm going to leave in June 1st.  Nothing.  Parag started that day.  But they had a long search going on, he said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's been going on for some time.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Brett Taylor will be the board chair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which I think is really...  Brett got two jobs this week.  Yeah, he did.  Brett is now the co-CEO of Salesforce and the board chair of Twitter.  And Brett is a really good guy in the Valley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And co-CEOs are always a terrible idea.  Yeah.  That's all I'm going to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I want you to know this was my decision, says Jack.  I own it.  It was a tough one for me.  I love this service and company and all of you so much.  I'm really sad yet really happy.  There aren't many companies that get to this level.  And there aren't many founders that chose their company over their own ego.  I know we'll prove this was the right move.  But then he also has cryptocurrency aspirations too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, interestingly, Parag Agrawal was also in charge of Twitter's crypto stuff.  I presume still will be.  CTO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the belief is he'll carry on blue sky in trying to come up with a distributed architecture.  Which is where I have the biggest hope.  We've talked about this show a few weeks ago.  I think there's a lot of hope for the next level of the internet.  That kind of distribution.  That kind of value-added layering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  From the point of view of a for-profit company,  it's kind of hard to see how that helps Twitter be a successful company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there's a lot of value-added services they can put on top which you'd pay for,  which would get premium advertising, which could have commerce.  I think there's ways to have basically scores of Twitters.  Twitters is what I see with blue sky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What about Ben Thompson's take?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't have a day to read it.  He writes long stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Bottom line, he says, well, it's actually quite interesting.  He talks about Twitter's advertising problem.  And I think he characterizes Twitter in a way that those of you who really love Twitter,  and I'm talking about Stacey and Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I like Twitter as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you two might agree with.  He says Twitter is intense and combative.  It's a lean forward experience and far more likely to be tied to something happening in  the physical world, whether that be watching sports or politics or doing work.  In other words, you're leaning into Twitter.  He says this matters for advertising, particularly advertising that depends on  a direct response, which Twitter has been forced to resort to.  When you're leaning back and relaxed, as in say Instagram, why not click through to that  Shopify site to buy that knickknack?  You didn't even know you needed.  How many times have I done that?  When you're leaning forward, though, and I think this is true of Twitter users,  you don't have the time or the inclination.  If you're doing Twitter, you're really not clicking ad links.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You're seeking information, not entertainment.  I've got another theory.  Well, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not done.  Let me give you all of Ben's theory.  Yeah, it's bad.  I'm sorry.  It takes a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, I'm sorry.  Hey, I'm saving you hours of reading, dude.  Thank you.  Yeah.  This ties into Twitter's third big problem.  I forgot what the first one was.  This was 100,000 sentences ago.  It ties into Twitter's third big problem.  The number of people actually want to experience the internet this way.  This lean forward active way is relatively small.  There's a reason that Twitter's user base is only a fraction of Instagram.  It's not a lack of awareness.  For sure.  Everybody knows about Twitter.  The reality is most people are visual.  Twitter is textual.  Which of course is exactly why Twitter's most fervent users  can't really imagine going anywhere else.  You three are the exact prototypes like that.  He says you're going to have a problem making money on Twitter  in the old fashioned way with advertising.  He says, you know what?  Twitter should bite the bullet and become a subscription service.  It did?  Well, fully subscription.  Paywall.  So let's review.  There's both little evidence that Twitter can monetize  via direct response marketing.  A reason to believe the problem is not simply mismanagement.  I agree.  I think it's structural.  At the same time, Twitter is absolutely essential  to a core group of users who are simply not unconcerned  or not simply unconcerned with the problems  inherent to Twitter's model, public broadcast model,  the abuse and mob behavior.  They don't care about that.  But actually find the platform indispensable for precisely those reasons.  Twitter is where news is made.  Shaped and battled over.  And there's very little chance of another platform displacing it  in large part because no one's economically motivated to do so.  They look at Twitter and go, yeah, I'm not doing that.  So given this, why not charge for access?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This goes to two things.  One is I think you can.  But if you have these value added layers,  this is what Jack said when I said this on Twitter.  He came back and said exactly.  I said that that blue sky thinks that the speech layer  is going to be the commodified layer.  And then you add value layers on there.  I want to find the authoritative people.  I want to find the entertaining people.  I want to find the relevant things.  I want to find stuff.  And others can come along and create those value added layers  and charge for those.  Charging for a place to go talk and blather?  No, we got plenty of that.  But to go to the effort to find something on top,  this is always what happens.  It happened with, I'm sorry, I'm going to say this, Gutenberg.  It happened where we hit the turn of the last century  when magazines exploded.  There's efforts to say there's a wealth of things going on.  How do we find stuff?  That's point one.  Here's the difference.  Point two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I didn't know you had two points.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I told you I did.  And you didn't let me make it before about the advertising.  I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I lost track of the points.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Point two.  Simply put, the advertising on Twitter sucks  because you feel like you've been fooled  every time you click on it.  Which is not good.  And I think that what Twitter should do is what BuzzFeed did  and what Vice did in their days is they need to open  their own agency where we say we know how to make advertising  that works on Twitter.  You idiots don't.  And they haven't done that.  And they've got to invest in advertising  that would be relevant or would be worthwhile to do something.  The advertising is there.  I always think, oh, I almost clicked on that.  Oh, it's promoted.  No, I'm glad I didn't.  So those are my two points.  Thank you very much for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would submit that the reason your first point doesn't work  is because Twitter is unique.  So your first point, you're talking about an area  where there's many different publications.  But Twitter, I don't think there's anything like Twitter.  Twitter is a unique experience.  So I think anything that says let a thousand flowers bloom  is not the point.  Everybody goes to Twitter because that's where it happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there's a billion Twitters, though.  You and I don't see the same Twitter, obviously,  because you hate it and I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But there's still one Twitter, even if it's customizable.  You go to Twitter.  You don't go somewhere else.  In fact, I was just on Twitter and I saw somebody's name  and I thought, is he dead?  And the reason in the trending and in the end,  I never look at trending.  Well, on the Twitter front page, it's there.  I hate to say it.  I don't look at it.  I understand.  I never see it.  You're using it wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So anyway, no, I'm the one who likes it.  You're the one who's using it wrong.  I think most people, by the way,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and Twitter certainly would prefer this.  Go to the front to go to the website, the front page.  I actually use TweetDeck and I don't see any of that stuff.  But really, if you go to the front page, that's what you see.  But that's the point is this is where it's happening.  This is it.  This is ground zero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, that's all mass media thinking.  That's no.  So that's what they have to get rid of.  I would get rid of trending entirely.  And the idea that there is one Twitter and Twitter says,  Twitter, love Twitter to this is BS.  There is no Twitter.  There's a whole bunch of fascinating, amazing, wonderful,  informative voices along with some jerks and a-holes.  And the point is to find the ones that you like  and the ones that I like are going to be different.  And that's OK.  And there's value to be found in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but this isn't exactly like the old way of like,  oh, there's a New York Times.  Twitter isn't monolithic in that sense.  It's only monolithic in that it's all happening at Twitter.com.  So I think it's the best of both worlds.  Absolutely, whatever feed you want to make of it.  But it all happens at Twitter.com.  And because it all happens at Twitter.com, you can do that.  You can conform it.  And I tell you, this comes from my experience with Mastodon,  which is a federated system.  And there is no there there.  And so you have to actually actively figure out  if you want to follow somebody interesting,  you have to know about them.  It's a completely different experience.  On Twitter, it's all there.  And it's trivial to add that person to your experience  or take that person away from your experience.  So I do think there's a lot to be said for the fact  that it's a centralized one place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Harper's New Monthly started in 1850.  Sorry.  They promised that, quote, it would be a place within reach.  Its job would be to place within reach the great mass  of American people, the unbounded treasures  of the periodical literature of the present day.  That's what we need for Twitter.  And I think that there is a role for that.  Isn't that what Twitter is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Except for the literature part, there's nothing longer than...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My COVID list does that to an extent.  Yes.  Could I charge for my COVID list?  If you really wanted to know, that's why I'm saying you can't.  Twitter can.  Twitter can.  Well, no, but under Blue Sky, I could.  I know.  And that's what's not going to work.  And I'll do more development.  It's like an API for content recommendation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, we'll see.  I think Ben's actually got it exactly right.  Now, there's a challenge because if you start charging  for something that's previously free, that's people who go,  I'm out.  But I think enough people like you guys are so addicted to Twitter  that you would...  I mean, it can't be like a lot.  It's going to be like Twitter Blue, two or three bucks a month.  I think they made a mistake by making Twitter Blue too little  in terms of features, too few features, and they didn't require it.  But I think you could...  Maybe you'd lose a third, a half of your users,  but if you could somehow charge three bucks a month  and keep Twitter being the place where it happens,  that's a great business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, to their credit, Twitter Blue is still new.  They're probably working on some more features for that $3.  They just didn't get a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They didn't go far enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if you lose users, you lose some of the value of the platform.  Because I mean...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think you lose the users that matter.  The people who are most...  That's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The people who I follow that I find most interesting  are not journalists and people like that.  It's the people who are...  Small people who research FCC filings and experts in antenna design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Book history wonks on my side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and they may not be willing to pay three bucks a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  One advantage of your plan is that Donald Trump wouldn't bother with Twitter  if it were just people paying for it.  Seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, that's wrong.  The reason he loves Twitter is not because the base sees him on Twitter.  It's because the media sees it and then amplifies it.  That's it.  That's all it is.  I don't think the base is reading him on Twitter.  I think the media is.  And that's one of the reasons you use Twitter.  Because that's where the media is.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He can stick it in our eye.  How do we feel about Twitter's policy on hosting people's spaces?  Oh, we have things to say on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is really interesting.  So another thing that happened...  It happened after Dorsey leaving.  I'm wondering if this is Agrawal's first move.  No.  They ban sharing private images and videos without consent.  I did a lot of interviews about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. What does that mean?  What they're trying to do...  I think it's just a badly written policy with a good intent.  And a lot of us came on quickly and said, whoa, what intended consequences?  Watch out.  The policy is trying to say we're trying to fight harassment.  One of the ways people harass each other is by putting up addresses.  And they already say you can't do that with phone numbers.  No doxxing.  No doxxing.  Right. Another way they say is that we put up photos people don't want.  And so what they're saying is if somebody comes to us and says,  Jarvis put up a photo of Leo Laporte picking his nose.  And Leo says, I'm fed up with this guy, Jarvis.  He harasses me all the time.  He knows I have a nose job.  He knows how sensitive I am about this.  And you can't understand how bad it is, but it's bad.  I didn't get my permission.  So under this rule, because you didn't get permission for the photo to be up,  we're going to say, we'll take it down.  Oh, I got a nose.  I got a schnoz.  We'll compare here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Fortunately, in this analogy, I'm a public figure who they're explicitly exempt.  But let's say I weren't a public figure.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Exactly.  Well, you're not fully exempt either.  And so the problem is there's this broad statement,  which Twitter can use in the future if you come to them to say that  photos without permission aren't allowed.  But that statement alone is really, really troubling.  Because do I have to go and get the permission of everybody  I take a picture of in Central Park?  Yes. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's wrong with that?  They have to complain first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they just complain first.  Let's say you took a picture of people in Central Park.  And let's say I was skipping work that day and I see myself in your picture.  I'm like, oh, motherplucker.  So I come after you and I say, hey, Jeff, you skip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You skip.  Oh, you skip going to work.  I thought you were skipping as an hop and skipping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I do also skip.  That would be embarrassing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be that'd be more embarrassing, Stacey, if you were caught skipping.  So you could as a private individual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I will skip on this program, Jeff.  Let's stay on track here.  As a private individual, you would say, I don't want you to have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would email Jeff slash Twitter and I would say, hey, this photo of me is online  and I don't want it.  And Jeff would have to take it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's primarily it's primarily about harassment, say revenge porn, things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. But it has implications for journalism.  And what if what if here's the argument people make.  So if one of the cops who murdered George Floyd said, I'm a private individual right now,  as he was doing it, he was.  And I didn't give permission that photo and take it down.  That's what people were fearing.  The head of Reuters of the New York of the White House Press Photographers Association  complained about just that on Twitter, saying, whoa, this is going to have an impact on  journalism on newsmakers doing things.  It's going to be used by cops to say, I'm a private individual.  Take that down.  Well, but our cops are private individual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If a cop's doing something in public as part of his job, he's not a private individual.  So I think that's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Public in the case of Twitter doesn't mean government.  Public means we don't know what it means.  It's a badly written policy.  I don't think the policy is ill intended.  I don't think it's a problem in itself, but it can be misinterpreted.  It's going to cause confusion.  It needs a lot of clarification and a lot of people.  What if I go to a protest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's say I went to the QAnon Wait for JFK thing in Dallas and I took pictures of people there  and I posted it and I was like, hey, this is...  The only reason I would post a picture of someone in that situation, I'd be like, hey,  it's the Q Shaman guy.  He's hanging out here.  I thought he was in jail.  I don't think this is so bad, honestly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I think the problem is it's turning into a judgment call for Twitter.  It's not as black and white as...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Any moderation is a judgment call.  It's the wrong judgment.  Yes, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're quite right, but the judgment is not what the judgment should be.  The judgment should be, is this harassment or not?  Instead, the judgment is, is this public or private or not?  And that's what's going to get in trouble with things like newsmaking.  Now, to Stacey's point, your point, Stacey, I'll give you an example where that's the case.  What if you go to a demonstration that has a lot of undocumented immigrants who are...  This happened at Northwestern University where the paper took photos on campus of people in  a demonstration and some of them said, whoa, that's going to reveal me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let me read...  Maybe you haven't read the actual policy.  This policy is not applicable to media featuring public figures or  individuals when media and accompanying tweet texts are shared in the public interest  or add value to the public discourse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. So they've got to make a judgment about that.  And I think I'd rather have them make that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That exempts the George Floyd video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That exempts a lot of things.  Well, when does it become in the public interest?  That's the issue.  I think all journalism would be shared, add value to the public discourse or in the public

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  interest would qualify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The 17-year-old young woman who took the video of George Floyd was not a journalist.  She's not a journalist.  She's not media.  That's the point.  So at that moment, some moderator says, well, let's look at the rules.  Not a public figure, not get permission.  It's off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think this is clear enough that a moderator understands that if it's harassment,  it should go down.  I mean, that's what they're trying...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what the policy should be written as.  That's my point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If the purpose of dissemination of private images of public figures or individuals who  are part of a public conversation is to harass, intimidate, or use fear to silence them,  we may remove the content in line with our policy against abusive behavior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  But above it just says outright that photos without permission are not to be on Twitter.  That's the problem.  That statement then will get misinterpreted in all kinds of ways because that's the line  of...  It's on the bullets of this is not allowed.  Photos without permission not allowed, period.  And other things will fall out from that.  The caveat should be there.  Yeah, that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think this is...  I think this is...  It's fixable.  What's that button you have, the moral panic button?  I think this is moral panic.  Dang it.  It's not here at the studio.  Look, you chased Stacey away.  I don't think this...  I think you're presuming there's problems ahead of time.  Well, hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What does everybody complaining about the internet do all the time?  This is what happened.  I think this is the time to have that discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think this is well designed, actually, and  is pretty clear in its intent.  Obviously, it's not a legal document.  It's not a contract.  It's just an expression of what their intent is in terms of moderation.  I think that it will be done properly.  If it's not, then people can bring it up.  But I think this is exactly right.  That if it's shared in the public interest or adds value to public discourse,  we'll allow it.  If it's done to harass people, we will not.  Here, let's bring up as an example.  Marjorie Taylor Greene or no, no, no, Lauren Boebert  calling Ilan Omar a terrorist.  Now, they're both public figures.  It is probably not shared in the public interest  or adding value to the public discourse.  It's probably intended to be harassment.  I think Twitter, there's enough room in here  that Twitter can make a judgment call.  They're going to have to.  If you want something that's written so tightly  that there's no judgment involved, I think you're out of luck.  I don't think that will happen.  I want judgment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just want it that's relevant to the point, which is harassment,  rather than having that blanket state.  Well, I understand the bullet points there,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  but the bullet point is not like a legal contract.  Don't let it get used that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guarantee you cops are going to use it that way.  Well, then Twitter has the right to say no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's because look, it's shared in the public interest.  It's not to harass you.  It's because you murdered somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's another example.  So let's take a picture.  Let's take a screenshot of the three of us.  Or Stacey, if she's back, the four of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm back.  I had to open the door for my dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm going to read on.  Wait a minute.  We recognize there are instances where account holders may share images or videos  of private individuals in an effort to help someone involved in a crisis situation,  such as in the aft-  This is specifically written for George Floyd.  Such as in the aftermath of a violent event  or part of a newsworthy event due to public interest value.  And this might outweigh the safety risks to a person.  That's a judgment.  We will always try to assess the context in which the content is shared.  And in such cases, we may allow the images or videos to remain on the surface.  I think this is actually quite well written and I think it's appropriate.  And I don't think there's a reason to be-  I don't think-  I just think we just disagree about the execution of the-  I don't think there's a reason to fear this.  I think this is-  Look, we keep saying we want Twitter to do something about this stuff.  They do something and now we equivocate and quibble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because we want clarity.  So Kathy Gillis, I think, was great about this.  By the way, we should have her on the show.  She's great.  I'm trying to find her.  I can't find her.  She's about to be on section 230 today.  Denise Howe.  I'm not alone in this.  There were a lot of people who raised the same issues,  which means that it wasn't clear enough and it just needs to be clear.  That's all.  It's not a big deal.  Denise Howe.  I had a New York Post reporter call me today wanting to find,  oh, this came a day after Jack left.  This means today.  I said, no, it doesn't.  And they wanted to find it was a whole big thing.  I said, no, it doesn't.  Relax.  It's just that some of us are saying there could be unintended consequences.  I think it's quite clear.  I disagree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  For instance, we would take into consideration whether the image is publicly available and  or is being covered by mainstream traditional media or if a particular image in the accompanying  tweet text adds value to the public discourse is being shared in the public interest or is  relevant to the community.  I think this is fairly clear about their intent.  And I think their intent is 100% right on.  Now, let's wait and see what happens.  But I think it's much more likely that they're just not going to enforce it than that they're  going to enforce it poorly.  I think that much more likely this is lip service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So then you're going to have people on the right coming after them and saying,  I asked them to take down that photo by making fun of me and they wouldn't do it.  And they're going to find them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think there's enough places in this copy where they could say, no, no, read line 50.  It says in the public interest.  I don't I don't see this being a problem.  Now.  So we disagree there.  We'll wait and see.  But it's not a big disagreement here.  Yeah, I'm really glad.  I see.  I think it's badly.  I'm really glad they did this.  We've been wanting Twitter to take a stand on this because up to now they don't.  And, you know, they take pictures.  I'm a public figure, so I accept that.  But they take pictures of my family and post them.  And I can't get them down.  So now I have a foothold to get them down.  I think that's that's a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Nice.  Denise Howell summarized it on Twitter.  In general, under U.S. law, an individual's reasonable expectation of privacy went out  and about in the public places low.  Will that factor into Twitter's analysis of what constitutes consent?  This remains to be seen, but it sounds like Twitter has something more explicit in mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think so.  I would submit that Twitter doesn't want to be the place where you post pictures of kids  fighting in school.  Yeah.  They don't want to be admittedly that stuff's legal.  You're in a public place.  Yeah.  That doesn't violate law, but they want a higher standard.  They don't want to be sensible.  If I were Tom Brady, I would definitely want this taken down.  So, I mean, no, see, he can't because he's a public figure.  Right.  And this is newsworthy or not.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Did you see the other news on line 23 that happened within the last hour or so?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Square's changing its name.  Thank you for putting that in.  That's new.  It's going to be.  What's like Square but not?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Block.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're going to call it Block.  It's like trapezoid.  It's a little like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As in blockchain.  Chain, yeah.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Payments.  Giant Square will change its corporate name to Block,  affection of December 10th.  That's a big deal because you build brand recognition for years as Square.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The corporate name, is that the brand of the...  Are they changing the brand of the service?  Well...  We built Square brand for our seller business, which is where it belongs.  Said Dorsey.  Block is a new name, but for our purpose of economic empowerment, it remains the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's what Kate Rooney's writing at CNBC.  I think she's right.  The move comes as Square expands beyond its original credit card reader business  with a focus on new technologies like blockchain.  I think that's fair.  Yep, yep, yep.  Block.  It'll still be ticker SQ.  Block had jokes to come.  Block's a good name.  Surprise, it's available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure they paid a pretty penny for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By the way, I forgot this, but they bought Jay-Z's music service, Tidal.  Tidal, yep.  They also bought...  They own Tidal?  Yeah, I forgot that.  They also bought the Buy Now...  By the way, apparently we were talking about this on Windows Weekly.  Buy Now, Pay Later is all the rage.  Apparently they bought a After Pay, which is a Buy Now, Pay Later thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They own After Pay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yep.  Thanks for joining us, Stacey.  Let me see what else I can tell you.  They bought Hershey's chocolate too, Stacey.  No, they didn't.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm like, what else do they own?  I'm so...  Blomix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that's interesting.  I'm just here to echo you.  We were talking about Buy Now, Pay Later on Windows Weekly is  unaccountably, Microsoft has bundled this in, and you can't turn it off,  a little Buy Now, Pay Later thing into its browser edge  to encourage people to Buy Now, Pay Later.  Guess what browser I don't use.  Yeah, that's a really good reason not to use the browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I tried it at first, but then they started putting a bunch of coupon things up on the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I feel like Buy Now, Pay Later is the equivalent of payday loans, right?  It's like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Could be a predatory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's less predatory, but I mean...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's no interest, right?  If you Buy Now...  Is it like layaway?  What is it?  I don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's more like layaway.  Most of them don't have interest, but they can...  Well, no, there's some kind of...  They just have long terms.  What's the evil part here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it to get you to buy things you can't afford?  Yes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  A lot of them just have those long, stretched out terms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm trying to remember.  There was a whole...  I read several articles.  I was fascinated by it because I was curious who was doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, let me look up what after-pay's terms are, since they're owned by Square.  Afterpay, your gift list.  Apparently, it was one of the things that fueled Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales.  Wow.  A lot of...  And by the way, the kids call it BNPL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you.  OMG.  OMG.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Buy a Bunpull purchases for Black Friday.  Afterpay.  How it works.  Here we go.  Shop now, pay over six weeks, never pay interest.  Who pays for this?  The merchant?  There's got to be...  How does Afterpay make money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you get late fees.  Merchants do pay.  And it says, let's see, Credit Karma did a survey.  This is a Consumer Reports article on it.  34% of consumers who use BNPL services fell behind on one or more payments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Afterpay says late fees are capped at 25% of the purchase price.  So clearly, they're hoping to get a little bit of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this for the unbanked and the uncredit carded?  Or how do you pay in turn?  Do you pay with your credit card?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's an option to get away from credit cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No external credit checks, no interest, no fees when you pay on time.  That's a lot of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's a risk thing, calculating the risk of a bad pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I'm thinking the merchants pay a few points on the sale too, right?  That must be where the bulk of their revenue comes from, the merchants.  Because it's like a credit card, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because they're not, well, I guess they are giving you credit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Afterpay charges, I've got the info.  Afterpay charges 4.17% to the merchant on all sales.  That's higher than a credit card.  Yeah.  So it's late payment fees plus merchant fees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and sometimes your late payment fees, if you miss them,  they will get reported to a credit bureau, but sometimes they won't.  And it kind of depends.  And the rules vary via provider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the online shop charges a flat fee of 30%  I'm sorry, 30 cents and a commission that varies with the value and volume  of the transactions processed using Afterpay.  The more you sell, the lower the percentage.  The fee can be as high as 6% per transaction.  And as low as 4%.  So it is more than a credit card.  Both higher than a credit card.  In order to get you to the merchant.  So I'm Joe's blue jeans shop.  In order to get you to buy blue jeans, got a young people in here.  They don't have credit cards.  I say, look, buy now, pay later.  It's easy.  I give up 4% to 6% of the sale, but I make the sale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder if you can get insurance for bad debt, bad payment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Afterpay pays within 48 hours.  So the risk is not on the merchant.  Cash flow is good.  The risk is on Afterpay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Afterpay pays the whole amount.  48 hours.  Oh, oh wow.  So it's a risk mitigation business.  It's entirely a risk mitigation business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The merchant is totally fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder if you get turned down.  Can you kill off your Afterpay account?  Because you've...  I'm sure that you can be blacklisted from Afterpay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sure, yeah.  On the other hand, maybe they don't want to blacklist you  because they get that sweet 25% in late fees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Credit card companies want you to pay late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, now we've learned everything there is to know about BNPL.  And by the way, when asked, Microsoft said, oh,  when you use Edge and buy now, pay later,  we don't take a fee from the merchant.  But then when asked, well, does anybody pay you?  They said no comment.  The answer would be, yeah.  We make money on it.  I just feel a little skeevy to me for Microsoft to encourage this.  I guess it's no different than a credit card.  We'd certainly been doing that for years.  I tell my kids, don't use a credit card, but pay it off every month.  Because I remember when I was their age, running up $30,000 credit card bills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The stupid credit cards that shows up on the college campus for freshmen.  And the interest is so high, you can't pay it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It just totally screwed me up.  I had to dig my 30s real deep to get that payment.  And then finally pay off all the credit cards.  What a great feeling that is.  And I just made a point from now on, a credit card is not a charge card.  I'm not going to run up a bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because I mean, what, 19-year-olds or 18-year-olds know that stuff.  That takes some discipline, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My wife took over our bills real fast after we got married.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not saying that's why I married Lisa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it didn't hurt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's nice to have a CFO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's nice to have a CFO in the family.  She's almost like scary good at this stuff.  It's like, oh wow, we've paid off the house?  Oh yeah.  And it shows.  I mean, she's scary.  And me, I'm like, how many times have the lights turned off on the house?  Because oh, I forgot to pay the electric bill.  We actually got, and this is hard to do, got the water turned off.  That is hard to do.  Wow.  It wasn't I didn't have the money.  It was just I forgot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then I saw the notice.  My wife makes fun of me because I used to insist on paying the bills once a month.  Because that's how I should do it.  I should do it once a month.  I said, well, that doesn't matter.  I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  31st of the month, you sit down at your little desk, your little armoire, you pull down the  desk, get out your fountain pen, get your checkbook and you go through all those, get some stamps.  You lick them all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You mail them all out.  I used to do that.  So aunt, who pays the bills in your house?  Me.  Stacey, who pays the bills in your house?  Andrew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Andrew does, but I can also do it.  I'm listening to y'all and I'm like, how did y'all make it through?  Andrew does it because he's doing the business stuff anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you have two people in the family who could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. Queen Pruitt, she contributes or whatever, but most of it falls on me.  And that's an agreement we've had from day one.  Here's a number.  I'm going to take over the numbers of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's a number.  This is from our chat room.  Thank you, Matt.  The average American has a credit card balance of $5,525.  Probably running that month to month.  What's the interest rate?  It goes up to $18,000.  Oh, it was at least 15%.  Yeah, it's like 18 or 19.  Anyway, so Twitter.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm still enjoying Twitter Blue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't get much out of it, but it's good.  I get the top articles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The top articles have been great for me so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They were so smart to buy Nuzzle and incorporate that in because there were a lot of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I wasn't happy that they bought Nuzzle.  No, no, no.  I was a little angry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did they buy Nuzzle directly or did Tony buy Nuzzle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, no, no.  Yeah, they bought it.  They bought the company that bought Nuzzle.  You're right, Tony.  But I bet you that the Venn diagram of Twitter users and Nuzzle users was like 50%, 60%, 70%, right?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm still happy with Twitter Blue at the moment.  It's $3 well spent.  You know who I'm not happy with?  Who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  ActBlue.  ActBlue?  This is the... and I'm sure there's an ActRed.  This is the donation system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, this is the Democratic Donation System.  Uh-oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I feel like this is a scam.  For instance, some dark patterns a little bit on the site where you don't know that  you're signing up for a monthly contribution.  I didn't notice for months that I was giving $1,000 to Mark Kelly who already won.  Oh, Jesus.  Schmuck.  Predatory.  Schmuck.  Predatory much.  Dark patterns in action, baby.  And both sides do it.  I know that that's very common in Republican fundraising as well.  So I'm just not going to use ActBlue anymore.  I'm going to donate right to the campaign.  Although all the... the only reason it's coming up is because I see Stacey Abrams is using ActBlue.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that's why I can't.  They all just use it.  Oh, they all do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you just... yeah, you just got to pay attention, but yeah.  Yeah, you do, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Also though, don't they take a chunk?  I'm dumb and I didn't do that.  Don't they take a chunk?  They do, but you also could give them more.  And then they want you to also tip them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Pretty predatory.  Just going to give direct.  Um, okay.  Okay.  Wow.  I'm going to take a break now after this fascinating, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You didn't show the...  Can you show it?  The thing with the onion?  Before he went on the air?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The onion?  I'll show it, but there's a bad word in it.  I had somebody sent me get on the... join the forums saying you shouldn't say the word crap.  I'm never going to listen to your shows again because you said the word crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I got kicked off the BBC for using the word crap because I was trying not to use the S word.  I thought, well, this is safe.  I'll say crap.  And boom, they kicked me off.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I'm not of that religion.  But I don't like the other a-hole word.  Self-important a-hole making big show about leaving Twitter.  Jack Dorsey.  Of course, that's, you know, a play on the fact that everybody, including me, by the way,  who leaves Twitter has to write a bigotry blog post about why I'm leaving Twitter.  Jack can write a blog post.  Yeah, I think that's good.  Our show today brought to you by Our Crowd.  I love talking about this because, you know, for years I don't invest in the tech companies  and I've sat on the sidelines and watched people like Kevin Ross get rich with the same,  you know, because they're covering these stories and they're investing.  And I'm just like, well, I'm sitting on the sidelines.  Maybe, though, if you're... and you have to be in a certain position in your life  where you've, you know, you've done all the right things.  You got the rainy day fun and you're saving in the right way for retirement, all that stuff.  But there comes a time when you're saying, I would like to invest in some of these exciting  new companies, these startups, because every once in a while one comes along.  I knew I should have... I should have...  Boy, if I could have only invested in Twitter before it went public,  which is what Kevin Rose did, I would be doing well right now, sitting pretty.  You should know about Our Crowd.  Our Crowd, a bunch of very smart venture capitalists, they're always analyzing companies  in the private market.  Now, this is what's different.  This is not... you're not buying stocks.  Then the global... and global is important too, by the way.  They look all over the world.  They select those with the greatest growth potential and then they present them to you  and say, would you like a chance to invest from personalized medicine to cyber security  to robotics, quantum computing and more in state-of-the-art labs, startup garages,  everywhere in between, Our Crowd is identifying innovators so you can get in when the investment  potential is the best, which is early, before the exit, before the IPO.  But you can't... it's not something you can do easily, right?  You don't read about these companies in the paper.  And I should mention, in order to do this, you need to be an accredited investor,  which every country has different rules about this.  You can find out by just going to the Our Crowd website and entering your country  and they'll tell you what the rules are.  But Our Crowd's accredited investors have already invested over a billion dollars  in growing tech companies.  Our Crowd has had now 46 exits, 46 IPO's or sale exits of their investments.  And those members really benefit when you get a big exit.  This is a great way to truly diversify your portfolio.  Investing, and it doesn't have to be a massive investment, I'll explain.  Investing early in innovative private market companies at Our Crowd.  Actually, Our Crowd has two ways to do it.  Accredited investors can participate in single company deals for as little as $10,000.  If you're in this ballpark, a very reasonable amount of money.  They also do funds.  They're a little more expensive, but you can get one of our Our Crowd's funds  for as little as $50,000.  But a minimum of $10,000 is required to invest in, as I said.  Investment terms may vary depending on what country you're in, where you're investing.  So you can find out what those terms are when you go to the site  and then put the country you're investing from.  You must be an accredited investor.  Our Crowd does not take advantage of anybody because you can join.  You don't have to spend any money to go to ourcrowd.com slash twig.  Join this fast growing venture capital investment community.  It's free.  You won't pay a penny unless you say, oh, they'll present to you.  And you say, I like this one.  I'd like to buy in.  So it's at no cost.  It's a great way to find out what's going on.  I think this is really clever.  And I just wanted to present this to you as an opportunity.  Ourcrowd.com slash twig.  I think it's a really interesting and a really good idea.

Thank you, twig listener.  And you support us by using that address so they know.  Ourcrowd.com slash twig.  Hey, speaking of twig listeners, our club twig community manager is here.  Yes, I am.  Mr. Ant Pruitt.  Your honor.  You got a big event coming up on Friday.  I'm excited.  I want everybody to know about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yep, yep, yep, yep.  We will be having a fireside chat with the wonderful Miss Mary Jo Foley.  Good.  It's 10 a.m. Pacific.  I just want to pick her brain a little bit, so I'm going to ask her a couple questions  about her history and past and so forth.  But it's going to be fun.  And you'll get to ask questions too.  Yeah, and we'll take some questions if I don't take up all the time.  No, don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But because this is the incentive to be a member of club twig.  Join the club.  You cannot watch this on Friday.  You can't listen to the feed later because it's on the twig plus feed unless you're a member.  That's right.  This is what we're trying to do is give you a bunch of reasons to join club twig.  A lot of people we figured would join because you get ad-free versions of all the shows.  That's nice.  No, most of them are there for the Discord.  I think the Discord is a very surprising and wonderful thing.  Stacey had her book club there.  She's going to do another one.  There's a poll right now for the next.  That poll is now closed.  Oh, it's over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I officially closed it.  It is Autonomous by Miss Annali Nulitz.  I can never say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. In fact, I interviewed Annali on Triangulation.  I remember from a long time ago.  It's a fun book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a super fun book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And brings up some interesting robot human questions.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, see now next up is we'll have to schedule the time for the next book club and Miss Stacey,  I will be reaching out to you to figure that out.  It's going to be January because December is crazy.  When's the book club?  When are you going to do Autonomous?  That's what we've got to figure out.  I don't know if it's going to be January after I've looked at my calendar, but we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We have a lot of stuff coming up too.  Amira and Mike Elgin are going to do Fire.  So I'm going to do that one.  We also have, you said, Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis is coming up a little bit later in the spring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think he's scheduled me for like 2024.  I believe so.  That's when you got a book Jeff, man.  That's when you got a book Jeff, man.  Seven bucks a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Andy and Natko, I'm going to sit with him.  Oh good.  He is fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  See all the stuff you get.  This is huge.  We have the Entedalynx show in there, the book club.  There's all sorts of stuff going on in the Discord.  All of the shows make it to the Twit Plus feed, including Dicty Bartolo's Giz Fizz.  So if you are interested, I think it's a very fair seven bucks a month.  A cup of one Frappuccino.  Fancy cup of coffee a month.  And all the details and everything at twit.tv slash clubtwit.  And by the way, it's month to month.  One of the reasons we made it month to month is if you join and you go,  I'm not getting my money's worth, that's fine.  I understand completely.  We will always continue to do what we do.  You know, the shows for free, the chat room IRC.twit.tv for free,  the Twit forums, twit.community for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What's funny is the main complaint is it should be $10 a month, not seven.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think seven's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Thanks for writing in about that.  Y'all can pay more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could have a seven or a $10 option and see what people choose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Remember, Full gets a cut, Stripe gets a cut, but I think we end up being about $5  per person per month.  We're very happy with that.  We're so grateful to all of you.  And if you do that, you don't have to listen to the ads,  which I think some people really like that idea.  So yeah, get comments about that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hey, I'm going to pay the $7 a month and I still want to hear the ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And people say, I don't want another subscription.  I completely understand.  That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're not, there's no pressure, but we won't show up at your house demanding money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Appreciate this.  Today.  The support.  Appreciate the support.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Aunt may show up at your house.  Oh God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Terrifying.  Run.  Black Friday.  Not great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not a thing anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Not a thing.  And the novelty is worn off the whole long lines and stuff.  I can remember Thanksgiving leaving my mother's house on Thursday evening and whatnot and  getting on I-85 North to head back to Charlotte.  And there's always this traffic heading off to the different exits near malls  because people were going shopping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Lisa and her sister used to get up at 4 P, 4 AM on Thursday, Thursday night, Friday morning  to go to Target, you know, for the door buster specials.  I don't think people do that.  Remember you'd see all those.  Yeah, you don't do that.  News stories about people crushed.  Yep.  You don't see that anymore.  I think there's a few things going on.  Black Friday shopping dropped 28% from pre-pandemic levels.  Now this is according to Adobe and this is to big brick and mortar stores.  Okay.  Online was about even with last year.  So some of it is it went to online.  But I have a new theory that nobody's mentioned.  I think there's also a move to buy local and those aren't getting counted by Adobe  because they're small mom and pop stores.  And I wonder because I've noticed weird Lisa and I are doing that for our Christmas presents.  We're shopping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rich people buy local.  I was going to say what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Rich people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm serious.  Buying local is expensive.  So rich people and there's small business Saturday.  But really what here's what it is.  That's sad.  This year you got the pandemic.  You also got the words about supply chain.  So people started doing their sales early.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They've been selling a lot longer.  You're right.  It's spread out.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then you've got the online shopping.  Most people would rather do online shopping.  Many retailers decided not even to open on Thanksgiving.  And so I think this is to brick and mortar stores on Thanksgiving Day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Cratered 90% from a year ago.  That's according to a sensor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Two years ago.  That may also be due to the workforce issues.  Yeah.  A lot of people.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Target decided to close on Thanksgiving.  Walmart, Best Buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My local Starbucks is closing every day at 1 p.m. now.  1 p.m. closing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You need more teenagers.  Have you noticed this?  That's what it sounds like.  I'll try to make some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Get on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I noticed this downtown.  It's Starbucks downtown.  Give me 15 years.  It's filled with high school kids.  Instead of going to the mall, they go to Starbucks.  They do their homework.  They sit at the tables.  They drink coffee.  They chat.  It's a social thing.  It sure is.  Is that me?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've been doing that for like 10 years.  Yeah, I know.  I'm just noticing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I think that's interesting.  But I think the reason that your Starbucks, Jeff, closes early  is because everybody in your neighborhood is in bed by the way.  No, I think it's a labor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they're trying to tough out unionizing.  No.  Oh, they're fighting.  They get more staff.  They pay more.  They don't want to pay more.  They're fighting the unionization.  So they'd rather close the stores and make less money.  I'm surprised.  I'm shocked.  I haven't seen a business story about this.  Just shocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, you said this, but this is only yours.  I know that my.  All around me.  My Starbucks are.  But you're also in Seattle though, Miss Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe people don't buy coffee afternoon in your neighborhood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They all want to sleep because they're old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's nap time.  I will say I agree with Miss Stacy regarding the big box stores versus the shop local because  I can make that sacrifice and buy my groceries at the more expensive,  family owned grocery store or whatever, but electronics, I don't know if I can afford to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's no real mom and pop electronics store, is there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I mean, some camera shops and things like that.  They're all dying though because of that, right?  They're all dying.  But I mean.  I still try to support the one in Santa Rosa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mostly it's clothing, I think.  So only rich people go to clothing stores that way.  What you're saying?  What store do they go to?  That's counterintuitive to me, but they go to the big.  They go to Costco to get their pants.  I go to Walmart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Costco, Target, Walmart.  I go to Walmart for my britches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Zara.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a lot cheaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where do you shop, Leo?  I shop at Neiman Marcus Brooks Brothers and Tiff Beautiful.  No, this is L.L. Bean, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, no, we're not going to mention them.  We gave them a lot of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've already given them way too much.  L.L. Bean goes with the wicked good slippers.  I only buy clothing from Maine.  Actually, that's true.  These shoes are also from Maine.  So how did you get your shoes off that quickly, man?  Maine shoes are easy to put on and easy to take off.  That's one of the reasons you buy shoes from Maine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I forget this table is high for you, considering.  Is it high?  I can't really move like that at this table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ant, you can verify it.  You see it?  Made in Maine.  Made in Maine.  It says that, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maine, Maine, USA.  Now your finger smells, too.  Does not smell.  This time.  Ant, be honest, does it smell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm not smelling his finger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've hit a new low.  This show is hit a new low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's talk about what other stories.  Oh, Stacey's trying to bring up anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you, Miss Stacey.  Anything.  Back on the tracks.  There's a chip story, Stacey.  There's two chip stories.  That'll save us.  What's the chip story?  I don't know.  I think it's boring, but she'll make it interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  Let's talk about data.  There's a Tesla story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a really good Tesla Model Y story.  That's a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The dog says the dog agreed.  The Tesla story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  PayPal says spending via its Buy Now Pay Later service  soared 400% on Black Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See, you're just behind the times.  Is that how poor people buy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's an honest question and an honest answer.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why you're poor.  You don't spend the money you have.  You spend the money you don't have.  You don't have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Exactly.  It's all predatory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Big story.  Here's one.  I got one that Stacey's going to go, oh, oh.  I'm ready.  Oh.  No, actually, you're not.  Meta has chosen Amazon Web Services as its long-term strategic cloud provider  according to protocol.  A big win for AWS.  I think if Meta, which is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought this was so weird because Meta...  Facebook was one of the pioneers behind open compute.  All the way back in 2008, I was quizzing Mark Zuckerberg on how many servers they had  because it was a really interesting number.  And I, for the longest time, thought they would push out...  Oh, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're right.  You didn't get an ooh, but you got a setting interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It worked really well.  Yeah, it did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Back off and I won't talk about it at all.  No, no, no, no.  It's good.  No, you're exactly right.  Love it.  Facebook's famous for open compute, which was a network operations center.  Yeah, and I thought they should offer their stuff as a pass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They do run their own.  So I thought they were going to offer everything as a pass.  I always thought that would be a really interesting business model  to go up against Amazon Cloud, but one layer up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Part of the reason they say is this is for PyTorch.  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, machine learning.  You're just making fun of me.  Machine learning.  You're very mean and I am the nicest person.  What is PyTorch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Tell us.  I think PY means Python, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is.  It's a framework for machine learning.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And so why can't Facebook run their own freaking PyTorch servers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess it's because if you think about cloud computing and Facebook's monolithic jobs,  the big jobs that they would need their specialized data center infrastructure for  is probably things like storing photos, newsfeed, their social graph stuff.  So maybe the machine learning was just one bridge too far for them.  I don't know.  I'm just guessing.  So having that kind of workload, Amazon's built their Graviton.  They've built the, what is it called?  Like Infra?  They've got the worst names.  They've got a bunch of machine learning options available for you.  So maybe Facebook was like, yeah, we don't have to build it.  Amazon's got it.  It's cheaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This, by the way, was announced at Amazon's reInvent conference today, or it will be anyway.  Are you paying attention to AWS reInvent?  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's their big, giant cloud computing conference.  And I always preface it as like, it's where Amazon tells you which businesses and startups  it's going to kill this year because every time it sees like a startup doing really well  or a feature that's gaining ground, it's like, let's launch that.  And then it does.  And then who goes, no, it's in Vegas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know if it's a live event or it must be probably Vegas.  It must be hybrid.  Yeah.  Who goes to this?  Who goes to this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everyone.  Everyone who's anyone in enterprise computing.  But Stacey, you're not there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are you sad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm watching it virtually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You are.  Okay.  Okay.  That's sensible.  And so people who are interested in enterprise computing go and Amazon then presents to them  what AWS is up to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They release so much news.  I don't even know how many servers.  There's over 200 AWS services, cloud services.  Right.  It's crazy.  Is it like Dreamforce for AWS?  Yeah, it's like Dreamforce, but only for Amazon's cloud computing.  Yeah, that's exactly what it's like.  And they'll do keynotes.  I like how you advanced from kind of to exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I was like, it's like the Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not Jeff, you're always wrong, but actually in this case.  It's not like Google I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like their Google cloud event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's for partners though, right?  Mostly like people were already.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's people who build on Amazon, but it's also it's their customers go.  It's everybody in enterprise.  So the investors are going to be there.  You've got all the startups there.  You've got anybody who's got to build any sort of application.  I mean, it's a huge show.  Like this year, like the 2019 one had, I think, 60,000 attendees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have to say.  No, it's legit.  Jeff Bezos is famous for for years.  I think they still do it.  Not buying desks for people who work at Amazon,  but giving you a pair of sawhorses and a door for your desk.  And I'm looking at the TV, the video feed of what's going on in Amazon reinvent.  And this is the equivalent of us two sawhorses in a door.  This is the cheesiest TV set.  It doesn't even go all the way behind the person.  It's like, oh, we couldn't afford to have.  Is that a bad hotel?  That's a very there is the full view.  It's just a strip.  It's a picture of the strip that's too short to actually go behind the host.  Those chairs look horrible.  We just bought chairs like that on Amazon.  In fact, Ashley, our marketing person, saw it, bought a chair there.  And she were laughing, right?  Because she said it was really small.  It's like too small.  It's a little tiny chair.  Come on, Jeff.  I guess he's not the CEO anymore.  Come on, Andy.  He's not.  What's his name?  Andy Jassy.  Anyway, I'm sorry.  I shouldn't.  Who used to be.  There's another.  AWS guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Reinvent every year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there's another big AWS story on line 52.  I think that's big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  On line 52.  Hold on.  Can I ask Stacey more about the chips?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a big story that Ant wants to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not that super big, Jeff, but sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  NASDAQ is moving markets to Amazon's cloud.  That's the story he wanted to talk about.  That's not a big deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Not a big client?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Everybody uses AWS.  I don't even think NASDAQ is a big operation, to be honest with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the NASDAQ used to come to, when I was at GigaOwn,  they used to come to all of our cloud computing conferences  because they were always like, all the markets are very advanced.  The banks too, on the financial and the cloud front.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that was to me the fascinating thing about all this was Michael Lewis's Flashboys,  which was all about flash trading.  And it starts off with somebody building a fiber as straight as possible  because even the slightest bend, so you slow down between Chicago and the New York,  the Chicago exchange and the New York exchange.  So they could be milliseconds ahead of the other traders  whose fiber line zigged and zagged.  So they had a building very, very, very straight.  And it just shows you, you're right.  When it comes down to stuff like this, cutthroat technology is everything.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Jeff, just so you know, AWS has hosted a bunch of NASDAQ stuff for years,  some of their data lake stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Billions of transaction records in a data warehouse operated by AWS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Including.  Right near my office is the fake NASDAQ headquarters, which is ridiculous.  It's sometimes square.  There's nothing that actually happens there.  They just kind of have flashing lights.  That's the other thing I learned in Flashboys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He says, you know, the stock exchange where you see the shots of going,  buy, buy, buy.  It's fake.  None of that.  Nobody's done that.  It's in New Jersey.  Nobody's done that in years.  It's all fake.  It's all for show.  It's so Maria Bartiromo has somewhere to stand and be the money honey.  And learn how to be insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, she's the nut job now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't get him started.  Stacy, no, get him started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Stacy, chip, no, we've got an AMD story, an AMD story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I wanted to ask you about the AMD partnering up with the meta.  This was a couple of weeks ago, right after the name.  Breaking.  It's not breaking, but still pretty big news because they're  partnering up with meta with their cloud computing processing.  Did you see anything about that?  Is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Meta is going to use meta's VR stuff.  Their Oculus is going to use AMD chips and they're going to actually,  they're going to use some new chips, which helped.  I mean, somebody liked it because the stock price went up 10%.  The stock went up 10%.  Somebody liked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  AMD has been on a tear though for the last couple of years in the stock market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Already, Sony and Microsoft both use AMD chips in their game system.  So it's actually not much of a surprise really.  Nice.  Yeah, these are good chips for that.  And then you said Finland is going to have its first quantum computer up and running.  It's pretty, isn't it?  Don't get excited.  It's only five qubits.  It does actually looks like a good K-cup machine.  Coffee machine.  We need a new K-cup machine.  Oh, it's a little big for the office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How cold does it have to be kept?  Do they keep it outside?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I got a great question for you, Stacy, because I've been seeing a lot about lately  fusion as a power source for the future.  Now, of course, nuclear power plants currently use fission,  which produces byproducts that are deadly and you got to put them somewhere.  Fusion is how the sun...  Can we talk about this two weeks ago?  Yeah, I'm just giving you something else to talk about.  So the sun...  Oh, he's doing his job, Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, we talked about the New Yorker did a big article.  It was there like every 10 years they look at fusion and there was a startup at MIT that  has figured out...  I swear to God I didn't talk to you about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe we did.  I'm sorry.  I do combine in my mind fusion with quantum computing because they both seem  way out there, distant in the future.  Maybe, never.  That's all.  That's how my mind works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what to say here.  There is a 238, I think is the most largest qubit computer running around right now.  So, Finland's computer is not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Little teeny weeny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's easy peasy qubit computer.  256 qubit.  Big enough for Finland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Who has the 256?  Is that IBM?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is...  No, it's actually a startup from Harvard MIT.  Quera, Q-U-E-R-A, computing.  Nice.  But it's only for specific problems.  Google has a 53 qubit machine.  And IBM has a 53 bit quantum computer.  How big would a quantum computer...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How many qubits would you have to have to actually do real work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The issue with quantum computers is you have to program to do a specific type of job.  So they're only good at certain types of jobs.  So it's not like...  So it's not analogous to saying...  It's not like American apples to oranges.  Yeah, or like it's got 256 transistors, you would say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, good luck with that.  So you'd have to run them as a benchmark.  You'd have to do...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In some things like Monte Carlo simulations, the quantum computer is going to be much better at  than a traditional computer.  Right.  But I don't...  It's good for simulations, particularly.  Yeah.  So I'm trying to think because you couldn't gauge it on performance.  You could do it on speed of application, but you'd also want to have one other thing.  So you'd be like, would it be energy as your trade-off?  Would it be cloud?  Would it be energy?  Would it be energy as your trade-off?  Would it be cost?  Because quantum computers on cost can't...  No.  Again, I don't think you could do a benchmark here.  You're going to have to come up with a completely new job that can only be done with the quantum

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  computer.  Okay.  Well, one of the things, of course, that always comes up with quantum computing is the idea  that it might make it easy to factor large primes, which is kind of critical to the public  key cryptography system we use today.  And if they got really good at that, we'd have to come up with another way.  And actually scientists are already working on alternatives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  I go to...  There are so many webinars on that right now.  I've been to at least three.  They're really hard to understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's pretty sophisticated.  I don't know if it's elliptic curve they're using or something, but something that would  not be as easy to crack as the prime factoring, which is what's the backbone of public key  crypto these days.  But then again, so that would be the question.  Well, how many qubits do you need to break the RSA 4096?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I could answer that.  I've read this answer before.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'll let you work on that while I read another ad.  How about that?  Okay.  You want to know about this kind of stuff?  There's a great place to go.  Udacity.  Udacity is an online education program geared towards people looking to take  their tech knowledge to the next level.  And man, do they have some great content that can really help you go further in the  career you want or get the career you want.  The latest cutting edge nano degree programs you can't find anywhere else.  Udacity is all about encouraging your, yes, you, your career growth.  They want to give you the information you need to decide what career you want.  Help you choose that career, then give you the skills for that career.  And then they go all the way, help you get the job in that career.  Aaron, here's an example.  There's lots of success stories on the website.  Here's a guy named Aaron.  He said, Udacity's nano degree programs and career resource center played an integral  part in helping me land a job offer from Google.  Nice.  That is, that is a hard thing to get.  That is the golden ticket.  Yeah.  A job offer from Google.  If you're looking to get into the most cutting edge technology careers,  you can get nano degree programs in AI and flying cars.  I would love that.  In fact, they've got a nano degree program for a flying car and autonomous flight engineer  or intro to self-driving cars or machine learning engineer or robotic software engineer  and a whole lot more.  Udacity's courses are created with the companies you will want to work for.  Industry leaders like Microsoft and Google and IBM and AWS and more.  They select team leads at the top companies to be your instructors.  So you're learning from people who are in the field working on this stuff.  You're going to get the right knowledge from experts who are working on these exact problems  every single day in big businesses.  This is so cool.  When you sign up for a nano degree program with Udacity, you can expect courses to be  project-based.  I think that's really important to get that active learning to do it, to build it yourself.  Not only does it test your knowledge, but having built those projects, you can now put  them up on your GitHub, which they'll help you do, put them a reference to it in your  LinkedIn.  People think a lot more highly if you could say, oh yeah, that's a project I've worked  on.  That makes a big difference.  Your projects and homework will be reviewed by qualified professionals in the field.  You get real human feedback, reviews just like real code reviews, and you're never alone.  You're going to get access to mentors 24-7.  It's actually a great community at Udacity.  Flexible schedule.  You can work whatever, as hard as you want, as little as you want.  But to give you a sense, if you work maybe five to 10 hours a week, you can graduate in  as little as three months.  Here's a good example of a scholarship offer at Udacity.  There are quite a few of them.  If you go to the Udacity webpage and select scholarships under resources, there's one,  110 and Blacks in Technology has teamed up with Udacity to offer part-time online tech  scholarships for black Americans who don't have a four-year degree.  That's awesome.  The truth is the four-year degree is not necessarily the golden ticket.  You need to get the skills these companies want.  And having a nanodegree program at Udacity, having that certificate can make such a  difference.  Right now 110 Blacks in Technology and Udacity are offering 2,000 full scholarships for  qualified applicants.  You can apply today at udacity.com.  And do scroll to the bottom of the webpage and select scholarships under resources because  there are others as well.  And if you're a business, you can use Udacity to upskill your entire workforce.  Check out the enterprise section of Udacity's website today to learn more.  So bottom line, get the in-demand tech skills you need to advance your career.  A great way to learn Udacity, udacity.com slash twit to learn more.  Check out the scholarship programs.  And you know the fun thing to do, just browse around.  I guarantee you you're going to look at some of these nanodegree programs and go,  yeah, no, I want to do that.  Udacity.com slash twit.  This is how you get $100,000 plus tech career in just three months.  Udacity.com slash twit.  All right, Stacey, how many cubits would it take to crack a 4,096-bit RSA private key?  Oh, 4,096.  Oh, no, you can do 1024 if you want.  That's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a 2,048-bit RSA.  2048 is great.  2048 is great.  You can actually, so in 2019, Google and someone from Sweden's Royal Institute of Technology  figured out they could do it with just 20 million quantum bits.  Oh, 20 million.  That's 20 million.  Now, how many do we have?  20 million.  How many do we have so far?  Well, 256.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, good.  I feel safe.  But hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is a two-pronged answer to this.  One is to get the exact number into complete Shor's algorithm for encryption.  But there's another way to do it where it's kind of like probabilistic computing,  where you get close, but maybe you go about it a slightly different way.  And the Chinese in 2020, they found a way to use D-Wave's quantum computer  to factorize large integers and bypass Shor's algorithm completely.  And they think they can do that with, hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  A MacBook Pro?  Back to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A MacBook Pro.  No, 89 noisy qubits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Noisy qubits.  That's a lot less than 20 million qubits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but that was only factoring RSA 768.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  By the way, I used to use 4096.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's why I asked about that.  And I now use a much stronger elliptic curve.  So in other words, while people are talking about there's a potential threat  with these quantum computers, we're kind of still far away from anything to worry about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But now NIST has, this is why I go to those events.  This is, those are the NIST is the National Institute of Standards and Technology.  They are.  They have a quantum proof encryption working group that should come out with  Oh yeah, they're working on this right now.  Yeah.  In 2024.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm using curve 25519 right now.  And it's, I think it's not quantum proof, of course, but I think it's a good,  it's kind of what I should be using for now.  And as anybody, and it's, you know, there's, it's easy as you can do it fast.  It's not a tough thing to do.  I have a feeling in the long run, it's going to, you know, at some point,  maybe not in my lifetime, there will be an 80 million qubit.  Maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I like we're at kind in our chat, you qubits keep quiet or I'll go through  their warm hole and quiet you down myself.  Curve 25519 is very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  And by the way, yes, I was going to do it and I decided not to.  Lord, what's a qubit?  Just a callback, just a callback, just a callback.  That's all.  We don't have to go any farther.  Google's do not be evil motto goes to court.  Three fired software engineers claim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I did see this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Three fired software engineers claim Google's don't be evil clause of its code of conduct  amounts to a contractual obligation.  They filed a lawsuit in Santa Clara County where Google is in superior court,  claiming the search giant fired them in 2019 because of their activism around Google's  involvement with Customs and Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement during  the Trump administration.  They had organized fellow employees to speak out against immigration policies,  released a petition signed by 1495 Googlers as well as 94 other supporters calling for an end  to Google's involvement with a practice they viewed as unethical.  Google they argued was doing something evil and as a result they violated the code of conduct  which amounts according to this suit to a contractual obligation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's hard to imagine how this gets very long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If it's true, the engineers activism was consistent with Google's own rules,  meaning the company may have fired them unjustly.  In other words, because the code of conduct said don't be evil,  they had the right to raise concerns over what they viewed as an evil practice.  That seems right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Did Google change this law of mantra from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe that's why because this was in 2019.  But you're right, Jeff, I don't know what a judge is going to say.  Because show me the statute that defines evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, in our new Sharia law in America, maybe it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I got a hunch they're going to get paid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The code of conduct also says, and this is in the lawsuit,  and if you have a question or ever think that one of your fellow Googlers  or the company as a whole may be falling short of our commitment,  don't be evil, don't be silent.  So they say, look, this is in the code of conduct.  We were told to raise a ruckus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which was always the point about it, that it was an opportunity to question  anything the company did to keep the company honest.  What was FACI doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, the company said they had fired them not because of that.  And this is, by the way, it's strange how this keeps coming up,  because they violated the company's data security policies.  That's why they fired Timnit Gebru.  That's why they fired her colleague.  I can't remember her name as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Margaret Mitchell?  Mitchell, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She wrote Gone with the Wind, but I think she also worked at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I was like, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She was married to an attorney general, but also worked at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow, there's a lot of Margaret Mitchells in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the NLRB is investigating this as well to see if they were unlawfully discharged.  I think this is interesting.  Don't be evil in your code of conduct if you don't want to stand by it.  And they, by the way, did, I think Google did remove that from the code of conduct in 2018.  Although Alphabet has it in their code of conduct as do the right thing.  That's different than Don't Be Evil.  If I were Spike Lee, I'd be upset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Both are very subjective, but sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  As of September 2020, Google's code of conduct did in fact say, quote, remember,  don't be evil.  And if you see something that you think isn't right, speak up.  I think that's a good code of conduct, but maybe you shouldn't put it in writing.  That's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think they're going to get paid here.  You think so?  I think they're going to get paid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you don't think so, Jeff.  We'll find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think the judge is going to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's an interesting point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, if the company had done, if there's documents that say, don't be evil, for example,  and this violated that, then there'd be something to go on.  But I think this don't be evil is very general open to such.  How can you hold Google for a standard of evil that isn't statutory?  It just doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think the speak up thing is more to germane because it's like, I thought it was evil,  so I spoke up.  And then they were fired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But then you sue under whistleblower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I'm sure that's the NLRB's investigation probably.  Here's a weird one.  Remember Facebook bought Giphy.  Or is it Giffy?  Giffy, God.  Giffy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was like, the peanut butter company?  You almost had me again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is it Giffy or Giffy?  It's Giffy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the peanut butter is actually Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Facebook agreed to buy.  I can't say it.  Giffy.  Giffy.  In May of last year, for $400 million, regulators in the UK yesterday said  they have told Facebook to sell Giffy.  They didn't know.  They know they already bought it.  It closed.  It closed after finding, quote,  the takeover could reduce competition between social media platforms and increase Facebook's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's interesting how one country can decide this on behalf of the whole world.  Well, can they?  I don't know.  A company that's not based there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh.  I didn't think about that.  Facebook can always decide to not put things there.  A country, I mean, do they have sovereignty over their citizens  and what their citizens can access and do?  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what the law is on this.  It's what happens in a global market is going to have to be national.  This is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've been saying this though for like decades and we're still not there yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's been on the show for decades.  It's been that long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not only is the problem that Facebook's market power increases by denying or limiting  other platforms access to Giffy.  Giff.  Get it right.  Giff.  Giff.  Giff.  Or changing the terms of access to its Giff for competitive sites.  They also said the deal is anti-competitive because Giffy had an advertising business,  which Facebook shut down.  And they said, you know what?  You bought Giffy also because that advertising business competed with yours.  As a result, regulators said Facebook will also be required to reinstate  the innovative advertising service Giffy offered before the merger.  I've got to go to Discord to see how they feel about Giffy and animated Giff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not a Giff.  It's a Giff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right.  Wait, wait, really?  So the consen- so we've all reached consensus that is G-Giff?  Hard G Giff?  I'm a soft G person myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm a soft G person when it comes to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my God.  Why are we still debating this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I don't debate it.  I just say it because I'm a grown man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the question is, I will go with what the company said is his name, right?  Because-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they don't have a right to determine root.  Really?  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Unless they're right.  No, no, because it's a company name.  There is no word Giffy.  Let's see what it says on the YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We are looking at how to pronounce the name of this American online database and search engine.  That's off the table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The CEO of Giffy calls it Hard G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  This is the creepiest voice I've ever heard.  It's English with Julie.  What is happening?  Giffy, Giffy, pretty straightforward.  Giffy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay, okay, okay.  All right.  So that's the company.  But if Julie says Giffy-  The person that came up with the actual file, I thought they pronounced it as soft-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They pronounce it GIF, but it's short for Graphics Interchange Format.  And graphics is a hard G.  Graphic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How do you pronounce giraffe?  Giraffe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I went to Wingate University, but apparently it's supposed to be Wingate University.  Wingate.  Yeah, we can talk about Carnegie and Carnegie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wingate.  All right, Giffy.  I'm going to say Giffy because I don't like the guy who developed the Giffy format.  So if he thinks it's GIF, I'm going to say Giff.  And actually it is relevant for the pronunciation of Giffy,  regardless of how you pronounce Giff or Giff, because that's a company name.  And the guy who founded it says it's Giffy.  That's fair enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here, you ready?  You know what he says?  What?  Quote, at Giffy, we know there's only one Giff and it's peanut butter.  Alex Chung, founder and CEO of Giffy, said in a press release,  if you're a soft G, please visit GIF.com.  If you're a hard G, thank you.  We know you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow.  Giffy.  Smug much, dude?  Giffy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In any case, it became meta for a short while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I don't know.  Does this mean if the UK says you must have asked, do they have to?  I guess.  I mean, if they want to be in the UK, I don't know.  This is fascinating.  I don't know.  So that's a number of them is in the UK.  I think it just thumbed their nose and say, make us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  It's like, we're a US company.  Make us.  What are you going to do?  And then they're going to say, well, you can't be in the UK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what the UK did do this week that was so exciting?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They passed their cybersecurity law.  It resembles a lot of California's SB 327.  It's a cybersecurity device law, says no hard-coded passwords, no default passwords.  Yes.  All right.  It provides an expiration date for security updates on connected devices at the point of sale.  This is fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  The California law does not do that last bit.  That's where the UK law kind of boosts out.  And I've been calling for this for years.  So when you buy something that's connected, you should be able to say,  look on the box and be like, I have five years of security updates.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's really great.  Yeah, that's nice.  That's really great.  The National Labor Relations Board, speaking of the NLRB, has reordered  a new election at Amazon's Bessemer, Alabama site.  They said, you guys really messed with this.  And you're going to have to have a second union election.  Did you see John Oliver's thing on union busting?  It was quite good a few months ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I haven't seen him in a long time.  YouTube is just getting better and better with the recommendations from me.  I love it.  We know everybody wants to watch John Oliver, except for Aunt Pruitt.  So we will not push that to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The union said Amazon's intimidation and interference prevented workers from  having a fair say in whether they wanted a union in their workplace.  Amazon says it's disappointing the NLRB has now decided that those votes should not count.  Our employees have always had the choice of whether or not to join a union.  They overwhelmingly chose not to earlier this year.  In fact, that was true.  One thousand seven hundred ninety eight to seven thirty eight against.  Wow, that was what they say that Amazon did.  Among other things, installing their own mailbox to collect ballots.  Amazon security guards had access to the mailbox,  giving some workers the impression Amazon controlled the results.  One of the things companies do is they have mandatory onsite meetings with anti-union  representatives who explain why unions a terrible idea and you got to go mandatory.  Oh, that's a lot of companies do that.  Really?  Yeah.  Again, John Oliver had a good piece on it.  Yeah, I'll check it out.  They don't violate the law.  They don't violate the law.  You know, you kind of try to stay within the letter of the law, maybe not the spirit quite.  But that was a big deal.  Remember when Alabama voted no, Amazon said, see, everybody's happy at Amazon film.  The centers, we don't need unions.  They hate unions.  They do just like Starbucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They hate them.  I worked for a couple.  I worked for advanced publications, which is Cunninghast and Newhouse newspapers.  And there was one union newsroom in the Cleveland Plain dealer.  And the others were given in newsrooms.  If you weren't union, you were given a lifetime job guarantee.  Well, come the troubles of the internet, they had to redefine life.  And I had to say, well, it's the life of the company, not your life.  And we're going to close the company and then reopen it to something new.  And so, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's that Brett Taylor?  Yeah.  Sorry.  Squirrel.  That wasn't the delayed reaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You talked about that like two hours ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's Brett Taylor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what I tried to say.  That's wild.  So he is now the chair at Twitter and the co-CEO of Salesforce.  I know him from back in the day.  He created FriendFeed, which I loved.  He worked on Gmail and Google Maps.  This guy was a great guy.  CTO of Facebook.  Oh, that Brett Taylor.  You're getting good with your callbacks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I tried to tell you, but you wouldn't listen to me.  You just steamrolled over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I knew the name and I thought, oh, it can't be that Brett Taylor.  He's a computer programmer, but I guess he's also a good business person.  He was a founder of Quip.  That's how he got to Salesforce.  They bought Quip.  He's a great guy, great coder.  I'm pretty sure we've interviewed him on our shows.  I feel like I know him.  He's too big for us now.  Not now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What's this theory about co-CEOs being a bad idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it just never works out.  That was me.  I'm just thinking about, can we name any co-CEOs that have been a good idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The most famous is Oracle.  Right?  Rim worked because those two guys were founders.  They did not work.  Look how well Rim's doing.  Don't you have a BlackBerry in your future?  No, actually, it's interesting.  They renamed themselves BlackBerry, but now they own QNX.  Bazelies or whatever his name is, they've left.  Deamonism.  They're back to single CEOs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At Salesforce, Benioff is clearly the boss.  Benioff takes over any room he's in.  I think this is a way probably to say, this is my right hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's trying to get out, so maybe he has to do this double thing for a while to keep the investors happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's really interesting because Brett's a great coder and a great product guy.  To see him as a business guy is an interesting thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's been in this role.  He's been at a high level for quite a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, he left Google in 2007 to become a VC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The normal people are screaming, the nerds are taking over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I guess that's what it is in a way.  And that's where my surprise lies.  It's not somebody from Bain Capital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's interesting because I think we're entering to this service slash API economy.  I think there's a lot of issues that need to be technically solved when doing these business deals.  I think having an understanding of that will give companies an advantage.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, look at Sam Lesson we had on the show last week.  Oh, that was so good.  He was great.  I watched earlier on.  There's a perfect example of a guy who's both a coder and a business guy,  and obviously a very successful VC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, we glanced around too.  The number of Indian-born CEOs in technology keeps growing.  Yeah.  Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadella.  And now Agrawal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Agrawal.  CTO, CEO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, go look up at that.  Is Thai still a thing?  Because if it is, I guarantee you, there's Indian CEOs everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  What's Thai?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Indus American something.  It's an organization.  Oh, okay.  Networking organization for South Asians.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, that Brett Taylor.  I like him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Jesus.  It came out of nowhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, there was another story about him being named CCO Salesforce, and I thought,  wait a minute, I know who that is.  I should have moved that up and run down.  I'm getting old.  That's all it is.  It really is.  How about we do one of them?  You know what I'm talking about?  Press a button.  He doesn't know what to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Google change log.  I'll press a button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's time for the change log.  Google announces a grab bag of new features for Android for the end of 2021.  This is actually, you know, Google's policy these days lately is to hold features back  and ship them over gradual period of time.  New widgets, new Android Auto features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Could they fix Android Auto first for the six?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe that's the fix.  Fix Bluetooth and Android 12.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, updates for Google Assistant, Google Photos, big blog post from Google.  So this is like all in one change log.  Get festive this holiday season with new Android features.  This just came out.  I haven't had a chance to read it.  Keep your family on track this season with Family Bell.  What's that?  It's an alarm for the whole family.  Lots of noxious.  Family members will be able to set bells on their own devices so they can stay on top of  their individual goals too.  But with Family Bell on your Android point home speaker smart display,  bells and notifications will go off throughout the house when it's time for important moments

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  throughout the day.  I may need to implement this.  We struggle with this in the pro house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, you know, right?  Time for dinner or time to get ready for school, that kind of thing.  They're all doing their own thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I may need to implement this because I usually have to yell.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When I was a kid, my mom got so tired of yelling,  come down for dinner that she got a bell that she would ring.  So this is just the modern equivalent.  You have a Pavlov.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My mouth still waters every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We click the lights on and downstairs for our daughter's room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She knows that's a good idea.  It's a lot better.  It's much more civilized than going,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that was quite the IOT moment.  That was an IOT humble brag.  No other parent can do that, but I can because my house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How do you do that?  Do you give it a voice command or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are multiple ways.  We use Lutron, a Lutron Pico upstairs and then the Google display for.  So there's a button on the display.  She's in.  Yeah, we have a physical Pico remote for her bedroom.  And then if she's in the family room, we just use the Google display.  There's no toggle on the voice.  And it's a big complaint I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One of our listeners, I don't know how I figured this out.  Roberto, I'm lying in bed on my birthday in the morning  and my echo suddenly says, you have a message from Roberto.  And he comes on in my house and says, happy birthday.  Thank God no one else I know has figured out how to do this.  Roberto, you're smart.  Oh, happy belated.  First of all, I don't.  But it was like, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's great and creepy at the same time.  Yeah, exactly.  It's like, how did you figure that out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So maybe he knows about this family bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Know a lot more about that encryption than you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't understand how he did it.  Get more out of your favorite Google app.  And by the way, and then the Amazon, you know how it has a light that pulses if  you've got a notification?  Pulsed until I said, all right, what's the notification?  Roberto says, happy birthday.  All right, here's another one.  Get more out of your favorite Google apps with widgets.  Home screen displaying a photo of mother and child from the Google Photos  People and Pets widget.  Oh, it's because I always have had a Google Photos widget.  But now you can have a People and Pets widget.  OK, you can have a Google Play Books widget.  You might like that, Stacey, because I know you like books.  You'll have a YouTube Music widget.  You can have holiday tunes in it.  And then the Google People and Pets widget.  You can relive festive memories with Google Photos.  I'm a big fan of memories in general.  But now these will also, among other things, birthday memories,  special event memories, New Year's Eve, Halloween, graduations.  When you're driving home for the holidays, simply going to the store for  some last minute groceries, a suite of updates enhances just how helpful  Android could be on the road unless it doesn't work at all.  Reply to messages in the car with a tap.  You can set Android Auto to launch automatically when you connect your  Android phone to your compatible car.  Compatible car not included.  To stay connected on every drive once you're on the road.  So you should try, though.  Maybe with this update, maybe that's one of the things they'll fix.  That would be nice.  That's what I'm hoping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I also am wasting 20 bucks to buy an actual Google USB cable.  So I'm trying to eliminate everything I can.  Nice people, nice listeners sent me links to a Kickstarter thing that  allows you to use wireless even if your car requires wired.  Thinking that might fix it, but I don't think so.  I think it's something on the six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Once you're on the road, Android Auto helps you get things done so you can  stay focused on the road.  Smart reply options are coming soon to messaging.  I love it.  And I actually I get this with Apple's CarPlay, but I presume it's available  in Android Auto where it'll say you have a message from Abby.  Shall I read it?  And it reads it.  Would you like to reply?  And I can dictate a reply.  Oh, yeah.  Would you like to send it?  I love that feature.  I used to get that when Android Auto worked.  That's really great.  Yeah.  You can listen to your favorite music with a single tap of the new always  on play button right next to the home button.  Coming coming soon, you'll be able to use your voice to search for music  faster in your media apps on Android Auto.  So a bunch of new features.  App permissions are getting a private boost, a privacy boost.  Get notified when app permissions are removed.  So apparently, after a while, the permissions will reset and you'll have to  go through that process again to give them permissions again.  Your device will automatically turn off runtime permissions,  which allow apps to access data or take actions on your behalf  for downloaded apps you haven't used in a while.  You can always turn them back on, but they'll expire if you don't use them.  That's good, right?  That's good.  I forgot I'd left that on.  Share the love with new emoji kitchen combinations.  Have you played with emoji kitchen?  No.  Let's you take an emoji and fix it up, add to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wouldn't other people not see it then because it's not standard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Becomes a sticker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's not an emoji, it's a sticker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's no longer.  Yeah, basically you're making a sticker with an emoji, I guess.  All right.  So those are some of the new features.  Boy, that was one item in the changelog that turned out to be a great many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This changelog could go on for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Long time, hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google's rolling.  Torturing me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hear Stacey's stomach growling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did you know my shoes are made in Maine?  Where?  In Maine.  In his mouth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And he got it off quickly again.  That just blows my mind.  I'm serious.  Well, how long does it take you to take your shoes off?  I have to suck my belly in.  Oh, yeah.  He's wedged in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I do special limbering exercises so I can whip my shoes off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Leo does Pilates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  Very good for you.  Part of my problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google's rolling out Android digital car key support to Pixel 6, Galaxy S21, and select BMWs.  That's the problem, Jeff.  You need a BMW.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Android TV 12.  Not just driver on the road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a BMW.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do you?  I love BMWs.  Do you have a Tesla and a BMW?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  Oh, you're obnoxious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've been told I'm obnoxious, but not for that.  Which BMW do you have?  What kind of BMW do you have?  It's blue.  I like the blues.  The 5 Series.  5 Series.  Very nice.  Good choice.  Ant's giving you a thumbs up.  5 Series.  Android TV 12 is now available.  Not sure if it's going to get to the Chromecast with Google TV.  And Chrome OS 96 is out for your Chromebook with camera tweaks, nearby share in Android apps, and more.  So go fiddle with your Chromebook.  There's a new scan tab where the QR code option is now located.  Oh, it automatically detects edges.  So it's really better for scanning.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow, I'm at 94.  Oh, yeah.  Well, get going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a new note.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's up to date.  It's not says Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it's Chrome OS.  Oh, you're looking at Chrome.  Yeah, look at Chrome OS.  No, I'm looking at Chromebook.  I'm looking at OS.  Chrome OS 96 is rolling out.  Maybe it hasn't gotten here yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rolling out.  Well, it's skipping one.  I'm at 94.0.  Or 606.124.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that, believe it or not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe they just didn't want you to complain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's probably it.  Not for Jeff.  No.  Don't give it to Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's got opinions.  That's the Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, Leo.  I stepped on your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We'll do it.  No, no, I don't care.  I couldn't care less.  We'll do a whole bunch of quick ones  because there's a lot of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Tesla story?  You don't like the Tesla story?  What's the Tesla story?  Up to line quick takes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Model Y breaks constantly.  And by breaks, I don't mean it's broken.  I mean the brakes.  Stops the vehicle.  Stop the vehicles.  Yeah, people are starting to complain about various bits.  Even Elon said, guys, don't rush.  We've got plenty of time.  Don't rush when you're making our vehicles.  So maybe the factory...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It seems like a software problem in this case.  It thinks that it's got barriers that it doesn't have.  I had that problem with my Model X all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  At least it could play by that all the time.  It would think...  Because it has, as many cars do,  the auto stop if you're about to run into something.  And she'd be driving down the road and all of a sudden...  Because it thinks something's in the road.  But there's nothing.  It seems.  Scary.  As much as I love cars...  You can turn that off.  So it's scary.  Yeah, that's not good.  A little controversy over 23andMe.  They did a SPAC, as you remember.  We talked about that some months ago.  They're earmarking cash from that SPAC for drug development.  They want to use what they know about your genome  to help drug companies develop...  Now, see, this is an interesting question.  Maybe, Jeff, you don't think this is such a bad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think it's a bad thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By querying its database,  23andMe can find causal links between genetic variations and disease.  Remember, they collect not only the genetic information,  but they also collect your phenotype,  these questions you answer all the time in questionnaires.  And they're using that information to develop new treatments.  Among its findings so far,  evidence of genetic variants that bolster the immune system  and decrease the risk of cancer.  They actually have two immuno-oncology drugs under development.  Through GlaxoSmithKline, one's in the clinical trial stage.  Does anybody think that's bad?  I think that's good, but privacy people say,  well, wait a minute, that's my genetic...  But this is for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's the same people who got mad  because Amazon didn't pay them to use their devices for Sidewalk.  That's how I think of it.  It's the same people who are mad because they're like,  well, I paid them my money to get my gene tested.  And they do keep your spit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, they keep your stuff.  So it's not...  I mean, I don't know.  There must be a process thanks to GDPR and the California privacy law.  There must be a process to say, hey, destroy my genetic info.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're a citizen of the EU or California, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Same difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's funny.  I don't know what that means at all.  It's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you from Texas now?  Good Lord, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Are you Europeans?  That, Brett Taylor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, good.  This is a good one.  Here's a good one.  If you trick people into visiting a malicious web page,  there are 150 models of HP printers that can be compromised.  Once they're in the printer, as you know, Stacey on IoT,  they can use that printer to attack your network.  Steal information and infiltrate.  Problem is, printers, we don't think of them as IoT devices,  but they in fact are because they're on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lexmark actually just launched their own IoT platform  based on everything it learned about printers over the last two or three decades.  Lexmark looks like a good platform.  The printer company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're still around?  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Didn't know that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  An Indonesian court has given the government permission  to pull the plug on the internet if it should feel threatened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who's pulling the plug on the internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The Indonesian government.  Indonesia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Indonesia has been cracking down on tech platforms for some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cracking down is one way to put it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  They restricted internet access during independence protests and demonstrations in Papua.  Now really the government has all the power they need to simply shut down the internet  or any individual service, whatever.  They feel threatened.  So that's not good.  A new rule will allow debt collectors to track you down on social media.  Federal regulators in the US.  They're surely doing it anyway.  Well, now it's official.  This is a change to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's because everyone's ignoring the phone calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't even find the phone number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is actually a Trump era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I, however, do have one.  I have to explain to the kids what this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It seems like you would shame you even.  We stopped them from calling at certain times that were problematic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now creditors can slide into your DMs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, with every other spammer there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They are not allowed to post something that can be seen by the general public, so that's good.  Or by your friends and followers.  But they can send you private messages asking that you add them as a friend or contact.  That's hilarious.  But they do have to say we are collecting a debt and you can't opt out.  So this is all right.  This doesn't seem too bad.  There is a bill which probably will be  died in Congress, but House and Senate Democrats have reintroduced the Stopping Grinch Bots Act,  which cracks down on scalper run bots, which buy up things like graphics cards.  Or PlayStation 5.  Concert tickets?  Or concert tickets, yeah.  Paul Tonko from New York, Senator Blumenthal, Schumer, and Lou Jan  will crack down on cybergrinches using bots technologies to quickly buy up whole inventories  of popular holiday toys and sell them to parents at higher prices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But how do you crack down on transactions, bot transactions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I think probably if you have a law that punishes it, it helps, right?  You don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You write a press release saying you wrote this bill and you hope you get two votes for it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it's got a good name, Stopping Grinch Bots Act.  Which is hard to say.  I got to tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it Grinch or Drinch?  Grinch.  Newt Gingrich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, you should learn statistics.  I'm just saying.  It's a useful skill.  Apparently there's a person going around.  His name is Alex Berenson.  Do you know who that is?  He's a Substack guy, wrote a post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Former New York Times, but living off the fact that he's former New York Times, he's far out on the edge of Blackwood Bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Posted a Substack saying, this sounds scary, vaccinated English adults under 60 are dying at twice the rate of unvaccinated people the same age.  You know, if you don't know statistics, you might go, okay.  But then, thank goodness for data scientists, because a guy named Jeffrey Morris has published a rebuttal which says, in fact, English adults under 60 who have watched the 1984 Ghostbusters movie are dying at twice the rate of people who've watched the 2021 Ghostbusters movie the same age.  Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they have it for six months.  The pandemic's wrongest man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So if you believe that watching the old Ghostbusters movie is more likely to kill you than watching the new one, I've got a Substack newsletter.  I thought this was a parody.  At first when I read it I thought, well that's silly, and then I realized.  Somebody making fun of statistical stupidity.  At the very end he says this is exactly the same statistical error that Berenson's making.  Nicely done.  Yes.  I don't understand it myself, but you know, statistics.  Satya Nadella sold half of his shares in Microsoft.  That's a lot.  That's a lot to sell.  But we figured it out on Windows Weekly thanks to Mary Jo Foley.  $300 million worth of stock because the state of Washington, your state Stacey, is about to change its capital gains rules.  I guess they didn't tax capital gains before.  I don't know.  And the 7% tax for long-term capital gains starts beginning of next year.  For anything exceeding $250,000 a year, 7% of $300 million is $21 bajillion.  So I can understand now why he's cashing in.  Plus he might have a little yacht.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But he doesn't want to help the homeless or pay for roads?  It's a perfectly reasonable tax strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you can't write off the state taxes on your federal taxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's right.  We're in a high-tax state.  Don't like that.  Congratulations to our friend Neil Dash.  He saved the floppy disk that he got from the Prince folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  His wife must be ready to kill him for saving all this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I guess when Prince changed his name from Prince to the artist formerly known as Prince with that weird symbol,  they sent floppy disks out to journalists with a font on the floppy disk that had one character.  That.  That's the beautiful part.  So that they could use Prince's symbol in their stories.  Of course it didn't take long before somebody, a British journalist I think, said,  we'll just call him the artist formerly known as Prince and that'll solve that.  Neil Dash had one of these floppies.  And he brought it over to the folks at Adafruit because he didn't have a floppy drive.  And they happened to have a PowerBook 180, a high-end 1992 model.  It is missing its ball, however.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Somebody played with it.  Somebody less than desirable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cattle like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But they were able to not only recover it, but then to post it on archive.org so it is never again to be lost.  His purpleness will be very happy.  This is the kind of thing that should go on the archive.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just thought this was the kind of thing the Internet's for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  They actually have the image of the 3.5-inch floppy that was given to the press when he changed his name.  Thank you, Neil Dash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The kind of thing Brett Taylor might do.  That Brett Taylor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I got to say, and I'd love to end the show with obituaries because people are dying.  One of the greats, and a guy I had huge respect for named Jim Warren passed away.  He launched the West Coast Computer Fair in the 1970s.  There's a picture, which the Times did not have, I wish they had found it, of him roller skating through the floor.  I used to go to these fairs.  He was legendary.  Roller skating around on the floor of it.  It was, I think, the first computer trade show, the West Coast Computer Fair, in the 70s.  He was the editor of Dr. Dobbs.  You know Dr. Dobbs.  Dr. Dobbs Journal of Computer Calisthenics and Orthodontia.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I used to subscribe.  One of the great computer magazines of all time.  And founded the West Coast Computer Fair.  Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak showed the early Apple there in 1976.  Here's Steve at his booth at the first West Coast Computer Fair, debuting the Apple II.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  When I saw this in the rundown yesterday, or whenever it was when I looked at it,  I felt bad because I'm like, I have no idea who this person is.  And I know I'm not the only person.  Oh, nobody does.  Nobody does.  But why is that?  Why don't these folks get their flowers while they're on earth?  You know what I'm saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, Jim did.  Jim was a great guy and everybody loved Jim.  He's passed away at the age of 85.  But you know, I'm going to be dead soon too.  So you'll tell the world, right?  I got you.  Yeah, let them know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I used to think the only real fringe benefit of working for a newspaper is that your obit would run in it.  But they're all dying faster than I am.  I know.  Shoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Shoot.  I got you covered.  He is, if you're interested in the early history of the internet, John Markoff, the great John Markoff,  wrote a book called What the Dormouse Said, How the 60s Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry.  And he did quote Warren and talked about Warren's story in there and that.  So if you read these old books about the history of Silicon Valley and so forth, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But I mean, even in school.  Oh, they don't teach these.  These names don't come up in school.  They always say, you know, Steve Jobs.  They never even said Steve Wozniak, quite honestly.  Yeah.  You know, why is that?  Something's wrong there.  Well, I think also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've only got a limited amount of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I don't think Jim Warren invented anything.  There's lots of people like Adam Osborne and Jim Morrow that you probably never heard of either who did, in fact, invent early personal computers.  Yeah, that's kind of my job is to remind people.  That's certainly one of the things.  In fact, really, one of the reasons I started Twit was I wanted to get some of these people on camera, sit them down, talk to them before.  We never did get Jim Warren on camera, I'm sad to say.  But that was always kind of one of the agendas was to kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who was the famous PR guy to Silicon Valley?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know what I mean?  Yes, I do know.  You mean I just the name escapes me.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Shoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Shoot.  Shoot.  Shoot.  That guy who doesn't like the word crap has now left the building.  No more.  No more.  Let's take a break.  Pics of the week.  We're going to wrap this up in just a moment.  But first, a word from Cashfly.  This show is quite literally brought to you by Cashfly's CDN content delivery network.  We've been using it practically since Twit started.  In the early days of Twit, that was the big conundrum.  How do I get the shows to people in a timely fashion without breaking the bank?  Matt Levine of Cashfly came to me and said, I can help him.  We've been using Cashfly ever since.  In fact, I love them so much because when we went to them, we were so nervous when we decided to do video of all of our shows.  We thought that's going to triple the quadruple the amount of storage, the amount of bandwidth we're going to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How soon into making Twit did you add video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Probably just a couple.  Oh, add video.  I thought you were going to ask about Cashfly because they did audio for a while.  That was my next question.  Adding video, when did we do that?  2009, John says.  John is our archivist.  So about four years in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so that's when the real crunch came.  Certainly from a bandwidth point of view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I was terrified.  We went to Cashfly and said, we have something we want to tell you.  We're going to quadruple the amount of bandwidth we're using.  And they said, cool.  They are so, they're such a great partner.  Now they do streaming, ultra low latency streaming.  And I'm not talking WebRTC.  I'm talking about real low one second delay or less.  And it's just great.  They offer an HTML5 player.  There's an SDK so you could put it on mobile, on websites, on applications,  whatever platform you want to be on.  Of course, Cashfly is completely global.  See those dots?  That's their points of presence.  50 points of presence all over the world.  Their low latency network means your video streams will stream quickly.  No buffering anywhere.  You have viewers regardless of where they are.  And man, you can, it scales beautifully.  You could deliver to more than a million users concurrently,  as well as ingest thousands of synchronous streams.  I remember when the first 100,000 viewer video stream happened  and we were just like a gog, 100,000 people simultaneously.  You could do a million, a million.  Plus their platform is designed for transmuxing thousands of streams simultaneously  with live failover.  They can ingest RTMP, RTMP-S.  SRT, all formats to deliver ultra low latency SLDP and HLS streams.  And they could do it all simultaneously.  And of course, the thing I love about Cashfly,  they will build a solution based on you.  You're unique and Cashfly can make you a solution that's just right  for your traffic patterns, for your budget.  And it's all built on their reliable, robust global network  with ingest and delivery wherever you need it  and the best support in the world.  And I can vouch for that.  They're fantastic.  They're always there when we need them.  Cashfly, it's the world's fastest, most reliable CDN  backed by a 100% SLA, up to five times faster than other CDNs.  100% SLA.  I love Cashfly.  They're also great citizens.  They've partnered with World Central Kitchen to serve 300,000 warm meals.  Good for you, Cashfly.  They pioneered the first anycast CDN infrastructure way back in 2002.  Their best hop technology automatically finds the fastest route to  and from customer origin across their global network of pops  for maximum performance and reliability.  Cashfly, come right now.  You can get a complimentary detailed analysis of your usage, your billing.  See if you can save.  I bet you could save as much as 20% with Cashfly.  Go to twit.cashfly.com.

Stacy Higginbotham, what's your pick of the week?  Ta-da!  This is the Fi collar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, I don't know if a dog collar is the best thing for a pick of the week,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  but okay.  Is that a dog collar?  Let her finish.  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It is a connected dog collar.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a, it's connected to Bluetooth on my phone and then it has a GPS ability.  Oh, see, I want this.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But always these GPS tracking collars have been too big for the doggy.  So my dog is 24 pounds.  Does she hear the doggy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's see if she's here.  We heard her earlier.  Is she over there?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, she's on her little blanket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There she is.  I see her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  She's a little puppy.  So she's about 20 pounds and she's mostly fur and she can wear this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is much bigger.  I've got her other collar here.  It's not too heavy.  Yeah, it's a little bigger, but it's still, she can wear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the point, right?  She can wear it.  It's not too heavy.  Because don't you always want to know where she is and what she's up to and what do they do when you're not around?  I know where she is.  She's usually wherever I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She doesn't go outside.  Does she not go outside?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She has a dog door, but she doesn't like going outside without me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's old too.  She used to escape a lot though.  It would have been good then.  But what I can show you is she doesn't like going on walks in the morning, but I, on the app.  Oh, see, that's what I want to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Like I want to see how they walk around, where they go.  I think that's what I want to see.  That's so cool.  Okay.  So that's where she went.  So there's a GPS, but how does it get the information back to you?  There's a bridge that plugs in to my Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it'll either talk to my phone or to that bridge and share data from the caller to back to my phone.  And then when they get nearby.  It saves it.  Okay.  So you can't see where she is in real time or can you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I can actually.  I can turn on the GPS.  I can turn it on.  I can turn it on.  I can turn it on.  I can turn it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can actually, I can turn on the GPS and see where she is in real time.  And I get notifications.  I'm getting shorter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's nice to laugh at short people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That tight shot.  I'm like, what is he doing towards the end of the show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just like to see just slippery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just, you can't help just slipping down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I didn't notice it until I saw it on the camera.  I'm like, what the heck?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You want to see me take my shoe off?  No.  Just like that.  Instantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't think he reaches down to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sorry, Stacey.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Can you use it to track your talk?  Stacey, I am so sorry.  I'm so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like the child who brings the crappy stuff to show and tell.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's the other way around.  You're the adult.  We're the children.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it also tracks your dog's sleep.  And I like this because my dog sleeps with her eyes open, which is so creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sleep tracking for a dog.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So my dog last night slept for 11.2 hours and she's got 6.2 hours of naps during the day.  That is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So 17 hours a day.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So you get little rankings for your dog.  I will say note that there are two downsides to this.  One, there's a subscription because of the cellular component.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, there is a cellular connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  Oh, sorry.  That's when it's that's the real time.  Sorry.  Oh, there is.  Oh, nice.  It's yeah.  It's a sorry.  There is cellular service there.  I just realized.  I'm like, oh, yeah.  So there's a subscription, a monthly subscription.  Is it how much?  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's worth it.  You know what?  If you love your pup, that's not a big deal.  That's fine.  Okay.  And what is it?  It says it's on LTE-M.  What is LTE-M?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's LTE-CAT-M.  So it's not the fat LTE.  It's the lower bandwidth LTE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Low power long distance.  Okay.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  Most LTE is long distance, but yes.  It says it reaches 30% farther than normal LTE networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that's cool.  Okay.  I mean, I'm just reading the website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then the other downside to note is that the, you know, how I talked about Mozilla's  privacy not included thing, the FI tracks all your data and then some.  It just wants to know where you are.  So it can tell you things like your pet is not near you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So yeah, it has escape detection.  That's so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  When you get it, you set a little boundary around your home and it's pretty narrow boundary.  It doesn't cover my whole property.  Thank you.  And whenever the dog leaves the geofence, I get an alert, which is nice.  Usually I'm with the dog.  It's actually whenever I'm not with the dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I want to get a dog now because this is great.  I got two.  Yeah.  Thank you.  How much, so battery life, do you have to charge it every night?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so I take my dog's collar off at night usually.  So I charge it.  I've had it for about a week and a half and I charged it like once a week.  Oh, that's not bad.  Why do you, why do you take it off?  She's got these jellies, all her tags and I know you have the things, but she's, yeah.  And she likes to get under the bed and she gets, it's kind of a process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We used to do that.  We used to take the dog's collar off.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I never think about that.  I've been wanting this forever and we, you know, we've tried putting Bluetooth tags.  Bluetooth tags, yeah.  I've always thought this would be a great product.  This is cool.  150 bucks, which is not bad.  It's waterproof.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you can, let's see, the one I just showed you is $112 at Chewy right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Man, I got to get a dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It attracts your dog's steps if you care for that and it ranks them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hold on.  Does it count the four legs and divides by four?  How does it count steps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think it counts all the feet because she walks more than I do.  Her feet are way, like, I mean, but she's smaller than I am too.  She takes way more steps than I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But yeah, I don't know.  Of course this isn't going to prevent her from getting stolen for instance, but it's  just for getting lost.  This is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think anyone wants to steal my dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, but if they, if I got to, like I always wanted to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got a cute little pug or a Frenchy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  French bulldog.  The bulldogs.  They get stolen.  I'll get a mutt.  I'm going to go to the rescue and get a mutt.  That's the way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the right way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely.  And it's a very sturdy collar and they come in different, like you can buy fancier collars  if you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And clip it in.  Okay.  Yeah, it looks pretty good.  Fi t-r-y-f-i dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, try Fi.  So there you go.  Good pick.  I guess that's an IOT device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's connected to my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's got a freaking cellular modem in it.  Are you going to fight me on this, Leo?  No, no, I'm agreeing.  I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is.  Look at that look on her face.  I'm scared of her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay.  I'm totally scared of her.  Mr. Ant Pruitt.  Oh no, I guess I'll do Jeff first for the number and then we'll do Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Jeff, your number of the week.  I don't much like my number of the week.  Let's see.  Have you been to the mobile phone museum before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  No.  All right, let's try that one.  So all the kinds of mobile phones you'd ever want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's have a little rundown.  Who runs this?  Memory lane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, I've had a lot of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh yeah, you probably have them all back in the window in you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a phone I had that was the skinniest, thinnest little phone I've been trying to

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  remember.  The J phone there now.  It'll be in here, bitch.  I had that too.  It was really cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a company that doesn't currently make phones.  It was some Japanese company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it was Sanyo.  Wow, this is cool.  Look at this.  Do they claim every phone ever?  No, I don't think so.  And their order seems somewhat random.  It is.  It is.  It is.  It is.  It is.  It is.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is.  It is.  It is.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is.  The official website of the Mobile Phone Museum, a charity with over 2100 individual models.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, so you could go, you could search by brand.  Let's see if they have any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have over 2000 unique models in the collection, but some are, they're still searching for  some iconic phones.  Yeah, this is not it.  They have collections.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, they missed mine.  One of mine, they missed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you can go by year, which is fun.  That's cool.  Nice.  It's a online museum.  History is calling the official website of the Mobile Phone Museum, a charity with over  2100 individual models.  Is there a location?  I don't know.  You can donate your phones too, which is fun.  I bet you I probably I probably could find something.  Yeah, you could.  Oh, they really want this one.  I remember this one.  Remember that spun around?  This is their most wanted.  Oh, that was a spin around.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  With 2000 models, but there's still many iconic phones.  Visit the most wanted page.  That's what I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they're unable to stay.  They stage exhibitions.  Yeah.  Which they're not doing right now, but that'd be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The tag, the tag, who are meridiest?  The Motorola Aura, the Nokia N950.  These are the most wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some of those were expensive.  Yeah, that's why.  Oh, the Vertu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, the Vertu.  Of course they want a Vertu.  I want the Mobira Senator.  This is for senators.  HTC Sooner.  Look at that.  That's classic Blackberry.  Wow.  They want Huawei made a Kentucky Fried Chicken phone.  They don't have that one either.  It's a pretty good set.  This is all they're missing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I like how they have a collection called the ugliest.  Let's see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The ugliest phones.  Is it all Blackberrys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it all Blackberries?  Because those things were hideous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  First best-selling James Bond phones.  Ugliest.  Oh, I had that Nokia.  I definitely had that one.  Ugly phones.  Wow.  Motorola Personal Phone 1992.  I had, wow.  I had this, the Nokia 3650.  See the dial?  That's ridiculous.  Is that ridiculous?  Yeah.  September 2002.  Yikes.  Yeah.  I remember that very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Thank goodness for evolution in phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How about the Toshiba TS211?  That's not that ugly.  Not that ugly.  Oh, I remember this.  The iKids.  In fact, I think I gave Henry this.  He promptly left it in his pocket to get it washed because he did not want to have a kids phone.  That a boy Hank.  It has little ears on it.  Oh, what's that?  I don't remember that.  The 7600.  Nokia 7600.  Nokia 7600.  Or the Nokia 7700.  This was Danger.  This was, oh look, Ashton Kutcher using one.  This is Danger Envy.  I know some guy who looks like Ashton Kutcher in a European town where they're watching.  Like the psychic?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, the Danger Psychic.  The Pauldy.  Oh, that's ugly.  Anyway, fun.  Good pick.  See?  No, that's a great pick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, why is that ugly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You like that?  You like the bling?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Samsung Diva?  Yeah.  I mean, it's probably, oh, fashion at least.  Part of their fashion collection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's just, I don't know.  Yeah, I mean, I don't think it's that ugly.  It's, you know, it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Meanwhile, one other number while we're at a little bonus here.  Jack Dorsey is worth $12.3 billion.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How is that possible?  Key and block.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He is the 174th richest person, according to Bloomberg's billionaires.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that makes me the 175th richest person.  I'm right behind him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ann Pruitt's sad news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I've been talking about the Hardheads and the football squad had a great run, but  they lost and the playoffs took a massive L against Foothill.  Foothill Falcons.  But they played hard.  They just, yeah, took it right in the nose.  And I just wanted to give them a shout out for that.  But they went pretty far.  Yep.  Made it to the semifinals.  That's nice.  I like it.  And then next up, I wanted to plug this week's Floss Weekly as we're featuring Ms. Lisa Lavasser.  I believe that's how you say her name.  ITD on that show.  And she was really dag gum good and touched on a lot of good points.  And if you're a member of Club Twit, you're really going to enjoy the bonus discussions.  Oh, OK.  We went a little long and got a little bit nervous about pushing Windows Weekly out.  Hey, never worry about that.  Just keep on going.  Oh, man.  It was such, such good conversation.  Me to be's knees.  Me to be Alliance is focusing on you, me, to business, to be, you know, instead of the  B2B stuff.  It was really good.  And lastly, I want to plug the five.  Oh, yeah, I had someone sent me a Christmas card.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Do you know who you are?  Because this was a fan that I bumped into at a store here locally that recognized me.  Oh, that's awesome.  So kind.  But thank you.  You know who you are.  But I want to plug this book, Five Love Languages, The Secret to Love that Lasts.  It's a classic.  I believe it's Gary Thompson.  Yeah, that's a classic.  Gary Chapman.  Gary Chapman.  That's a great book.  Check that book out.  It can't hurt to read it and understand it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because generally you have a different love language than your spouse.  Totally different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you got to know that so you know how to make your spouse happy.  Totally different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I love Queen Pruitt and I know she loves me, but boy.  She talks a different language.  Yep, two different languages.  Two different languages.  And I want to make sure I get it right.  I think that's a classic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that's a nice addition you got there.  That's pretty.  I like that.  You got high quality paper with deckled edges.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes.  Very fancy for someone like me.  But what I like about it is I don't particularly do a lot of self help books and things because  in my opinion a lot of them come off too woo-wee.  This one's very concrete.  Yeah, when I picked it up and read the first chapter I was like, okay, this is something  that I can totally understand and not a bunch of platitude stuff.  No.  Yeah, check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And if your spouse likes back rubs and you like a fine meal prepared in the French style  you just got to know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Or if you like me I just like time.  Yeah, time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't want to talk.  That's my problem.  I don't want to talk.  Just time.  I have to talk all week.  I don't like to talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Five love languages.  If we asked Lisa whether you like to talk or not what would she say?  She thinks I like to talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm with you Leo because I come off this show and no one in my family talks to me.  Yeah, you're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you have to understand that there are people who see that as love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo put her in a bad mood this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they don't think I'm mad.  They know I'm not mad.  They just know that I'm just tired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You need a waffle.  I don't blame you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I need a waffle and a book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I'm not.  I think we're introverts.  There's only so much human interaction we can handle before we just really run out of  steam.  We just lose our energy.  I agree with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't bug me man.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why we do the show for three and a half hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's the weirdest thing about presentational people, performers, is a lot of them are introverts.  That it's not at all unusual that we have this extrovert persona.  But really, as soon as that's done, I think that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I live it.  I know it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, it's been really fun hanging with you introverts.  Thank you Stacey.  You're the best.  Stacey on iot.com.  Subscribe to her newsletters.  Check out her events.

No.  There's nothing out there.  It's dark.  Not a real window.  Oh, you turn the lights off.  Turn them back on.  So you have to...  There we go.  So there is daylight out there.  No, that's not daylight.  That's a blue light.  So good.  We can have it night or day anytime.  That's good.  And prove it.  The power of the DMX.  Check them out.  Hop.  Hands on photography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hop's going to be fun this week.  What's it going to be?  I got some questions as usual and I'm going to address it.  We're going to talk about some moon photography.  For those of us that have the nice fancy Pixel 6 Pro or the Pro iPhone, I'm going to show  you how to take some nice moon shots with those phones because everybody doesn't have  a DSLR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's never dark if you've got a Pixel 6.
