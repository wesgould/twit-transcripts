Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm in New York nice for  Finding out about iot stuff. Yes. I was doing an event for  Teaching people in the media how to review connected gadgets. Oh, that's telling them about smart homes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the kind of boy. I didn't know people in the media were interested in learning anything  Hey  Yeah, I say that as a person of the media I know  Maybe I'm a reformed media person, but that's good to know that they want they want to do a better job of covering it  Yeah, I presume mainstream media

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I I talk to people at Martha Stewart magazine Oprah magazine  Crazy other places it was it was really neat

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I learned a lot and we and we owe a debt of gratitude to because I guess you didn't have much connectivity there  Where are you so we can give them a plug sure I am at we communications

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You guys may be familiar with them as Microsoft's PR agency. Oh, they used to be wag yet or Wagner Edstrom. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, now she's we what a good idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they're they're being super kind and let me tell you we are accruing all kinds of technical debt with them. Good Lord

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, thank you  Yeah, it was started by Pam Edstrom who was a Microsoft employee then spun off into a agency of her own  Didn't one of the founders just die recently. Yes celebrating the life of Pam Edstrom. She did  Message from Lissa Wagner's Orkin who was the Wagner in wag Ed  Yeah, but really venerable ages years. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah, anybody covered tech new way again

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tech PR was its own  unique world in PR  It made its own kind of PR stars. It's kind of interesting. I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were so tightly associated with Microsoft for so many years  I'm glad they're still  Doing what they're doing. That's great. Thank you. I was gonna say I think they have more than just Microsoft now  Oh, yeah, lots of clients. Well, I think the rebranding to we was smart. I like that  Anyway, we have lots to talk about so I'm not gonna I'm not gonna drag it out here. I don't know where to start though  Google has said they may be doing an ad blocker in Chrome or no, they haven't said anything but  Apparently that's the Bloomberg story  Ah  There is a post from Google search had been gombs that they're gonna change  How search works because of the fake news problem and the snippets problem and they're gonna use humans us  They've always used humans, but we're gonna make it easier for us to get involved. Yeah, but they've changed they've changed the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Criteria and what struck me about this?  I think it's very important is that Ben Gomes who's the genius in search at Google talks about favoring quality talks about  Reliable sources talks about giving people authority. I think that's a really big deal  It's not Google's not saying we're favoring truth. We're favoring reliability quality and authority  That matters in a few ways  That's that's Google deciding to buy us in favor of the good stuff and decide what the good stuff is  You know not that Google didn't to an extent they always wanted a good experience. They always wanted relevance  But now to say out loud they want quality  I think is good for Google and good for those of us who fancy that we make quality

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's a kind of timely because Robert Pirsig passed away this week the author of  Zen in the art of motorcycle maintenance and it that much of the book is really about  Quality right he talks a lot about quality. What is what is quality and  It's funny because  Gosh, you'd think that from day one the quality of their search results was the most important

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what they offer right there's persegue. Well, yeah, but people learned how to game the system. I mean that if we think about  Google's in the constant race and they use you know  What the original was like people linking back a third of it  The word of linking back people started gaming that and then they started using different metrics. And so this is not like a huge change  I think Google has always wanted to  Surface the best and brightest and now that we're in such an automated age. I  Think it comes back to people. So I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  quality the thing about quality is  It's one of those things, you know when you see it  But it's pretty hard to pin down and everybody's idea of what a quality search result is might would vary wouldn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It depends on what you search for. I mean if you're really searching  You know when you search for how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich when you get a like that's actually a terrible example  That's a good example because that's obvious  Right. Well how to pick a smartphone. So if you look that is harder, but hopefully  You know, there's all those crappy like a smartphone  Da da da results that are just link. They're just amalgamations of links and then there's  authoritative reviews and I think the opinions may be different there, but  Deciding who's done the work, I guess is probably a little bit easier. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's funny because when people talk about fake news, this is related in a way to fake news, right?  When people talk about fake news, it's in the eye of the beholder too you and I we all we could all agree  What's a fake story?  But I would say that part of the problem with fake news is a lot of people would embrace that story and  I doesn't make it true  Yeah, and then there but yeah, right there's there's not there's stuff that's not factually true that that would qualify easily as fake news  That's like peanut butter and jelly sandwich then there's stuff that can't be measured  Then there's stuff that can't be measured and then there's stuff that's true in spirit if not true in fact  And that's the big one. That's the problematic one, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's there's there's the schema as they say you may have you know  The Breitbart article might have facts, right?  But how it chooses to interpret that or what it what it does, you know  The recent example was there was a but you can't call it fake news if it has the facts, right? Can you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um  Give me an example of a fake news story. That's factually true

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, so there was a recent case  that  Of the alleged rape of a I think a high school student by the son of an illegal of an undocumented immigrant, right and  It got no play on  CNN MSNBC ABC CBS NBC, but it was non-stop on Fox since the argument there that that's the the schema  That's the worldview you choose right present and you say it's not actually untrue taking the world

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's factually what's untrue or maybe a misrepresentation is the conclusion you draw from it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, right in the prioritization you give it and so it's an interpretation of the world  Which is the world is open for interpretation, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean there's editorial judgment in every news source. Yes, absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And a worldview and ultimately it's defined by a worldview, right?  Yes. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Belt on show. So what I think some people would say is this whole thing about fake news is my world for view versus your worldview  It's fake if it doesn't match my worldview

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, that's that's Donald Trump's interpretation of fake news. I'm serious

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lefties interpretation, isn't it? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't hear a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lefties as you call them shouting fake news because you're a lefty you're seeing it through the prism of a lefty. Yes  My that would be what I would submit right?  It doesn't I mean because we're looking through a certain filter it looks true to us I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wouldn't look at Fox's story that they chose to run and call that fake news if it indeed  I mean if it happened it happened and you know  Right, but the only reason I'm raising this is that you think there's a difficulty rampage

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead, but no your turn. I saw it's the the the the the the lag drive me crazy the blood  If but if they say there's a rampage of immigrants on a  Crime wave I'll give you an example rapes across America. I'll give you an example and that's fake the word wilding

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is so this is remember that they're in Central Park

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the right the story of the  Supposedly young black men who attacked a jogger the men went to jail  But that story was  Became a story of young black men wilding  You know, this is a trend furthermore. The men were eventually acquitted and and  Donald Trump and I would presume his political allies said continued to say that they were guilty and  Were wilding so there's an example of there are there's some facts  In there and there's also some interpretation in there and there's some actual lies in there  And how do you know how to what how do how would you call what would you do with that story?  Well, if you've reported on them being acquitted, I mean if they were acquitted you just say that donald trump is wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, okay. Yeah. I mean if you've been acquitted you're no longer guilty. That's  Yeah, okay, yeah, I mean if you've been acquitted you're no longer guilty that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You never were here's the last night here's the headline from the daily news  Um  You know, this was a story 19 when I was it was a long time ago 89 something like that. Yeah, I think so  Brutally raping and nearly killing a jogger during a crime spree of three dozen youths  Wilding randomly attacking anyone they found and it turned out this I mean this probably was fake news. It was certainly misinterpreted  Um and it ended up having you know  Five kids spending their years in jail including rocker's island because well, this is this is something like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember welfare queens  Yeah, the 80s threat of welfare queens that really weren't I mean that's both an interpretation  And we're still actually getting  We get a hint of that today with like the debate over health care  Was it chaffetz who said, you know people could have health care  Or or an iphone or I cannot remember his the implication was the same they'll buy an iphone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why shouldn't they pay for their health care?  By the by the way, it was just just to finish this wilding story. It was a 28 year old investment banker who confessed  years later  That did it a white guy  So but I bet you anything in most people and certainly in the president's mind  This is still those seven kids those seven black kids  So how do you as google?  The only reason we bring this up. I bring this up is how do you as google determine?  How how do you weigh this stuff? I don't I think it's very difficult to put yourself in that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They don't want to they haven't wanted to but now that I understand why it's a slippery slope  They have to you know, it's the example that I gave on the show a couple weeks ago  Search for climate change you get one set of results search for the this is no longer the case  but search for at least for me search for is climate change real you got different results and  So at some point google said no, no actually we should give the same thing we try right now climate  Change so climate change

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a really good example because  There is no there's no agreement  I mean there's consent to scientific consensus, but there's no agreement among people about this  And I mean last night i google might say oh, yeah. No, it's true. It's real  But there are plenty of people who say it's not what should google do with that?  Well, does the authoritative sources agree? Oh, no, that's well boy. That's really problematic. So so so  Climate change real  Okay, so they've fixed this problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is yeah now now if you search for climate number three is how to talk to a climate skeptic

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Number seven is the 97 percent consensus on global warming. Some people are going to really say that this is slanted

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well  But but toward what towards science?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's wrong with that? Yeah, i'm like towards something that's provable and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In wait a minute. So last night not provable  There's scientific consensus

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's scientific consensus. They can prove that things are changing. I mean there's  And you know the nice thing is if  Scientific consensus goes another way and they're like, oh are bad. Look what's happening something totally different has changed in the  climate modeling and  global or climate change isn't happening and we got a bunch of scientists who agreed that that was the case and there was a  Set consensus google would change the results and the rest of us who are like  Climate change is a big deal. Suddenly we'd be like, oh  Here's all this proof that it's not okay and we change our worldview and google would change its too to reflect that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and maybe okay  So this is so this actually is climate change real is a really interesting search and I should probably do this in an incognito mode  Uh, because i'm because that's another thing. There's this filter bubble your results vary depending on whether you're logged in to google  But look at so you're right the first three results climate change  How do we know climate change vital signs of the planet how to talk to a climate skeptic and then top stories?  Two of which are  Climate change believers, but the third of which is a is a guy who says that's it's all wrong. It's crazy  It's weather that's in the top stories. So they aren't banning, uh pointing opinions. No  I don't know  So, let me this is challenging for google I think and I and I think problematic but it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So so last night I interviewed david kenney who's the in charge of ibm watson  Uh a fascinating hour with him, uh at on a stage at cuny  And he talked a lot about ground truth  And the fact is a fact I think there's ranges here, right? There are facts and then there are interpretations of the facts and then there are lies  um  Uh, in fact, he said on climate change climate change has been quite, you know  He used to head the weather channel or weather company. It's it's quite the issue for him  He said that the data we do not have is data from the bottom of the ocean  Uh that if we spent a trillion dollars on on sensors at the bottom of the ocean  We would know a hell of a lot more and be able to  uh  From that model better what's actually happening with climate  We don't have that but we have a scientific consensus based on a hell of a lot of facts and a hell of a lot of facts that are  verified  So there's the fact there's the interpretation and then there's the stretch and the lie

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So in the earliest days of google  The goal was merely to reflect the internet, right or was it right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was it yes, and yes, and well we said that in media  Google says that facebook says that we reflect and the argument i've been making lately is that google's mirror may well indeed be straight and  True, but the world is cracked

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's cracked. Yeah, but so that's not google's job to say. Oh, let me adjust this view. Yes, it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's the same with spam if so you have this article over here that has  Has 10 000 people talking about it that says climate change is bs. You have a scientific paper over there  That's annotated and factual and has two people reading it  If you use the wrong judgment, you will you will give too much weight to the discussion  Uh and the fake controversy being formed over here and even worse because it can be gamed  Uh, well like I so I agree with you what google should do an indication of truth what google should do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is do everything it can to prevent gaming?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What google should not do includes the creation of fake controversy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah gaming it's not gaming if a lot of people  Gravitate towards a really inflammatory headline that may or may not be true  it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's just google. Well, i'm sorry, but I think google should reflect  Google should have a pure algorithm and when google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no such thing as a pure algorithm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would argue the world is ranked is a pure art. No, I would argue that page rank is a pure algorithm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, your algorithms are totally  They're your biases are reflected in how you design your algorithm  So if you design your algorithm to wait what you might be saying is I want the algorithm to value the mass  You know the mass attention which would be the 10 000 people viewing one article versus the two viewing the scientific paper

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So let's talk about how page rank worked doesn't work this way anymore  It would rank highest the highest the the articles that were  Uh linked linked not read linked  by  Highest ranking sites  so it  That was in a nutshell what page rank did that what I would argue the only bias there is well  The the search results should return the result that is linked to by the most high ranking sites  Which to me yes, that's not you could say it's a bias  but  That's that's as pure a thing as you could do I would say  But the problem is you then have gaming which you have to kind of maybe do something about spam and gaming

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But what's wrong with that? You also have fake controversy you have you have you have controversies that are ginned up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But don't you understand the risk the huge risk that's involved if you do anything else because now you're going to say, okay  Well, it's not giving us the results we approve of in whatever context we're living that risk right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're living the opposite risk right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so this was my problem with fake news all along was that  It's it says it doesn't agree with what I agree with but that's could be used by anybody  I don't want a search engine that's going to have bias built in whether it's bias for things

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I believe in or bias against things the world has bias built in and it's not a choice search engine reflects

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's out on the internet if a lot of people are writing about one thing?  It should reflect that whether you agree with it or not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, because it will leo, but they're not really people that's made up stuff. It's it's it's I mean it's it's it's it's pr  It's bernays, right? The world has been warped media warped the world. Well, I don't know if

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think google could fix that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It has to make some attempt and that's why I think the gombs letter is so so important  Is it's them saying we're going to make an attempt and facebook is saying the same thing  They have to worry about quality compare and contrast with twitter, which doesn't do jack  Because they argue. Oh, no, no, no, we go. It's free. We got everybody on and we see the result there  So I think that yeah, you're right. This is this is this is a this is a risky path fraught with peril  It's fraught but but the but not doing anything we have just learned is more fraught  And and not doing anything in 20 years

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When we're sitting here saying god  We should never have let silicon valley determine how what our values and future was because look what we got  Are we going to come back and say, you know, boy, I guess that was a bad idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you want those guys say about about about uh, new york media? We should we should never have let  Hollywood in new york determine our values and so they're looking at just that so so that's a good point

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hollywood has for several generations now  Projected a worldview out there, right?  Yeah, and new york uniform. It's not uniform. There's also mel gibson movies, but but take those out  And there's a relatively uniform worldview for coming from hollywood  What would you do? What would you do then in response to that? Would you say?  Oh, we got to decide we got a sensor. Let's see. What about the catholic anti-defamation league?  Why don't we say let's come up with a rating system and say you no catholic could see that movie because that's a worldview  We start here legal

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Start here  in the case of climate change  Google  is now  favoring the institution of science  Is there anything wrong in a company that wants to bring us to knowledge with favoring?  the academe and science  and  Expertise and authority. Okay, but I think it would be those are the institutions  That the others want to tear down. That's why it's controversial right now. It would be I think on its face  To favor science science

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It would be a mistake to fetishize science though because what you call science is  Just today's scientific worldview and no in no scientific innovation ever ever thus  It always flies in the face of the current scientific worldview. That's called science has  method

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well science  Yeah  The scientific method is always allowing for you to question that and then prove that it's wrong and that's  That's very different than saying I don't like it it's wrong  Science says I don't like this. I think it works a different way  Let me show you why I think that and let me prove it to you  and that's  That's a very different value in  In terms of quality, it's it's much preferred  So otherwise you're just living inside someone's head. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so when it was accepted  scientific fact that the  Sun revolved around the earth if you were  google in in the 16th century  Would you eliminate search results that said it was otherwise that Copernicus guy got to downrank him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They probably would have downranked Copernicus for a while until they had but they would have fixed it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They would have gotten their event. I mean and probably faster than unless he got burned at the stake in which case well  We'd be out of luck

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We still got there and we'd probably get there faster with more people having that kind of input a larger crowdsource system  and gets gets you to the right answer faster

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Get you to the by your by your logic  By your logic than schools then then you're in favor of teaching creationism because hey  There are some people out there who believe in creationism and and who are we to say what's right and wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I would be a mistake for a school not to ignore creationism  I wouldn't teach it as scientific same as

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google does not kill off links to holocaust deniers if you search for holocaust layers  You can find them because you might want them for research and find out what they're saying. That's what google does  Okay, but if you ask is the holocaust real if you ask is climate change real it favors. Here's my here's my fear

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google's going to start  So so part of the problem is that the web  Is not it does not exist in a vacuum that the what we really see is the web is the result of google searches, right?  You can't you you only see what google surfaces?  um, so i've  That's the huge and in my opinion dangerous power that google wields  And the good news is there are other search engines  So it's foolish to treat them as a monopoly and that may that may be enough to fix this  But i'd be very worried if google used some world view  You know, maybe I agree with it or disagree with it  But use some world view to rank the web to to shape the web  There's a don't you think there's a risk in that that  Uh, well conventional wisdom says the sun revolves around the earth. So leo  Schools do it universities do a history does it? I mean that's what history is history is the you know  Is this the story told by the winners? But um  What I was hoping is that the web would be a better do a better job

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, because people make it  I mean the web is just a reflection of us and who are values

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The web is not if it's a reflection of us. It's not a fine if it's a reflection of google or

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a reflection of how we manipulate it. It's a reflection of how we all exploit it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you see what i'm saying that it's it's if if it'd be one thing if a reflection of us guided or misguided  It's another thing entirely if it's a reflection of silicon valley's world view that's dangerous  But

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know I think you're I think you're you're yeah, there's gotta be a word for this, you know reverse anthropomorphizing or something  um  for google  To decide I mean it's no different from the fight for the textbooks in kansas, right google decides to favor science  Or texas because i've looked better yet. Yes, right google decides to favor science or a teacher

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Librarian decides to favor science in texas. It is no different. That's why I don't want it. It's exactly the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do want it. Good lord. I don't want people walking around saying well if enough people say it  Then i'm going to treat this as fact that is fake news

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but i'm gonna i'm gonna surf if if everybody in the world agrees on something  Your search results should reflect that if if there's dissent  It should reflect that whether it fits your world view or not. Okay. All right. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on two things there two things one

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, just because people talk about it doesn't mean that it's a survey if you're trying to say we we determine fact by survey

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  i'm saying there's a huge risk  in censoring or limiting the  visibility of parts of the web  Because it doesn't fit  Your world view which everybody in your bubble agrees is true

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, science is not the web that google's giving you science is true and google is giving you knowledge. It's not true. I beg to differ

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Science is true. No, and it is a that's a huge mistake  Science changes so something that's true shouldn't change

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's that's not true science is not true science. We is a result of a scientific method which aims towards truth science is not true  That's a big mistake as soon as you say science better  Well, i'm not saying I believe in the scientific method look so absolutely believe in it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Say google favors the scientific method when it's favoring science. Is it is that what you're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is we're going to favor the scientific method?  That's not what they're saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you look at the results on climate change, they're the papers are from nasa because that's loaded

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's that's not use climate change, but in general  Google is not saying we favor scientific method. They say we favor our world view

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they're saying they favor authority and quality  And as defined by well and that's so so maybe your question becomes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you you know the texas school board is an institution

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  True enough there you got me. Okay, you got me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really important to understand that it's that  I don't want to put that's giving too much power to google  By the way, it's giving too much power to the mom. There's a threat in this  We've been doing the shows for eight years and if there's a threat in this show, it's me saying  Google has too much power  Or google has to be respond has to responsibly use its power  And it's the problem is I you know  Look, I understand why they're trying to do this and why facebook's trying to do this  In fact, I think that the I would say in both cases they're doing it out of  Absolutely benign and in fact positive motives  I just don't think we should ignore the real so doing it to not lose ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean the other story in the rundown is is is google expanding the definition of hate speech  Because they've got a real problem around youtube when havas and the guardian and verizon all dropped youtube  Uh, oh no, this is this is an economic decision, too  Uh, there's a line from hate speech to fake news. That makes it even worse  Because now the institution's well influenced by revenue

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we knew that was the case to begin with

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there's a quality that's why I liked page right the advertisers

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was too simplistic, you know, obviously the problem is humans  uh, and and they want to you know the game stuff so  but uh  I you know, I honored matt cutt's attempt to degate to to eliminate the effect of gaming on google  That was what matt cutt's job was  And then I have no problem now the whole world does it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now you have entire campaigns that are run on nothing but this now you have eight chan and four chan and company  trying to tear down institutions  uh, I know and  And and and and but you're just saying how many people is it it could be a hundred people  Right, yeah, and they're very clever about it  They're very good about it  And and and it's and it's just an extension of a pr company in the old days or an ad agency, right?  No, I I guess to take it to take it to your full conclusion is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you if you know, you don't want those hundred people to determine what you see on the web either

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Thank you. Yes  And so you've got to find a balance you've got to adjust for them  You've got to make some and and so you're forced to google. Here's what i'm saying  Google didn't want to be this position. They were forced into this position  Yeah, if they wanted to deliver knowledge and a quality experience to us  They have to acknowledge my own my point to them has been  that they've got to be more transparent about the efforts to manipulate them and thus us  and  Uh and and and that they have to adjust for those efforts to manipulate and we have to be able to adjust

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the sentence that uh worries me and and this is uh, once again from um  The ben gombs who's the vp of engineering at google ahead of search at google  Um, we combine hundreds of signals. This is a this is really in a nutshell  We combine this is the whole key. Yes ranking is the key  We combine hundreds of signals to determine which results we show for a given query from the freshness of the content  To the number of times your search queries appear on the page  We've adjusted and this is the sentence that that i worry about we've adjusted our signals to help serve as more authoritative  pages  And to demote low quality content  So that issues similar to the holocaust denial results that we saw back in december less likely to appear  And I just want to know  This is good, but what is it authority who what is authoritative and what is low quality?  Now he says an issue part part of this comes from direct feedback tools, right? He says we're going to give  Users a chance to help us with authority and quality

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's more that's more on the feature, which is autocomplete, which is really a different thing  Okay, so that's not going to change that's not going to work with that's not going to change ranking ranking is holy  And so ranking they've got to make universal decisions that they can stick with it's going to yield so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where's that conversation about what is authoritative and what is low quality? Where's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So i'm involved in this decision. There's gonna be an announcement next week is something i'm involved in  That I won't say yet  but  We have to be more transparent about the signals that various parties use  To make decisions on their own and for their own reasons  So if you're if you're an ad network if you're an ad agency if you're an advertiser if you're a media company  If you're a platform  You and if you're a reader  You need more signals  That you can use to judge things. So so for example, i'll give you a simple example, right age of sight  If this site has only been up for for two weeks procter and gamble. Do you really want to put your diapers on it?  You know, I don't know now the new york times was two weeks old once two weeks doesn't mean it's bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's a signal that tells you you might want to be cautious. There's a really good example because doesn't that favor incumbents?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does it less so what i've what i'm arguing what i'm going to argue with next week is that  Absolutely, and so there needs to be so like how would you things that even how many signals become a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Survive if i'll tell you just well twit's brand new and you got to trust cbs. I'm gonna answer your question

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm gonna answer your question  So so you have sets of signals and you have interpretation of them and they're both bad signals and good signals  Vice and virtue  You need a few things then you also have people signing up to pledges of doing this and that and this and that  So you need I think an agency to to or agencies to worry about three things to to audit compliance  I made this pledge. Do I hold true to it? And that pledge is just me saying to those who care  Uh that I fact check or I do whatever  Second is um, and that's not game. Yeah, okay, so I screwed up. I screwed up once  No, you need human beings. You need human beings. There's an appeal process  I've long said I have long said that google needs a jury of advertising peers to make these decisions because google is the voice of god  So you need appeal and you need review?  Of a new site. Oh, this thing is only two weeks old but hell it's nick christoph starting a new media brand  Yeah, let him in  um now the second part is which favors  Incumbents  It does to some extent if edward armuro starts a podcast network. He's gonna be damn fine  There needs to be a door open for new ones  Yeah, well, yeah and and leo but this is where we're stuck

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I understand the problem and I understand the difficulty here's a here's an example with snippets  So who are search completion who painted the monolisa and then which predictions were inappropriate?  And then but see notice the categories that they give you for and I wish I could pause this gif  The predictions and this is why I don't like them are hateful sexually explicit violent or other  The three hatefully hateful sexually explicit violent  Um that that's an interesting choice those three  Because that reflects a current cultural point of view  Exactly, but uh in france nudity is not nearly as problematic  But they hate violence but they hate violence that's still there we currently will rate a movie are for sex  But not for violence  so these kinds of systems  Are I think culturally problematic they perpetuate the the  Establishment the the the the culture in charge  And I think the risk here is the culture in charge is the silicon valley culture  Which is I think one could argue a very bizarre and non-standard culture

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, that's what's said about hollywood. That's what's said about new york just like hollywood washington government. Yeah  Yeah, and I would and I would think it's risky and that'd be and it's only a deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a big it's a deal because hollywood movies are one thing  The the the the the company that essentially controls visibility on the internet and the entire internet. It's a whole other  Thing they have even a higher responsibility much higher responsibility than hollywood does

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know people used to make that argument about hollywood though that they are the influencer and arbiter of culture  Not just here but abroad  And I mean now it's much less relevant. It's problematic. It's much more problematic now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With google it's much more problematic because it's not just hollywood. It's not just the movie you went to see  It's your everything you do when I mean the web is now the internet is everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's where you get your information period, but you don't have to get it through google and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, so that's so I did mention that there are other there are other search engines. Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there are yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no about.com is going away  I didn't know it was still around  But it was full of gaming right consult. I consulted there for a year

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When the times bought it, I don't know. I don't I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't I just worry that google has so much power  but you but but and jeff I try I do trust people like you to kind of speak truth to them and  And so I just I think it's important that we make sure that there's room for  points of view scientific theories ideas that don't fit

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The dominant culture that's that's where humanity. I agree. They're also testing different perspectives  Um, they're they're testing other things as well, and I think they're they're very conscious of this  But but but the allele all the points you raise are of course good points  And you're doing it for the sake of showing all the yeah, because i'm a liberal and I want I do I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  firmly believe in climate change  but  For the sake of argument and and the problem is  If we're if you're not the dominant culture it sure doesn't feel good  Uh, you know when the dominant culture uses these very powerful tools to suppress your points of view

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unless those points of view are

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wrong guys. We're no no, no, no, no, no, we're we're not going to solve this now  But we've been talking about it for a while and we keep I feel like we've gotten around and around a couple times

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're right. We have not but I am going to give you a chance to talk about the new amazon echo

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was not this this was not just for my own selfish reasons  So also leo about this too. I want to get you a devil's advocate hat  You can put it on when you're like if you know the worst thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But but I think google needs to be devil's advocate the reason  The the worst thing is for is for a bunch of people  Who have this who have come from white privilege or whatever point of view it is all sitting around agreeing  I agree  And so it's important I played it's not merely the devil's advocate. I think it's really i'm sincere in my  Concern that the dominant culture not  dominate the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can get a revisit of clippy would you like an alternative opinion on this yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's got to be a there's got to be a way to do you fool you  Yeah, meanwhile  In more important news now, there's an amazon echo that will look at your style choices

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought this was an april fools joke when I saw it. I was like no, that was my exact tweet not an april fools joke

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, but it's actually telling I I don't think amazon look they've made mistakes the amazon fire phone is obviously one  But I think amazon is jeff bezos is careful about strategic moves. This there's a reason super smart  I love like there's a reason for this. Yes. So what is it? Tell us what this thing does

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so for two hundred dollars and right now it's invite only it's an amazon echo that has all the features of madame a  with a camera and the camera in this case  takes a picture or a video of your outfit and it uses

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Machine learning and recommendation algorithms to decide which one's better. See how blurs the background intentionally so that chair doesn't distract

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then what is style check how does that work style check is uh looking to say this the computer's 64  Confident that this is a better choice this oh my god  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Talking about dominant culture  Yeah  Fortunately, it's a plan for you america fashion is a completely trivial  Thing so I don't mind so much, but I have to agree the shoes are much better on the left than the right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is great for amazon because here are a couple things that that I think is smart here  Okay, I don't I I call this the closet  The closet echo even though I would not want this in my closet. I actually have a camera in my closet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a dot. I have a dot in my closet  Yes, but so I can listen to news while i'm changing but this would this would take its place effect  I got on the list immediately

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Me too, but it's a camera. So I don't think I would want the camera while i'm changing  To be honest, but so what this does is it gives amazon a chance to understand what you're wearing  Which will give it the ability to make some amazing recommendations for what you should buy next fashion's a big spot for amazon  You know clothing is still something that most people  Don't buy from amazon  um, so that's one and two once it has this intelligence think about the kinds of value-added services it can add  Such as once it knows what's in my wardrobe it can suggest outfits for me  It could even look at the weather and say hey, it's gonna be cold  Here, what about this or look at my calendar? You've got I mean, these are the sort of it's not doing this but  these are the sort like  the things you can do when you have  information about people we're just we're just uncovering this and it's going to be amazing and  amazon's getting a leg up with  Understanding what the heck's in my wardrobe

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm gonna predict this is this is we're gonna we're gonna look back. It's gonna be the museum of dead technology. This is another fire phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It might be yeah, because it's too limited to use. This is huge too

How many views you think on this video where you can see it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One and a half million. That's what i'm saying. This is social. This isn't the computer telling you what to wear  With one view from the institution. That's what social I get that. I think this is exactly what amazon wants to do with this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is trained. It's a machine learning algorithm. They're training it against these videos. They're trained

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually don't know what they're training it against well, they're clearly collecting information right in much the same way google photos  Is collected. I mean, you know amazon's not stupid your machine learning it needs  It eats data  I think this is huge. I think they can sell they'll sell they'll sell a million of these in the first year  Oh, jeff, I sent it'll be around long. What if you sell a million?  That's 200 million dollars jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but it's not  The only it's the only style thing go ahead again

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I send I take pictures and I send of my outfits like before I go on stage or something  Like if i'm picking my wardrobe, I send pictures to my friends. There are dozens of apps where you can  No, but there are dozens of apps where you can send it to strangers  I can't think of the app's name right now, but there's if I don't have a friend. I want to bother. Yes, I can send it to them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  still people  Um, well this will be this could be people. I mean, I wouldn't be surprised at all if they tie this into stylists  In fact, they say style check combines machine learning algorithms with advice from fashion specialists  The only to me the only threat to this is the price which is 200 bucks. I think if this one has but it's also an echo

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it does everything the echo does. Well, does it have speakers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good question. I think it's more like a dot with a camera  I mean, I it probably needs to be that expensive because it's got a camera. They're expensive. Yeah  Um, and it's got led lighting and it's got uh now algorithms in it to blur the background

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What last story I picked the google or the oh, it's jeff's turn I say I see  Oh, I see. Thank you. Well, it's been a little bit self-serving. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jimmy wales announced i'm excited. Are you involved with this?  I'm i'm an advisor

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  i'm  Jumped for joy because wikipedia jimmy wales of course created wikipedia  He's now creating wiki tribune  What's the point

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  jeff  So the point is a few things one is  That and it's going to be a changeable beast. So i'm probably projecting my wishes on it more than reality  What I want most one out of this is that we have this constant flow of news updates breaking news everything else  And I want a place where I can go and say what do we know about blank an updated repository?  Jimmy also wants this to be a um, he wants to bring over some of the culture. This is gonna be hard from wiki  pedia of  collaboration number one and also of npov of neutral point of view of fact based and and and things that have  of the the the show their work and they're transparent and you know what changes are made and why by whom

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, I was gonna have professional journalists working alongside volunteers contrast this to my point of view on the google's attempt to you know get  Uh search fixed this is exactly the response I love to see first of all, it's one site  It's not dominating the net but it gives people a place they can go. It's community supported. It's a news platform, but  Fact focused fact oriented evidence-based journalism is the tagline they're using and  Because it's like wikipedia. It's people it's made people are involved  And and somebody I think it might have been you jeff said the reason that  Journalists hate this is because community and journalists are equals  That kind of might I didn't somebody but yes, that's true they said that yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I visited I visited uh jimmy when he was about to do a weekend test where he hired journalists and and  Volunteers hired people to play the roles and covered news for a weekend  um, he thinks wiki software is not easy enough to use  And and there were different functionalities. So he's building on top of  Of existing platforms but building an easier to use platform to do this  And i'm enthused. It's a for-profit company. He's trying to get as much patronage as possible to use as little advertising as possible  That's not closing the door on advertising  I think so may be necessary but but if you don't totally depend upon advertising then the reward structures are not  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Clickbait, so are they gonna monetize it says with subscriptions

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, so it's a patronage. It's a it's all gonna be free and access  It's gonna be like public media in the u.s. But I can become a supporter. Yeah, I want to definitely become a supporter at various levels

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm a supporter of wikipedia. I mean I give wikipedia a monthly contribution, but I this is just as good an idea. I I think  So um  So he's hired journalists. Your turn. He's hired three out of the ten that they want to hire according to the web page  What do you think stacy? I mean you're you're a journalist. What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's a good idea as a journalist. Okay  This is just going to come out wrong. So i'm just to say it  I think in some ways  I am  A common or like a general community member isn't necessarily as knowledgeable as I am about some things not everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But so well, that's why they're journalists too. I mean they're it's right. It doesn't  Wikipedia is created in time. In fact, it's it's interesting because wikipedia doesn't have a lot of  uh  Experts, I think but but I don't know actually I shouldn't say that  Is entirely by volunteers whoever says I want to write an article and it somehow manages to  It's not the the sole version of truth but work towards truth. It does in a beautiful way

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would love them to I want to see this in actually something like net neutrality  Which hey, it's back. Um, I think that would be like a real I want to see them cover something  Like that  As opposed to like there was a shooting an x number of people were killed which feels  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's a great idea. I just want to see what's the latest on trump and russia?  Yeah, give give me the give me what we know and don't know about trump and russia  And don't force me to go through 87 articles to figure out where the hell are we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because I mean finding  Making meaning out of what's happening in the world is tough and especially right now and there's  It's so complicated and the more meaning you try to put in a story the more context you put into a story  the more dangerous and I won't say the further from the truth, but  The more risky run of people saying what no, that's not my meaning  No, that's not my meaning and and it's because people tell their own stories and make their own stories and  I don't know. We'll see. Well, I mean and so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's funny because this contrasts us with our earlier conversation  This this is but the because it's just one source  You can still go read the new york times the washington post the bright part whatever you want to read  This is one source. I've I think this is a very interesting experiment and maybe it'll be a flop  I mean if you'd if if before wikipedia if you had said we're going to make an encyclopedia of all the world's knowledge edited by  Volunteers who have free access from anywhere in the internet would you have said what that'll work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I remember a conference at  Harvard where jimmy wales faced jill abramson  It was then a number two editor at the times  And she said you don't understand how much it cost to have a bangtab bureau and jimmy said  I don't care  The world doesn't care the market doesn't care who would have thought that volunteers could replace encyclopedia britannica  On the other hand the cautionary tale. Do you remember the wikitorial in the la times? No  So they they they they not too wisely decided to do a an editorial and to hey, this is a crowd thing  Let's make it into a wiki  So they took an editorial about the iraq war and then opened it up and it took no time at all for of course  Of course warzone and I blogged at the time this is going back many years now I blogged at the time and I said  No, no, no, no  You should have had one from column a one from column b two from perspectives and each one should do its best job  To argue this is an editorial so it's not fact-based  It's opinion-based and show me the two perspectives argue to their best and jimmy wales happened to see that at the time  And he said you're right. He looked coming. They should fork it and he tried to get to the la times to say no  No, guys fork this thing, but it was too late  It was such a disaster. Well, they also didn't I mean look at

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the key to wikipedia is the talk page and the fact that you can see all edits made and you can see  The debate over the talk the editors the volunteers is a small percentage of people who really spend a lot of time on it  But for whatever reason in fact  Really? I mean if you want to know about net neutrality wouldn't isn't the first place you'd go wikipedia. I don't I think it's you know  It's it does have any effect when that's overwhelming  When there's breaking news, yes when there's breaking news, I go to wikipedia. Do you stacy use wikipedia for research?  I bet you do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like especially the technical topics like uh,  Semiconductor design discussions and like if I encounter some weird spectrum thing i'm like, oh, what's this i'll go there  um, it's better there I don't  I don't go for things like net neutrality even though they can do a really good job of covering like the historical

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this is this actually is really good this this net neutrality conversation  And the other thing I like is the you can see all the references the you know  Article after so if this is a starting point it really bugs me when I see schools say and you may not use wikipedia  Because it's better than the encyclopedia britannica

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So my daughter's school says she can use wikipedia and they even say it is a source, but  They actually talk about where to go to see  Controversial things and how to recognize gamed pages, of course you need that too

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although wikipedia is surprisingly not gamed given how open it is. It's always amazes me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People I mean it's gamed for a few moments and then it's ungamed. It's not gamed long term usually

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like if I go to hillary clinton, I wonder  There's gonna be a lot of factual stuff and of course at some point somebody will put something bad in but that  There are people watch over it  Um, I think this these are these are really kind of amazing  I'll tell you it's not a day goes by that. I don't refer to wikipedia  and so I yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you go back to our google discussion  One of the arguments that i've made is that is that is that you need to look at the things where there's fake  Controversy created there's there's there's a right so it's not how many coats of shellac do you put on wood?  it's is climate change real and and to me the the the  The  Data to use for that the easiest day is to look at those pages on wikipedia which have to be shut down

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you know i would guess the climate change page is locked down

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or vaccines. Oh boy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah  But see they have um, they have a vaccine page, but then they also have a page called vaccine controversy  And that's where knowledge the controversy is fine. Yeah, that's where the debate goes  Uh  And then if you go to adverse effects, which is where you would expect anti-vaccine advocates to get involved this looks  I mean like  Pretty accurate. It looks like the cdc stuff. Yeah  Uh, so  And yet if you go to vaccine controversy, you will then see all the stuff and that's exactly how it should be handled  Don't you think?  This is I mean, so i'm anyway, i'm i only say this to say jimmy seems to understand  And jimmy and his team i'm sure jimmy doesn't that involve I don't know how involved he is in wikipedia these days

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh jimmy's gonna be very involved. He's gonna be the I think he's gonna be the editor to start good

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because he think he gets it  And uh this could I  I expect to check wiki tribune for news  At maybe my first stop in the same way that wikipedia is my first stop for factual information

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I I very much agree with my esteemed fellow panelists  That covering a fire or shooting or that kind of stuff is not what we will have plenty of that there's breaking news everywhere  Taking these ongoing complex stories, but I wish it would start with a test. I told him this he's not gonna  He's gonna do this. I would just like to start with a test of this. That's just the latest on trump what we know about trump  What his policies are what he said?  uh  Connections to russia  And so on that would be a test of this thing if you can pull that off without the world tearing you apart  If you can be a useful resource that people can look up and see what's going on you've passed an acid test. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the idea is you'll have reporters and then you'll have the community by the way look at the bottom of the page. There's  Hey, jeff. There's a picture of somebody we know guy advisors include gaya kawasaki jeff jarvis and lily cole  Who's lily cole? I don't know who lily cole is. I don't know. Yeah, we haven't had a committee meeting  um  I think this is good for jimmy  I mean this is this is a very jimmy way to address  This fake news controversy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Be interesting to see how it works. She's an english model actress and entrepreneur great. What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jimmy jimmy's a strange fellow in some respects  Okay, you know, I don't know what the story is there but um

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I became a support. Now the question is will she have the amazon look in her closet?  She's a model she oughta  Right. No, they go their own way. Okay. Here's why environmental campaigning and business activities, right?  Right and you know what? Yeah advisor to wikipedia. It's already this is great already in her wiki. Uh, uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Profile is that she's an advisor to wikitribune. That's the other thing. That's amazing about wikipedia. I love how fast wikipedia is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I see somebody may have died. I'm like wikipedia. Tell me  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And who would have guessed that I know who would have guessed that that was the use of which would be put

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but who would have guessed it would work and would continue to work after all these years and not turn into fourchan or reddit or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So so this oh she's very so so she started a an altruism based altruism based social network called impossible.com  Which invites people to give their services. I know it's a way to help others. Yeah. Yeah, so it's great  So she's neat so so the no the notion of altruism and helping out and volunteering is core to this a smart a smart  Smart get as I would expect

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they are hiring actual journalists and the idea is they just take the news stories of the day and report them

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, and then I don't think that's what it is  At least all the stories of the day. I don't think they're going to be comprehensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But okay, but then there are obviously here and and then copy a copy edited by the way  Uh, because there's a rule there's a role for grammar

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Grammar wizards grammar wizards. I love that. I can't wait to see the oxford and serial comic debates

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you know you're hey man oxford forever and you know, you're gonna find plenty there's plenty of unemployed copy frustrated copy editors out there  They'll volunteer like crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I I hear from them all the time in a way. It's rolling

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's rolling the comments into the story in a way, right? That's right now. Yeah, some authority writes the story and then  You know the comments supplement it but if you could in a responsible  Well-done way add that content back in that might be very interesting  All right, well we anyway watch for it wiki tribune.com. He says if he doesn't get  Enough support if he doesn't get 10 journalists. He's a third of the way there  He he'll refund everybody's money  28 days to go. So it's kind of crowd sourced  6306 supporters, he doesn't say how much he's raised at this point  Just that he's got three out of ten journalists hired

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah for the some of the so it got swamped at first and the contribution thing didn't work at first  So if you did try to contribute go and you couldn't go back and let's all make a pledge to contribute after it starts

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  with content  like help out  Because these things are better if we all help out  So google's doing virtual reality field trips  Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead haven't they done this before?  My daughter that's like she knew what google cardboard was way at the beginning because she went on virtual field trips  But now it's available to everyone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, okay, so you can install expeditions on your phone  And participate and one of them the reason that's caught my eye is hamilton  so  My favorite thing in the world  Is it really so one of my favorite things I was like  Yeah, no, I also like spaghetti with meatballs  Uh, but uh, no hamilton. I thought we just saw it in san francisco. That's what's on my mind because i'd seen it in new york  You saw it again  I yeah, at least we almost saw it again like  tomorrow  How much how much were the tickets in san francisco, I think you know, I I subscribed to the series so I think it was I think  They're 100 bucks  I don't know if one day it'll come to austin there's active scalping. Yeah, this is a tour so it is yeah  How was the uh quality of the production? Well, it's not new york, but it was very good the the hamilton was uh had  Performed in new york. He was an understudy in new for hamilton in new york the angela same thing  Um, they're very talented cast. There's just something about broadway that it's just you know, it's it's hard to describe but it's just  a little bit better  But it was it's such a you know, it's a brilliant show  And I just seeing it is always great to see it. It's just an amazing. I also saw I walked by a theater the other day  1984 as a play. Yes. Yes 1984 really has had a resurgence in the last year. I don't know why yeah  You know else who's had a resurgence this last year twitter  In fact the stock market thought twitter would make one cent earning per share  That was the analyst consensus it made 11  Better than expected earnings after several quarters of disappointing results  revenue  Better than expected still declining 548 million monthly active users  Seven million more than expected  328 million  uh  so growth  But it's got to be I mean, I think the consensus is it's because our president uses it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I was talking to a brand manager at a large fortune 500 company  And she was taught we were talking about different social media stuff and she's like, yeah  We everyone's like get your brand off twitter. It's nothing nothing's there snapchat instagram  But now the word is we all got to go back to twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So now they're they're back to twitter. I'm back on twitter  Oh lord

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How long how long for how long that's a good question. That's a love hate thing  uh  Yeah, I mean  I just i'm just observing  Weird freak out. Uh  And i google's peripherally related to this. Uh, there was a new york times article  About uber on sunday. Actually, it wasn't even about uber. It was a profile of travis kalanick

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Such a good mike isaac's did such a great job with that profile. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but  For the geeks reading between the lines there were two very interesting titbits in here  I do recommend it. Uh, it's it's really a profile of kalanick, but it starts off  Uh with a little anecdote about kalanick. Apparently he had pulled a fast one on apple  By telling his employees to help camouflage uber's app from apple's engineers  Because uber had been violating apple rules secretly  tagging iphones  To keep track of them even after the app was deleted that is a strict violation of apple's privacy guidelines  apple caught on what the way they prevented it was with with I think with that tool gray ball that they were using to keep  authorities from using uber  they  geofenced cuportino so that the feature of the app  that  Extracted the phone's serial number  Uh wouldn't work in cuportino, but what they didn't realize is that apple has employees all over the place  They thought all of the apps were reviewed in cuportino tim cook called him in  And uh said so I heard you've been breaking some of our rules  Mr cook then demanded stop the trickery or we'll kick you out of the app store  Um, of course apple didn't know apple with anybody else would have kicked them out of the app store  And never let it back in but it's uber  So they didn't a little  Now you knock it off you bad boy you  And of course uber says they knocked it off what they were doing is uh is keep  And actually they did it for legitimate business reason not to spy on us  But because uh uber drivers particularly in india, I understand were buying extra phones  They were getting rewarded for the number of rides. They accepted just period it they accepted  So they were buying a like a hundred old iphones putting the app on them and accepting rides to to bonus themselves  And so the whole idea was  Well, we'll now know because we've seen this phone before we'll know from this id that this is bogus  That this is a resold phone and it's not you know, or something  So that was revelation number one interesting to apple fans was that apple has kind of a double standard when it comes to uber  And also interested because apple has never said  And probably should have oh, you know that uber app that was spying on you  Right didn't mention that but then the other thing we learned way down at the bottom of the story mike isaac  uh  Boy, this was well researched  Was that uber had been buying?  information  about competitors  Of course every company not every but many companies have to competitive research big companies do  Uh, but what's interesting is where they were getting this information  So we i've used and I even have recommended a service called enroll me unroll.me  Which is great. You use it. Well, it was great until I found out what they were doing you use it  to get  In fact, I think I recommended on this show to sign off of uh, newsletters and mailing lists that you don't want to be on  Does it automatically it'll create a digest of the stuff delete it from your inbox if you want  But it turns out unroll me which was a free service  We maybe should have asked a little bit more about how they monetized  They said in the early days. Oh, we'll put an ad in the digest we send you but no in fact  They were collecting all your gmail  Going through it looking for things like oh, I don't know lift receipts and then selling that information anonymized  They say to uber  Uh, I think a lot of people unrolled unroll me when they heard this  But I guess we should have known  Unroll me wrote a blog post that was founder of unroll me saying he was heartbroken  He's heartbroken we can do better i'm heartbroken that you found out what we were on board

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So  This is one of those things where again  when you sign up for a free service you are the product and  I  I saw this and I was like people are going to have a fit about this and I was kind of but I  I was a little shruggy about it, too  um, but  one of my people I follow on twitter, she said, you know a lot of people  Don't think about the trials and tribulations that come with being a free base service  And she was wondering how many entrepreneurs would start a company based on a free service knowing now what they know or knowing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What they know now some do there's a lot of in silicon valley  We're going to scale it and figure out how to monetize it later. I mean twitter is famous for that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're doing a great job actually better

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, here's the thing gmail does the same thing. Everybody knows gmail google looks at your mail, right?  But what they do with what they look at is they they don't sell it to a third party  They use keywords to put advertising in your feed targeted advertising and people I think know  Most people know that that's what goes on and as long as you're not selling to a third party  I don't think that you know, most people are bothered by that those who are don't use gmail

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your fitbit data is sold to a third party

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But see that's kind of the thing is I think people yes we now we need to really think harder if it's sold to a third party  like  Well the lift receipts, but what else is being sold with third?  What other email tidbits are being sold to a third party? And the other thing we know is that anonymizing doesn't work  We've seen time and time again so-called anonymized data de-anonymized easily

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right  this is this is a huge thing that i've been  talking about for years and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People like free there's different. I mean gmail is okay, right? I mean, it's okay with me anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh gmail is fine by me  But I am  It's not just because they don't sell it  They're also building like products on it that I think are interesting  But I didn't put my photos in google photos for a long time because that was a step too far for me  So, I mean everybody has  It was accidental stupid phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's so much value I get out of google photos  And again, you know google does give you control of this and I think I know they're honest and I think they're explicit in  What they do with it and it doesn't sound like they're scanning your photos looking for stuff. They can sell to a third party

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but they do now have an image of my daughter  Like and all of my friends and they know who I hang out with and where I hang out with them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's maybe you don't want that. I can understand that's really personal. Yeah  But you don't mind them seeing your fashion amazon seeing your fashion choices

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No  So we all have we all have our bar right and there's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Line beyond which we will not go slice which owns unroll me. In fact bought unroll me apparently for this information  I was using the slice app. I wasn't using unroll me. Well, actually, I think I was but I not recently but slice  Is a great service because it gets all your receipts and tells you when something's on its way and so forth  But now I realize I immediately deleted my slice account  Because I realized oh they're selling it to other

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People including uber. Well, they also tell you like how much you spend on like uber in a year and that sort of thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. It's really useful if they kept it to themselves  I'd have no problem with it  I trust slice but the problem is your  that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why do you care that uber can buy how many I mean?  They're not marketing to you. They're just getting competitive. I mean, is this really a huge issue?  I mean get past the icky factor like you're like what that's happening. The problem is of course uber

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I don't trust uber as far as I can throw them  so, I mean it doesn't take a lot of imagination to come up with  Ugly uber scenarios. We know they have a god mode for instance that they could tell you where you you know  They could say hey look, there's where leo is they could track you around with that  Well now if they also know my lyft account, I mean how many things are they is is was sold to uber  Do they know everything i'm is uber tracking my every move are they going to start?  You know sending me solicitations say hey, we see you're going to the prom tomorrow. Let's let's get an uber for you  How long before they start showing up an uber driver starts showing up with a card that says leo laporte  At the airport because they know i'm arriving, you know, I could just see all sorts of scenarios that would not be savory

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so this is really like  I think uber for whatever reasons and any company that's not thinking about  User trust is being super short-sighted because we're moving into this era where they're going to have a more information  But b we're going to have automated transactions and relationships with them  so like  If you sign up for amazon dash fulfillment on a product, right? You're trusting that it's measuring accurately. It's not trying to like  cheat you out of a few extra  You know filters for your brita right or something like that, right?  I would never expect google to treat me or not google  I would never expect uber to treat me fairly if it had automatic access to my credit card and was in charge of saying  like  I don't know when my ride show actually a good example is I always feel like it's telling me i've gotten my ride a little too early  Even though the car isn't there yet and i'm not actually in the car  but  That aside we're moving to this era where you're the trust your brand has is going to be really important and essential  Like I trust amazon with my data because amazon doesn't sell it. They're going to recommend products to me, but  That's about it  And they're going to protect it from authorities who come seeking it. So  I don't know just going forward. That's kind of how i've been thinking

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff google doesn't sell my information to a third party do they no it ends up

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know others benefit so when I had this conversation from the digital news initiative  Where the beginning of the conversation about giving data to media?  They're very cautious about  um google executives said to the room of media people the best way to make use of google's media google's data is to use  um google's advertising services, yeah  And so you do get the benefit of it, but you don't get the data on your own  To do something with and there are ways to pass data on in cohorts that make it anonymized and make it right and allow others

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To give people valuable services. Well, I think what we need to do  The information needs to be given to us clearly and then we each individual needs to decide what's okay. What's not okay  I'm, okay with google collecting information for internal use only i'm not crazy about fit but sending my  But this is this is the terms of service

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is exactly what the terms of service are. It's just nobody reads them. Right. I mean fitbit

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but they're also not written to be clear. I mean, I really think for instance unroll me  Needs to say when you sign up and by the way  This is what's going to happen to the other things we see in your gmail  The reason they don't is they know that people would say oh, that's it. I'm not signing up  They like it that it's obscure written in legalese  And you know if you read the terms they're they're not immediately clear what they're going to do what they need to do is say  And I wish we could say to the ftc  Hey, you guys got to regulate this and you got to make sure that there's some rules about disclosure so that it's  Easily understood by a normal person what you're planning to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the ftc in 2015 put out a report. I think it was november 2015 that talked about what people should do with data  and  dc read the report and  The ftc called on congress to make rules about this because the ftc currently doesn't have rules that interesting work on  So if you look at the recommendations in that report  You will just be dismayed by the fact that  Even the ftc is like, oh guys, we should really look at this and do better here and we're not and congress was like  No election season and I guarantee we're not going to deal with it now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  speaking of which  Ajit pi the new chairman the fcc spoke at the national association of broadcasters convention today and announced  We're going to roll back net neutrality  May 18th is to let you know  Uh the the ed issue of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Didn't you have didn't you have a devil's advocate session which I know you do on the show to have discussion

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Didn't you have a devil's advocate session? No, I didn't but what I did is I explained  the conservative point of view  here  Don't agree with it  What they're going to do is they're going to roll back or they're going to try to roll back the reclassification  of internet service providers as common carriers under title two  Uh  That provided the fcc with the regulatory cover that they needed  To prohibit isps from blocking or throttling traffic  FCC said we're not going to we're not going to use some of the other, you know  Title two also allows them for instance to do to set rates. We're not going to do any of that other stuff  uh, but we're we are going to do that and  Um, and that was because they were told by a court. That's the only way you can do this legally and so the  One of the points I made is the fcc can only do what congress explicitly allows them to do  That one could make the case that title two is kind of bending the telecommunications act to do what you want to do  Uh, and I would prefer and I think most would prefer more  Specific guidance from congress. I think that's what pie's point is. Well, we you know, what we want is  congress to really say how  Isp should be regulated now  I do believe that isps are  You know utilities in a way that google and facebook are not and that your privacy  Does need to be regulated and protected by the government. That's the only way it's going to happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait net neutrality isn't about privacy. So i'm sorry not privacy. Uh, your yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you for the correction. Although this is kind of intermingled with the privacy rules. It is but  But I was like don't you jumped yeah the apologies yes, obviously we're talking not about that but about uh,  Prioritizing traffic on the internet. Yes  And and things like zero rating and uh, and and this is that picking incumbents thing where you know  A company would say well, we don't like you netflix, but we happen to love comcasts service  And so we're going to make sure everybody can get streamcast and not at no bandwidth cost to them  But comcast you're going to have to pay  So the fcc has scheduled a vote  Notice of proposed rulemaking for may 18th, which seeks comment  And would lead to a final vote. So this is the same situation that happened with the previous  Uh vote remember tom wheeler kind of got  Decided to put this actually started

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This started  back in  2008 I think it was with julius jenakowski  His nprm that started the ball rolling rolling on net neutrality regulation  From the get-go and then wheeler came back because jenakowski stuff was refused by the court, right and that took

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  years, right  And then wheeler asked for comment millions of comments from people like you and me  Convinced him that neutrality and title two was the right way to go.

Is that a technical issue must be  It's the frequency you have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It I was about to say it's your frequencies and if you're it depends on how they're doing their speeds and I I  Didn't have time to look at what atnt is doing here  But some of the things they use to make faster speeds you need it on the handset device side and on the tower side, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well good. Um, i'm glad I have an s8. Although  After a week with it. I'm going back to the pixel  Yeah, the pixel is still the best android phone out there. Oh, okay

Transcript:  So my pixel c  Which I love your your tablet your crumb book almost died last night. Oh, no  So, uh, and I found out this is this is a known issue since for almost a year. They haven't fixed it  That's very irritating. So I had a finger  Unlock, right? Yeah, and to boot it worked fine  And then when you then went in on the security level to get in wrong pattern  I just used the same pattern pattern works. I did it again and again. I reboot it. No, nothing. Nothing  Look it up known issue with the pixel c  And fear of this or some isolated rumors of cases happening on this on the pixel phone  And it's been unfixed so I had no choice but to wipe the tablet and then it's okay now and i'm now using a number instead

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you always have a backup number, right? You can't you could have used that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Something you know, there's no way to get in try another method. No  No, Jeff is like I looked on the forums. Oh, that sucks  I did. Yeah, stacy. Are you gonna get the first wi-fi connected juicer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or are you gonna use your hands?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, okay y'all a four a four hundred dollar juicer was originally down from seven hundred dollars  Uh, is it the june juicer? The junior? It's the juicero. Well, that's what I thought  Maybe stacy would like one of these is really well made

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've tested it. I've i've actually okay. So really  Yes, yes, it's connected. So I know now from stacy  Here here's this is this is sad and you guys are gonna make fun of me  But I know doug evans the ce the former ceo and the founder of juicero  And everyone's making fun of this and i'm not i'm not saying they shouldn't make fun of the fact that there's a four hundred  Dollar juicer that squeezes these things but doug evans goal and the reason it raised so much money was not because of the juicer the press  the reason is because  Doug evans big goal in this company was to rethink how people got their food and got their vegetables and they wanted to  He wanted to create an accountable supply chain  for  Fresh greens and fresh juice and make it easy for people to consume  So the hardware was secondary to his vision. It was crucial to it, but it was  It was it's not what the company is about and I think what happened is he ended up  He over featured it he got  It's too much right and it became really expensive and we were in this  It it does. I mean like it takes a very disciplined product management manager person to say  Wait a second. This is not a good idea. We don't need the strength of two teslas  so  while everyone's mocking  Everyone involved for giving 120 to a connected juicer company that doesn't even require the juicer  That's actually not what this company's about. You know who agrees 100 with you  The ceo of the juicing company. No avanka trump. She loves the idea of daily cold press juice

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We can make it home  Yes, excellent, please  She even created a bit.ly link just for you  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think we also use the same makeup believe it or not. We are we have the same preference in one. I think it's our our  What's it called?  It's east san lauron touch nice magic magic magic eyeball toucher. Yeah, it's it's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a yeah, I don't I don't i'm not a makeup person. Um, your contouring is excellent. Don't give me that  Like I do not I do not know how still the queen of contour. She's watched all the videos  Did you read ben einstein's fabulous?  Bolt article about the juicer and how over engineered it is and by the way not in a bad way  I mean  He said of course if this were our investment we might have slowed them down a little bit but they did this stuff  This is like the if you were going to pick a squeezing device  that is made  To perfection this is it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the best squeezing device ever and it's just too bad that people might go out and get those juicero  pouches of already juiced  Vegetables, let's say that they're already juiced and squeeze them by hand

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you already juiced? The inside is is like it's the consistency of um frozen chopped spinach

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're saying the juicer is doing more than just extruding this from the bag it's actually processing it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not processing. It's just it's extruding. It's the raw vegetables that are and you just kind of squeeze it  Haven't you seen raw frozen spinach? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So is it any did the stuff you get any different from the juicer that you get from squeezing it with your hand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no. No, no, it's the same stuff. Okay, just checking  But in juicer has been open at the demos they showed they they will cut open a bag and they will show you the stuff inside

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they're so they should really just give away the juicer and charge 39 bucks a month for the bags

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The bags are very expensive. They're like six to eight bucks  But they could just do that the thing they're most concerned with like the accountability  I think they probably could have done with like a qr code or a scanner in an app. That's what he said

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He said no, the reason you need the wi-fi is it checks the date it makes sure it's you know, it's good  It uh, I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe they're selling my juice preferences back to boob or they are they're communicating things back to the farmers. I mean, oh  Again, is this?  This is not world solving world hunger. This is just to get people to eat locally organic vegetables

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  120 million dollars in venture capital

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But his goal was to disrupt the food supply chain. I mean  by by

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Letting people by making a billion dollars sending afforded selling a four hundred dollar juicer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Giving people the confidence. So selling it in an easy way giving people the confidence that it's you know  Whatever not expired which is a big problem actually with juice the the  Unpasteurized juice you could get a real juicer and buy fresh fruit and then you really don't do that  Oh, I mean think about sales of I mean  Sales of like microwave dinners, you know why people don't do it because it's hard to clean afterwards

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's easy to juice but hard to clean  I don't know. I mean will there be a big market in juicero bags or can you not get a subscription without buying the juicer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to have the juicer to get the bags. I believe

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or you could just eat the you could create a great market in them. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Again i'm not saying this is great. I just well he's at i'm sure out of business

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Probably maybe I don't know. Yeah, you never know silicon valley. I mean some of these companies  Go ahead  I was gonna say this isn't like q cat. I don't think no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or is it jesus? Oh, that was I sat in on the demonstrations of those guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was a qr code reader  the idea was you'd be reading a magazine and you'd want something in the magazine and  You'd have this thing it looked like I have one actually and you'd scan the barcode in the magazine  And then it would go to your computer because you did have a computer was connected by the serial port  And would go to the computer and launch the web page

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For that thing because because this because no one's ever going to do this thing called a url type out the urls never  Type out the address. No never going to happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, now we're getting image search for things on our phones and getting out

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, that's one of the things bigspie does do unless you're a verizon customer which when I kind of turned it off bigspie on this  S8 you take a picture of something. Here's my q cat look  Yeah, it exists. It's a little kitty  These came out of austin, I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so the guy who did it had these huge gold  Cufflinks, I'll never focused on this with the q cat logo on them  It was you know an aftershave you could smell for the next radio checks and it was just so slick. Yeah  um, I wonder if I go to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead  No, go if you go to get cat  Can you still own what I found interesting was

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was leo's point that that you have an idea about how to change something and you  As I do find this fascinating that he wants to change the supply chain here  uh, but  Um figuring out what the real value is of what you sell and what it's perceived as  Is everything so people perceived the value as the juicer and it was not it was the juice, right?  And and I have something to do the fact how you price it affected that perception 700 bucks. I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, totally. I mean and I think that's  When we take away when we're doing our business case studies about this  That's probably closer to the lesson you would take that you should take not not that this is absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't let your engineers over engineer your product  Probably, you know keep it on keep a lid on costs  That's you know what? I honor him  What's his name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Doug evans, he's he's he's such a hippie. He's a he's very he's not like  He's the polar opposite of 90 of the entrepreneurs. I mean except that he's got the same passion, right?  But he sandal wearing dude kind of chill

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He'll be back. He'll be back failure is not a stigma in silicon valley  It's a badge of honor

Transcript:  I don't think he's really a silicon valley dude to be honest from austin  No, no, I mean he's he he lives there but he's  He's not like that  Serial entrepreneur. He just saw a problem a way to solve a problem that he thought  Existed and you know, I
