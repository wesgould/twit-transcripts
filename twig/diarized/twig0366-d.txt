This Week in Google, the Googlers are assembling.  Jeff Jarvis is here from the City University of New York.  He's a professor of journalism at the Townite Center there.  Actually, you just started your new semester.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did.  I was brainwashing the incoming class.  I saw you in a picture of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They all look so smart and young and lively.  It's really neat.  That's exciting.  It is exciting.  I was thinking you'd be a good teacher.  I'll come and do a talk any time.  My son is about to graduate from college,  and he's a journalism major.  And I said, you should go to CUNY.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, yes, yes, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So maybe we can talk about that too.  Let's do.  I'd love for him to.  What he says he wants to do, I think  is probably a smart thing, is get a job first,  work for a little while, and then go to graduate school.  We have a fair amount of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why do you need a graduate school degree as a journalist?  I've never understood that.  That's Stacey Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She is a journalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Challenging me in my entire institution.  She's a real journalist, unlike me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's a real journalist and currently  is doing what most real journalists are doing,  her own thing at stacey on iot.com.  She's currently at the Intel Developers Forum  at Moscone Center in San Francisco.  Hi, Stacey.  Hi.  And Kevin Marks is joining us.  He's had so many jobs, he's decided not  to have any more jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I'm trying some new things,  but I'm doing little bits of journalism too now.  Are you?  I'm writing the odd thing, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice.  Kevin is a much valued advocate for the open web  and what he calls the indie web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nonetheless, nonetheless, I'm peeved at Kevin right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, good.  We can have a fight on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, what have I done?  Because I was gonna have a joke  that normally my face is all pink.  Oh, rats.  Today mine isn't and his is,  and the joke for me today would have been  that you know that Jarvis was named after me  and the next thing named after me was Fuchsia.  I was gonna have a Google operating system.  My face isn't pink and Kevin's is.  Kevin gets the Fuchsia joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know where to begin.  This is gonna be a jam packed episode.  I wouldn't mind starting with you, Stacey.  You're at IDF.  It's ongoing.  In fact, you're missing a session right now  that you really probably should be at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, how to design my own smart home  using Intel's new Jewel module.  What is Jewel?  It's a new dev board like Edison, only smaller.  It's got, I'm trying to remember if it has a curie or not.  You guys have to forgive me because,  oh my God, I've had very little sleep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're jet lagged, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I did.  I had to get up early this morning and yesterday morning.  Did you fly in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you didn't fly in this morning.  You flew in yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I flew in, no, but I did have to.  I had like a seven or seven o'clock call for rehearsals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's right, you did a session.  Was that this morning?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I interviewed Intel's head of IoT.  I'm not gonna say the name.  We talked about five.  Murthy, was it Murthy?  It was Murthy.  Nice.  So there you go.  So, Julie's computer.  You didn't have to say his full name?  I didn't.  He actually had to say mine, which, you know.  Heard about StairBlin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We tried, we really, really tried to train you  on how to say Murthy's name, but I guess it didn't stick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, the night after, I said it perfectly,  like three times, and I was so proud of myself.  I know what I do that to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what, Stacey, is I always say,  you know, you don't want to hear me introduce these people.  You want to hear them tell you about themselves.  Which. I always do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or sometimes I'll say, if I don't know somebody's name,  I'll say, and how do you spell that?  Dr. Venkata Rendhu Chintala, also known as Murthy.  Yes.  He is the president, client, and internet of things,  businesses, and systems architecture group.  Wow, what a title.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, he's a former Qualcommer.  He was, he was, been there.  He had been at Qualcomm forever.  So Intel getting him was a big coup.  So I would say, actually,  if you wanted to pick a big theme for the show,  it's that Intel is actually signaling very strongly  that it's going to be okay with non-X86 architectures.  So the big thing they did was they announced a partnership.  Sorry, they announced that they had taken an ARM.  They licensed ARM.  Was it architecture license?  Which kind of license is it?  I don't think it was an architecture license.  I was trying to find someone who had said that  and I could not.  So I can't tell you if it's architecture or not,  but they're using it to manufacture ARM-based chips.  And so this is, this is big for two reasons.  One, Intel's, they have billions of dollars invested  in their fabrication plants  and they have to keep those things running all the time.  It costs them huge amounts of money.  This gets them manufacturing the chips at the edge,  basically.  So they may have not one on mobile,  but they're like, eh, we'll just make them instead.  So it's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a really interesting strategy.  Cause of course, you know, traditionally you think of ARM  and Intel at odds, that they're competing architectures.  But of course, Intel has a lot of fabs.  They have a 10 nanometer process  and it makes perfect sense.  If you can't beat them, join them.  They're licensed the architecture.  You know, ARM doesn't make its own chips.  It licenses it to other manufacturers.  Why shouldn't Intel manufacture ARM processors  like Samsung and LG and everybody else?  And Qualcomm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the cool thing, what you'll see, my hunch is  you'll see a company like Apple  because Intel has the most advanced manufacturing.  Take a look at this and say, hmm,  and start moving their manufacturing from like Samsung,  maybe not TSMC over for a variety of reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Interesting.  Yeah, TSMC, the Taiwan Silicon Manufacturing Company makes,  looks like it's gonna have an exclusive this time around  on the new iPhone.  Ah, that makes sense.  For last year iPhone,  and there was this whole battle going on with,  well, whose chips are better?  Apple was sourcing chips from TSMC.  And was it Samsung was the other source?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Samsung, they had two different, this is super nerdy.  They were manufacturing using two different processes.  So, and I can't remember who was doing which one,  but one was like a FinFET process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  And yeah.  And then people were going back and forth with benchmarks.  Oh, you want the TSMC chip.  And it was crazy.  You can't tell the difference.  But I think it's interesting.  I don't think,  I think Apple doesn't want to buy anything from Samsung at all.  Right.  So it makes sense.  At the same time,  you don't want to single source something  that's that important.  If TSMC has a fire and can't build any chips,  you're in trouble.  So I don't think multiple-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everyone would be in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they wouldn't be alone exactly.  Yeah.  So I thought that was probably the most,  the biggest story was that Intel's gonna license ARM  and start manufacturing ARM chips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then, yes.  And then they showed off this little Project Euclid,  which is this little candy bar size device.  I wish, oh, I should have tried to steal one from the demos.  Thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, what happened to your klepto tendencies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.  Well, they guard these things pretty well.  I gotta be honest.  Anyway, this is for robotics.  And this is cool because it has a camera  with some computer vision.  It has sensors on it.  And the idea is you can,  and it supports two different robotics frameworks,  TurtleBot and Arduino.  And you can use it for a really high-end fancy robot  or a pretty chill low-key robot.  And you can build these apps,  like a Follow Me app, in 20 seconds.  They have this great, gooey interface  kinda combined with an IDE.  And you just are like,  I wanna turn on this type of intelligence  and this sensor and this one.  And you check off these boxes.  And then it basically, I guess it flashes it to the Euclid  and you stick it on your robot and it happens.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  First quarter 2017.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we have no word on pricing.  I was like, is it $100?  Like more, less?  He's like, I'm not telling you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Intel's RealSense technology is used in some computers.  And if you go to see a 49ers game,  and I'm sure it's true if you go see a Cowboys game,  or a Jets game, or a Giants game,  or they have this kind of  medieval Renaissance fair outside the front.  And one of the booths is the Intel RealSense booth.  It's kinda cool,  cause it'll take a picture of you and face paint you  with the 49er colors or whatever in real time.  Kinda like Masquerade does or the Snapchat things.  But that's the kind of technology that's in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think they have that here.  They had like a, get your picture or portrait painted  like an Italian masterpiece.  Exactly, yeah.  Which very applicable that is.  Same booth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Same booth.  Repurposed.  Instead of yellow and gold they have.  Or silver and black or whatever, they have something else.  I'm also interested,  and I know it's probably not up your alley  cause I don't know if this,  well, might have an impact in IoT devices.  It's something they're calling CrossPoint.  This is gonna be a joint venture with a crucial,  a micron that makes the crucial thing.  And it's a new kind of memory  that crosses the line between DRAM, traditional RAM,  and storage, NAND storage.  It's a thousand times faster than traditional NAND drives.  It's not quite as fast as RAM,  but it's fast enough to be used in lieu of RAM.  So imagine instead of the traditional setup on a PC  where you have storage that loads stuff into RAM  that the CPU gets access to,  and there's bottlenecks all along the way.  Instead, you have a huge chunk of CrossPoint memory  that might be terabytes that is used as RAM as well.  And it does make sense in IoT where speed is not critical.  It would greatly simplify IoT devices  because you don't have to have discrete RAM and storage.  It can all be one thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now Intel actually announced this.  Intel and Micron announced this last year.  Believe it or not.  Did they announce a ship date?  Is that what the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This year, the fall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the other thing is it's both a thousand times faster  and it can last through a thousand times more data rights,  which is interesting when you're kind of upgrading algorithms  and things like that for artificial intelligence.  But it's an entirely, it's a new type of memory.  So yes, like you said,  and this has been a 10-year effort.  And again, this is why Intel,  like becoming a manufacturer is really interesting  because they've spent a lot of money and effort  thinking about like new ways to just build chips.  And 3D CrossPoint is a new way to build memory.  So I think this is cool.  I mean, I will always think semiconductor manufacturing  is cool because I'm a big nerd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and I think Kevin, you probably can weigh on this,  this is the first fundamental architecture change  in how computers work since,  Alan Turing conceived of a Turing machine.  I mean, the idea of not having separate RAM,  separate memory and separate storage,  but of combining the two is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the Turing's abstraction didn't really-  He didn't mention storage and RAM.  His was an imaginary tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But when we started building them, that's what we did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's more of a challenge to the Voin-Neumann architecture  where there's a notion of a CPU  that has a small number of registers  and then successive layers of slower storage outside it.  And so if you actually look at it,  there's a sort of hierarchy of speed  between the different layers of the stack.  And this is blurring a couple of the layers.  Because in a sense, SSDs are kind of,  they're kind of RAM anyway.  They're treating memory as if it was storage.  They're just slow RAM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're random access though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they're random access.  You don't have the same performance penalty  of seeking that you do with spinning metal disks and things.  But it's still, it's a layer of like, is it in the CPU?  Is it on the chip?  Is there a cache there?  Is the cache there?  And as stuff fans out.  And a lot of performance work is spent working on  when things are moving from one cache  to another in the stack.  So, you know, I'm not sure how big a difference it makes  to actual sort of engineering designs.  Because a lot of engineering is spent  thinking about those transitions already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just, you know, here's why I'm thrilled to see it.  It's just, I was a little worried about Intel to be frank.  And it's nice to see that they have been innovating.  This reminds me a little bit of IBM in the day  where they really have deep R&D labs  and they have some really interesting stuff  that they're coming up with.  Stacey, what is the sense at the conference?  Are people excited about these new technologies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Most people are here kind of sad  because they feel like none of these things  are ready to take off in a sense  that would mitigate some of the loss of the PC business,  for example, or not loss, but.  Well, no, I mean, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, that's, it's been hurting Intel badly, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, yeah, and I do think that we're gonna see,  I don't know if Intel will be as big as it ever was,  but I don't think it's gonna go away.  And they have, it'll be really interesting  to see the fights that develop  because Intel's actually coming after almost everyone.  Like they're like, okay, fine,  we don't want anything at the edge,  but we're coming after the gateway boxes.  We're coming after the cellular RAN business,  that's radio access networks.  We're coming after like the cellular equipment business  and the core of the network.  And then again, where they've always been strong  in the data center and in the cloud,  but they are coming after with like the FPGAs  and the Nirvana buy, they're like,  ha ha, and Nvidia, we're coming after you.  They had, Intel and Nvidia had this little spat  over benchmarking in the last couple of days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll see about that one.  Yeah, I'm like, eh.  Yeah, I'm not sure I'd go head to head  with Nvidia at this point.  Yeah.  So anything else?  I mean, making arm chips is kind of amazing.  This cross point technology is very interesting  and the fact that it's so close, what else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm trying to think of the cool stuff that I've,  I have seen some fun things.  I've been hanging around in the maker area,  so I saw like toys battle.  I mean, some of this is just stuff you see  at every kind of maker fair kind of conference.  So I'm trying to think of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That real sense thing seems really cool.  Did anybody build anything with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's some robots.  There's actually a robot.  There's a demo here of a robot inventory management system.  I know you guys are like, oh my God, kill me.  I would have built battle bots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, Amazon needs these, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, it's this robot that goes zooming along your shelves  and it scans to see what you're missing, what you have.  It saves like a lot of work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  If Walmart's gonna compete with Amazon,  which they apparently wanna do,  they're gonna need some way to make it possible  to use their stores as fulfillment centers or something.  So maybe this is what that's aimed at, I don't know.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was gonna say Intel finally delivered  on their silicon photonics.  Silicon photonics is light waves on a chip  and it's moving data with light instead of electrons.  Wow.  So they had missed a couple deadlines,  but finally today they showed it  and it's a little laser integrated onto a chip  and it's like zoop, zoop and things go really fast.  Wow.  That was my scientific explanation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's a scientific explanation  on the relative speeds of cross point versus hard drives.  In the time it takes a hard drive,  if a storage device were a runner,  to sprint the length of a basketball court,  NAND memory, solid state drives, could run a marathon  and X point technology could circle the globe.  Do you hate this?  You hate this?  I hate these things.  It's so micro, it's so marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe it's because I kind of spend a lot of my time  trying to explain stuff to real people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How many chips do you pile upon each other  that they're gonna sell that will get you to the moon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well that is one of the things that's interesting  actually about cross point technology  is it's a lot more dense than a DRAM,  eight to 10 times more dense  because they're doing this kind of stacked layers of memory.  So you're gonna get a lot of storage  in a very small space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And stacking is the new way to get around Moore's law.  Maybe we need a stacking law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.  Oh really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh.  Instead of trying to increase density in two dimensions,  they're putting more layers on top of each other  and cross connecting them, yeah.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think this is really exciting.  I hope this isn't pie in the sky.  I hope it's not like the equivalent of nuclear fusion.  It seems to me this could completely change computing.  And IoT big time because this,  something that can last a really long time,  use very little battery and it's cheap  and not complex to make is exactly what you need for IoT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know that it's not complex to make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm sure it is initially and it's not cheap initially.  But I'm assuming Moore's new law  will lower the price of this.  Krasanich's law.  Krasanich's law.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm trying to think of the CEO of Micron.  Murty's law.  We could combine it with some unholy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You had Murphy's law, now you have Murty's law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You just tell him make a law.  It doesn't matter what it is.  It'll catch on.  So we're gonna take a break, but I'm curious.  I want you to, Jeff, explain why journalism school.  Because I let you off the hook,  but I'm gonna put you back on that hook in just a second,  especially since my son says,  hmm, maybe I will go to J school.  Our show today brought to you by The New Automatic.  Did you have one there?  Did you see it, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I haven't seen the new one.  I just, I've seen them before and played with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I love the old automatic.  I have them in all my cars.  The idea of the automatic, of course,  is it uses the OBD2 port in your car,  which every car built since 1996, even my Tesla has.  It's right under the steering wheel.  You'll see it there.  You connect the OBD2 device, the automatic, onto that,  and pair it with your phone by Bluetooth.  Now, your car is part of your quantified life.  You know, I mean, it's the obvious thing.  When a check engine light comes on,  you can see what's going on.  And actually, the app is very cool  because it'll also tell you the nearest repair shop.  But it does a whole lot more.  It'll keep track of, for instance,  it'll pair gas usage, accelerator usage, brake usage,  and put it all together in a trip,  a little trip packet that you can,  I have with if this and that uploading to my Evernote.  So every time I take a trip in my car,  I know exactly how much it costs,  how many time I brake hard,  how many times I went too, you know, accelerated too fast,  exactly a map of my trip.  It's really awesome.  This is even better.  The new, get ready, Automatic Pro is here.  What are they adding?  What could you possibly add to something that's so perfect?  3G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dun, dun, dun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unlimited 3G with no subscription.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What?  Oh, it's built into the price of the automatic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I guess it's like the Kindle whisper thing, right?  When Amazon was doing that.  So the adapter plugs in,  your driving data is relayed over 3G.  You could track everything in your Automatic Pro app.  And because it's on 3G, you could do crash alerts,  trained responders.  This is like, you know, like OnStar or something,  ready 24 seven, we'll contact you and emergency services  and loved ones if there's a serious accident.  What?  This is so cool.  You'll know where your car is all the time.  Now this is something I love about the Tesla app  is I could see a map when Lisa takes my car of where she is.  Now the Automatic will do that too.  It makes your car so smart.  Gives you so much information about what's going on  in your car.  Literally a map of where your car is right now.  There are lots of apps too.  If you've got a teen driver,  you can use the Automatic Pro or the regular Automatic  to help them be better drivers.  Even on Android, turn off texting during their trip.  You can see all the apps that it pairs with your Nest.  It'll turn on the thermostat when you're on your way home.  If this, then that.  You can ask your Amazon Echo how much gas is left in the car.  If you track business expenses,  you can use Concur, Expensify, FreshBooks.  They all interface to the Automatic.  So you can keep track of business mileage automatically.  You can even tie it to your Jawbone Up.  I'm not sure how that would work.  You walked two miles, but you drove 43.  I don't know.  Really neat stuff.  So are you interested?  Go to automatic.com slash twit for more information.  The Automatic Pro, now you'd expect this to cost a lot more.  The base Automatic, 99.95.  The Automatic Pro, 129.95, that's all.  And when you use our exclusive offer code, twit,  you'll save 20 bucks.  That pretty much brings it down to the original price.  So you're getting all that extra functionality,  basically for free.  Automatic.com slash twit.  Time for your new Automatic.  I am so excited about this.  I really am.  And you knew about it already.  They must've announced it earlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They announced it today.  Another note about this, like from a news,  not necessarily a selling on people perspective,  but Automatic is funded in part by USAA,  the insurance company, and having the 3G capability  is essential for being used for any sort of insurance efforts.  So my hunch is we'll see this soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm a USAA insurance customer.  I have a USAA investment and banking account too.  So that's great.  Yeah, I knew they were an investor, but that's really good.  Automatic, just like it sounds,  Automatic.com slash twit.  Find out about the new Automatic Pro.  That is really, really awesome.  Really, really awesome.  All right, back we come to this week in Google.  Anything else before we move on  from the Intel Developers Forum, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you see anything happening behind me, let me know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody's sneaking up behind you.  Da da da.  Da da da.  Da da da da.  She's in the press room right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am, you can tell, because no one here is well dressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Except the waiter is walking by in tuxedos.  If they had only gone to J-School,  they'd be well dressed, right, Jeff Jarvis?  Yeah, you bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I got an undergrad degree at Northwestern.  I did not get a graduate degree, I got jobs.  A couple things.  In my day, young children, in my day,  the way you worked up was I went to work  for the Berlin and Iowa Hawkeye and the Great Free Press,  and I worked up and up and up and up.  Chicago Tribune, Sarasota Examiner, Time Inc.  That's how you got the added training.  That doesn't exist anymore.  That path simply doesn't exist.  One.  Two, a lot of our students, our median age is 26, 27.  A lot of our students are career changers.  So they're coming to graduate school in journalism  to start in journalism, which makes a great deal of sense.  If you have an undergrad degree in journalism,  what we're finding is people are coming back  even later in their career, some right out of college,  and some later because they want to considerably  advance their skills.  That's what I told Henry to do.  I said get some real world experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He wants to work for Vice this summer as an internship,  something like that.  I said that's great.  I think he wants to be more in production.  I said that's less of a writer, more of video.  He looks at me and he says, boy, what you got is an easy job,  so I want to do that.  I think he kind of fantasizes about taking  Twitter over in a couple of years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's kind of neat to train him.  If you look at some of the families that have  trained their own heirs.  The New Houses in advance and so on.  The Salzburgers.  The Murdochs.  They get certain jobs as they go and learn the way up.  I'm happy if you ever want me to talk to Henry  about journalism careers.  I'd really be more than happy to sit down with him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I told him all about you.  I told him all about Jake too.  I said, Jeff's a great guy and he will be  a very good mentor for you.  The Bradleys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if I answered Stacey or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have yet to convince me.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you get a journalism degree, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did.  I have a B.J. from the University of Austin.  Nice.  Or University of Texas at Austin.  But the idea of going back to school in journalism

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  seems strange.  I think if you were lucky enough to have somebody like Jeff  as a professor that would change the equation.  Of course, journalism is changing rapidly.  Probably a lot of journalism schools  are trying to figure it out.  They have no idea.  They teach you how to, here's how you write a lead,  here's how you file your copy.  But I think when you have somebody like Jeff,  who's definitely got his finger on the pulse  of what's happening and what's changing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you're someone like Stacey, in all sincerity,  you're teaching yourself, you're working at places  where you're inventing businesses, inventing new things.  A lot of people who go out of J-school  land in newspapers that aren't changing.  And the only way they can get these new skills,  and they're not training anybody,  they're not updating your skills at all.  So the only way they're gonna get to learn  about new stuff is to go to school.  Could you teach it all yourself?  Yeah, you could, but you're busy as hell  being forced to write 87 blog posts a day.  It's a way you break out and try to move up in the world.  And then also, these days,  when I brainwashed the class today,  I took them through all kinds of new jobs  that didn't exist five years ago.  Product development is a huge new field.  Audience development, though I hate the title,  is important, social media, web video, data journalism.  These are all specialties where we've frankly  gotta do a better job too of teaching greater specialty.  Giving every student, it's what I call a skills transcript.  That every student has to have a certain level of skills  across a wide range of things now.  Every student has to know social media and data,  and obviously the web and web video and so on.  But then they need, in our research with employers,  they need what we call superpowers.  You need at least one.  You need to be really good at all of that  and plus knowing stories and knowing how to do facts  and all that.  But you also might need to be a specialist  in audience development or in social media or in web video  so that you have that extra value in getting a job.  And so they can come and they can concentrate enough  or become a documentary filmmaker  or whatever the hell they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would really love to learn data journalism  if I were going back to school right now.  I think that's fascinating.  There's a program.  It's the new kind of investigative reporting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, there's a San Marcos, Texas State University,  which is not like, whoa.  LBJ's home school.  Yes, yes.  So they actually have a data journalism master's program  and I've actually thought about, I'm like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wouldn't you love that?  See, now that we're all working,  it seems like it's extra luxury to be able to take a year  or two and go to school would be an incredible luxury.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  I'm like, can I just take some of these classes  every now and then and work on it  while I actually do my job?  You might be able to.  No, no, they're actually, I've talked to them before.  I've done some projects with local journalists down here  and they're like, yes, you should come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So one day.  Yeah, because that's the chance to go through stats  and data and visualization and all that too.  There's great programs there.  Plus we have an entrepreneurial program  where you learn to start a business and do so.  The new social journalism program  where we can reinvent journalism.  I'm working on a new degree right now.  So yeah, if I thought that I were leading students astray,  I'd obviously be a horrible fraud.  One thing I haven't learned in journalism school  is how to adjust this camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should teach that.  Actually, you can also use data, big data journalism  and investigative journalism for advocacy purposes.  I was just reading about Mr. Trump's new campaign manager  who is a former, was he executive editor  or chairman of Breitbart?  Chairman of Breitbart, yeah.  And so he is obviously a smart fellow  because besides doing the advocacy blogging at Breitbart,  which is very clearly aimed at promoting an agenda,  he also created a foundation to do,  and spent money on trying to get deep data information  that they could then go to mainstream press  like the New York Times with and say,  look, we've dug up the data here.  And that wins them over in a way that the advocacy does not.  Steve Bannon is his name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jay Rosen wrote it, I'm sorry, not Jay Rosen,  he linked to something today.  Ben Smith, the editor of Buzzfeed,  I'm putting it in the feed right now,  wrote a good piece today arguing that this is the final  merger of media and campaigns and politics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Interesting, but you know what,  that happened a long time ago with Karl Rove  and Roger Ailes and I remember when Nixon used admin,  it was like, oh my God, what a revolution.  And now it's like, that's clearly how you have  to win a campaign.  I don't know, we got a little sidetracked on the journalism.  Stacey's fault, blame Stacey.  You know what, I love talking about this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's-  Did you see the Mother Jones thing today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, about the prisons and the cost of reporting the story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that was interesting.  So basically, I put it in the chat room,  but they wrote a piece about,  you know, they did that great investigative work  on private prisons and it basically was like  an 18 month journalism project and they say it cost them  about $350,000 to do and they got about $5,000  in advertising on it despite getting a million views.  So they're saying, you know, we wanna keep doing this  and the way we're gonna keep doing this  is if you pay us to keep doing it,  so please sign up for subscriptions to us at $15 a month  and support us doing this kind of work.  So they're basically going for the NPR model,  which is, you know-  Yeah, and I think which is The Guardian is doing as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kath Feiner, the editor of The Guardian,  wrote a wonderful piece basically saying,  here's why you need us and their membership plan  has kind of shifted toward patronage.  And I think there isn't enough patronage  to support all the journalism in the world,  but the fine journalism like Mother Jones and The Guardian,  and when I pay the New York Times,  I'm paying them not to get access to content,  I'm paying them out of patronage, not out of support.  So he's in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  And yet, didn't the Wall Street Journal just the other day,  and I saw you gloating about this on Facebook.  And now-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I said I wasn't gloating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whereby I was gloating.  Gloat not, hashtag gloat not gloating.  It was a humble gloat.  Humble gloat.  Had it started to restructure its paywall.  Bricks out of the wall there.  Yeah, giving people more ways to read without paying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Days passes and social links and that kind of stuff.  Yeah, and there was also a piece of just-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does that mean that their paywall isn't working for them?  Because if it doesn't work for the Wall Street Journal,  it won't work for anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It means that there are things they can't do, right?  The reason they had to buy Market Watch  way back in the day was to get more reach,  so they could get that kind of advertising.  They want to get more conversion and more sampling,  so they need to get more people in.  They want to reduce the cost  of their subscriber acquisition cost,  whether you're a magazine or a website,  you have to pay to market.  So if people will sample your content,  that's a hell of a lot more efficient.  So in a sense, giving up some money in the paywall  for day passes or sampling or social links  is a way to get people in as marketing.  There was another piece just out this week  that said that basically apart from the New York Times  and the Journal at all,  paywalls are not working for newspapers.  And they're not-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that was tech debt, wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I'm not surprised.  I mean, there is the counter example of people  I think that's working, Jessica Lesson and Ben Thompson  at Stritechary, Jessica Lesson at The Information.  At a very high level.  Where, yeah, but I mean, well, okay, admittedly,  and she's $400 a year  and doesn't need more than maybe a few thousand subscribers  for it to be sensible and profitable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She could stand a few more bricks out of the wall  because I haven't paid the 400 for Jessica.  That's the problem.  And that's why you take the bricks out of the wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a promotional value.  And that's what Ben Thompson does.  He gives away a considerable number of one article a week  and then you pay and you get more.  And you do-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Doesn't he also have a windowing strategy  or where you get them later?  I don't know if he does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Philip Elmer DeWitt that we were talking to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's who, okay, yes, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  His Apple 2.0 blog.  Philip, of course, was at Fortune, as were you, I know,  and left not so long ago to create a blog.  And that's exactly what he does.  It's free to read after a few days.  So, we need all these different,  this is what happened with podcasting.  We had to figure out all these different ways to monetize  to figure out which ones work.  The nice thing about podcast,  our advantage in podcasting is we can do ads  that are not completely annoying  and they don't carry malware.  And I think we can do ads that serve our audience  to some degree as well as the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they're less trackable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and so far that doesn't matter so much.  To our advertisers, what it does mean is that advertisers,  it may mean we'll never get out from under  direct response ads, that we won't be able  to get much brand advertising, some say.  I disagree.  I think brands really can't track TV ads either.  They're used to doing research  and figuring out whether the ads are working.  I don't think trackable,  you can track a banner ad really well, right?  Does that help them be more effective?  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, no.  And neither need of advertising, how trackable is that?  The holy grail is to get from ad to intent,  ad to purchase, obviously.  I always say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's extremely hard to.  If we don't produce a return on investment  for our advertisers, they shouldn't buy ads with us.  And ultimately, that's the final metric,  it's the only metric that matters.  And they just have to have-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Consider Leo opening up a store.  I remember back in the days of the Trio blog.  And it was a great blog and it was amazing.  There was a blog about one product,  but I was a fanatic Trio user in the day.  So you read it.  It's how old I am, children.  And he started opening up a store selling accessories,  cases and all that stuff.  And that became the core of the business.  And for the Trio and then a few of the follow on things,  I never know what happened to them.  But the notion of commerce,  have you ever thought of just using Best Buy Amazon APIs  and creating commerce opportunity?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we do that.  I think, so a couple of things.  We used to have a,  I think we might still have a page that says,  not only here are our sponsors,  but if you want to support us  by this through this Amazon link.  We used to have a product picks page.  I don't think we ever brought that back,  but eventually we could.  It's some income, it's not enough.  It's not a huge amount of income,  especially when you have to hire somebody to do it.  Yeah, that's true.  We're actually very happy with our kind of simple model.  Yeah, you're driving a Tesla, probably.  It works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, don't mess with it.  I'm serious, like why?  You don't have to take over the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, in fact, that's the other thing.  At some point, any entrepreneur has to grapple with the idea.  Is this a lifestyle business?  Is this an Uber unicorn?  Is it something in between?  And I think we made this something in between,  which is we're not trying to get bigger, just better.  And our revenue's gone up steadily every year.  We make a decent amount of money now.  So yeah, why break it?  Not that I want to talk about myself.  Let's talk about Duo.  Or let's talk on Duo.  You want to talk on Duo?  So it came out today, or a couple of days ago.  I'm waiting for Allo.  When's Allo coming?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you go to the Play Store, you can say...  Yeah, I'm registered for it.  Yeah, I saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was weird.  Yeah, when I installed Duo, it said,  people also installed Allo.  I was like, no, they didn't.  This is a pro-bar piece of scam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but I had registered somehow.  I guess I went to a website.  So when I went to the Play Store before it either came out,  it said registered.  And then automatically, I got a notification when Duo came out.  It said, okay, you can download it now.  I presume I'll get the same thing with Allo.  I presume so.  These are both announced at the Google I.O.,  developers conference.  Duo is Google's FaceTime, basically.  Except unlike FaceTime, it's completely cross-platform.  It's based on an open standard as well, WebRTC.  This is just a WebRTC client, Kevin, right?  I think so, yeah.  Which is easy to do.  Kind of begs the question,  why did it take them so long to get this out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it can't just be WebRTC on iOS,  because they don't actually have WebRTC on iOS.  iOS was the hanger.  Yeah, so there's no WebRTC in Safari,  and you can't run another browser runtime.  So you've got to build it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's probably what takes,  because you could crank this out pretty quickly  using a WebView, right?  Anyway, it is point-to-point only.  Couple of interesting things people noticed, for instance,  you do not need a Google account.  When you put it on a phone,  you'll tie it to your phone's number.  Some people complain and say,  well, I don't want to have it on all my different devices.  Well, no, but that's the point,  is this is like your phone device.  It's like making a phone call.  So I'll call you, Jeff, so we can see.  It's a little dark in here.  So by the way, because I had talked to Jeff before,  his icon was right there on the front screen.  And this is kind of fun.  Watch, I tap my picture, and I'm full screen,  and then he's full screen.  I don't know what that's good for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, that's true.  Well, let me turn the volume down all the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't even know I could change the volume.  It's very simple.  The point is there's very few controls.  You could flip the camera from front to back  and back to front.  I don't know what else you can do with it.  We can talk.  We'll have a nice conversation.  I guess one of the best things is iOS and Android.  It is not available there.  Now I'm seeing Jeff's picture.  It is not available for desktop.  You can't, there are WebRTC clients,  but they don't interoperate with this.  iOS and Android only.  Also, and this is Florence Ion's article  going through some of the points, the knock-knock.  So when I called you, Jeff, let me hang up,  and you can call me Jeff.  Okay, fine.  All right.  So show my phone if you would, Josh.  So the knock-knock thing,  they talked about this at Google I.O.  When he starts to call me,  I'll immediately get a live image of Jeff.  And so I can decide whether to pick up based on,  oh, I can see him.  And I still haven't answered the call yet.  Boy, I wish you could see it.  I wish it were brighter.  You know, let me turn this up all the way.  Let me turn this up.  There we go.  Turn off auto, turn it up all the way.  All right, now, call me again, Jeff.  It hung up on you.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, it's checking it.  Okay, ready?  It gave up.  See, now you can see it, right?  So that, by the way, was from the desktop.  Please, Leo, please answer my call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Please, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't get audio, I think.  And then I swipe up.  I'm feeling very low.  And he goes from kind of this dim black and white guy  to the colorful pink guy.  To the pink guy.  Yeah.  Picture's good, right?  Look how good the picture is.  I think it works great.  Doesn't, you can't do sideways though, right?  Or can you?  What happens if I turn it sideways?  Do you?  No.  Oh, so we can.  No.  So we could use this, I guess, on the show,  except we can't get rid of these controls.  But, or maybe we can.  I haven't played with it that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, okay, yeah, all right.  So I'm gonna be obnoxious.  Now I'm gonna try to force you  to use this for me in the show, yes.  We could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Next time in a hotel.  I would.  You know what?  It would probably work better, wouldn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So does it work on tablets or only on phones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was designed for phones, they said,  but I think it works on tablets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you could put it on your iOS device  if you had a Google voice number, for instance,  and you could get,  because the way you verify the number is it sends a text.  If you are on the same phone,  it will auto enter the text, right?  But I noticed that if it doesn't do that,  yeah, I think I put it on my iPad, actually.  You could enter the text in by hand.  So I think you can use it on a tablet.  Quality looks good.  Yeah.  Quality looks great, actually.  I'm kind of blown away by the quality.  It's better than, we should probably start using it.  Actually, we can't use this.  You know why we can't?  Because you can't get it off the phone.  Yeah.  We'd have to hook a phone up to our system.  Skype-O-Saurus is Windows machines.  Well, you could Chromecast it.  Oh, I can Chromecast it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You Chromecast it into something that will...  That wouldn't hurt the latency at all, would it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it doesn't.  You'd have to Chromecast the whole thing.  It doesn't have many controls.  I mean, if there's a negative, it's not very fancy.  It's a video only.  It doesn't work with any other Google product,  including Allo.  You already...  Really?  Yeah.  We have video calling probably on Facebook Messenger  and WhatsApp Messenger and Skype,  and so do many of the people you converse with.  So that's probably the biggest knock,  and it's true of any of them,  is you have to have somebody  that's using it on your phone book.  Now, the way we did this is Jeff's in my contacts list.  So he showed up in my Allo contacts.  Once he...  I mean, sorry, your Duo contacts, once he installed Duo.  So that's pretty transparent.  You just have to get everybody you know to talk to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So in market positioning,  what's the advantage of Duo versus everything else?  Just cross platform?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kevin, why is Google doing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Who knows?  You know, they showed it off at I.O.,  and they said the point of this is that it's really simple.  That was their pitch, as far as I could tell.  It's true. It's one button.  It is.  I mean, the thing is that video calling is like,  it's not magic anymore.  It's something anyone can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's ubiquitous.  It's the Netflix of your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Five years ago when we were playing around with this,  it was hard.  Actually, 10 years ago,  we were playing around with this in computers only.  But the point is it's now table stakes.  All the things can do video chat.  And so I think they just tried to wrap this up  in the simplest possible thing.  They charged the phone number  so that it just feels like I've made a video call.  And then that's the thing that you can work  for Android and IOS.  I mean, the thing is you could do this  with Hangouts already.  But it's the bit that's slightly weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but Hangouts are always so quirky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Hangouts always has,  like the app has accreted so much stuff  that it's quite hard to work out what you're doing with it.  So they announced this week  that they're dropping Hangouts on air as well.  So they may be slimming this down a bit  and making it less of a sort of Swiss army knife thing.  But there was also links in with Google Plus  and all sorts of other random pieces that joined together.  So if they're actually gonna streamline these products,  I mean, that would be good,  but they don't seem to be doing this.  They seem to be adding more new ones  rather than saying, oh, of the six chat apps we've got,  let's consolidate them and make them coherent.  I've still got six ways of getting text messages  on my phone, three of them controlled by Google.  And it's confusing as anything.  So it's a single function thing.  It makes a bit more sense as that,  but I'm slightly puzzled by it  and I'm not sure how I'd use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I also,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm probably more likely to use Facebook Messages  than video chat,  because it's in the client  that I'm actually talking to people on.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I also think nobody wants to make video calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's not true.  Okay, so my daughter who's nine  and kids who are younger,  that's what they expect.  They do.  Oh, that's interesting.  So like if I call her and I call her on the phone,  she actually holds the phone in front of it.  She does, this is how she talks on the phone,  no matter what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really?  So.  I thought that was the Kim Kardashian thing.  Oh, let me ask you this.  She doesn't know that.  Right, but she's too young.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But there is that as well.  There is the talking to your phone on speaker phone  is a thing that's a reality TV trope,  but people have picked up on it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that what that is?  So when people are walking on the street talking like this?  Yeah.  This is the equivalent of the old French cigarette thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well I think it did start with the Kardashians,  because of course in order to video people having phone calls,  you have to do that.  Oh, so obnoxious.  It's really obnoxious, but it's interesting  how that's become, oh, Koran,  and it is the worst thing ever.  Ever you can hear the call, it's just so annoying.  It's just terrible.  And it just looks ridiculous.  It should be banned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So mine is doing it looking for a person's face.  She's not doing it because.  No, no, she's doing it, it makes more sense.  I get this.  No, that's why I'm interested,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because she's a new generation and she is doing it.  So that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And like my friend who's got a four year old,  he travels like 200 and something odd days a year,  and his daughter doesn't even know what a phone call is.  A phone call is FaceTime for them.  So like when she saw me, she was over at our house  and she saw me talking on my phone,  she just, she's like, what are you doing?  And I was like, oh, I'm talking on the phone.  She's like, I can't see you.  And I was like, well, yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And she's like, how are you talking on the phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was fun.  You know, I thought it was interesting on Twitter.  On Sunday, we had Alex, among others,  had Alex Wilhelm, who's a millennial.  And he said, I don't have a phone icon  on the front of my smartphone anymore.  I don't, I took that off.  Wow.  And I thought about it and I thought,  you know, I never use the phone either.  Yeah.  If I'm gonna use, if I'm gonna call somebody,  I'll call them director.  I'll say, okay, Google maybe, but I've never, sorry.  I'm not talking to you Google, so go away.  I never use that.  So I'm gonna try, as an experiment,  I'm removing the phone icon from my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so you're like an aging millennial now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wanna be like you young people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am not a millennial.  I'm an exer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're an exer?  What am I?  I'm a boomer.  We're boomers, right, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you guys are boomers.  Us exes are lost in the middle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then there's the whys.  Like why?  So, okay, so all right, I'll stand corrected.  I actually do use FaceTime every time I call my mom.  I was gonna say every week,  but every time I call my mom, she likes that.  So when you're visiting with somebody  or you miss somebody or a family member,  video calls are great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, after the show, my hard stop is to video my daughter  and see how the first day of school went.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So.  Oh, today's the first day of school?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, no, we do it with our sons in the UK.  And randomly, a mixture of Skype and Facebook Messenger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Skype's even suffering from this  because it is built into all the Messenger programs now  and you already have somebody in the Messenger program.  Just makes sense to do a video call that way.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does, curiosity, I don't know,  does Facebook still use Skype?  They used to.  Or they have their own protocol now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, they have their own stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Everybody should, I think, I'll bet you  the number one reason for a duo  is to raise awareness of WebRTC,  which is a great technology,  and I don't think is widely known.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the thing is, it's still a silo.  It doesn't actually interoperate with WebRTC,  as far as I can tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it doesn't, that's true.  That's a stupid thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, so, I mean, the thing that,  Hangouts is built on the same basic stack  and it was designed to go between desktop and phone  and go everywhere.  But part of that is what makes it a little bit clunky to use.  Whereas I think this is, they've started from,  okay, I want a one button way to call people.  And they've got the knock-knock thing,  which is, I'm not sure,  I'm not completely convinced by that product decision.  I haven't actually been through the,  do you have to approve people  before they can do that to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you can block them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But they may already have exposed themselves  to your points.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the bit that makes me nervous.  I agree.  I don't want to, that's the first thought I had is,  oh, I know what I'm going to be getting.  But that's probably why it uses phone numbers, right?  Because it's presumed to be a little more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But how does it then know that the other person has Duo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it does, because as soon as you install Duo,  you're suddenly showed up.  Or you're in their directory.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they then know everybody who has Duo.  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, in the same way that WhatsApp knows  who you've got WhatsApp and who's just a phone number,  right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, WhatsApp uses the phone number  to figure out who you know.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if I have a bunch of people in my phone,  like my work contacts as part of my Google account,  those people are going to automatically be able to call me  if I download Duo and they have it.  Yep.  Oh, that sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, do you, they already have your phone number.  I know, but.  They could call you on the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have my curlers in.  And I don't like.  Well.  I guess I ignore them.  I don't have to see their faces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can disable that part.  There should be a way to forward to voice.  Wouldn't that be nice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's exactly, or at least you have to throw out the camera.  Same as you can on Skype.  Just I'm going to do a voice call instead of a video call.  Yeah.  There's a one button solution for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But this, but yeah, the phone number binding thing  is a bit weird.  Signal does this too, which is even weirder.  So, you know, Signal was the likely encrypted chat app.  Oh yeah.  And it's secure and it's supposed to be a good thing  for journalists to use for sources and stuff like that.  Except that because it uses phone number,  it does the your friend just join Signal thing.  It's like, my friend probably just joined Signal  to do something confidential.  You notify me about that is not actually a good signal.  It's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's terrible.  Yeah, that's a leak.  It's an information leak.  A metadata leak.  It's not even metadata.  That's real data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, you know, I mean, WhatsApp was very successful with this.  So that's the model they're copying.  So WhatsApp said, okay, you've got a phone number.  We will use the phone number.  That's all you have to do.  We'll bootstrap off that.  We're just replacing text messaging with our infrastructure.  So instead of actually paying the phone company,  you're just paying data  and you're probably not paying much for data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The larger story here has nothing to do with Duo,  but just the fact that the carrier's infrastructure  for making phone calls is rapidly being usurped,  just as the cable companies has been, by the internet.  And increasingly, I mean, your daughter probably  won't make telephone calls in her life.  She'll be doing data calls from now on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was it 2012 or 2014 that data surpassed voice?  But the carriers have known this was coming for a long time.  They tried to do a bunch of things to stop it.  The FCC was like, stop trying to do that.  And now they've kind of accepted it to a certain extent.  They've built all these apps of their own,  trying to kind of compete with the massive web companies.  Although, and Kevin, I don't know if you know about this,  did you see how the EU is looking at imposing  some of the same burdens on the infrastructure,  so the Facebooks and Skypes of the world,  as they are on carriers as part of kind of a telecom relations?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, no, maybe?  Yes, I've seen bits of that.  I haven't actually followed the latest edition,  but they've done effectively,  is it sort of common carrier type rules?  But they've also previously done things about broadcasting.  So they basically tried to take television broadcasting rules  and apply that to online video and things,  which is a less coherent mapping.  Because obviously, and the problem is that the EU rules  were all written at the time  when there was a state monopoly broadcast  and a state monopoly phone company.  And in lots of European companies, there still kind of is,  but that has changed.  And so they're going, they've sort of,  they've got a mapping problem  they're trying to make sense of there.  But I haven't seen the specific ones  about the phone things here.  I mean, is it 9-11 type regs and those kinds of things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm waiting for my Forbes quote of the day  to get out of my way so I can...  Oh, we've all been there.  Okay, so let's see, stop, stop.  Okay, so it is the European Commission  is preparing to announce a review  of the EU's e-privacy law later this year.  And it will include new measures forcing quote unquote,  over the top messaging services  to follow the same kinds of privacy rules that telcos do.  So this is Facebook, oh, there's noise.  That's all right, we barely read.  Facebook, Skype, et cetera, Viber, all these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, there's kind of an irony there  because I would say in some cases,  these are much more private systems.  For instance, Duo is end-to-end encrypted.  Your phone call isn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, the governments hate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know, I know.  Oh, I get it, I misinterpreted that.  I thought they wanted the internet communications  to rise to the level of the telcos privacy.  They want them to fall to the level of telco privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's the other half of this.  Some of this is interception rules.  So that's the place where we want to be able to wiretap you.  The British government has been making noises  along these lines about outlawing encryption.  And the change of prime minister  was not gonna make a lot of difference  because the prime minister,  the previous secretary was pushing this very hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Theresa May is the Snoopers Charter's sponsor.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So there's that level of staff.  The other thing is that they have,  the sort of the actual privacy thing  is a data protection staff,  where they say in order to share information about people,  you have to have consent  and you have to be able to give that information to people.  So, you know, in terms, like in the American companies,  they create this database of who knows whom  and the context and stuff like that.  The metadata. Then they're using that  to cross construct other things.  In the EU, that would require them to file some forms  and make sure that they're fitting regulations.  So it is sort of a slight difference  of regulatory point of view there.  But the intercession stuff is gonna be tricky.  And again, I'm not sure that's consistently agreed  across Europe either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think that's why you're seeing a rush,  a land rush for these encrypted applications.  Why WhatsApp and,  and Facebook and Google are all adopting end to end encryption  to preempt any measures by governments.  Although it doesn't mean the government can't do it,  but what it does do is that it means the government now  has to face the prospect of losing Facebook  and losing WhatsApp.  And you saw what happened in Brazil  when they tried to shut down WhatsApp.  Yeah.  I mean, I understand Putin's government has, you know,  Putin signed an order that required that.  I don't know what the upshot of it is.  I haven't heard anything since.  I'm sure his state police told him,  well, you can order us to do that.  Doesn't mean we can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, but they, I mean, but that's, you know,  in Russia, they have their own Google equivalent,  their own Facebook equivalent.  They can be ordered to, right?  Under their thumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  But nobody, even Putin is gonna throw Facebook out of Russia  or WhatsApp or any number of apps or Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure what the relative penetration is there.  I haven't actually tried it recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe that's why you can do that there.  But it would also explain why Google might rush  to get this stuff out  and Facebook might rush to get this stuff out now.  So that it is a little harder to force a back door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The crypto community has been working hard  to encourage this and to push this for a while  and adjusting it so you actually got perfect forward secrecy  and things like that make a difference.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Perfect forward secrecy is crucial because that way,  you know, even if they've been collecting it,  they can't retroactively decrypt it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. If they get hold of your key,  they can't decrypt previous calls,  which is a problem with PGP  and the sort of first pass of encryption models  is that once you have the private key,  then you can decrypt everything that's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All the emails I've sent with my PGP key,  which is why, by the way,  you should change your PGP key fairly regularly,  but all the emails I've used the PGP key on  would be then compromised the minute they get the key,  not with perfect forward secrecy.  Those remain encrypted conversations.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's basically automating that key changing, in effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  Fuchsia.  That's Kevin Mark's skin tone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And.  I need a different color backdrop  to make me look less pink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's appropriate that you're here, Kevin,  because you're probably the only person  that explains, could explain.  I've been waiting for this.  What this is all about.  So.  I need to read about it first, but okay.  Oh, well, I'll tell you,  I'll tell you a little of what I know about it.  Google posted on GitHub an open source version  of what they're saying will be a new operating system.  It uses a little kernel,  which is a kind of a real time extra small kernel.  And it is, according to Google,  appropriate for every operating system,  every setup from IoT all the way up to desktop.  And a lot of what we've gleaned,  we've actually learned from just going to the GitHub post,  because all the source code is already up.  And you can see what kernel,  they call the kernel the magenta kernel,  but it is based on little kernel.  Is it called little kernel?  I think it's called little kernel.  So this is post Linux?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's instead of Linux, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And let's see, relationship with LK.  LK is a kernel designed for small systems,  typically embedded.  So it's a real time operating system for embedded.  Fuchsia could be used that way,  but magenta has additional features  like first class user mode support,  an object handle system,  and capability based security model  that little kernel does not have.  Presumably because they want to make it available  on the desktop as well.  So this Fuchsia thing is very interesting.  Why?  Google already has two operating systems,  Chrome OS and Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, part of it is that those are both on Linux  and they've done some work to converge  their Linux kernel between them,  but that's not, I'm not sure that's fully,  I forgot the name of the project,  but they did some work to try and do that.  But then there's a bunch of sort of baked in assumptions  in Linux that may make it harder to do some things.  The obvious one is the way audio works there,  which is clearly worse on Linux than it is on the  iOS kernel.  There's a lot of latency.  Because it's a push model rather than a pull model,  which means you end up accumulating buffers.  So it may be that they've started to step back and say,  rather than try and make that kind of deep change to Linux,  it may be easier to start with something else  and just put our system over there on top.  But the other thing is, this is Google,  it may be an experiment.  Just because Google has published something  doesn't mean this is their strategic direction.  They have lots of parallel things going on at once.  The difference between them and Apple is  they do them slightly more in public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For all we know, this is somebody's 20% project, right?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now Apple built several different operating system  things internally, but only shipped a few of them.  And Google is probably doing the same thing,  but maybe with a slightly more visibility here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The tagline, and maybe you can help us understand this,  pink plus purple equals fuchsia.  Now I do remember there was a pink operating system.  This was an Apple IBM joint venture, right?  Yes.  But I don't know if that's what they mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not sure what the reference is there.  Yeah, that was a long time ago.  That was like 20 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think it could be that.  And I don't know what purple is.  The only purple I can remember is Libpurple,  which is the libraries that allow you to do messaging  with Pigeon and other messaging programs.  So I'm not sure what pink plus purple equals.  I'm not quite sure what that is.  Maybe it's just a color lesson.  Someday we'll all know.  I think it's intentionally unclear, which is fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the new wave Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Google Plus.  Gosh, that still breaks my heart.  We hardly knew ye.  We hardly knew ye.  No one knew ye.  That was the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yeah, so my sort of bottom line here is  it's another operating system experiment at Google.  There's lots of things they could be planning  to use it for, we don't know yet.  It doesn't have Java in it.  It uses Dart, right?  Well, I'm suspicious that they use Dart.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Based on Dart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They said it's written in Dart.  Based on Dart.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Dart, if it's actually a code

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that doesn't make any difference.  What they would want to do is get a stack up running  on a particular code.  What they would want to do is get a stack up running on it.  They can run Chrome and Android and things on top of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is Dart LL, what is it?  LVM, what is it?  LVM, what is it Dart?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Google compiled LVM.  I mean, Dart is basically like mutant JavaScript.  That's a bit more Java.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but an operating system written in JavaScript,  now the future is here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, but we've had those.  Only toys.  That was Palm OS and Firefox OS.  We've had those.  I mean, my TV is being run by one.  Right.  The LG TV that has a-  I do too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's Palm OS.  It's so funny.  I look at it and I go, oh.  This is kind of-  There's no cards, but I feel like there's,  in that interface, there's stuff popping up.  I feel like those could be cards.  Yes.  They just haven't popped them up yet or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A little card at the bottom  that you can turn into full screen apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's kind of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But yeah, you know, there's,  so it's a project.  We don't know what size of a project is.  And to say, oh, this is going to take over  from the other ones.  Well, that would be involved quite a lot of change  and not that likely.  But you could think,  I think the reason there's just speculation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, that's obviously true.  The reason there's just speculation  is you can think of some business reasons  why Google would want to get out from under Java,  would want to get out from under Linux.  Samsung's doing Tizen for kind of the same reason  they want to get out from under Google.  Android.  Yeah.  You can kind of understand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But at some point, for it to be useful  as an operating system,  you have to put a web browser on it,  at which point you've put Chrome on it,  at which point you've recreated Chrome OS  with some missing plumbing,  with some different plumbing,  which is a perfectly sensible thing to do.  Android, there's more baggage there,  but they're working on making that work  because they're doing the Android on Chrome thing as well.  So in principle, you can do that.  In practice, there's a bunch of work to do  to make those bits combine,  and there's still the work to actually get the thing  ported to a bunch of lower level drivers  and stuff like that.  So when Firefox were bringing their things up,  they were basically building something  that would run on top of an Android phone  because that's what exists.  And this would be the same thing.  It's the question of what layer in the stack  are you suddenly deciding things are different?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll be talking about kernels next week on Security Now.  We were talking on the Twitter about micro kernels  versus whatever the opposite is,  big normal kernels and tiny kernel and little kernel,  and Steve wanted to clarify everything for us.  So if you're interested in kernels,  the notion of kernels,  having to do with this as well with Fuchsia  next Wednesday at Security Now.  Google is killing Hangouts on Air,  or well, at least shifting it away from Google Plus  and making it YouTube Live.  Another blow to Hangouts,  I just don't get what's going on with Hangouts.  I really don't.  I don't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It can't die soon enough for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't like it?  Well, you don't need to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, no, I know.  But every time I try to use it, just it never worked.  I love it in theory.  I love the idea that I could be talking to someone  and be like, hey, let's take this to,  like I am-ing someone and be like,  hey, let's take it to voice  or let me show you something on video.  But it's not that easy.  I don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Google even says when you get Google Fi,  oh, don't use Hangouts anymore.  You should be using Messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is a very, by the way, nothing program.  Doesn't do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep.  Well, the thing is they had the SMS app  that was part of the built-in Android one,  the source one.  And then they said, oh, we'll use Hangouts.  And then they thought Messages.  And then there's Google Voice.  So I've now got three separate Google apps  that want to take over my SMS.  Yeah, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not to mention Facebook Messenger,  which I used for a while.  Yes.  I can't wait to, I guess, will Allo be,  will it take over for Hangouts?  Will it be the new thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, but I suspect that's what they're thinking.  They're saying, okay, we're gonna refactor this  into separate stuff.  And obviously it's much more fun to work on  a shiny new product than it is to keep the old one running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's, by the way, was it you who said that,  that's the structural problem within Google.  There's the engineers are allowed to choose  what projects they want to work on.  So you always, all the shiny new stuff  gets all the attention.  And it's hard to get a good engineer  to keep working on the kind of maintenance.  I'm not sure that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think, maintenance is respected there as well.  They do reward that too.  So it's not just like, but,  Apple has that problem too.  Apple is very bad at, well, has been in the past,  oh, let's make a new thing rather than

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  maintain the old one.  Yeah, nobody's maintaining iTunes apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, so, do you remember iChat?  iChat was actually pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  iChat was good, yeah, and it was standards based.  Wasn't it XMP?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was XMPP, it would interoperate with.  That's what killed, by the way, can I just.  The video chat on that was standardized as well.  Yeah.  And then they never pointed that to iOS  and then they went away and built FaceTime.  And Steve Jobs says, oh, we'll open source this tomorrow.  Never did, never did.  We're still waiting.  Yeah.  So yeah, to say this, actually the company  that's most coherent about this has been Facebook.  Even there, they bought another company  because the other company is successful.  But if you actually look at the way that Messenger works,  it's a lot more coherent than the Google thing was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How old would you guess Hangouts is?  Don't say if you know.  When did it come out?  Yeah, don't try to figure it out.  It was five years, 10 years, how long?  Have we had it a long time?  Feels like we've had a long time.  It's three years old, you're right, Jeff.  Three years old, that's all.  Hangouts only three years old.  That's all it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  It would be a little bit of good data journalism  to do a kind of half-life of Google projects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, well that's the site death page on IndieWeb.  You've seen that.  IndieWeb.org slash site, site hyphen deaths  as the list of all the things that have been abandoned  and lost people's data.  And it's a long list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, by the way,  how do you feel about XMPP disappearing?  I was really excited about XMPP  and I was really disappointed that Google abandoned it.  Was there a good technical reason for that, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a complicated protocol.  It was very XML heavy and there was a bunch of cruft in it.  So you could probably make a case  that you could do things more optimally  than sending stuff that way.  But there was a nice action with it.  And it was used by Facebook and Google and AOL  and a bunch of people.  You could actually interrupt with it  and then that gradually got broken.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like all of this that we're talking about  would have been eliminated  if everybody had just gotten behind XMPP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To some extent, but the problem is  it was bound to email addresses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was federatable.  Well, that's another thing, by the way.  Why are we bound to phone numbers,  especially if the telephone service is done?  Why is POTS our unique number?  Why isn't it an email address?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, can you imagine a date pretty soon  just as you don't have a landline,  you don't have a phone, you have a connected computer?  Why do you need a landline?  What do you need a landline for?  And a phone number is not memorable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why a phone number?  Why not an email address or something else?  But why not an email?  And XMPP was interoperable.  It was federatable.  It was very flexible.  Yeah, I know it was XML, but it was very, because of that,  it was very parsable and extensible.  It was highly extensible.  That makes me sad.  Here's the list of site deaths.  When sites go offline, taking your content with them.  You can see them all as you scroll.  Upcoming ones and then.  Any day now, paper data app, Gatorius.  Are you doing physical devices too,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  or just software services and software products?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We could do physical, we'll accept that as a wiki,  but it was mostly software products.  It started out with, yeah.  This is fun.  Oh yeah, claim ID.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was really into that.  Everpix, remember that?  Oh man, this is depressing.  Lava bit, we know why they went out of business.  This is fun.  I'm glad somebody put this together.  What's the CMS on this, by the way?  Is this a wiki?  It's MediaWiki.  MediaWiki.  Love MediaWiki.  Thank you, MediaWiki.  So it's kind of a heavyweight wiki, but it works.  Gets the job done.  Twitpick, remember them?  Glad they went away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they kind of got eaten by their.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're still around.  Someday Twitter, is Twitter on this list?  Oh, I know, you know what?  I'm sorry.  No, Twitter is, didn't you love the article?  Twitter is a honeypot for eight holes.  Well researched.  It was.  And it kind of said it all.  And Twitter's response was the most anemic response ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they've always made an anemic response.  I mean, the interesting thing for me reading that was  remembering Ariel's initial complaints about it,  because they brought up Ariel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't realize Ariel had been, very early on.  She's wonderful.  What a terrible story.  And that's how this begins.  This is Charlie Walsall's Buzzfeed article  inside Twitter's 10 year failure to stop harassment.  What I didn't realize is one of the very first people  to be harassed was Ariel Waldman in 2008,  when Twitter was about a year old.  And Jack Dorsey promised to fix it, never did.  Nobody fixed it, never did.  She still uses Twitter.  She still loves Twitter.  Because what, Stockholm syndrome?  Because.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, because no, people are still there.  I mean, the thing is, in her initial case,  it was someone who'd been stalking her elsewhere  and had moved onto Twitter as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twitter gave them, Twitter was like fertilizer.  It was like sunshine, rain,  and just everything it needed to grow.  Well, that's.  Control food under the bridge.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just linked to my piece I read in 2014 on this,  which was, for me, it was a structural thing,  which was that the thing that they changed.  At the time, looking back at the responses  they made to Ariel in 2008, they were basically saying,  no, no, Twitter isn't a platform for harassment  because you choose what you see.  You don't, it's not a place  that people can just come at you.  You have to go to your app to see it,  and by default, you won't see it in your stream.  And that was true in 2008,  and they broke that gradually over the years.  And they switched it from a place  where your primary view was of things  you'd chosen to follow.  Like Google+.  To now, the most urgent thing that can happen  is somebody has added you,  which means it's become a spoken email inbox.  And also, under your tweet, any response  from any random person is shown  in chronological order and threaded,  so it's also brought in the worst of blog comments as well.  So they managed to combine the worst of email addresses,  having an open address that you can't turn stuff off,  with the worst of blog comments  in the service of increasing interaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As a friend of mine, as Google said a long ago,  it's the problem, Kevin, we've talked about this too,  that when things are sender controlled,  the recipient becomes the victim.  Yes.  So as you saw that Leslie Jones,  victim of Twitter,  some pumpery,  just started the hashtag supporting Gabby Douglas  for all the hell that she's gone through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was great.  Why do we keep going back there?  It's not that good.  I think we can do without it.  Why do people keep going back?  Why is Stephen Fry back on Twitter?  Why did Leslie Jones go back?  Because they suspended Milo Yiannopoulos,  but that was the guy.  It was the least of it.  And it's like we want to stay on Twitter,  but why?  I don't understand the loyalty to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, there's two things going on there.  Well, one is it's the memory of when it was good.  In the same way that we keep using email,  even though most of it is spam.  I stopped using that too, yeah.  We kind of remember when getting an email  from someone you didn't know was an assignment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like me and Taco Bell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nostalgia, you're saying, or Chipotle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, so it's...  Yeah.  There is a set of us who got on Twitter early  who had this mode of talking in public  and having a conversation.  Oh, it was so awesome in the early days.  That picks up on the blogging model as well  of that semi-overlapping public  and the ability to see bits and pieces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I keep trying to use, you know,  StatusNet or the Open,  and it just doesn't have the same...  Yeah, it doesn't have the...  It doesn't have the critical mass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It gains from scale.  I mean, but the problem is,  the other thing that's...  You know, the reason this is hard  is that Twitter is built to move things  between these different subgroups.  And so it started out with just the subgroups,  but then there's ways of bridging between them  with hashtags, with hat replies, and so on,  so that you can move stuff from one place to another.  But it's hard to tell what is...  You know, just in systematic terms,  what is the big trend thing  that we should all be seeing  and a sort of attack on somebody else  without doing content analysis,  without actually checking it closely.  And that's the bit that's structurally difficult.  The other thing is,  Paul Ford called it the other day,  Twitter is the angry social network,  which I thought was a very good way of summing it up.  Twitter is basically the place  you go to shout out the cloud.  When you have bad service,  when you have bad service,  you go and shout at companies on Twitter.  And this is actually a good business for Twitter,  and to some extent for the companies,  because they're actually getting this feedback  and the ability to respond to people  who are the most upset customers in real time.  So there is a sort of structural value in that.  It was also the place where you complained  about your government and were able to start  revolutions of things and so on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there was that sense.  Where you tore down the government  by launching a presidential campaign at that, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but the challenge is,  it's a bit like,  you know the problem with Facebook is that  everyone you see on Facebook has more friends than you  and is having a better time.  Because A, the people who have more friends  spread more widely,  and B, you only post the positive things on Facebook.  So you have this effect that it feels like  your life is compared to what you see on Facebook.  Well, Twitter,  everyone you see on Twitter is angrier than you,  and also their anger is getting more traction than yours,  because of the same effect.  The angry things get traction,  they're spread, they're retweeted, they're shared.  That is amplified round in the loop.  So most tweets are,  if you actually just look at a stream of tweets at random,  most tweets are anodyne and calm and so on.  But that's not the perception you get when you look at Twitter.  You see it being this place that people shout at each other  because that's what's amplified.  And therefore, you start treating it  as the place you go to shout at people.  And so they've managed to take it from this,  the place where you would just send notes  about what you're doing your day  and your friends would see them  and tweet about your lunch or whatever it is,  to this place where it's the place you go to shout at people  that you don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why would you wanna go there?  I can understand why you'd wanna shout there,  but why would you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've learned about so many new,  I mean, like I follow such a diverse group of people.  And a lot of them are super nerdy.  And they'll start talking about, I don't know,  a new programming language or something they've seen  that they're excited about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I go to Hacker News for that.  There's lots of other places you can get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are, but I mean, Hacker News,  it's already been written by the time it's on Hacker News.  So as a journalist-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and I see people, I agree, Stacey.  I see people like, I just put something on the rundown  a second ago from Benedict Evans, Mark Andreessen,  quotes, Josh Marshall tweets.  I mean, there's Fred Wilson tweets.  There's just all kinds of amazing people there  who I wouldn't see otherwise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I mean, the other thing is,  I actually feel like I have a nice community on Twitter.  I have a lot of people who are engaged with me  on crazy questions about smart homes  or just tell me that I'm wrong in a respectful way  and then educate me, but not in a jerk way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Knock some wood, Stacey, knock some wood.  I guess, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I feel like, I don't know, I like it,  but I also feel that most human beings are good.  I do too, I used to anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do too, no, it's just the bad apples  that ruined the universe.  I swear to God, Twitter's ruined my opinion of humanity.  That's reason enough not to go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was the Twitter that was built.  The thing that they were saying in response to Eric  was you choose who you see, you choose who you hear from,  and you've got to make your choices.  So part of it was that, and those of us who spent time  deciding who we follow and so on, that still works.  But the challenge is for the signup flow now  forces you to follow publishing entities,  famous people, verified people, news sources, and so on.  It says, pick one of these, pick one of these,  pick one of these, we're not gonna let you go through  until you've got 30 people in your following stream  so you have something in your stream.  So the sense of actually choosing people to follow  organically has gone.  And they may have needed to do that  to get people to sign up at scale,  but what it means is most people's perception of Twitter  is that it's not that place where you have conversations  with people, it's a place where famous people  talk to each other and you sort of shout  into the void at them.  And that's part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twitter makes me feel like a battered husband,  and I suspect Ariel Wallman feels the same way.  And I feel like I just keep making excuses for it,  and I keep going back and I keep getting hit.  So here's the question, Leo,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because there was a lot of conflict with the Olympics  that Twitter was quick, taking down anything  with the IOC that said take down.  Oh yeah, oh yeah, they take down Ariel Wallman.  All right, so tomorrow you're in charge of Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I don't wanna be in charge of Twitter, no.  Then you fix it.  I'm gonna shut it down.  If I were in charge of it, I'd shut it down.  I'd give the shareholders their money back  and say thank you very much, bye bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Bye bye.  Well, I take that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you wanna do?  You know what, we have, and I apologize  for bringing this up again,  because we've really talked about this.  We've trashed this to death.  Add infinitum, ad nauseum, for years.  And this is part of the abuse cycle.  How could you fix this?  What would you do?  But it's so great, but there's so much there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, so the point is there isn't a quick fix.  The problem is it is a cultural problem,  and you would have to disentangle  the cultural elements in it.  So if I was put in charge of Twitter,  I would hire a bunch of sociologists,  analysts of that nature, to study this more closely,  and not just use simple engineering metrics  like engagement.  Bring Dana Boyd on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What does she have to do?  Go ahead, Ceci, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was gonna say bring Dana Boyd on.  She can hire her from Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But she's busy.  But yeah, basically hire a team of people like Dana  to analyze this and look at it from those perspectives.  Say what is this doing, how is this affecting things?  But also have this sense of,  I've written, the point is, if you think of it as publics,  this is a literary theory thing of each work has a public.  Each tweet has a public.  Each person's set of tweets has a public.  And the idea is the public is the people  that that thing was written for,  and then the people who respond to it and go to that.  And look at it in those terms,  and rethink it as this network of overlapping publics,  and think about how you can decide that  rather than to building a single overall ranking  and collection and most popular and most feeded,  work at how you can make those publics coexist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I also think we just have to get to the point  where you're gonna have trolls,  you have trolls in life, you have criminals in life,  you have people who need beds in life.  It's the problem with Twitter, the problem with all of this  is the encouragement that the same people give them  and the encouragement they get to do that.  Oh, that's so funny, oh, that's so wonderful,  let's go after.  And the reward systems are set up wrong,  and we've gotta change that fundamentally.  We gotta change the rest of society.  Kevin, I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not just about society.  It is, there is a difference,  there isn't a set of affordances  that amplify certain behaviors.  So, classically, if you have any discussion on an email list,  it will end up being a back and forth  with you quoting each other,  because that's how you discuss on email list.  If you have any discussion on a Wiki,  it will end up in an edit war,  because that's how you debate on Wikis.  You delete each other's stuff until there's something left.  And that can lead to a different outcome.  At least the Wiki, there'll be something at the end of it,  but you may have deleted all the argument,  but there'll be something there.  Whereas the email list, all there is is this giant  cross ongoing exchange that nobody cares about in the end.  And Twitter had picked up something from the blogging world,  which was this sense that you can't see  the whole conversation, but you can see bits of it  and follow parts of it and make sense.  But they atomized into these small pieces  that were kind of composable,  so you could have a conversation that went back and forth  without the effort of doing the block,  quote, response type stuff that we do  when we write the longer blog posts.  But as I say, the change they made in emphasizing  at replies without a sense of who you were following  kind of broke that model in that they've got bits of it  that can bring back, but they changed the default.  So the defaults are still designed to get stuff  to flow more quickly and amplify it.  And if you look at it as our goal is to get stuff  to spread more, that's what you do.  But actually a very small amount of Twitter  is that stuff that should spread that far  and cross all these groups.  And there's much more value in the stuff  that happens within groups.  So modeling that better and understanding  how you can do that would be the interesting part.  And they've probably spent a bunch of time looking at this  and trying to make sense of it,  but they have been very focused for obvious  and sensible reasons on making sure that the people  who have millions of followers and who are public figures  have that work for them.  And they somehow lost the middle of people  who suddenly become famous  or suddenly have their thing take off  and have sort of transitioned from I'm talking to 20 friends  to I'm suddenly in front of the entire world  and things are going weird.  Like Gabby Douglas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gabby Douglas.  That's so tragic.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But Gabby, you could predict that  because she was on television,  she had been bootstrapped from that platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, why does being intelligent make you a target,  a legitimate target?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And every argument is, oh, you're public,  you deserve this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She's an athlete.  But it means that you're a target for attention.  You certainly have a large amount of attention.  They can predict that.  They know to do this for contestants in American Idol,  things like that, they'll set them up,  they'll have someone work it out  so that they're filtered and modeling that.  That the tougher thing is when somebody makes that,  invents the hashtag that catches the political zeitgeist  and then they're rocketed to them  and then they become the target of the opposing faction  and who will then try and tear them down and work that out.  And that's when the harassment piles up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like it's facilitated  and the Gabby Douglas thing is a great example.  It's facilitated this kind of gotcha,  quick to judge, meaningless diatribe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People have always been like that.  Yeah, but no, of course they have,  but they haven't had a platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And now you can trash somebody.  I mean, you can really trash somebody.  You can cause somebody to lose their job.  You can put people in horrific,  you can have people kill themselves.  I mean, she was devastated  because she didn't put her hand over her heart.  Right.  I mean, this is ridiculous.  This is ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You could do that with a television station or a newspaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not in anywhere near this kind of pervasive evil way.  Yeah.  No, this is just...  It's just terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just terrible.  Anyway, I don't want to talk about it anymore.  My personal choice is not to have anything to do with it.  I don't even want to talk about  what withered Twitter anymore.  Ford had an event in Silicon Valley right before IDF,  coincidence, I don't know,  in which they announced by 2021,  wait a minute, let me check.  That's five years from now.  They're going to have a fleet of type four  fully autonomous cars operating in a ride hailing service.  What?  You think that's possible five years from now  that we'll be ride hailing a driverless vehicle?  No.  It's so funny because for years, for years,  when Alan Mulally was the CEO  and people were starting to talk about autonomous vehicles,  I would ask Alan every time I interviewed him,  so what's going on with Ford autonomous vehicles?  And he said, oh no, people love to drive.  We're never going to do autonomous vehicles.  I said, come on, you got a skunkworks.  You got a place in the back there.  Are you doing it?  No, people love to drive.  Now they've said, now level four is not fully autonomous.  It's one level below.  So you do need, I guess, a driver.  I'm not clear what Ford's saying they're going to do here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So to get a fully autonomous car,  like level five, is that NIST levels?  We need to have a regulatory overhaul  and insurance overhaul and a lot of big conversations.  So the idea that that's all going to happen before 2021,  I think is ludicrous.  So, and I think the media is somewhat complicit  in talking about autonomous vehicles and being like,  this is a self-driving car,  when in fact we shouldn't be calling them that.  We kind of got in trouble with that in Tesla,  with the autopilot.  Tesla also called it autopilot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think they were wrong to do that.  I think they still are, yeah.  They've stopped doing it in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, but I think that this idea is great  and we have a lot of technology  that's going to get us there by 2021.  We're going to have some really awesome vehicles on the road  and our participation could be very little,  but we're not going to be able to hop in our little pods  and have it zip us off places  and then go zip off and park on its own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they're saying level four,  but they're also saying that the biggest cost  of having a ride sharing service is the driver.  So it implies they're going to get rid of the driver.  So I don't know exactly.  Maybe I will have to sit behind the wheel of my taxi cab  just to make sure it doesn't run into something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No way, you can do that.  Because if you got, what if you got massively trashed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that's not going to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, so the point is it'll be a system  that works in certain areas  and it doesn't try and drive everywhere.  And it has, so it's basically like an automated bus route.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess when they say they plan to have a fleet,  it could be a fleet of a hundred vehicles  and it could be in Nebraska.  We don't, we're not sure what that means exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that would be a great place actually.  The control areas would be huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Make a lot of sense.  It's an easier problem in lots of ways, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tesla says that their next,  well, a rumor says that Tesla's next version  will be fully autonomous.  Autopilot 2.0.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the model three?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Elon Musk's goal is by 2019  to have a fully autonomous.  According to Jalopnik,  Tesla's next version of Autopilot may go fully autonomous.  Now version eight of the software is due soon, I think,  right?  I don't know if they're talking about that.  They're talking about a new sensor suite  that'll allow level three autonomous driving,  potentially level four fully autonomous driving  in a not too distant future.  More radar, front-facing radar,  plus side radar, plus a triple camera system.  So they're really trying to increase  the capabilities of the car.  Right now, I have a camera in the front,  a camera in the back, and I think radar,  and I can't remember, it's not anywhere near enough sensors  to really do even level three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Man, I have hopped a curb,  and the sensors did not help me in that situation.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, I don't know.  I can't decide if this is all,  if this is a hype that's years off,  kind of like artificial intelligence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have to get around, but in a way it's good.  And you're right, there's a huge regulatory hurdle too,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  not just a technical hurdle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this actually, by talking about it  and setting these deadlines,  even if we don't quite meet them in the way we hoped,  it does get people excited.  It gets, I mean, legislators are like,  ooh, now we should think about self-driving cars.  Right, I think that's what it says,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  is it puts osmotic pressure on them.  Get the conversation going, yeah.  And you have states competing with each other,  will be the first state with autonomous vehicles  and all that kind of stuff.  That makes sense, yeah.  Yeah, so it's a PR thing, I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But, did you guys see about Tesla camping?  Because that looks really exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a new kind of glamping.  What is Tesla camping?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, there's a Bloomberg had a story about it,  and I thought this was great,  because people drive their Tesla Model 3s back  out into the woods, and they leave them on all night,  because you can have air conditioning  and bugs don't get in or whatever.  Yes, I think this is awesome.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  So, he holds his seats back.  Well, I mean, he filled the seats back.  You can see the pictures if you scroll down.  He kind of cherry-picked this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, camping mode.  Well, I could do this in my Model X, easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so.  We'll have developers doing this  in the parking lot of Google soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, there's, yeah, there's exactly, there's apps for this.  I can do this in my, in my,  your air conditioning doesn't run, no,  but it doesn't run all night without, you know,  I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What you're saying is there's enough battery in there  to really do, there's USB ports to keep your phone going.  There's dome lights, the LED lights that could run all night.  There's air filtration, fans, music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like a portable house you bring to the woods.  I mean, really, that's what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How long would it, how long?  Oh, he also says, do yourself a favor.  Pick up a portable electric espresso maker,  and you can plug it into your kettle.  They plug right into the car.  What the what?  Now, really, do you have enough juice to do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mm-hmm.  That's what I thought was awesome.  He's talking about it, it barely used any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I gotta try this.  Well, it's working California where it's cool at night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not sure it works in the car.  That's why it would be great in Texas,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because like, I wanna go camping, but you really can't.  You can fold up your Casper mattress in the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then you can go to like a camping vacuum pump  to like, slug it back down into its original packaging.  I don't know, I thought this was hilarious and awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go people.  He had to throw a towel over the 17 inch screen  in the front, because it was too bright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a feature for me.  My daughter, she likes having a light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A little nightlight, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, I'm gonna say like, it doesn't quite add up,  because an RV costs less than a Tesla.  Yeah.  Well, the same order of magnitude as a Tesla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you've already got a Tesla, just, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm never gonna buy a RV.  Well, you can limit it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You may need to if you've already got a Tesla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But also RVs, they have infrastructure.  There are parts with hookups.  You can go and like, plug your thing in.  But the cool thing about this is you do have LTE,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you have power, you have USB, you have a giant, giant battery.  You just need the Tesla toilet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that is missing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What you may need is a sort of large solar panel  to lay down so that you can lie in in the morning  to recharge the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just camp next to a supercharger.  You're saying cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because I can't afford a Tesla.  I'm gonna sell my house and just buy that,  and then I'll limit it.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I might be doing the same.  Maybe our new studio.  Who knows?  I don't know.  Audi's cars will be able to tell drivers.  I think every car should have this  when the red light turns green.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't get this one, Leo.  I didn't understand what the benefit of this one was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well.  I think it should be when a red light,  or a green light's about to turn.  I know we've got yellow lights,  but some yellow lights are shorter than others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The idea is sometimes you're at a red light,  you wanna just close your eyes for a minute,  or cut your nails.  Text.  Text.  Now the car will show the time remaining  before a light turns green,  and then maybe Italy.  How does it know, though?  Because it's got this data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, the city's publishing this, huh?  You can know people are gonna jump the red,  I'm telling you, I'm counting the days  till there's an accident around now.  Yeah, cause you can go dee, dee, dee, dee.  Cause people are gonna jump the light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dee, dee, dee, dee.  I make it hard for people who run an orange light,  as I like to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's great for drag racing.  Orange light?  There's no such thing as an orange light.  Is that what you've been telling yourself that is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what you call it.  It's red.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When a yellow light turns to red.  It's red.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When you're in the middle of the intersection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good name for it.  I'll call it that from now on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They call it AMBA.  In Europe, they do show you the yellow both ways.  Before it's red and before it's green.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh.  Yeah.  That's a good idea, just to let you know.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It doesn't buzz you to stop you from clipping your nails,  but you shouldn't be doing that anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kevin, what do you think of Tim Berners-Lee's plan  to reclaim the internet from Facebook and Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was slightly amused by the start of it,  given that I wrote another article about this  right after the centralized web summit,  which actually mentioned more things.  Oh.  Well, David Weinberger's a pretty good guy to write this up.  I was teasing Weinberger about that, but yes.  So there's a bunch of things going on.  So the decentralized web summit happened in June  at Internet Archive, and a bunch of people came,  including Tim Berners-Lee and everyone who's working  on lots of these projects, and worked on that.  And this one is sort of highlighting solid,  which is Tim's research project MIT.  It's not a W3C thing.  It's based on linked data,  but it's basically a privately funded group there  that's trying to build something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it a silo for your personal data?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's supposed to be a sort of,  you store it on your own server.  So it has sort of some, the base of it is,  you store it on your own server,  and you bring the app to it,  and it gets the data from it there, and then sends it back.  So it's that kind of model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So a third party like Google or Facebook  could ask for data from my pod,  and I could charge them for that,  or I'd have permissions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the idea.  I mean, the thing, you know,  the slightly frustration with me is that  we have the social web working group at W3C  that's been trying to fit these different components together.  And so there's an indie web group set of people there.  There's a linked data set of people there.  There's a bunch of people who came from activity streams,  and we're trying to work out the models  of how these things connect together.  And solid has been some contributions to that group,  but they haven't, I think they've put one spec  into the group so far.  Whereas, you know, indie web has put three or four specs in  with micro-pub is kind of recommendation this week and so on.  So we're trying to make this stuff fit together,  but Tim has not been promoting the W3C part of this.  He's been promoting his personal project, which makes sense.  If you ask someone, what are you working on?  They'll talk about that, and you know,  I'll talk about indie web stuff,  he'll talk about solid stuff.  But I think the interesting part is where we're trying  to get these specs to work together.  And there is a, part of the social web working group,  there is a paper that describes the different projects  we've got and how we're trying to make them interoperate.  And that's an interesting one to look at.  I'll try and find the link for that.  Because that social web protocols thing  that Amy Guy has written, that sort of describes  different protocols we've got and how they connect together  and how the indie web ones connect with the activity  stream ones that connect with the ones that have come  from the other groups.  So we're trying to make these things fit together.  The indie web approach has been,  we'll make some very small point protocols  that are easy to implement,  and then you can connect things together with that.  There are other protocol discussions here  that are trying to be more comprehensive,  that are trying to give you an inbox and an outbox  and build something that's closer to a sort of  more complete social network,  rather than a sort of start with your website  and build up model.  And then solid is in that realm,  but taking it a stage further.  So it's saying we're gonna use the linked data model,  which describes resources on the web  and lets you connect them together and express things  in the Tim Berners-Lee vision that he's been pushing  for a couple of decades now,  as the sort of the post web web of the web of linked data.  So it's trying to use that worldview  and connect that in with the web.  And the challenge with all of these is,  can we actually get them to interoperate  or do they only interoperate with things  that are running the same code base  that are actually the same thing?  And that's the piece that's hard  and the mapping between I think is the important bit here.  Very good.  I will find you the article I wrote that has-  I will read your article too.  But yeah, so the social web working group  is the sort of the W3C group  that's trying to put this stuff together.  I will put- so that's-  I'll put the link to that in the chat as well.  And that's- there's a series of drafts  and candidate recommendations  that are coming out of that group.  The social web protocols is the one that explains  the connection between the different ones  and how we're trying to make the work together.  Candidate recommendations are the ones that we think  are in a state where they're implementable.  And then there are working drafts  that are trying to build different pieces of this,  but are not ready for-  so basically gathering implementations  and trying to converge.  So the micropub is a candidate recommendation.  That's derived from the IndieWeb work.  Web mention is a- I think is a-  it's just draft working draft.  It doesn't seem to be in that list.  But basically we've got a set of these different protocols  and we're trying to make them all fit together.  And the-  Web mention is a candidate recommendation.  Web mention is a candidate recommendation as well, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So there's basically, there's been a lot of us  trying to work on different bits of this  over the last, I think it's two years now  this group's been chartered.  And SOLID is one of the-  is a research-  is Tim's research group at MIT  and it has people that are part of this group as well.  But what I would say is if you're interested in this stuff,  have a look at the social web working group stuff  because we've got a bunch of actions  for operating drafts and things there.  And there's connections to the SOLID work there as well.  The link data notifications came out of the SOLID group  that's in there as a working draft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  W3.org slash wiki slash social WG for social web working.  Yes, capital S I think you need.  Oh, it's capital, oh, case sensitive.  It's a wiki.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a wiki.  Oh no, no it does work, okay.  So yeah, social WG.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who put these purple links in here?  These look suspiciously like Stacey's interests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't actually,  I didn't have time to drop anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What I learned is a hired consultant  to auto didact physicists.  So maybe that's a Kevin Marx.  This is a Kevin Marx.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was a Kevin Marx.  This was a fun one.  All right.  This is fascinating.  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is from Eon.  The reason I thought it might be you Stacey,  I know you like to read Eon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do.  Well, Kevin and I have a lot of similar interests.  I'm not gonna lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's true.  We do tend to know it out together.  So Sabine Hirszenfelder, she's a research physicist  and she said, one of the problems you have  as a research physicist is all these people  who have strange theories who contact your physics department  and want to tell you about them.  And you try and be nice and do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She put a note up on her blog offering  physics consultations, talk to a physicist,  call me on Skype $50 per 20 minutes.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, is that where you got your idea, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is exactly where I got the idea, yeah.  So she says, okay.  And she talks about what happened  and she found it was actually really interesting.  There's a sort of set of people who learn about physics  from the media, who have some sort of loose understanding  of how it works, but have taken some piece of a visualization  or a central explanation to heart.  Completely misunderstood.  And they solved it.  Yeah.  And so the service that she provides  is they ring her up and say,  so I think we can get perpetual energy from this  because of this, this, this, and this.  And she just say, ah, the thing that you've misunderstood  is this piece and you should read a paper about this.  How useful.  And do it from that point of view.  Did she get calls?  And she says, you got a lot of calls.  She got enough calls that she had to recruit  other graduate students to respond to it as well.  That's so awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And based upon this pricing,  just talking to Kevin for the length of the show,  we've actually had what?  Let's see, $300, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's true, I should ask for an invoice.  No, so I thought that, I also did this.  I put this up on Twitter and said,  interesting business model.  If you're interested, want to talk to me for the 20 minutes,  for $50, I'll do that too.  I've had some people respond  and she has some really interesting conversations out of it.  Oh, I should check this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought about just saying hi,  but then I was like, no, too rich for my blood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, here's what this reminds me of  is this recent article in the New York Times and elsewhere,  debunking chem trails.  And we've all seen these contrails from jets in the sky.  It's commonplace.  I've seen them since I was a kid.  But apparently there are a group of conspiracy theorists  who are convinced, I'd never heard of this,  who are convinced that these are actually government planes  spraying toxic chemicals.  Oh, you're gonna get the email now?  Gene altering concoctions, testing weapons of war.  So somebody decided to do a peer-reviewed study  and scientists agreed.  Well, not all, 77 scientists,  76 of them said they had no evidence  of secret large scale spraying programs  and could easily explain those trails  as condensation, not spraying.  There was one scientist, one who said, well.  So even in this case,  you're never gonna get 100% agreement.  But that's an example of something where it's,  I didn't know this.  Is it widely believed that we are being sprayed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Widely without being chased, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, but it's widely spoken about.  There's a sort of coalition of people  who talk about this and link to each other.  Oh, no.  And because of the sort of Facebook  and Twitter application models.  The internet. The internet.  The internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They can find each other.  But I'm telling you, it's all Twitter's fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But literally, if you sign up for one of these sites  on Facebook, if you follow them,  it will recommend the other eight for you.  Yeah, right.  It's a very well-colored cluster  and it connects to some of the other ones as well.  And the challenge, it is,  we do spray chemicals in planes.  In an international survey,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  17% said they believed  in a secret large-scale atmospheric program or SLAP  to be true or partly true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would love for someone to do,  I think Gawker actually for a while did something like,  it wasn't called Camping with the Crazies,  but it was like-  It should be.  That's a good name.  They hung out with conspiracy theorists in cults  and they reported on them what these people believed  and just showing how many groups of weird there are.  And I think it'd just be a fascinating podcast  because sometimes you stumble across  these weird areas of the internet and you're like,  wow, there are really people that believe,  like the Flat Earthers.  I didn't know those people still existed  until whoever that was got all excited.  I just, I love that.  I love people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if you want to fuel that fire.  Yeah, I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Same with the anti-vaxxers and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The people who believe wifi is bad for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a guy who lives in Petaluma  who comes by here periodically with his laptop and his lap,  because he's a windows developer,  to enlist us to help stop wifi in the public schools.  And I said, you got, boy, buddy, you got the wrong,  you got the wrong person for that.  Jason Ponten, who edits the MIT editorial review,  did a, I found out about this article on Facebook  when he put a link to it on his Facebook  and wrote something that I thought  was really good on all of this.  My own experience as a science and technology editor  is that conspiracy theories are impervious to evidence.  People who like these sorts of theories  are the kinds of people who like these theories.  Conspiracy theories satisfy a deep need  to think history is rational,  even if the reasons are occluded.  People who like conspiracy theories  need to self-identify as savvy souls  who can see through the propaganda  that includes the sight of sheeple.  Showing people why they're wrong about a theory  just makes them dig in deeper, they get angry.  In the end, conspiracy theories collapse  like drunkards fall apart slowly than all at once.  Later, we all pretend that a large number of Americans  never actually believed X or supported Y  because national life must go on  and it's intolerable to our civic religion  of democratic anti-elitism to admit  that half of us don't know our butts

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  from the hole in the ground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then he links to this New York Times story  about chemtrails.  Wow, I thought that was a good way to put it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The thing is they're connected to things  that actually happen.  We do spray chemicals from the air  because that's how we do crop dusting,  but that's done with small planes  and then we can go around because otherwise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, every conspiracy theory is somewhat believable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There are also people who have called  for atmospheric geoengineering to end global warming  and things like that.  It's not out of the realm of the last one.  So you can find papers from sensible scientists  who will say, could we fix global warming  by filling the atmosphere with dust or something like that?  And so there's a series of things you can join the dots to,  but then you decide every streak of cloud in the sky  is a chemtrail from a plane that's trying to kill you.  And that's when it gets a bit weird.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey guys, I think y'all are all wonderful.  Is it time to go?  It's time for me to go.  No, no, we should wrap it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You said, you told me, you warned me.  You warned me.  So we're gonna let Stacey go.  I will read an ad and then we'll come back  with our picks of the week.  Stacey, thank you so much.  Have fun at IDF.  Have a great conversation with your daughter.  Are you gonna use Duo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh no, we're gonna use Hangouts.  We have a sticker sharing relationship on Hangouts  that we just keep going.  Oh, that's so sweet.  Oh my goodness.  All right.  Well, sayonara, it's also good.  I don't have anything for you this week.  So, see you on the next one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacey on IOT.  You always have something for us.  You're brilliant brains.  Stacey on IOT.com, at Giga Stacey on Twitter  if you still wanna use that.  Thank you, Stacey.  Thanks, bye y'all.  Take care.  Our show today brought to you by something Stacey,  I'm sure would endorse and support.  I think she even has one, the Ring Video Doorbell.  I have one right here.  Well, actually I have one on my door.  I think maybe I put it on my door.  The Ring Video Doorbell lets you see and talk to  and hear somebody at your front door.  Whether they're ringing the doorbell  or just moving around out front, it is awesome.  It replaces your wired or unwired doorbell  with a very nice chime that will ring inside your house,  but will also let you answer your doorbell  using your smartphone or tablet  wherever you are anywhere in the world.  Yes, it's internet connected.  And now Ring has a great deal on their security bundle kit.  If you go to ring.com slash twig,  you could save a significant amount  on a variety of Ring Video Doorbell kits,  whether it's just the basic ring.  And what is that thing next to the ring?  I don't know what that is.  I'm gonna have to look at that now.  This is something new it looks like.  They also have a bundle kit that has the ring  and the stick-up cam, which is awesome.  That gives you the stick-up cam.  It gives you a camera kind of much like  the Ring Video Doorbell.  Oh, it's a solar security sign.  Oh, that's nice.  So you can say protected by ring.  You'll love it.  You can also get with one of their bundles,  you get the solar panel,  which allows your stick-up cam to work  without ever being wired.  Love that.  And then there's the chime,  which plugs into any standard power outlet  and works with your Ring Video Doorbell  so that you know you have a visitor,  even if your phone is in the other room.  Ring is great, especially summertime,  when bad guys often will come to your door,  especially while you're at work or on vacation  to see if anybody's home.  If no one answers the doorbell,  they're gonna go around back and break in.  But see, you'll always answer the doorbell,  even if you're in Paris or London or Stockholm.  There are two kinds of Ring Video Doorbells.  There's the Ring that I have,  which has the battery, year-long battery.  But if you don't need a battery  if you're using a wired doorbell,  get the Ring Video Doorbell Pro.  It's a lighter, slimmer.  It also has an HD, well, both are HD,  but it has a 1080p camera.  Really great picture.  I just saw one for the first time the other day.  And you're gonna get lots off  by getting one of the Ring of Security bundle kits.  So check them all out at Ring, R-I-N-G.com slash twig.  I always know who's coming and going at my house,  even if they don't ring the doorbell,  thanks to my Ring Video Doorbell.  I love this.  Now they'll sell you a little,  one of those little security signs to put out front.  Oh, it's solar too.  Oh, that's cool.  That's nice.  Ring.com slash twig.  We thank them for their support of this week in Google.  Well, we lost Stacey,  but that doesn't mean we get to go home yet  because it's time for our picks of the week.  Let's start with you, Kevin.  I'm sure you have a few things you'd like to promote  with the IndieWeb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the big one coming up is IndieWebCamp New York,  which is the 27th and 28th of August.  And I wanna encourage Jeff to come along  when it's in his journalism students' long as well.  The link's 2016.indieweb.org slash NYC2.  Sign up there.  There's space for, I think, 20 or 30 people to come along.  And we should be live streaming it as well.  But basically, the IndieWebCamp is like the two-day event  where we get together to talk about building our own websites,  spend the first day is initial show and tell  of what you've made and discussions.  The Sunday is a sort of hacking day,  and then it ends with a demo of things  we've built over the weekend.  And we've done lots of these in different cities.  We've already done one in New York this year.  And that one was snowed out  because it was done during the blizzard.  That shouldn't happen this time around.  Oh, that's right, yeah.  But that's coming up.  Plus, we also obviously have the Homebrew website clubs  in lots of cities next Wednesday,  including San Francisco, Portland, Brighton,  and places in Germany and Sweden as well, I think.  I can't remember exactly which ones we're having this week.  And then the other news was the thing I mentioned briefly  in the Social Web Working Group,  which is that MicroPub is now kind of a recommendation,  which is the last stage before it becomes a full draft,  a full publication,  which means this is a really good time  to test out a MicroPub with your stuff.  So MicroPub is the specification  that lets you remote post to another site.  So you basically authorize somebody to post on your website  and then that gets sent out.  And we've built this to connect things together  in different Indie websites.  There's also a site called silo.pub  that will connect to sites like WordPress and Blogger  and Tumblr and Twitter  so that you can post to those using this protocol as well.  So it's a strong protocol  for letting you publish from one site to another.  We've got a set of implementations and as it's in CI,  it's a really good time for you to test against it  and try things out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very nice.  Very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis, your tip of the week.  Let me see here.  I don't know if you want to show this or not.  You may not want to because it's political.  Oh, go ahead.  But the video that has been going all around the Twitter  in the last couple hours is the Says Who video.  Have you seen this?  No.  So Trump's lawyer is on CNN  and the correspondent says,  well, you're behind and you can plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, well, let me ask you about this.  So you say it's not a shakeup, but you guys are down  and it makes sense that there would-  Says who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Says who?  Says who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Says all the polls.  Most of them, all of them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That says who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The polls.  I just told you, I answered your question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's one way to prove the truth.  Which polls?  All of them.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And your question is?  Okay, so my question is-  That's enough.  I don't think it is really surprising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Says who?  That solves it.  The Says Who meme, the meme will be all around-  Says who, get ready, you're gonna see it everywhere.  Says who?  So a couple other Trump moments  without adding in political analysis.  There was an analysis of his tweets.  I love this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought that was really interesting.  They did a syntactic analysis.  Well, no, it was a platform analysis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And an emotion analysis as well.  That's right.  So the over the top wacky tweets come from Android  and they come from Trump's own phone.  The other tweets come from iOS or the web client.  And so for example, the last 24 hours,  I think that actually Donald Trump  has been locked up somewhere.  You bet he has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  24 hours, there's been no Android.  Mike Pence said, Donald, come here for a second.  I have a fabulous tostada you're gonna love.  And then they took his phone.  So if you look at the tweets and look at the source,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  if it comes from Android, that means it's Donald.  That means it's a little bit, shall we say, more passionate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is actually a really good example of data analysis.  It really is.  That we were talking about.  And if you just, everybody knows the politicians,  the celebrities and many others  have people tweeting for them.  The question is, it seems like Donald tweets for himself.  Turns out, he also has people tweeting for him  and it's actually fairly easy to figure out  which of Mr. Trump's tweets are his  and which are from his team.  And this data analysis,  even down to which words are most likely to be from Android  which from iPhone.  The Android iPhone thing made it kind of easy, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It did, but then backed up the data analysis

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to show that there were two different voices.  Yeah, and also there was a time analysis  and it's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it has been 24 hours with no Android tweets.  I checked before we got on the show.  And lots and lots of Facebook,  but the Facebook has the same milk toasty voice  as the iOS tweets.  Very interesting.  So there's also another study that Stately did  of Trump searches by state.  Like other people searching?  Yes.  What people search on and where is it here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are they Trump's, I don't understand.  What people searching for about Trump.  Trump related things.  Yes, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Trump rally, what happens if Trump wins?  California is where to move if Trump wins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love it.  In the state of Washington, Trump voodoo doll  is the number one Trump related search.  However, in the Keystone state, it's how to build a wall.  In Florida, it's the best words.  Louisiana, it's Obama birth certificate.  It's in Texas, contrast Texas to California.  In California, where to move if Trump wins.  In Texas, what happens if Trump wins.  And of course in Hawaii, it's Miss Teen USA.  And apparently in Alaska, nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nobody wants to know.  They figure they'll just be part of Russia.  Trump with his good relationship with Putin,  he's probably gonna give it back to Russia.  That's pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is pretty funny.  Wow, I don't know how a Stately decided.  Methodology maybe.  What was a Trump tweet?  Is Taco Bowl really a Trump tweet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They came up with a long list  and then looked at it state by state.  So it's not the best solo side of methodology,  but I enjoyed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mine is a little more tech focused.  In October, 1991, Linus Torvalds released Linux  to the world less than two years later.  A gentleman now deceased and a very sad story,  Ian Murdoch created Debian.  The Ian was his name, Debbie was the name of his wife.  Yesterday was the 33rd,  birth, 33rd, yeah, is that right?  Can that possibly be right?  23rd birthday of Debian.  Debian Day celebrated each year.  Debian is unfortunately a little bit eclipsed by Ubuntu,  which is really a derivative of Debian.  But if you've been thinking about Linux,  I love Debian, debian.org.  It is not supported as Ubuntu is by a company,  but it is fully community supported.  It is, as I said, the basis for not only Ubuntu,  but a great many Linux distributions.  Why not use the source material?  It's really great.  And something I gotta say is it's so easy now  to install Linux.  You install Debian, it's gonna recognize  almost all of your hardware out of the box.  Linux has made huge strides in PC hardware compatibility.  And since frankly, most of the time,  all you really need to use is as a browser,  and Chrome and Chromium are available, of course,  on Linux, you're not even sacrificing anything  and gaining a whole lot, including nobody spying on you,  no advertising, no compelled forced upgrades,  just a rock solid operating system  that's actually pretty fun to use.  So happy birthday, happy 23rd birthday.  That's kinda sweet.  Yeah, it's a nice story really.  Debian is a great operating system.  It's free, it's completely free,  and it's all community supported.  I imagine there are a few people at IndieWebCamp  who use Debian.  I should think so.  Yeah, it's kinda the IndieWebCamp of operating systems.  Hey, thanks so much to Stacey Higginbotham once again.  Sorry we had to let her go, but she's always welcome.  She'll be back next week.  Our first show from the new Brickhouse,  I'm sorry, Eastside Studio, we're calling it the Eastside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was wondering, I was here changing the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's not gonna be all Brick anymore, for one thing.  And we thought we should give it a new name.  This studio's on the west side of Petaluma.  The new studio will be on the northeast side.  Well we're moving on now, moving on to the east side.  On Sunday, our very first show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So when you get off.  Plus there's a theater song.  When you get off the freeway,  is it over on that side of town?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the last exit in Petaluma, the Petaluma north exit,  it's right there, it's very easy to get to.  So you'll go through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's why you are at the brewery, right?  Right, the brewery's there.  Right next to Laganitas, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We got an IHOP, we got an Applebee's,  we got a Burger King, we got a Jack in the Box,  and we got a Laganitas.  We're moving to America.  We're moving to America.  You're moving on down.  We're gonna make America great.  No antique shops there.  Yep.  No, as a matter of fact, that's another reason to go there  and lots of parking.  So that's where we'll be next week.  How far away is that from your home?  Just as close, our home is equidistant to the two studios.  So that's nice, yeah that's really nice.  Kevin Marks is at kevinmarks.com, he's also Indie Webcamp.  Make sure you go to indiewebcamp.org  to keep up on what's going on with the move  to keep the web free, open, and ours, ours.  Exactly.  Unless you're AOL and Verizon, in which case it's theirs.  Nevermind, it's too complicated.  Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism  at the City University of New York,  author of What Would Google Do?  Public Parts, Gutenberg the Geek, Geeks Bearing Gifts.  He's also on buzzmachine.com, that's where he blogs,  and often writes on Medium as well.  Thank you so much, both of you.  Really good show.  Cheers. Thank you.  Always fun.  It's gonna look a little different next time.  It won't be quite as nice and polished.  Eventually it'll look very similar.  One of the reasons there's a gap behind me now  is we actually took that out, that wall out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How many settings, how many?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One fewer, so we'll have four sets plus my studio,  so five total.  So one fewer, we're only losing one set.  That tall thing?  Yeah, the tall one, exactly.  Yeah, which you never use, right?  Sky booth, yeah, we know.  It seemed like a good idea.  We got the living room, we got the round table,  we got the news set, we got the radio corner,  and my office is gonna be identical.  My office will be indistinguishable.  Thank you all for being here, we'll see you next time.
