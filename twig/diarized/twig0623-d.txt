Transcript:  But only half the staff was yeah. Yes, because it's not even nursing home. It's a better living. Yeah, because it's Florida  Exactly, so I was getting him Instacart and Amazon  He was not going out at all for anything and they reopened the dining room and not again  97% of the residents are vaccinated the 3% who aren't probably don't even come down dinner because that's by the reason they're vaccinated  but half the staff is not and he got it and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's in hospital. So it's serious

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just a perfect example of how the unvaccinated are victimizing not only themselves being vaccinated  I'm so sorry, but he's it sounds like a prognosis is good. He's doing he's doing pretty well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looks like it's about we don't be able to talk to him. I saw I send him  Because he's also losing his eyesight, of course, he's 95 years old. So I've been faxing to the nurse's station every night  messages in 36 point  That's to tell him what's going on with him because he can't understand. Yeah  So yeah, it appears that he's doing better not good and we'll see him five. Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah  All right. Well, I understand why you weren't here and I'm glad you went down there to take care take care of business  Also here aunt Pruitt from our hands on a little serfie show. Hello aunt. How are you?  Unbelievable as always sir yourself. I'm well you may notice that and is back in his house  Because in our county in Sonoma County, the state of California is not mandating masking  but in our county they are counties are indoor environments this county is and  It varies and so we are masking up in the studio and we are also saying no more  In you know, you can't sit next to me. How long did that last about three weeks?  Yeah, we shall see we were so close. We were so close to normalcy and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's I gotta tell you it's I think I've talked about it before I'm sort of used to the the work from home  Environment in in mode of operation or whatever, but it was nice to see my colleagues  I know where you know fairly right? I know the truth. I just wanted to use the coffee machine. I understand. Okay, you got

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Reason he likes our espresso machine. Hey, I want me Stacey has the week off  But I'm thrilled to get we've been trying to get him in for a while now Mike Maznik of the fabulous  Tech  Blog great to see you Mike good to be back  It's one of the smartest observers of what's going on on the internet  If you don't read tech dirt do and let me put in a plug if you don't support tech dirt  Do if you go to the insider shop  You'll see ways that you can support them and it's a particularly important now because Mike has taken a very principled  Stand on the blog. I guess there's a little history needed here Mike. You want to set us up with this one?  storytime

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's principle by the way is a synonym for poverty, but keep going

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, yes  Yeah, I mean, you know we had an issue last year and I actually if I remember great  I think I was on yes one of your shows. Yes, maybe this one. It was this one. Yeah  When when what happened was we we we had ads on the site  And a lot of them came from from Google AdSense and we started getting very angry messages from Google  Complaining about various stories and threatening to kick us out of the program  For really bizarre things like they said all of our stories about Google were dangerous and derogatory  Which you know, I'm sure it was just some sort of automated system, but you could read that in a really really  Interesting way and so we had pulled Google ads for a while and then do you feel like good just to yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Put a pin in that one  But do you feel like Google was trying to censor you or this was some sort of automated?  What was it was the automated thing looking for? I think the real issue was our comments

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I honestly think that you know, we have pretty open comments and and despite what people say  You know about open comments. I think our comments are generally pretty good. We do have a few trolls  But but they in some ways tend to be productive trolls and that they inspire  thoughtful responses and conversations back and  Our smart so some of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People it's people who are fairly well  Who understand the issues and care a lot about them because you know, you really are you really are the it's the most astute observer  What's going on out there? So I think you attract smart people. So I'm not surprised your comment sections are good  But sometimes people say bad things about Google person. What is it? They say no. No, I think sometimes people use bad words

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I think honestly that's what it is people use like a lot of companies that sell advertising

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Advertisers don't want to be juxtaposed with bad words  Yeah, or things like that. So they say well because this has bad words on it. We're not gonna put ads on that page

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly and and and I understand that right?  I mean one of the things that I write about pretty frequently is is the impossibility of doing content moderation at scale  Well, and that's you know, and you can see a perfectly reasonable logic for how it gets there where you know  Some filter some algorithm ticks off and says there are bad words on this page  Advertisers do not want to appear next to bad words  Therefore we will not do that and if that was all that it was and if they just said we are going to remove ads  From this page we would say fine. No problem  But where it got it got more and more tricky was that then they started saying like, you know  If you don't fix this then we're going to shut down your entire account and and but they won't even tell you what exactly  It is that needs to be fixed. It's just fix this  There is something bad on the page and you know, and and basically I would go back and forth with people there and we would  Get you know, maybe it's your comments, but we can't tell you and and it was just getting worse and worse  And so we finally just sort of you know dump them last year and then we were trying to use some other  Some other ad partners and we explored a bunch when we first dropped the ads  We had different people reach out to us with different kinds of solutions  And what we discovered is almost all of them are really, you know, just reselling Google ads in some way or another  And then what we had decided actually late last year was that throughout all this process  We were getting increasingly uncomfortable just with  Google Analytics as well, which we had used for many years as kind of the analytics package  It's sort of the standard free analytics package that everyone uses and so we just started exploring different, you know more privacy  protective analytics packages and there there are a bunch out there and it's there's a huge range in terms of what they offer and  So we installed a few of those  You know basically in December of last year and we sort of ran everything into January and towards the end of January we said, okay  I'm comfortable with these other packages the two ones that we're using by the way  I should plug because they're they're better is  There's one called plausible and another called Matomo  and  and so at the end of January, we actually pulled Google Analytics from tech dirt and  Then like February 1st  I open up the page and I look and I still see it saying that it's calling Google Analytics and I was like  How can this be we we took Google Analytics off the page?  And we're trying to figure it out  We realized that because the new ad partner that we had just begun testing had Google Ads it  Automatically shoves Google Analytics back into your page. Even if you don't have it for your own page  It's to track the the ad side of it  And so, you know that was a problem  We sort of tried to deal with that and figure out if there were ways around that and eventually we just took all the ads  Off the page because that was basically the only way we could guarantee that was happening  And then we actually found another I don't even remember what it was  There was another thing that we had in our site that was also injecting Google Analytics into the page  So we had to kill that and so basically where it stands now is we don't have Google Analytics on the page  And we don't have any ads on the page as a result

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It makes sense advertisers want to know how many people saw the ads so they're gonna need to do some sort of analytics and  Google Analytics is the default we use it too. I should say  Actually, I proposed to our executive committee that we stop. I didn't hear anything  From them might have to do that unilaterally  What's wrong with Google Analytics?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I don't think that there's anything  Necessarily wrong about it in general, you know  I actually think it is a pretty good package and it is free  But there is a trade-off there and that is that you are sharing the data of your users with Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Every single person who visits your site actually pings Google in effect, right?  We've just with their IP address  But Google's able to stitch that together with cookies that they might see or just information exactly that I and so so they're they're learning about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And and you know, whatever you feel about Google and I think of you know, all the the large internet companies there  I feel like they're the least of the you know, the evil ones  But they are still a very large company and they do things that I don't always agree with and I frequently disagree with  And it just began to feel uncomfortable and I started saying, you know, we don't have to give in to this same thing  We don't have to give all of our visitors  Information over to Google and frankly, I know like a lot of our visitors use various, you know  Blocking technologies to block the analytics and to block the ads and we're fine with that  You know, I know a lot of people get mad about it and say oh you're stealing from me  It's like no we were we always encourage people like, you know protect yourself, you know, we're fine with that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But in the long run if you do that, you might as well not take ads because if your entire audience blocked analytics and ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and and so, you know it got to the point where we just said, you know what?  Let's let's just see what happens and and you know, I feel better about the site when I'm not doing that to the people who are visiting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How are you gonna pay for your rent? I mean how I mean well, that's what we're working on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there are lots of ways that people can support us and I'm gonna say this is where you come

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just a few small monthly payments quite in the same boat, but we're in a very similar boat and  I think we will be in the same boat in time and like your audience our audience is savvy enough to not to use ad blockers  to not want ads  Fortunately because we're a podcast you know ad blocker works on the podcast  You could skip over the ads is about all you could do and that's usually a pain people listen to the ads  But we still have to do some sort of analytics for those ads and you know  We have to measure downloads at the very least so we're in a similar position  I was I totally understand why you would do this and respect it and I guess the message would be for people who are listening  this is gonna be increasingly a conundrum for  Journalism and sites like yours and I guess sites like ours is how do we survive in a landscape?  Where people don't want to be tracked they don't want ads and companies are increasingly invasive with their tracking and advertising

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, was this easier in the newspaper day when it come to  Trying to gather analytics about the subscription base

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They didn't know anything tell me about the ABC  Yeah, yeah, so the audit bureau circulation  Would just verify that this paper was sold  And then it gets worse and because then we had what was called syndicated research  More the magazines than a newspaper is where they would say well how many  People saw this ad and it's pure BS. They call it a pass around rate  It would do a panel. So so but but I work at people magazine supposedly  Every copy of people magazine was seen by eight people. Yeah, because they would come with place the doctor's office  Checkout they count everything they can possibly supposedly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Count the same thing just multiplier downloads by eight everybody will be happy. Thank you  Need to use that a lot of podcasters do is another problem  We have at least you had the ABC and the idea the ABC or Nielsen ratings or arbitron  Was that there was a standardized system everybody used but a podcasting  There's you know, people make up numbers and you know, you hear Joe Rogan say I have 45 million listeners a month  And you can't there's no way to we can verify verify that it's made

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So and the other funny thing is that when so the audit bureau circulation existed, sorry, Leo starts me going, you know  It's old-time week. I'm gonna talk about the old  The whole point was to verify your circulation did did in fact you sell six hundred thousand copies of the  Podunk daily disgrace, right?  So that comes to the internet and I was on the committee to decide what do we do about this internet thing?  And so the presumption was that advertisers would still want to know how many people saw your site as a whole and it took  Like three years before they realized no advertiser gave a damn about that because all the advertiser cared about was the page  Upon which their ad appeared and they said a lot of that. I don't care about the rest and  And and the industry was just so hidebound in its old ways  And it was so much about bragging about size matters. I have more people reading than you do that became utterly meaningless  So the what I always tell the students is the myth of mass media was that all readers see all ads  So we charge all advertisers for our readers  That's why a newspaper had everything it could cram in their bridge columns. Who cares about a bridge column?  Well five people worth a bridge column. We're gonna charge every advertiser for that. I charge them the same. That's all they look at right  so so that's how the  Industry never kind of got their head around that and we're still stuck in that so you have advertisers in their media departments and still look  At things like total size even though it's meaningless  They could buy a bunch of small sites a hell of a lot cheaper than buying the big sites yet in the early days  They would sell out the Yahoo homepage because everybody wanted to be on the Yahoo homepage. Mm-hmm  Ludicrous first the ad industry is stupid. The media industry is stupid and we're paying the price  No, I'm not Mike is paying the price now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's this notion and it started with newsletters of the sovereign writer somebody  Like Casey Newton leaving a big name publication and starting his own sovereign newsletter  I guess in a way that's the one last hope  For sites like tech dirt is well if we can't and don't but we choose not to deal with the devil  Will be supported

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and I mean it's interesting right I mean the sort of you know  Substackification, you know of independent writers has been a really fascinating thing to watch over over the last couple years certainly and  You know there is this temptation to see if we follow that path the issue  I have with that approach is that most of that really does kind of rely on a paywall, right?  I mean you're the way you get people subscribe is you do maybe like, you know  One free thing a week and then the rest is is behind the paywall and I'm uncomfortable with that  I mean, I think the part of the value of what it is that we're writing is how widely it is shared and how more

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People and the impact you have yeah impact you have is important and huge and what nobody talks about the paywalls  Nobody the New York Times down is the subscriber acquisition cost and the churn  It costs a lot of marketing money to earn that money  And then when people do leave because they do damn them  You've got to replace them and still grow and that's a huge cost and the subscriber  The total subscriber  Payments in the world are not many the Reuters Institute for the study of journalism at at  Oxford calculated for me that in the US  63% of all new subscriptions go to three brands New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal  Everybody else splits the other third

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean it is interesting though that that with some of these independent writers because they have so much less overhead  They're able to make it work  I actually think that's great and I think it's kind of a really exciting thing  You know, it's a slightly different approach than what we would like to do  You know, we're focused on you know  When when people subscribe to the different things that we have we try and give them extra features  Rather than locking away the content and that that's kind of our focus  But you know, I think it's it's kind of cool to see some writers who are able to actually make a living this way  And it is a different approach and it sort of has opened up people to that kind of thinking like  I do want to support not these big giant brands the New York Times the Washington Post or whatnot  I want to support this individual writer  Who who I like and I want to be able to continue writing and to also be able to eat every once in a while  so  You know, I think I think there is something promising there  I just don't like the the paywall aspect of it and maybe that's just because I'm an old school

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Person the key to what you're doing and what Leo is doing that I prefer for all of media  Unless you're the New York Times Washington Post policy journal if you can do it do it fine. Hallelujah, right, but it's it's not  Subscription pay for access to content its membership and it's being part of something and supporting that something  because I like what you do because I want to be part of a project because  I wanted to be free to the world  Because I want the social status to say and look I'm smart enough to read tech dirt  You know any of those things are the motives for people to put you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and and there's a fundamental sort of economic thinking behind that too, which is that you know  People will pay for something that is a scarcity right something that is widely available is it's it's less easy to convince people to  To pay for it  But if you think of it not as paying for our past content  But paying for our future content our future content is scarce because it might not exist  You know if we do if we can't survive and if we can't stay stay around  Then there is no future content  So the scarcity that you're paying for is our ability to continue to produce amazing content in the future  Rather than the way I think most people who have a paywall also think about it  Which is that you're paying for access to this content that I already created. I love that. I'm gonna. Yeah, that's great

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm gonna make a note of that. That's a really good way to position it. I  we  No matter what we do. We will never do a paywall because it's anti-democratic  I think and we want the most you too  I think the most possible people should hear what you have to say  You know any senator who gets sent a link of why you're wrong senator about section 230 should be able to go to that  page without  facing a paywall so  You know we want to keep that going and I think it's really that's really kind of what ad supported media was all about is  This kind of democratic medium that anybody could listen to you know how many people are you Mike? I mean you've added up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  staff wise yeah  It's  Yeah, so it depends on how you count  It's we're four full-time people and then we have the the writers or there's another four writers as well who are part-time  Do you have an amount of division?  We have you're looking at the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have actually more people doing ad sales than you have in your entire company. Yeah, we're small  It's a big well. It's just because that's what you have to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it costs money to earn money. Yeah, that's subscriptions ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Membership any of this yeah, you know you club twit isn't free. We have to have a person manage it  We have to have engineering devoted to it our hosts have to vote time to it. It is far from free  I you know in fact the jury still out whether it's a net positive really  But it's to having fun with it though. Oh, well, that's the thing it's fun to do  So I guess if it's just neutral, okay  But that's you know, it's hard. It's really hard and it's getting harder and I see it seems to be I mean  This is maybe this is a natural cycle for media. I don't know but it seems to be this is what happened to blogs  Is now having to podcasts is this shakeout and then you get the  Acquisitions by big companies and then there really are only two kinds of blogs  They're hobby blogs or blogs that are owned by big media companies and you and I fall in this crack

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Between the two trying to do it was it was the great future of media to have it truly independent media. Yeah  And and this is what Dave Weiner  Got blessed for yeah in starting blogs and RSS. Yep, and I'm just reading  boring and gorky I am  There's a book called surprise. Goodbye Gutenberg  I  Didn't say so do you own every book with Gutenberg in the title? I think I do I think I think I do  Yeah, this is written in 1980  About the changes in the newspaper business. I won't bore you with a fear not you can you can keep watching folks  But it's fascinating to watch that every time a technology comes in  how it causes this kind of disruption and and  The big old players will try their damnedest to hold on to their position and that's what they're doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think if you look at the history of radio, I understand it was something fairly similar  You know when radio first came about there were lots of independent people who just you know set up a way to broadcast  And it might only reach you know down the street or whatever and then then you know  All the big players came in and crowded out all of the small independent ones bought them up. Yeah. Yeah, it's like funeral homes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't get started on funeral homes, okay  And let me tell you about the history of funeral homes, you know  Actually, this is the problem with all of our shows but this show particularly is we're all kind of  There must be a name for it the ultimate dilettante. We want to know everything about everything  Fascinated by all of it. That's we're nerds  Let us  Talk about some some Google News. How about there's Google News?  How about that how about that story what a thought this week in Google what a thought although I well  Okay, one more story from tech dirt  But there's one that I really enjoyed from today this was Mike's story and I just I actually  Bookmarked  One particular line in this yes, actually the First Amendment does mean Twitter can kick you off its platform Wall Street Journal  Mike responding to Columbia law professor and professional goofball Philip Hamburger who is continually  Misinterpreting what would you get my suit again?  He seems to be a little about nice clueless about the subject matter he seems to be teaching well  You said you felt bad for students at Columbia Law School. So that might be  Problematic my favorite line though is you're talking about this  Editorial he wrote in the Wall Street Journal  and  Basically his argument I guess is that  You know the First Amendment  He tries to argue the First Amendment doesn't protect website content moderation choices, this is a very convoluted article  Oh, but you write if the Wall Street Journal really believes this nonsense  Why won't it let me publish my op-ed in their pages about how the Wall Street Journal is the worst newspaper ever and regularly?  Lies and nonsense to please its scheming owner in his hatred of the internet. This is why we love you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm being censored by Rupert Murdoch clearly. No, something must be done will be pulled. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mean they don't they don't let me print my articles in the Wall Street Journal. How dare they that's a violation of my first  That's my first amendment right according to the Wall Street Journal. So, you know, I'm just taking their argument to its logical conclusion

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is a very complicated convoluted argument that hamburger makes by the way, I love that his name is hamburger  He's probably pronounced at hamburger. I'm thinking but anyway  Hamburger basically says  It's it's violating  federal laws against discrimination  to block the president the United States  It's discriminatory course, he's not exactly a protected class unless  rich billionaire  Politicians is a protected class. Maybe it is I don't know  It's a very interesting attempt to make sense. That makes absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's it's the thing too that you know, I I mean I was mocking different aspects of it  But honestly like the article was was written in such an amateurish way  That I mean it does not read like any law professor I've ever met wrote it it really reads like  You know somebody who has just discovered the internet and is mad and has written this article  Without understanding any of the underlying law it's the same kinds of arguments that you know  I think I said something in the article that it it reads like, you know some random Twitter account. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That maybe there's a co-author a former  Trump DOJ official who's now a policy analyst at a DC think. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She there were two bylines on it and the other one is a former Trump DOJ official  Who's now like a policy analyst at some think tank and it so my guess is that she wrote most of it? Yeah, just I  Don't know. Yeah, they're both their name. They're both named on it  But the writing is just it's not good  I mean just from a from a purely like, you know, how do you write an article standpoint?  It's it's it's all over the map. It's not clear  Like there's this one all of a sudden it throws in a copyright issue in the middle where it says that like Google benefits too  Much from fair use and therefore it's like privileged by the government and no longer a private company

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it's no sense if you wrote a paper in law school  With these premises you would be flunked

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I guess except in his class but but well, I'm gonna say I'll say

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's very obvious at this point to me is that this nonsense is not aimed at you and me  It's a shame it's showing up now in the Wall Street Journal, but it's been showing up on the nation's airwaves for years, which is basically  Polemicized arguments that we have no relationship to fact but don't require it because the the audience it's intended to don't have a  Ground or basis to understand it. They just want to hear  Stuff that it confirms what they believe and so this stuff works very well. This stuff is very effective  You know, it's the reason you can lie through your teeth  About all sorts of things that are for the rest of us obviously lies  But for the audience for whom it's intended it's gospel truth  you could say the January 6th in Sarasota was a bunch of very peaceful people who were just touring the  Congress and you know when I look at the videos and go well that that's  Obviously not true. But for the audience for whom it's intended  It's gospel and that's what this is this is not intended for you and me Mike  I'm sad to see that in the Wall Street Journal, but I'm not surprised. I'm not surprised at least especially on that page. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean the the Washington Wall Street Journal, you know opinion pages, you know have become  That kind of thing and it's it is more targeted also at  You know officials in Washington and to make this argument to make them think that there is some sort of legitimate argument here when there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Clearly not it gives them cover  I don't I think I think most of the people who read the Wall Street Journal and most people in college  I would hope I'm maybe I'm maybe I'm a fool  I would hope the most people in government who read this know better and even Philip Hamburg knows better  But that's not the point of this it by any means, you know, this isn't this isn't for them  this is to give them cover to give them argument, you know points so that Jim Jordan can go out and  try to get into jail and see the  Insurrectionists make sure that they're not being mistreated  Like the good Patriots that they are it's just it's we live in a very different world, you know, yeah and  I'm you know, I'm glad that you have the fortitude  I'll tell you this the fact that you have the fortitude to call out this BS when you see it  gives me courage  Because it's very any well, no, seriously anybody who's in my position or anybody who's a broadcaster is always  Fearful of saying what I just said because there are there's some percentage of people who are watching who will no longer listen  The show ever again  Yeah, because we challenge their  fundamentally held beliefs and  That's risky. And if you're in mass media, you're trained don't yeah, don't don't  Don't we don't have enough numbers to begin with don't reduce them. I  Gave up about that about you know when Trump first got elected  We tried to be fairly judicious you tried I screwed it up about two or three years in it was like, oh screw it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you did change you just suddenly changed we tried not to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But at some point I didn't want to get political but it gets to the point where when people when there's outrageous lies being told  You can't turn your back on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, yeah  If your focus is on the truth and you have to focus on the truth, right?  And and so, you know we criticize people across the political aisle  But you know when when one party has completely detached itself from reality  then you have to call that out and and you know, I criticize Democrats all the time as well, but  it's their their  Commitment to the truth is a little bit closer than than the Republicans right now  Well, yeah, and that's I think that's unfortunate

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah  and I try I bend over backwards not to make it a partisan issue and just say well look there's some people who are really clearly  liars and thieves and grifters and there's some people who are not and  It's not necessarily to split down party lines. Yeah, but it when somebody's a lion you got to say hey  That's not true. And when somebody when a law professor writes in the Wall Street Journal that somehow  The First Amendment doesn't protect Twitter against the government or somehow the Google is is the government  Just you got to say something. You just can't let that sit. Yeah, and you know what?  Maybe you and I are paying the price for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Well, you know, I'm currently being sued for defamation too. So Oh Lord  Kind of you know these things these things happen so it's it's been it's been quite a year

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I almost I almost  Yeah, you don't I  Verge on despair. So I swear to God Mike. Thank you for  Hanging in there. I'm doing my best. You're keeping us in here. Now, let's talk about the pixel 6  Good old hardware, this is you know, and there's plenty of people who prefer that we just stick to that  And you know for a long time we fought the good fight, but honestly this all of impacts technology  I mean we're to this this this diatribe in the Wall Street Journal is is going against it is really the the  That's the issue. It's the big tech attack. Yeah, it's it's which is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What like I mean and also I mean it you know  If this actually did get anywhere and if people actually believed it and it moved into sort of you know courts and Congress and wherever else  You know  It it is an a clear attack on the open internet and all the stuff that we were talking about before the things that we find  important about having the ability for there to be some kind of independent media that doesn't exist if  these things  Go into effect if people actually believe Philip hamburger and his argument about how the the First Amendment interplays with the internet  We don't have an open internet anymore  We have a very locked down and and a very proprietary kind of internet and that's not the internet that I want and this shouldn't  Be the internet that anyone especially anyone watching this  Listening to this as an open podcast with yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are should exactly and and part of what they're going after is to bring liability  To anyone for anything so that the hell that Mike has gone through in a few cases becomes all of our help

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everybody can go through this everybody say that again and again section 230 means that we can have a chat room and we can have forums  And you know we can have people on our show if you lose section 230. I'll just be me talking very carefully  I'll have a lawyer  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Want lawyer says get rid of Travis first oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  First ago Jeff are you kidding? Oh, yeah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's a nice guy, but yeah, I've only been in one life and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I will never and I by the way I was a plaintiff. I was suing I will never ever  Voluntarily do that again is if nobody's been if anybody's ever not been through a lawsuit and  Mike you've been through several it is awful. It's expensive. It's boring. It's time-consuming  It's frustrating. It's everything that you would hate bundled into one big  Hairy ball of eight it's terrible, so yes, I hate you have my deepest  You have to defend yourself right yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know the other thing that amazes me is that you have some law professors not talking about  Professor hamburger here  But other law professors who I think are serious thinkers or they appear to be serious thinkers who keep saying that if we change section 230  It's fine the courts will kind of sort it out and everyone can just you know argue things out in court  It's just like have you ever been sued have you exactly this process?  It is not it is not the kind of thing where you know you  Nobody wants to go through it and and the pressures are all to sort of cave in you know and and not to actually defend your  Rights because the the cost of actually defending your rights and money obviously but also just in time  Concentration stress levels you know my blood pressure  You know is is so high and so extreme that you know  It's really just not worth it for most people to go through that that process and you know not that I'm doing so the chill

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Becomes Arctic nobody nobody was that's the problem. It is a chill absolutely chilling effect  Just saying as with any repressive regime you wonder why people put up with a repressive regime and keep your head down

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the safest thing to do and even you know to be clear because of that. It's not just the cases that go to court  I mean you know without going into any other detail  I'll say that that you know we've faced. I think it's four threats this year  Some of which were fairly serious that we have to take seriously and that is time attentions and stress  And you know and we're willing to defend the decisions that we've made because we stand behind them  But you know it's the chilling effect is is really significant. I'm really fortunate because my business partner and wife

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Lisa her attitude is  We fight everything we don't settle we keep going yeah  even though it costs us more almost always cost you more than to settle because  Yeah, and trolls and everybody else they know exactly how much to ask for and just enough so that it's cheaper to settle  But Lisa is a is somebody who really believes in principle. She says nope never gonna settle  It's a precedence. We're gonna fight. Yeah, cuz I don't yeah, I think that's the reason she doesn't want to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, cuz in the long run that you know then you're just flinging open the door everyone says oh, they'll settle so we'll do it  We'll get our we'll get our fee and then that adds up so yeah, and a lot of times it does make sense to fight it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Speaking of section 230 Amy Klobuchar speaking of you know Democrats get it wrong too sometimes  And I think with the best intention. She's trying to shut down  Vaccine misinformation, but she's introduced a bill that would in effect carve out an exception to section 230  to allow  people to  take down  vaccine  Misinformation is that necessary fine misinformation? Yeah  the health is information act of 2021

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  well the bill actually  Tasks the head of Health and Human Services with defining what is misinformation. How could that possibly go wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually you wrote a great what did you what did you your headline in this was something like I don't even remember something about  It was good. It was like I like it was good. Let's all right. Let's let's let's talk  Let's go to our happy place. Let's go to our happy place. We'll talk about the pixel six. Let's take a little break  We'll take a little break a little a moose bouche a little palette refresher to take the the poor taste of  Section 230 out of our mouth, and then we will then we will talk about  The pixel six our show today brought to you quite literally by our CDN our our content delivery network  Cashfly cashfly has been innovating content delivery since  1999 and I know it firsthand  We've we've been using them for the podcast for almost the whole time when we first started to it  So many people downloaded it that the website crashed. Okay, we need a better way  Let's see then we went to BitTorrent and I was I was reduced to begging every show  Please seed our show so that others can hear it that didn't work out  So well, then Matt Levine from cash flies one of the founders called me and said Leo we can help him man  Have they helped it's great  If you and it's one of those things that you probably don't notice  But whenever you're downloading one of our shows audio or video and it comes in lickety split and there's no delays. There's no pauses  You could thank cash fly cash fly has 50 over 50 points of presence all over the world  Which means it's the fastest CDN for global throughput  You can get our content from a server that's near you and now cash fly has introduced  Ultra-low latency streaming using the same network  It's not the WebRTC solution that has led us all down in the past stream delays on ultra-low latency streaming with cash fly less than one  Second one second latency that almost seems impossible. It's it's  Practically infinitely scalable they can deliver a video to more than a million users concurrently  Plus ingest thousands of synchronous streams  I'm this is a mind-boggling technology their platforms designed for transmuting thousands of streams  simultaneously with live failover RTMP  RTMPs gets ingested and turned into low latency ultra low latency SLDP and HLS streams  Simultaneously, they offer a great HTML5 player  You can use with an SDK that means it can work anywhere  You want your player to run websites applications mobile devices, whatever platform you're on on  Their low latency network  Global network your video streams will stream  Perfectly anywhere you have viewers no matter what continent they're on  It's really a remarkable solution and the thing one of the things I love about cash flies  They're great support their engineers are there  24 7 365 to help you with any issues and they will design a custom solution based on your unique  Needs all built on their reliable robust global network. That's so good. They can offer a hundred percent SLA  Now I'm not gonna four nine five nine ten nine thousand nine's  SLA a million concurrent streams five times faster than other CDN's. They're nice people too. They've donated now  Considerable amount of money through world central kitchen nice job  They pioneered the first anycast CDN infrastructure way back in 2002 2002  Their best hop technology does it it automatically finds the fastest route to and from customer origin anywhere in those 50 pops  Look just for you right now  You can find out how much cash fly can save you you can see what their custom solution would do for you  You may be overpaying 20% or more for your content delivery network, and if you're not using a CDN  Stop the insanity go to twit cash fly comm right now twit  dot cash fly  Comm say goodbye to outages at 3 a.m. Twit. That was that was my line to it dot because I I don't want that 3 a.m  Phone call the podcast the servers are down never happens with cash like twit dot cash fly comm  Thank You cash fly  Now an interesting story we talked about this on Mac break weekly yesterday actually because  Apple is famous for saying nothing  You could speculate all you want everybody knows there's gonna be a new iPhone in September everybody knows that we can guess what?  Will be new on that there's even leaks, but they are lips are sealed in the fact they go after well  They'll arrest people they'll go after they'll arrest people they went after somebody in China who was sharing the prototypes  And said not only not only their Chinese lawyers say stop knock it off  They said and by the way we want to know everybody who gave we want to know who gave you those so we can go after  them to  Should they not?  Should they not what?  Go after those leakers. I think when you do it in China. It's a little bit different  It's a little bit of a threat yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know well they also they went after a journalist at Gawker back in the day  Yeah, who just picked up a phone somebody left behind and  They have their own police force cops to go after me

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But actually this is the question should they not because Google  In the face of kind of endless leaks about whatever Google does has decided to do the opposite  And I think this actually might be a successful strategy  Rick Osterloh they started with tweets and then Rick Osterloh invited a handful of tame journalists in  To look at the pixel 6 he wouldn't let him take pictures of it wouldn't let him video it  But look at it and to give them a pitch which was you know if you look at what they learned  It was essentially an ad  For what the pixel 6 would be without any real details for instance one of the things Osterloh is all excited about is is the  Fact that Google is going to design its own  system on a chip for this  When unmentioned is well what exactly is they're calling it tensor  Because it will have probably elements of the TPU that Google offers right now, but  That's only a part of the chip the AI part, and it's widely speculated  They were talking about this yesterday and all about Android that actually it's Samsung making this  system on a chip  But you know the pixel 6 pixel 6 Pro available sometime this fall and  I think this might be a good strategy it for one thing they showed pictures of it so that  Short-circuits all the little leaks and stuff some many of which are wrong  Gives you an idea we know the phone's coming really they didn't say anything  We didn't already know we've seen pictures of it the camera bar in the back and stuff  And it really gets a lot of attention. It's a way to get good publicity. I can't wait I  Know I'm you know what it worked. I will buy it  I know the  Conclusion on my weekly we yesterday was the reason Apple doesn't do this is they're selling actively selling the iPhone 12 right now  They're not going to talk about the iPhone 13 and all  Good point they don't want to and Google sure maybe this will kill sales of the pixel 5 I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have to laugh because what so the three people that were going to buy the last pixel what are you gonna kill wait?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, so they have nothing to lose I guess by this strategy  But I think there's a lot to be gained by this  I think there are a lot of people like Jeff and me who will say oh good schmucks. Maybe I won't buy the Samsung  Whatever Galaxy Fold 3 which I guess is gonna be announced next week. Maybe I won't buy that maybe I'll wait for the pixel 6  That's so there's nothing but benefit for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google okay, I'm waiting for the time right now, and I'm waiting for the pixel 6  And this is killing me both my machines are ready to die. What's the cx9 is that your next? That's the  Book yeah, that's the beautiful Chromebook we talked about but it's out of it's out of stock is that why you're waiting for yeah  I like was what up. I don't mean to change the subject for this what I do here. I went up and  Within minutes it was a will notify you I want to be shortage

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Chip shortage, it's gonna be that way for everything chip shortage even cook and the Apple  Analyst call this week or last week said we're gonna be hit by chip shortages not for the main chips  Flagship chips like the m1 and the a16 we're gonna be hit with he called them legacy nodes  the processors that every phone has it made by little companies in China and you know the  Accelerometers and the you know all these little chips is GPS chips things like that that we use that everybody else uses  We're gonna be hit hard  So I'm sure this will happen so you're buying these six

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why are you buying the six? I'm just curious so I skipped the five  Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because they didn't change much  Right it was the same camera system  All right this for the first time they're changing it. There's a new camera system  They didn't give out much information about it. They showed the folks in the room pictures and videos  But they weren't allowed to share those three cameras telephoto lens with 4x optical zoom not as big as as Samsung's but  Still you know a reason to get it I I you know I I actually bought a Samsung  s21 Ultra  Because there was a deal on Google Phi  About a month ago thinking all right. You know what this pixel 5 has fallen apart  I'm sorry pixel 4 is your for art for I should although I did fix it  But I was thinking maybe it's time to get a Samsung and then they said oh  There's a delay and so I canceled it because really I don't want that I I like pixels right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Plus I'm not too keen on the 4x  The the 4x zoom I'm not too keen on that you'd like more. What is the the Samsung s21 is like?  No, no, no, no, no, no, I I still think with these sensors being as small as they are  It just doesn't it just doesn't work to have such a large zoom you really should just zoom with your feet

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Samsung's claiming a hundred X zoom and the pictures I've seen actually look  Look pretty good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The last one I don't think it was the 21  But there was one mr. Howe had and he allowed me to play with it at the studio  We went outside and did a little zoom test and then quite frankly. I thought it looked terrible

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well compared to your fancy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It just looks terrible, you know even  Looks like a look at this video. This is a really good job. This is from Hassan Vora the phono guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look, he's gonna do let me let he's gonna 1x 2x  3x 5x 6x 8x  1220 this is on a Samsung ultra the 21st. Oh, yeah, you see it's soft. You see it's soft, but you get the picture I  Don't want that picture

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's just for looking at something  But I don't want that to be printed out or or shared or anything like that  That's just for me to zoom in and look at something that I can't see far off with my own eyes. That's my opinion  Yeah, for example, I went out just the other night  To go check out the deer here in the field because I know they're always out there and I don't have binoculars  I'd rather just pick up a camera and just zoom in and look even though I know the picture is gonna be horrible  I'm still just looking through for my own edification just for the view of those deer off in the distance  And I think that's what these smartphones and their zooms are all about because from a picture standpoint, it just don't look good  You're a photographer Instagram. They just don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Eat rats those deer are you're a photographer you have higher standards. I think a lot of people  Especially with kids and others for instance. I was visiting my dad on Monday just like you Jeff. My dad's not as old  He's 88 and show my screen. Can you are you stuck? There you go  There's a hawk in that tree. Good luck finding it. So I manually zoomed  This is with an iPhone, but I was able to I mean, yes, it gets soft  But for a lawyer with your family and say look what I for a lot of us  Being able to get that I agree if you're you know, look, it's no Scott born bird photo. I know no  But that's not what I wanted I just wanted some record of the fact that that hawk was there  Yeah, so I think your your standards are a little different

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, probably so. Yeah, I want to talk about the tensor piece because I think that I  Mean, is it really you raised the question Leo? Is it really tensor or they just use the brand? You know, how much is it AI?  But but the more processing occurs on your phone is it's you know, it's what happened reading my book about the early days newspapers  Where you had dumb terminals and then more and more and more smart went around the terminal than you had your own computer  right and the phone has been not dumb at all, but it's getting smarter and smarter and smarter and smarter and the process you can occur there for  immediate action like translation for improving photos for  Privacy and not setting things up the cloud. I think that's the frontier that the Google has been talking about now for two or three IOs  Maybe just maybe we'll start to see actually come to fruition Rick Osterloh demonstrated for the attendant

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Attendant journalists something that you can't currently do, you know, Google has I think by the way  It works really nicely on the pixel for this auto transcribe  So if there's audio on a YouTube video, whatever it gives you the trans I love that feature. I think it's a good  Well, or you could do simultaneous translation with the Google Translate app, but you can't do both  So he demonstrated now thanks to the tensor chip. We can do this on phone  simultaneous  transcript transcription and translation  Very cool. I think that's a really good example of having more powerful AI on them  Compute a phone can do I  Don't know Mike what phone what do you use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is gonna be embarrassing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you say Nokia 3310, it'll be very very cool. Yeah. No I have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  oneplus  Five five. It's a great  Yeah, but it's it's old  I tend to buy phones and then use them until they're on their very very last legs and then then I then I get deep into  What is what is the latest and greatest and try and find something that would last me another?  another few years before I have to look again, but  Yeah, I mean I'm sort of always paying attention to it. But yeah, I like the one plus five and it's actually it's a great phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was the last good one plus actually  We don't buy another one plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why I actually haven't been been following it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they they got merged back into their Chinese parent company oppo. I see  All the reviews of the latest one pluses are that they're not they're not great  But I think the one I loved I agree with you. I loved the original one pluses and I loved the one plus five  But I think that might have been the last one  That was good to note, but if you like this, I think the pixel six would be actually a very good  Next phone for you. Is this is this latest phone a thousand dollar phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And in are you all willing to pay for it other than mr. Look for it. Well, hey

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mr. Moneybags over here. What are you talking about?  You've already said you're gonna buy it anyway  You already said you're gonna buy it they didn't announce a price they actually had some funny verbiage  I don't know if I can find it where they said that there's gonna be two the pixel six and the six pro  the six will be  Like a hot like high-end phone price and  The I gotta find the pricing the phrasing you're gonna have to parse it. They did not give a price

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I was thinking they were mentioning it the way Apple did the their last couple phones  They had the pro and then at the pro max  You know, I mean, what's the max run, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  1299 you  Think Google dares go that high. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, well, and so that's the thing. You got to listen to what the words that they said were if I can find them and  And

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see the price your question is I've skipped two versions I used to buy every damn phone  I'm at the 3a XL so I skipped the four and I skipped the five  To you I'm being penurious. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pixel 6 belongs to the upper segment and can keep with the competing products  But the pixel 6 Pro this is Rick Osterlo will be expensive  It was specially designed for users who want the latest technology that sounds to me  899 and  1200 no, I don't think no even Google knows you can't sell a $1,200 phone  All right, so probably 1100 would be the highest that they'd be willing to go. It'll be around a thousand

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It strikes me. It's just interesting to note that like how much more expensive phones have gotten over the last few years as compared to like  What I'm saying computers that you know always seem to get cheaper  But the phones get more expensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they're not doing as much I mean there is AI out there to help out with certain tasks  But for the most part is still a phone with very limited capabilities from a productivity standpoint

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and and I mean, you know, it's getting to the point where the phones are as much as the computers or even I mean  You can get you know, oh, yeah, if you can find them Jeff, you can get good  For a lot less. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is there a justification for the higher price I mean that is yourization is always  Miniaturization has always cost more right? It's a  The smaller it is the more expensive it is and I think that you're seeing screen technologies that are very expensive now  Oh LEDs with no bezels things like that. I don't know if it's justified. That's an interesting question

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are they just every time I ask that people look at me as a cheapskate?  Something is just have a certain value, you know and a thousand dollars for a smartphone still just doesn't quite  Hit it for me considering what it's going to do and how long it's going to actually last considering like your  Pixel 4 XL is now bursting at the scene

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but yeah, but thanks to the right to repair and I fix it  I was able to put a new battery in it and it's good as new  So that's good news. It was the battery exploding  It wasn't the well it was on its way to exploding  You know, I was just putting up with it  One morning I came in and the back was kind of coming off. It has a goiter your phone  And I thought what's going on? Why is the back coming off?  I maybe the glue failed because it wasn't an obvious bulge, but then I mentioned it on the air  I think it's because the battery's bulging and everybody from father Robert on down said oh no, don't charge that phone  It could blow up exactly. So I  Went to it I was gonna buy as I said a Samsung s21, but then I thought you know what 39 bucks  I fix it. They send you the tools. Yeah, I should  Oh, oh, no, I should demonstrate my  My geek cred and I did fix it. It wasn't hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was and and I also want to say that that I understand that security is also built into the pricing  At least it should be  Some people say if you can buy it unless it's expensive smartphone  You're gonna miss out on security updates because it's probably running an older version of the OS and so on and so forth  I get that but still at the same time thousand dollars thousand dollars. Well, and they're I think the thing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Confirms your argument is there are very very good phones for two and three hundred bucks  That are don't you have the security concerns? No, I don't think I mean Motorola's  G  G power which I get is what I get from my daughter whenever she breaks her phone  50 bucks it's  The Motorola's giving them updates  They it's a great phone. It's pretty clean. It's as clean as you know, Motorola used to be Google  Yeah, they used to be quite nice. They still are they're just very similar to the old Motorola  Phones that we loved that when they were Google  They're still cleanly made they don't have a lot of crap wear on them

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mm-hmm. I think part of the answer is is what I will now know is the Maznik doctrine  Don't buy a phone very often when you buy it  You want to buy something that you don't want to buy something you feel as a smart  You want to buy something's gonna you're gonna stick with that's smart. Yeah, that makes sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I say that about other tech, you know, I'm gonna spend pretty big. Yeah, like what do you smell on cameras mister? Wow  What do you spend on cameras? Yeah, right you could buy a new camera for about four grand five grand and you'll have it almost a decade

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah  Yeah, that's not I mean, but remember last time you bought a camera and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's been a while. Oh, no  About a year and a half, but I should I should

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Your role is the house  Photographer here you get all the camera reviews  So you're reviewing the latest and greatest stuff all the time for hands-on technology, right? Mm-hmm. Yeah, so you don't you know  As I remember the r5 the new Canon mirrorless was a choice that you really liked right? Yeah, that's quite nice  Yeah, quite nice, but you and you don't have one right now. You had to send it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't I still want one but I would have that camera for almost a decade. I know I would

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Remember in the old days you'd buy a TV  And in the last ten years

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm trying to convince my wife that ours doesn't work and she said no it those days

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh don't seem to be around anymore, right televisions

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You they go what four years now five and that's because what a TV used to be a durable good like a dishwasher or a refrigerator  but now they're a technology good and  Technology, you know, even though the hardware is not gonna fail  Right the technology moves on and you well, and hell Leo we're old enough. No TVs were furniture

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were for durable good. They were in a cabinet  Yeah, our stereo our stereo was a gigantic. Yeah piece of furniture. Our TV was a big console piece of furniture

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and now it's all in your pocket  That's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's true. I actually wrote an article for the American Association of retired people magazine  Which I mentioned that the resolution of Neil Armstrong walking on the moon is actually lower than the resolution of your Apple watch  Much lower  Yeah, that's perspective. Yeah, so you're wearing on your wrist something that you know is better than your Zenith TV from 1969 easily  Yeah, a smaller is the only silly problem  Gotta hold it right up to your eye  And then it works  Facebook  What do you think I'm gonna say anything good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're gonna be quite objective  That's what I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Facebook disables accounts tied to NYU's research into political ads saying well  They used unauthorized means to collect data  Maybe that was what they did wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe they the NYU ad observatory book users, but who were those users? Yeah, who were they?  Advertisers, oh  So is that advertiser a user is it public?  You know, I think that 90% of what I see says Facebook not good  10% says well, there's a few issues here. I'm curious to hear Mike on this one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But wasn't that plug-in that that the is voluntary using it was browser

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the volunteers who put it up, but there was also going to other people's pages

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stuff the volunteers site had a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook I'm on this side. I agree with the complaints. I think points are right here, but there is some  People like like like Daphne Keller. She's saying there's a few issues. All right, but let me defend what there's a few little issues

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. Let me defend what the overarching benefit of this is the NYU ad observatory  And what they were trying the purpose of this was to kind of understand how political ads  Propagated what dark money groups are spending necessary research

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Entirely incredibly important necessary research. Yes, I agree. All right, and Facebook Facebook should just give them the data  I mean the problem is that Facebook refuses to get in the data  The answer is Facebook give them the data and stop messing around. Yep, exactly right exactly right there. That's it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right next story as usual like does it well that was easy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like we like to  The browser extension which again was used voluntarily by volunteers on their Facebook account  Copied ads that people saw on Facebook stored that data a public database. It did collect user names  Links to user profiles and information about why users see a particular ad  And that information can't be isn't publicly available  You have to have an account on Facebook and that's why they had to give this plug-in

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you could you could see examples where that kind of thing could be used for nefarious purposes  And that is the 10% that Jeff was referring to but did you see Mozilla's response to this?  On the on the rundown yeah go go find it and pull it out 24 I will I have it line 24

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here we are why Facebook's claims about the ad observer are wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead anybody can talk. Yeah, so I mean, you know, basically Mozilla is saying that the the they you know checked out the  The code of the the extension and it is not privacy invasive  Oh interesting, so there's you know, they're sort of reinforcing the NYU folks

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the reason they have a dog in this hunt is because it's an extension that runs on their browser on fire  Right, so they as they always do before they recommend an extension analyzed its its behavior, but they did recommend it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right and so it is it is sort of an odd situation because you can see an argument where  You could you can you know picture a hypothetical scenario where there would be a similar kind of extension that also had nefarious purposes  Such as you know a Cambridge Analytica style extension that was sucking updated to then be used to you know  Manipulate you with this information and you could see where a company like Facebook that has been fined billions of dollars  For allowing Cambridge Analytica to do what it did might have to put in place rules that say like hey, we won't allow this  but  you know in this case, this is clearly not that kind of situation and  As I said at the beginning and and cut short this discussion like Facebook's  Give give give them the data

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Mozilla does say you know  We we like to be proactive about third parties collecting data and we made an exception in this case  because it was good faith security research and  So we feel like that the benefits to society outweighed the potential risks  They also said it doesn't collect personal posts information about your friends  It does not compile a user profile on its server  So a lot of the things that you might say well, I don't want it to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right and what we should have is a general we should go even beyond this and I've said this long since  You know in this case, it's for researchers to be able to look at the advertising which is vital  But there should just be a general policy of all advertising in my mind, but let's start with political advertising  where  What it's targeted to well, I've said this before problem with saying what it's targeted to is that then you can find out  If that ad came on my page  You might find out something about me as a result sir  There are privacy issues there  But but the ads the who places the ad and the targeting of those ads in general purposes tied to at least to the ad  Should be transparent. Yeah as a matter of policy and should be not just Facebook every media company and Facebook  We're doing the same thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Forget getting in while you involve Facebook should just publish it right? Yes, they were going  What didn't they say? Well, they have the  Some

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some I was gonna say they publish some data  But what the NYU people have said is it's not it's not all of the data that they have and it's not the data that  Is most useful for them as researchers to explore. So sorry Jeff. Go ahead with no

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, the other point is that we were trying to say they should also probably be transparent about this to the to the user  And about the ad and so I had this discussion at a meeting of a lot of  Rabbit the rabbit a lot of highly critical  Facebook observers  And there was a now former Facebook person there who they trusted we just said yeah  but the problem is that if an ad is  targeted to  Old men with white hair  Then  You can start you can  You can then see that  Because the ad was targeted me you now know something about what Facebook says about me because of the targeting behind the scenes  And that makes that public  So there are issues of privacy around this but they are solvable and and and and Mike's absolutely right we need  Facebook could end all of this by creating a policy of transparency about political advertising and making that as transparent as possible  While also protecting privacy it's possible to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're not and they're Mike Mazik a master class and how to take a two-line story  a half-hour discussion  I'm learning. Yeah, we're here. This is our real skill actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's behind the video. Yeah, the OEC it's 45 minutes of Leo manages to piss me off. Oh  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just wait Jeff just wait. I'm being nice you were gone for a getting started. Yeah  Time to ease in ease into  Actually, I was gonna read this story on the Boston Globe about this natick custom couple harassed by eBay  Was buying a paywall when I clicked close it gave me a blank story  But then I I refreshed and I was able to get it. So I don't know there  Maybe they need to work on that earlier. Yeah, so what happened?  To this couple they start it starts  There's they're doing like a lot of people selling some  leftover stuff on on eBay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then they start writing a newsletter or blog or something saying oh this things we learned about how to do it better  And this they offered advice that became their business to advise people about how to sell on eBay. Yeah, that's usually  Like back Mike Masnick to any given technology company they might have some criticism well, yeah  eBay sick literally sick the dogs on I'm sick their security head on them doing all kinds of terrible things  Painting graffiti onto their fence at their home sending pizzas to be delivered to their least of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what this reminds me of is Scientology  Yeah, I have a friend for a longtime friend who was a Scientologist she left and  The things Scientology would do to you if you left were very similar  Harassment, yep, where did eBay get the idea? This was a good idea  Well, one of the people start with the leadership

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I I still can't figure out what the what the end game here was, right?  I took tremendous interest in this story as a small independent publication that often criticizes large technology companies  But but like what is the end game?  What do they think is gonna happen that that if they?  Intimidate this couple over and over again send dead pigs to their house follow them around town in dark vans  You know show up in the middle of the night graffiti their house that that's gonna suddenly make them decide to walk away. I  mean because the only way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like I mean a troll and a mafia boss. Yeah, yeah similar similar behavior there  so and I thought about like what what happens if YouTube were to do this because if you go to YouTube and and  Decide okay. I want to start a YouTube channel and I want to make this thing big and great and so many views and likes and so  on you're gonna look up resources to try to  Get all of those goals and you'll see a gazillion different  YouTube creators given you their best tips and sometimes well the mistake the mistake these couple made is they started they pivoted from

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Simple tips to talking about the journalism and the company in the way it was run and so forth according to  The I guess they're suing  Or maybe there's a criminal prosecution

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, one guy's in jail. It was a sentence for a year and a half. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Prostitutes go ahead. Did you hear his excuse though? No, he said it was the he blamed the  The alcoholic culture at eBay. Oh, that's alright then

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know the weird the way it began was a little weird. They spray-painted graffiti on their new fence  But instead of writing something really insulting they spray paint alone fighter Fido master and  And the couple said we  We googled it to see if something kids are saying these days. What does that even?  Mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So maybe the guy was drunk. It was a user like it was a username

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Again, they said it was it was a troll on their site  And so they were sort of I guess trying to imply that it was the troll that like, you know people in their

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fido master painting my name on your fence  Prosecutors said the harassment campaign starting with the fence  Spray painting incident was directed by James bow be a UGH who headed eBay's global security and resiliency unit  Do you wouldn't you like you know when I start a global security and resiliency unit? You'll know that we're in trouble  That's a sign  That's a sign  Resiliency along with other participants in the scheme bow was charged last year with conspiracy to commit cyber stalking and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Conspiracy to commit witness tampering. He's awaiting trial. So cyber star wait wait conspiracy to commit cyber stalking. That's a statute

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. Oh, wow. Yeah, I didn't know that good thing right and witness tampering  Gosh this is this is it's an amazing story  But it's and I think you have a link they thought it was all like kind of goofy, you know  Roger Stone grade harassment, right? Not like the life's the van following you around  Yeah, but not life-threatening. They called a taxidermy  An animal parts shop in Arizona. They called to ask about an order  for a fetal pig  You know, it's just it's like  It's like wasn't like they hit him over the head with a hammer  They delivered a sympathy wreath for one of the members of the couple  The the driver said he had come from Central Square in Cambridge was instructed to leave the  $255 wreath by the back door without ringing a bell  You know, that's it's harassment, but it's not you know what I'm saying. It's no but I mean for the for the couple

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's still terrifying right? I mean, they said they started sleeping apart, you know, they set up  Next yeah, I mean it was just they were they were constantly stressed out and and terrified and you can see why I  Mean, I think it's pretty bad two people from the security and resiliency team

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Flew to Boston rented two vehicles checked into the Ritz-Carlton hotel  Initially planned to plant a tracking device in the Steiner's car, but it was locked in the garage  So they went back to the hotel  The next day they cops really is the next day they came back  Steiner the one of the man was up on a cup a ladder installing security cameras  While his wife handed him tools out of a second floor window. Suddenly she saw a dark colored Dodge Caravan  Driving up their streets black van New York plates. She told David as the van drove past  We felt in danger. We felt like targets. It took another pass by the house and  Then later in the day the same van pulled out to follow him while he was in a car with his friend  it's it is you know, this is gonna be a great movie because

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the thing is too. There's there's other stuff. I can't talk about it. But in previous regimes  eBay did other bad stuff  And so there's a there's an interesting cultural thing here. Yeah to use the highfalutin word  Okay  And and then so the the the CEO CEO then I've met a couple times  He was a he was he was number two executive of Reuters. This is not a technology story. This is a crappy company story  But there seemed to be a lot of them. Look at this fire. Look at this blizzard

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Story the the World of Warcraft team and the harassment and the weird stuff that's going on  How do companies get this toxic culture? How does that even happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  power and power wealth and power I  Say it's not just technology. Let's let's be clear about that. It's lots of companies. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What we need is a powerful government that can crack down on kids playing games late at night. That's what we need  Ten cent under some pressure I think from the Chinese ruling party  Has cut kids playing time on their flagship game honor of Kings if you're under the age of 18 in China  Your playing time will be limited to one hour on regular days two hours on public holidays

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jesus mom and dad

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Previously I read this and I could see my mom's just yeah just applauding  Yes, many times and she fussed at me about

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Half an hour of television every night. That's all you're allowed  It was choice between Batman and the man from uncle and I just three hours of podcast no problem  Yeah, why do you think I do such a long show now? Yeah  That there was a government directive issued in late 2019 which  Actually was the original cut back to an hour and a half on a regular day in three hours on holidays  They also banned players under the age of 12 from spending money to top up in the game. That's fine  If you're between 12 and 16, you could spend up to 200 yuan a month. That's about 31 bucks a month  No charge could be more than 50 yuan  While those between 16 and 18 years old are limited to 400 yuan a month. I  Think this is fine. In fact, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Think we should why do you think this is fine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, first of all, it's not the government doing it. It's it's the game company doing that  I think this would be fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that this is that really that different in this case? No, okay, maybe but if if

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  if I when I was playing Simpsons tapped out if they had said you cannot buy 200 donuts and  I wouldn't have been the end of the world. You invested that Amazon stock. I know I'd be wealthy man right now. Yeah  if  Tick-tock instead of just having some guys say, you know, you're really been doing tick-tock a long time  You should have a drink of water simply said enough is enough go to bed  Shmuck, I don't think that would be a bad thing  It's not the again if the if the government's doing it, I you know, I understand but if a company  Even because of the you know, stink-eye from the CCP says and maybe we should do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think that's so bad is it but as Mike said it's not the company the company and the government are the same thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In this case, but you said the crackdown Oh Tencent is not a Chinese government  But Tencent is one of the companies like DD like and financial that the Chinese government is paying a lot of attention to all of us  right, so that they may be just be sensing the  change in the wind I  You know, I it's very interesting. I think that there are a number of people I quoted last week  Didn't I know a Smith of no up the no opinion blog, which is the best name for a blog ever  Saying that it really is Chinese the Chinese government's focusing  their resources on hard tech not consumer tech not not  Things that don't actually produce something of value and now for the foreign affairs  Magazines calls it China's Sputnik moment. It's it's it's the Chinese government saying yeah, you know what?  We're gonna crack down on consumer internet companies and by the way on for-profit online education firms  And the foreign affairs says in order to impart to redirect the country's efforts towards other strategic technology military such as computer chips  Yeah, they say it's military but Huawei for instance. Nobody's cracking down on Huawei. Nobody's cracking down on the in fact  They're putting a lot of money into  in internal chip design and things like that in country chip design, so I  Am that makes sense I can understand why they might want to do that  But they do they have time crystals. Sorry. No  Only we have time crystals that segue the greatest  According to next web and you know, I look to them for scientific information

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The greatest scientific achievement of our lifetime. I want you to explain this to me you smart folks

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Any takers on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The only thing I know is that apparently it violates the laws of thermodynamics

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Says it's a big screw you to sir Isaac Newton  It's a perpetual motion machine, but it's at the very smallest  Molecular level and they use the Google says they use the quantum computing labs to do it  They create the world's first time crystal inside the quantum computing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it changes state without using energy exactly is that the basic thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if you had and the analogy TNW uses if you had an ice cube that would melt and refreeze  You know in a cycle, but but never have any energy come in or go out. That would be like a time crystal  Alright, and that's her and that violates  That's that violates it just law of first law of motion and  Also and the wall of entropy right the law of the universe always moving towards it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does feel like the beginning of a very bad science fiction movie

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, just the name it's the name frankly time crystal if they call it oscillating from fabric  Interventionist time  Capsule we'd all go. Okay fine. Whatever. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't know the paper call it. I don't know. I didn't look at that should have paper good Lord

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's an academic paper. Of course there is going to the source. What an idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me see this is from our Vicks  Observation of time crystalline eigenstate order on a quantum processor. Look at all the names  They had so many names on this article that they actually had to leave five of them out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For those of you on audio, it's a very fat paragraph. It's yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, Jeff you asked for it  Did you know quantum many-body systems display rich phase structure in their low temperature?  Equilibrium states however much of nature is not in thermal equilibrium remarkably  Remarkably it was recently predicted that out of equilibrium systems can exhibit novel  dynamical phases that may otherwise be forbidden by equilibrium thermal dynamics a  paradigmatic example being the discrete time crystal we shall call DTC

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does that help

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the doctor Phil interpretation  Concretely dynamical phases can be defined and periodically do have any many many  Something about eigenstates

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My god next web really did did go over the top I kind of enjoyed this is the most important thing  It's gonna even know what it means. They don't know what means but they but it's gotta be the greatest scientific achievement of our lifetimes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think that's actually true. I think you could point to some other pretty important  Achievements what it's interesting to me because it's it's it's another quantum computing  step and  Google likes to announce these by the way, they were the second team to do this  The other ones did not use a quantum computer  They did it some other way  But it's a state of matter that sounds like a big deal. Yeah, the other other team did it in a diamond

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hmm what in a diamond? Yeah, so is it the time diamond?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was it was a time sandwich wouldn't you rather have it the diamond than an a quantum computer  I'm still skeptical over this whole quantum computer thing. It's not I just yeah  Okay, anyway good on you Google if there weren't so much government money pouring into this I'd be a little less skeptical I  Feel like it's just well, let's build this lab we can get some money for it. It'll be a great job  I love this  New York Times article two influencers who were very upset that they and some of their friends have been taking advantage of by online  Brands just not paying them enough money  For the women especially women for their plugs have created a website called if you pay me and  And they basically the the  FYPM  Dot VIP basically the ID is like a glass door for influencers  so you find out what other influencers are getting paid for their brand campaigns and  That gives you the power to negotiate for a better deal for yourself. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Saw this and I really enjoyed the idea of this  but the other side of me said well  Maybe you need to hire a better manager as well because I know of a couple female influencers such as Elise Swoap's  She's doing quite well for herself  Being an influence on Instagram and in Twitter and so on and so forth and so well to where she's even gone to Belize  With you know, the Smith family Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith and all of them  She's of her work. Yes. I mean it's  She's able to negotiate I'm sorry, but she was able to get a good management team to help her with I just hate the whole

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Influencer thing just drives me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I will go ahead and say on her behalf. She hates it, too  Yeah, but she's cashing at the same time. She understands  She understands her value, you know  She understands that the art that she can create to help with with brands and and marketing and whatnot, you know  So hey, she's a gun for hire if you will and she does a damn good job with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I mean, I think I think I think there's something really interesting about that  Just the information sharing aspect of it, right?  Sure  The issue here was that they felt like they were being taken advantage of because there's an information asymmetry  They don't know what's going on. So the information sharing part I think is really cool  Yeah, the thing that's good that made me a little bit, you know  Feel a little weird about this is is even like the the term  That becomes the name of that website, you know  I kind of where that comes from and where that's been used in the past is in cases where you know  People have you know done stuff willingly  As a volunteer for free and then gotten mad afterwards over the fact that they they you know volunteer to do stuff and and  there's this sort of belief around that particular statement that nobody should ever do anything for free and  I you know as someone who's now doing my entire career for  Congratulations

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We need an F you pay me for bloggers  The podcast yeah, no, it's the info that's a perfect phrase  Information asymmetry and there's a lot of sites like this  That's what your last door is all about find out what others in your field are getting paid so that you can negotiate more fairly  And by the way plenty of employers are  Adamant do not share how much you make with other  Staff members because they know that's just a recipe for disaster  Because if people knew they might say well, hey ants getting  $50 an hour. Why am I getting ten, you know, and I hear by the way people tell me that all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah, the other thing here is that is that you tell them bless. There's different reasons less your heart

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ants a lot cuter than you are

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's different reasons to do it too when people would screaming about how Peter post steals people I  Put my stuff up for free on how Peter post cuz I got audience there, right? I got value out of it  I try that's your choice. That's reasonable choice

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We we had a sponsor for some time  That that was for graphic artists. You would put up a job that you wanted to do and you'd ask graphic artists to  Provide samples kind of to bid for the job  And a lot of people said no, no, no, don't ever do work for free. That's fine  Don't if you don't want to same thing with photographers. It comes up a lot with photographers  You know don't do it for free, but there are some people for whom that that is a sensible economic choice  Nobody's forcing you to do it for free. Yeah  Don't tell you and Lisa, but I do this show for free

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Listen quick

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You'll see a lot of I'm the only one doing this show for free. Oh, I mean my yes, that's true  You know, there's a lot and a lot of folks in the creator creative community and some of them that are rated as

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Quotes influencers, they will tell you that yeah, there are times when you do some things for free  I know I have there were certain opportunities presented to me in the past and you know, someone wanted to  Offer up a payment for it and I said no I want to do this pro bono  I'm not going to do this for free. I'm not going to do this for free. I'm not going to do this for free  I want to do this pro bono or what have you because I felt like I'm going to get more out of that that one gig  in the long run  That's gonna pay me and that's your choice right now. It was my right. So sometimes yeah  You can choose to do some things for free. You don't expect to do everything for free  Yeah, but every now and then it's okay to do some jobs

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's up at the point is it's your choice, but the but I agree with Mike information is key  So you need to make an informed choice and if people are normally getting a thousand dollars for what you're about to do for free  That might be helpful to know that and might change your point of view about doing it for free

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there's also matters of equity too. There's you know, what I've started out in the business. Oh here goes Jarvis  My first internship I don't have to say anything anymore. Jeff just does it for himself. I chill myself  At Chicago today the people that I know tomorrow is paid $75 a week. Well, I could afford to do that  Right. I'm still in college and and and now I understand that free internships are not a good thing because of the inequity  Yeah, but I'm also with Mike that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not necessarily the case that you shouldn't do stuff pro bono, you know, right? You don't have to get paid for everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean it depends on it obviously depends on the situation what it is that you're getting, you know  There are situations where doing something for free will get you a large audience and and oftentimes that trade-off is worth it  The question is how much do you know about the trade-off and and you know, what do other people get but also what is the actual value?  That you're getting back and the problem is when you when you don't have that information  So a site like this  I think that is giving you the information in terms of what other people getting paid and how valuable is it to do certain things?  I think that's really interesting if they find out like oh I did this and I didn't get as much money  But it led to all these other deals like hey, that's really valuable information  Yep, and so I like the information aspect of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As long as people are going into it willingly and I'd hate to live in a world where everybody says  Oh, I'm not gonna open the door for you lady. You got to give me a buck first, you know, I mean I  Yeah, there's a certain amount of stuff you just do for the karma points and that's fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When I when I wrote the book that got me on this show  Well, what Google do was Seth Godin sent me down and said listen schmuck write a book  But don't write the book to write the book write the book to get the gigs  Yeah, I wrote the book and and the rest is history Leo stuck with me for 20 everybody knows

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The last thing you should do is write the book to make money  It's not gonna right you write the book to get another book deal. Yeah, that's right  You write the book so you can get on the BBC and be a commentator. That's why you write the book  Hey speeches good news. You will be getting a check for two dollars and fifteen cents some  This is  At least four dollars Google plus there was a class-action lawsuit  Maybe you didn't remember this but after Google basically shut down Google plus in  2018 which was like a year or two later  It came out Wall Street Journal reported because we've heard Murdoch, you know  That Google plus had exposed the private data of hundreds of thousands of users for years  That Google knew about the problem and that the company opted not to disclose the data leak because of they were worried about regulatory  scrutiny  Google did acknowledge the data leak. They admitted that the private data of half a million accounts actually wasn't private  And since nobody's using Google plus we're just gonna shut the whole thing down  That's when the class-action lawsuits started the class-action lawsuit Matt Matic and Zack Harris versus Google filed October 2018  The case  Is that Google plus data litigation calm?  settled in June  2020 Google agreed to pay out seven and a half million dollars  lawyers, but half of that money went to legal and administrative fees and  About 1.7 million people now remember there only 500,000 accounts compromised  But anyway, 1.7 million people filled out the forms by the October deadline and those people  Do a little math  3.25 million divided by 1.7 20 million you get two dollars and 15 cents

Transcript:  Congratulations, you're a winner. I'll put that with my $3 AMD check that I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Got the other day I got it. Yeah, I get I don't even cash these checks. It's too much trouble to cash them  I got a bag of pop chips in the mail for the big pop chip  At least they sent me something I could use  It was it was an API thing  developers were able to access data from Google's people API even for  Profiles marked private. So if you were smart enough to be able to use the API you could scraped Google basically  Then there was another plug  Bug again with the people API that was for many more people in the case was expanded to cover those two and a half million  That's why they were so many winners.

Transcript:  Suppose I should give you  Jeff a couple of stories  Top German court says Facebook must inform users about deleting their posts or suspending their account  Explain why and allow them to respond?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Seems fair, you know the one hand they say get rid of all this junk on Facebook  Is your Facebook get rid of it all and now but be nice to those people who are pretty all the junk

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's you can't wear it. It's Germany. This is a Mike story. It's my way. I can't do a German

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Get rid of them but do it with the smile

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a glint story that was not written by me. But yeah, it's it's it's kind of crazy because you you know  You can understand the thinking behind it. You're saying oh, yeah, you know, you're you're shutting somebody's account down  You should tell them why but then you begin to think about most of the people whose accounts are being shut down  And do you really want to have to explain to every spammer?  Why it is that you're shutting down their account or every troll or every harasser?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why they got they got that trick so now we're gonna have to go trick

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So so much of it so much of it is is really  Teaching the trolls had a like walk right up to the line  Without crossing it because you have to explain to them each and every time and so it's it  You know, it's it's tricky like, you know  Because if you're on the receiving end of that and you legitimately don't think that you deserved it  Then it totally makes sense that you want that explanation you want that clear explanation and I've had accounts shut down for  Various reasons and we're like, you know, come on explain it to us, right?  I mean, that's what we had with with Google and and their ad words stuff and and  But at the same time you should have recognized like there are a lot of bad actors  And if you have to explain every little detail to the bad actors that only helps them or their you know  Companions be really really bad actors. And so it just becomes really really tricky very quickly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'll give you an example. I we have a mastodon instance. That's a kind of a federated Twitter  Don't show this screen John because I don't want to give out any personal information, but  Because we were getting spammed so much I made it necessary to apply  And every day I go in there and there's always in fact there is right now  Because one of the things we say is why do you want to join this and there's there's one guy says I listen to  Tweet I'm interested in mastodon. I want to see what the community is talking about. Yeah, I'll prove that and then the other guy  Says media  Yep  You see these and I know on our forums on the tweet community. Yeah, they say, you know, sometimes it's very interesting  Spammers are very honest. They say well, I would like to share news about my litigation practice with everybody in your I mean  It's interesting to see the variety and then half of them say I love Twitter and those people  absolutely rejected  Absolutely rejected. So let me just approve you Greg all the cases

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I get my my actions is out by DMS are open and generally that's fine  I get those people talk to me. I wouldn't know the less talk to but then there's always those accounts that say hi from  Gina six far seven. Yeah  Yeah  It's Twitter where they gotta go to the effort to kill. Oh, well, you're killed because you're Gina one six for well

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's they could do that. Right? I mean how hard is that for them to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's nobody to contact. It's BS. It's it's it's Germany  When there is when find another way to make life different when we ban people or when we don't approve people on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Twitter forums there is a field that says why but it's it's very generic like your spammer  Your schmuck, yeah, right your schmuck is a good one. I have to add that to the field  You don't have to give them in other words in for in too much information about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What then meanwhile Google is suing the German government?  Yeah, I don't understand this  I don't understand the next day gay. That's TG hate speech law  Which requires Google to dime users to the government? Oh  problem with all this is that is that  Bad speech would have would hit a couple tests on the platforms and the first test is community standards  The next test is what legal so if something just didn't pass community standards, you're gone boom done. The government's complain  Whoa, whoa, whoa that person did something illegal. We want we want to put them in jail  You must tell us even though you're not a lawyer. You're not a court you have you're not an agent of the police  Nonetheless, you will do it you think Germany of all people would get this idea people other people  Or them is not a good idea  You must do our police work for us and report those people to us  You know Stasi  But that's what they want. And so Google is now bless our heart suing the German government saying yeah, we don't wonder that  We don't be a police force

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And yet I can see why it might be easy  Bad PR for Google to say no because all the German government is asking for is look somebody posted hate speech  We want to know who that person is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But then then we turn around and then you know, there's gonna be a furor about about  Tech so let's say it's not Germany. Let's say it's China  Right when Yahoo did that in China and a man went to jail. That's a big  It's it's let the government do it they can they can put a subpoena in they could do lots of things  But this is not the role of a private company to play police, but that's what they're they're expecting them to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  I mean if the government spots something that they think violated the law let them go through the proper legal process get a subpoena get  You know and and be able to go to the company  Present the evidence let the company look it over and decide whether or not they think it's a lawful subpoena  And pass on the information in that way not not this sudden just just you know, you have to hand it over kind of thing

No  You remember this story in the British?  broadcasting about Amazon  destroying  unsold stock at one of its UK warehouses including smart TVs laptops drones and  Hairdryers. Well that story had a good effect  They have announced Amazon has announced that following the backlash over those  Products being destroyed and they you know, they're actually understand why as a business Amazon want to destroy them. These are products stocked  By Amazon for third parties that never sold third parties just you know bailed didn't want them back didn't want them  What's Amazon supposed to do?  But well now they have created a couple of programs  To to do something with those instead of just destroy them  Program one FBA grade and resell will allow third-party businesses on Amazon to resell returned items is used  That's one thing that will help and then there's going to be an FBA  Which is fulfillment by Amazon by the way, I should explain that fulfillment by Amazon liquidations program  Where you can get I guess I don't know somehow get money out of these bargains, yeah bargains bargains cheap deals

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the other thing Amazon did I was I was interested this week finally because I get a fair number of books from Amazon and  and and they shipped the first book in a  Fully paper thus recyclable nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unvelope I've been getting those two. I think a lot of my Amazon stuff's been coming in those recyclable pouches. I like that  Yeah, that's good  YouTube has banned Sky News for a week Australia Sky News Australia for a week over kovat misinformation Wow  You think is owned by Murdoch Sky News

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  UK is not anymore, but Sky News Australia is fully owned by Murdoch and it's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fox News on steroids. Yeah, they actually deny the kovat exists  Which will come as a surprise to the four and a half million people worldwide who have died from this non-existent disease  Oh, maybe they just were old and died. Anyway, that's probably what it is. Sure. Well, I wonder why did Rupert get a shot then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why does Tucker?  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They also they also deleted a bunch of those videos  I mean they suspended the account for a good but they they permanently deleted they wouldn't say exactly how many I think the Guardian tracked

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Down at least six videos that had been deleted and that was has always been Google's policy to do that. Yeah, they should that's yeah  It's fair whether they're a big boy or not  YouTube is also giving or creating a 100 million dollar  Shorts fund for people who were wearing shorts. No for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To to challenge short

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Videos stock  No to people who are smaller than five foot tall  No, this is this is for shorts YouTube shorts are those 30 I think you're 30 seconds  Actually now that tick tock is now three minutes other previously known as fleets fleets  That's a Twitter. No, that was Twitter fund that will reward creators for their most engaging and most viewed short form videos  Between 2021 and 2022 obviously trying to drive traffic to their shorts platform  Payouts may range from $100 to $10,000 based on viewership and engagement. This is ticktocks done the same thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is this is what matters not if all of the influencers are in on this stuff  Their engagement is going to be through the roof. Yeah, YouTube influencers. Absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely, you know, I almost think these companies really don't need to pay people  The reason YouTube is is because the shorts thing is a new program  So they're in fact, I remember Renee Richie saying yeah, I'm trying some shorts so that I can get in this shorts thing  Get it in the shorts from YouTube. That's that's the story  Right there actually at which I'm getting back to Amazon they've got a little conundrum  While companies like Google and Apple are saying you've got to have if you first of all  We're not gonna reopen right away now. Thanks to Delta and these hot spots  We're gonna slow down the reopening and when you come into the office, you'll have to be vaccinated  Vaccinated  Facebook's not doing that. They're saying you have to wear a mask  Amazon says we can't because there are so many vaccine deniers in our warehouse  So many kovat skeptics, they're afraid if they require employees to get vaccines or even the mask

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It wouldn't go over well 16 dollars an hour instead of 15  They lose a lot of employees if they do that. So I heard this same rationale  From the old folks home where my father lives  Well, why don't you require well, we'd be short-staffed  Yeah, that means is that it has to be leadership from on high it has to be governors and presidents  But it also should be a company like Amazon that says we'll pay what it needs to get the staff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're gonna have a safe workplace. Yeah, yeah, because I mean if the workers die, they're gonna have a shortage anyways

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And worse to their also their insurance is gonna cost is gonna go up people who were sick. I  Don't what I don't understand all of this is why I have not seen commercials from insurance companies saying would you would you obviously  Word of the day a schmuck. Would you schmucks get vaccinated?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Would you schmucks give Amazon your palm print?  Sure, would you do it for ten dollars? I do it for free. I'm a schmuck. Don't  Okay, I think it's widely agreed by security experts that your fingerprint your palm print any biometrics are problematic  Because you can't easily change them. I guess you could all right burn your hands with acid, but  This is the unlike giving out any other identification

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is hard to change and gave my eyeball to watch clear to get on the airplane. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so the Amazon uses these scanners  For something to call Amazon one. It's in their go stores. You could pay for goods by  You know waving your hand over a scanner  Amazon grocery Amazon book and four-star store stores are all over Seattle have them they're going to New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Texas, Texas  the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Another way for them to do this for those Amazon one stores

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And well, there's that so Apple does this with the with the with the fingerprint you could instead of storing the palm print  You could store a hash or some some one-way data trip that you could then  Match up with a palm print without actually storing it in the cloud. I don't know if Amazon is doing that though  Mm-hmm. I mean there are ways to preserve privacy and still collect this data

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean and I'm with mr. Mr. Jarvis on this people that fly with clear  You you definitely walk up to that retinal scan. Yeah, they got mine

Transcript:  Hmm. I definitely did last month without after because I had the same thing. It was global entry also that had expired  I guess I either I missed the notification or they didn't search and I didn't get a notification  huh, and but yeah, I had to take off my shoes and  Go through all of that like a savage  Yeah, it's definitely different in different airports because flying back was a very different experience than

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The way I apologize for saying like a savage. I've been informed that that  Disparages savages and I will not say that anymore. I will say like an animal. Is that okay?  Apparently the spirit is saying like a

Transcript:  Do you need Amazon echo in your smart soap dispenser Amazon think so  Here's a  $55 soap dispenser that needs Wi-Fi connection so that you can talk to it  According to Amazon you can the reason they put a speaker in the in there is so that you can automatically play songs jokes and more  While you wash

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually one of the dumbest ideas I've heard you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can and it's really dopey, but you can't ask your echo to play the song while you wash your hands  So you wash your hands for 20 seconds remember in the old days during kovat we had to wash our hands remember that  It's coming back baby  It's it is a variable rate dispenser that pumps out more soap the farther away from the nozzle you hold your hand that's pretty good  Is a little pricey compared to other soap dispensers, but I did actually  Turn our entire house into an airport washroom by putting automatic soap dispensers everywhere  And by the way, just like the airport they stop working after a while  We I bought them every bottom from here because I want it well  I don't want to have to go on something that's got kovat on it. I just want to go put my hand under it  And then wash my hands, but they don't they're not very reliable. I've had them all die on me over time  So I'm not gonna buy one with an Amazon echo in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, no  No, there's plenty we don't need government funding. It's goody two shoes thinking and I don't think it makes much sense myself  President biden scared the hell out of me  This is a tech dirt story once again  Uh, he look you see I subscribe to your rss feed  Very new how old fashioned of you cramps. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're the one

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really are there a few people

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We actually have a lot of people who read the rss feed

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like the rss feed and you know what I like about your rss feed you do full articles  You don't do those we do two sentence pieces there  Absolutely. So i'm gonna read this from my newsreader  Go for it. Joe biden  Speaking, uh, where was he speaking somewhere?  Uh  He's he's said something he said out loud the thing everybody's thinking  Which is these cyber attacks could lead to a shooting war  Yeah, biden, uh said on tuesday cyber threats including ransomware attacks are increasingly able to cause damage and disruption  In the real world. This is a speech at the office for the dni  Uh, so he's speaking to the intelligence agencies if we end up in a war a real shooting war with a major power  It's going to be as a consequence of a cyber breach  So those of us who have been saying well cyber warfare at least nobody dies or you know  It's not quite as bloody perhaps as a shooting war. Maybe not. Maybe it could  Uh, he did not mention russia  but  He did well immediately then mentioned that russia was spreading misinformation  Ahead of the 2022 midterms. It's a pure violation of our sovereignty. Mr. Putin  He said he said his name has a real problem  He's sitting on top of economy that has nuclear weapons and oil wells and nothing else nothing else  He knows he's in real trouble, which makes him even more dangerous boy. I think that's all very accurate  Yes, we agree disagree

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's I mean it's it's accurate but the question is was that was that a wise thing to say, you know  There there are these concerns obviously lots of concerns about cyber attacks and and you know other kinds of computer mischief  But you know saying directly that you may respond to cyber attacks with actual  You know weaponry attacks  Seems like an escalation and not necessarily an escalation that that that we should be making right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree, but he has been escalating the rhetoric all along hasn't he?  You know really calling putin out saying you got to do something about ransomware  And you know, we talked about this yesterday in security now  but the ransomware gang that brought down colonial pipeline which then disappeared we think perhaps because  either of the u.s or russian military or  Police agencies going after them seems to have reemerged  And their code is identical to their original code  And and maybe this is one of the things that precipitated but did anyone think that they weren't going to reappear

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, they disappeared but they're the people behind it were still out there and they still want to make money  I think the idea was always that they were just going to reappear with a different name  And so I don't think it's that surprising what they did the dark side ransomware gang has reemerged as black matter

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's ransomware by subscription  Uh, it's very similar. The code is almost it is identical. In fact to the dark side  uh code

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ransomware by subscription

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, that's the way it works these days you have affiliates. So as if you're this oh, I see it's it's ransomware r

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Our service aas, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah  So you're smart enough to create the ransomware  The best way to make money is not to inflict it on people but to make it available to script kiddies and others who want to  You know make a little money on the side. I was thinking it was the new business model for the wall street journal  It is a business model  For everybody i'm thinking about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you don't subscribe i'm gonna kill the internet  That  Buy this newspaper or we'll kill the internet

It's a pretty old version of android. I think that's like even older or doughnut  Uh, jeesh  Yeah time to get rid of it. It is a very small number of people but you know  They're out there and that's a big problem for google. So get ready because say goodbye to your gingerbread  Chrome os 92 is rolled out redesign emoji an emoji picker e sim support  Uh pre-installed meet pwa progressive  web apps  Google meet pwa means you can use google meet as a progressive web app, which means weirdly  You could you could put it in your menu or your title bar put an icon on your desktop in it  Even though it still has to basically have a browser. It's like a standalone app chat will also be  uh  A pwa and both will be pre-installed as a launcher icon on chrome os  E sim is for cellulars phones, obviously  um  There's some other stuff  You know if you're a chrome, uh, but user you're just gonna get it  Automagically you don't have it, you know, it just happens  google chrome  Will also change how it shows insecure websites. They won't  Uh, it'll it'll only well, it won't show you whether the site is secure anymore  it'll only show you if it's insecure because  Google's pushing hard for https everywhere and basically this is their way of saying it is everywhere  And in the few cases where it's not we're going to put a little black  mark a little black, uh lock  It's going to be confusing to people because until now the lock meant it was secure  Yeah, that's that's a little so now it's gone. And if you see the lock it means it's insecure  I am confused  Well, wait a minute. No, it's not http

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which one is it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. What is it chrome will not only will only display security indicators when the site is not secure as shown below  So the re the problem I have with that is I always click on the lock to see  The certificate, you know you click on the lock and you get this information and you can then look at the certificate and so forth  Um, I guess they'll have to have another way to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They'll figure it out at some point and let us know so security

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh what yeah moving along moving right along what do you got some waffle to get to or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Chrome some of these i'm seeing for the first time that's why it's a little slower chrome for android is becoming a two-factor security key  For google account sign in  And actually I love this single sign-on thing where it says are you trying to sign in and you say yes  And it does that  Uh used to be you'd have to have an app the google app on your phone now  You can do it if you've got chrome of on your android device  Which is fine because you probably do  So you don't have to install anything additional just it'll just do it with chrome  This is another new feature in chrome for android youtube's premium light subscription  Is now going to give you the chance to have ad free viewing but for less it's being piloted in europe  That's why the price  As you see it is six point nine nine euros a month  uh, I think it'll be ten bucks a month in the  Us which is less than the premium plan. I'm not sure what the us price will be  Um six it's about 60 the price of a premium subscription  But you only get about a quarter of the benefits says the verge  This is an experiment only available  In the nordics and benelux except for iceland  Sorry iceland  Premium light as is  We were talking about this last week, right?  That the reason we have google music or youtube music is because we don't want to pay for  We don't want to see ads on youtube and it just comes along for the ride  So maybe this will be this will be the youtube music free version of google  premium  And finally, uh the august security patch. Oh, I should check is rolling out to google pixel  The otas are live  That's good. You always want to do that  Uh three security fixes and one functional update to address accidental assistant  triggering  No one wants that  and that's  the google change  Uh, I think even cut short the theme there.
