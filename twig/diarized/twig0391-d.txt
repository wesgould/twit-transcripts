We're going to get to the end of this show.  And we're going to get to the end of this show.  And that's because the Internet of Things, the queen of the Internet of Things is here.  Stacey Higginbotham of Stacey on IoT and IoTpodcast.com.  And she and I are going to talk about our connected ovens.  We're not kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're not kidding. My oven's on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I learned some things about the June Oven and we'll talk about that in a second.  Also here, Jeff Jarvis.  He's the king of all media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, at least he's a friend of the king of all media.  No, I wouldn't. Yeah, I wouldn't claim that title ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Best buddies to the king of all media.  Blogger at BuzzMachine.com.  Longtime caller.  He's also a professor of journalism at the City University of New York,  at the Tao Night School of Journalism.  And we join together every week not just to talk about Google, despite the name.  That's just a convenient hook on which to hang the hat of all things having to do with Internet, social media, journalism, the new world.  The new world.  What's the matter, Jeff?  We don't like the new world too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want the old world back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, the only thing constant is change, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Come on, it'll it'll just I was fine with I was fine with that.  The change went on a detour for the first time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was liking the change in my life.  I now understand the phrase.  I'm just glad I won't live long enough to see that.  I never understood that.  And now I get it.  But I've lived long enough to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because we did.  Hey, hey, hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So why don't we start with the June Oven?  Because there's a little heat going on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We should mention that June is a sponsor of one of Stacey's shows, just as a disclaimer.  But you talked you talked me into buying this long before they were a sponsor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  And I bought my own too.  Yeah.  And I paid actual money.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and that's the by the way, the other side of this a lot of actual money.  It's a fifteen hundred dollar toaster oven.  OK, before you get upset, that's a ridiculous amount of money.  And I wasn't going to do it.  I actually put down a hundred dollar deposit and they wrote me about a month ago saying, OK, your oven's ready.  I said, I'm not. But then I realized I'm already in for a hundred dollars.  And you get a you know, you can return it after whatever a month or something.  So I thought, well, I'll give it a try.  But I said Stacey, I saved the box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, good. No, I still have the box, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I know. Well, I don't normally save the box.  But this time I saved all the packing material and I was glad.  So the first thing I cooked in it was a steak.  I got to tell you, this oven is wild.  If you look at the front of it, it looks like it has an Android phone in the front of it.  And it pairs to your iPhone and you watch while your food cooks, but not just watch like what temperature it is.  You can watch what how hot it is inside the food, how hot it is inside the oven.  You can watch video, live video of your food being cooked.  And I had the weirdest experience yesterday.  I put a piece of bread in there to make toast because I want to see, well, does it toast?  And it reckoned. Wait a minute.  No, I recognize this. That's either bread or a strudel.  Yes, I can explain why.  How would you? So then I tapped the bread and said light, medium, dark, dark.  You know, and I said that the thing it's got ceramic elements, so they get bright red immediately.  And it toasted at the same time as my Breville toaster oven, which is what I compare it with about five minutes.  But it tells you it's going to be five minutes.  It tells you exactly how long the toast.  I've never had such even toast, by the way, perfectly browned on both sides.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So literally my husband and I have been talking about this.  I'm like, did you notice anything about the toast in the oven?  He's like, it's toast to your toast.  And I was like, yes.  It felt silly.  Like we were justifying the cost of the oven.  There's no justice. I'm going to say this right in front.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is zero justification for the cost.  It's way too expensive.  I'm embarrassed that I bought something that expensive.  How much does your other oven, your Reven oven cost?  Revel is a couple hundred bucks.  And it's the rebel is a fantastic convection.  It does. It does every actually does everything.  The June does is a smaller.  One of the things that's surprising is how big the June is.  It's taller.  You need a lot.  You should get the measurements before you buy it to make sure you can fit it under your counter  because it needs a few inches all round because it's an oven.  It also feels like it looks like it's made out of space age materials, like not like the inside is some sort of weird plastic.  It's it's fancy.  It's got carbon fiber heating elements.  Yes, this is it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it was the back that it was showing.  I was confused for a moment there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so so so I cooked a steak and it didn't come out great.  But I'm used to cooking my steak and my big green egg and it's smoky and delicious and it's got it.  It's better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, yeah, it's not going to taste smokey.  Don't recommend it for the steak.  We did a filets.  It was good for that.  You have a thermometer so you could put it right in the meat and it and it'll tell you if it needs if you if it recognizes the food will actually be there.  If it recognizes the food, it'll actually tell you to put the thermometer in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, which is nice.  And in many cases, it does recognize the food.  Sometimes, though, you have to pick the food from.  So when you when you when you get next to the oven, the display lights up.  It almost says hello.  It's a size of a small Android device.  And I'll say why I keep saying Android in a second.  And then it and then it has a scale in the feet.  You mentioned this, which is kind of cool.  So it knows whatever, you know, how much steak you put in.  And if it can identify it through the camera, it will actually say, oh, I see toast or a piece of bread or I see a strudel.  Why is it the same strudel and bread?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's what it is.  Actually, when you put salmon in it also says salmon or strudel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It did not. I must have the update because that's the other thing.  It updates all the time, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  It's connected to your Wi-Fi.  It's doing a probability.  It's it's machine learning.  So it's it's doing a probability that this is most likely.  It knew I put in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It knew it was also learned.  It didn't give you a choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it didn't give me a choice.  Learned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, it's getting better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, so Stacey, does the data go back up to the cloud?  A thousand people said, no, that's not strudel.  They put a salmon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  And they're planning an update.  I don't think it's up there yet.  I haven't been given this option.  Maybe it's on the phone to ask, how did you like that cooked so they can learn about like how things like is their preset rate.  Is their preset recipe the right one or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because the steak, for instance, was underdone.  I had to put it back in.  I said medium rare.  It came out rare.  Could be because of poor probe placement, which has always been a problem of mine.  So you've got to get that temperature probe, you know, where the coldest part of the steak would be.  Maybe I maybe I missed and I pushed it too far and thought it was more cooked than it was.  This is sounding uncomfortable.  Go ahead.  OK, so the next day I'm going to cook salmon because I want before the show I wanted to cook, you know, steak, salmon, chicken breasts and toast before the show.  So I could talk to you, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Excellent. I've been wondering about it.  I didn't bake cookies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't bake cookies yet because I am not going to bake cookies.  But maybe maybe we will for the kid.  So I'm ready.  I got the salmon.  Open it up like walk up to the oven.  It's in a boot loop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That has never happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not a good thing for your toaster oven to be in a boot loop.  So the June logo comes up and then briefly it flashes the screen and then it crashes.  So I go, oh crap.  Well, and Lisa said, you better turn on the oven, the regular oven.  We want to have dinner someday and our oven is crashed.  So I go onto the June site and they have they don't have a phone number, but they have a chat interface.  And it does say, we're not here all the time.  So, you know, but but fortunately, what was her name?  Trisha or somebody? June?  Not June. Should have been June.  But but Trisha says, oh, yes, hi.  Oh, good.  And I said, my oven's in a boot loop.  She said, describe that.  And I described it.  She said, all right, we're going to reset the oven.  This is a good thing for you to know, Stacey.  You unplug the oven, which I had done already.  Plug it in, holding, pushing in the button.  You have this big knob in the front.  Push it in and plug it in and hold it.  And you know what comes up?  The Android boot loader.  Android.  It's Android.  It's the Android.  Yeah.  Which is ironic because they only have iOS software.  No, they have an Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have.  OK, they didn't have it.  Oh, wait. Oh, I could be lying.  They're doing they're working on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't have it yet.  OK, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's Android.  And then you have the same things you have in an Android recovery screen where you can delete the cache, delete the data reset, just like Android.  So and she says, just do a complete reset.  So I did a complete reset.  And just like Android, you have to do down, down, down, down, down and then do it to confirm it.  It refreshed it.  It did not need to do the update.  So it didn't.  And I told her that she said, oh, that's interesting.  Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Huh?  Someone in the chat room asked if it's running an Intel Atom.  It's actually the Nvidia K1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's why it's Android.  Should that make sense?  That's what's in my shield.  It's Nvidia Tegra K1 processor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's in my shield.  That's actually a very good processor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looks like an older version of Android.  It does not look like Nougat.  It looks like more like KitKat.  It looks like a fairly old, but it doesn't matter.  That's not a big deal.  It doesn't matter.  It's custom.  More stable.  Yeah, it's not running Android really.  It's just, you know, it's running on the application.  When your oven rings, answer it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  So then the next thing is it says, join the Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I got on the Wi-Fi, connected the phone.  I've had a little trouble connecting with the phone, but the beauty part is then it's fine.  I put the salmon steaks in.  It says, oh, salmon.  How would you like that to be?  It says, oh, salmon.  How would you like that cooked?  Firm or loose or whatever?  Two choices.  Moist or firm?  Something like that.  Dry or...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's like flaky or moist.  Yeah, it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of them is unpalatable, but that's the one I chose because I didn't want firm.  So, you know, do you want dry or moist?  So I chose moist and it was, again, a little undercooked.  We put it back in for a few minutes.  I mean, you could use it in a regular oven.  You set the temperature and everything like that.  Chicken, same thing with a little undercooked.  So it's a little bit undercooked.  Actually, the salmon was fine.  That's dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  So here's where I think everything is perfectly cooked.  So I have a probe placement problem, I'm thinking.  Well, no, I'm wondering if maybe you just like your food more done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I don't eat chicken where it's pink.  I don't eat steak where it's cold in the middle.  I mean...  Oh, well, no, that's true.  It was not doing it the way it's supposed to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Because I've cooked, like, I mean, I cooked...  Let's see.  I've cooked five fillets in there and they came out...  We did them for rare.  No, we did the medium rare.  Yeah.  And that was for me.  And then we kept my husbands in longer.  And they were pink.  They were still pink in the middle.  I want it to be pink for medium.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But, you know, medium rare.  But I don't want it to be cold in the middle, which it was.  It was rare.  It was blood rare.  It was blue.  So...  Jam that sucker in there.  Yeah.  Because anyway, I'll play with this.  But I'm very impressed.  The chicken browned beautifully.  Because what it does is it all...  It will bake it and then it'll turn on the broiler.  It does this all automatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  It crisps...  It, like, does something to crisp the skin at a higher temperature and then...  And you can watch the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, you can even...  I could show you on my phone because I have the app.  I could show you videos of my bread toasting.  Because it has a picture.  It's just wild.  I can show you, you know...  And then...  And you can see it took...  It started at 4.30 p.m.  Ended at 4.41 p.m.  It shows you the temperature chart.  It's the geek.  It really is the geek's, you know, thing.  Here's the chicken breast cooking.  And so you have a video.  And it cooked quite well.  It's really weird.  I have to clean the camera, obviously.  Anyway, despite the cost is the...  If it were half as much, I would tell everybody,  this is just forget any other toaster oven.  This is the one you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  Stacey, you scolded him last time.  I said it's not a toaster oven.  It's an oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So...  Well, it makes toast.  It does make toast.  So I would look at it as a...  If you don't have two ovens.  So I have two ovens in my house.  And they're two full-sized ovens.  And they were $1,500 each.  That's true.  You're right.  Okay.  So if I only had one of those, I would buy this in a heartbeat.  Instead of the second oven.  That's what I had really good one.  Instead of the second oven.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's big.  It's bigger than my Breville toaster oven.  I could put a small whole chicken in there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I've done up to a six pound chicken in there,  which is good for feeding my family.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's good for that because it knows how much it weighs.  It knows what the temperature, internal temperature is.  It can look at it.  I mean, it really is...  I agree with you.  This is a fascinating use of this IoT technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's like, you know how we talk about our smart homes  being like anticipating our needs and all that.  This oven doesn't anticipate your needs,  but it provides that level of set it and forget it.  Like I don't have to think about it.  I literally shove a tray of food in there.  Yeah.  And it's like, oh, I got this.  And then I'm like, sweet.  Yeah.  I would like to try some baking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it'd be interesting to do some baking in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will say that during the review, and I don't bake a lot,  so we baked some loaf of like banana bread or something.  The top got done and the middle still wasn't done,  but it was also, it wasn't a preset.  So I'm trying to remember.  So you were just doing a recipe.  Yeah, I was just doing a recipe.  And again, I don't bake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can't really blame it because I want the presets to work perfectly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, and they should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think that's what's interesting is that they will, right?  Or at least they're getting feedback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, they switched their cookie recipe.  I think I told you guys this.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So.  I'm going to try some other, some vegetables.  I like to, I love to bake root vegetables like cauliflower.  So I'm going to try some of those things.  But I have to say, it's kind of amazing actually.  It's kind of interesting.  I just, it is awfully expensive.  And I guess we're kind of subsidizing the initial outlay.  Yes.  By the way, the service, the support was very good.  And she said, we're going to have the engineers contact you  because I'd like to get more information on what happened with the crash and the pairing.  So that was good.  She was pretty knowledgeable.  She said, well, try rebooting your router.  It was good.  She knew what she was talking about.  So there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder, I wonder if they do their own support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry, go ahead.  I felt like that was actually somebody who was hanging around the office late at night.  They're in San Francisco, so it wasn't that late.  That's 7 p.m.  Go ahead, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I want to talk about a different gadget.  Yes.  That's not a little...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you want?  Should I?  Yes.  This will be the gadget segment.  I'm having fun.  I don't mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's talking about Trump.  What's that?  Okay.  You remember, what was it, two weeks ago now?  You had AFib.  I had AFib.  So this got recommended to me.  And this happens to be the company that Vic Condotra is now the CEO of.  Oh, I saw your exchange with Vic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  And so it is very, very cool because all you have to do is put your fingers on these metal pads  and it talks to your phone and you get a good AKG.  In fact, I will email one to mine to Karsten right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's kind of amazing.  And you send...  It's really good.  You need your doctor to be in on this, right?  Because you want to send the...  I presume you want to send the graph.  Well, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So here's the way it works.  So Karsten, I'm sending you my AKG right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is AliveCore is the company that does this.  AliveCore.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  AliveCore.  And the first time you sign up, yes, they have to have a clinician.  It takes up to 24 hours.  A clinician does look at your AKG.  Oh, it doesn't have to be your doctor.  I guess to make sure.  Okay.  No, but I guess to make sure you're not dying.  Yeah.  And then you can look at your own after that, and you can send it to your doctor if your  doctor actually gives you an email address, but that's rare.  You can sign up with your doctor.  You can pay to get analysis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh.  So if you're worried, you could say, hey, and you send it to them and they say...  That's my ticker right there.  Oh, Jesus.  You better get to the hospital right now.  I know.  That looks nice and regular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's good.  Yeah.  No, you were boring me with the oven talk.  See how calm it is?  Yeah.  Excellent.  So that is normal sinus rhythm, and it will analyze it and say you're normal.  That is super cool.  It really, really, really isn't so small.  There's a thing you can get so you can stick it on the back of your phone so you can check  that way, but I don't want to become completely...  My wife got nervous.  I would get completely neurotic because I used to be always like this with my hand on  my neck checking my pulse, but that's not fully informational.  And then when I went into AFib, I looked for apps on Android, and there are apps that  use the camera and the light.  You put your finger on the camera.  But it's very unreliable, A, and B, really hot.  It burns your finger.  And not nearly as good, whereas this really does give you a decent EKG.  This is only 80 bucks.  I can't believe it.  It's really quite amazing.  It's so tiny.  You can put it on the back of your phone.  You're coming out with a watch that'll have it on the watch.  You put your finger on the watch.  I would have thought the watch just...  It's actually a band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, because it works on an Apple watch.  So it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They used to have a case that did this, an iPhone case that did this.  Oh, really?  A live core.  Yeah.  They also have...  I don't know if this is still here.  Let's see.  There's a database.  You could actually send in your data to this database.  And I'm trying to see if it's still there at the USC Center for Body Computing.  They were trying to get enough data so they could understand what's a normal heartbeat,  what does it look like?  Because one of the challenges of having all this is now that we can see everything, we  don't know what's normal or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and also that's kind of what...  One of the things Apple's pushing is Apple using iPhones for research.  Yes.  Sign up for a bunch of these research projects.  Research kit.  Because the nervous...  Yeah, research kit.  The nervousness of this is...  And this is why Vic's company, AliveCore, is so unusual.  They got FDA approval.  Yes.  A lot of companies really are kind of...  That's difficult.  It's expensive and difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm trying to see...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can imagine all kinds of things where the signals will be good.  I'm talking to Vic in a week or so and I'll report on that, but maybe we should have Vic  on in fact.  Which would be fun.  But my mother's a type 1 diabetic and there are signals when she's going to an insulin  reaction, like clammy skin and other things.  You can imagine many signals.  You can imagine the case where maybe it would be predictive of my AFib if it knew enough  signals of what was coming up, or an insulin reaction, or an epileptic seizure, or God  knows what.  With all the signals you could have...  Jake was teaching summer camp at ID Tech Camp a couple years ago and there was a kid there  who had Tourette's and he wanted to do an app that checked his Tourette's ticks and  moments because it would predictably get worse or not.  The opportunities here are huge.  But anyway, so thanks to Vic.  I paid for it, let me be clear.  But thanks to Vic and his company for starting this.  I just ordered one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think this would be...  I didn't realize this, AFib is not a sign of a heart attack, it's a sign of a potential  stroke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the risk.  Well, no.  Here's how it works.  No, it could lead to a stroke.  AFib is an irregular heartbeat.  You lose sinus rhythm.  It can go into tachycardia, which is a very rapid irregular heartbeat.  And if it goes on for long enough, because the heart is so inefficient, it pulls the  blood collectively in the heart and becomes clots.  When it goes back in, when it kicks back into full rhythm, that's when the problem is.  So what happens is...  It shoots the clots in your brain and you are sorry.  Or your lung or whatever.  What's so critical, I know this is lovely, talk to Jeff.  Want to hear about my prostate?  So what's so important about this is when I went in that Sunday night, I was supposed  to go to Tokyo, you have 24 hours.  If they believe you that you really haven't been in for a long time, you really started  24 hours, then they can clear, shock you back.  But if you go past 24 hours, this happened to me once, because the damn doctor at the  time didn't do it.  I had to go through a 30 day regimen of blood thinning before they would shock me to be  sure that I had no clots.  All the time I was in tachycardia and I had to travel to London, I was miserable.  So now if I were...  I haven't had AFib for 10 years until I got it two weeks ago.  But if you were worried about this, you could check yourself every day and then know within  24 hours you were regular and it was fine.  And you can know for certain...  I went to the hospital once and I didn't have AFib, I thought I might have, so it's a waste  of time and resource.  So this kind of stuff is just amazing.  What a tiny little inexpensive thing.  So cheers to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dr. Mom, if I have some...  If I'm worried, can I send you my ACOR for reading?  I can send it to Dr. Mom in our chat room and she can tell me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How does Dr. Mom like my AKG?  Does it look alright?  Okay, Dr. Mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, to me, as a complete layman, it looks excellent, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The rhythm was beautiful.  Oh, Dr. Mom said I explained well.  Thank you, Dr. Mom.  I appreciate that.  I find this amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And especially at $79.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you do it?  But it's active, it's not continual.  It's not like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't feel good.  Let me try this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I kind of wouldn't want to because you'd really become neurotic.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so I used to have a problem where I would faint if my heartbeat got too fast.  So I think it was more my blood pressure would be too low.  So they stuck me on a Holter monitor and that thing was annoying.  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I'm like, oh, I would love to have...  Yeah, that is interesting, Stacey.  The fingers, the pulse in the fingers is what makes this work.  But I wonder if they could do it otherwise or make you do it once an hour or something  like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, because right as I'm about to hit the floor, slow down clutching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dr. Mom says it looks like you're alive.  Thank you, Dr. Mom.  Yes.  How much do I owe you for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Our best analysis.  She already asked me who my insurance carrier was.  So obviously she's a real doctor.  Anyway, I ordered one, Jeff.  I think that's probably a good thing for me to have around at my age, at my weight.  And I go to the gym every day and I probably should bring it to the gym with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting too, because you get your pulse rate.  You can record it.  You can see what's what.  Yeah.  And then Stacey, did you ever find the database?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I found the website for the USC Center for Body Computing.  And that is that is where I stopped looking because I wanted to pay attention to you.  I felt bad like surfing the Internet while we were talking.  But if I find it's also related to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's Dr. Leslie Saxon.  Oh, sorry, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Leslie Saxon.  We don't want you to faint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not going to faint.  I'm good now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She grew out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I know.  I think this is I mean, we talk a lot about kind of how everything is going to change.  But this is a palpable, useful and affordable.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Solution.  Good for Vic for doing this.  AliveCore.  What a different thing from Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Huh?  That's what a different thing.  Oh, different.  Yeah, very different technology.  So this is I don't want to go into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Speaking of AFib, Google+, is still alive.  Oh, that was cruel.  They have applied the paddles to it a few times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Clear.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Poor Vic.  I was just going to say one more thing.  So this this also ties, I don't want to get in prematurely, but to your new advertiser,  because the kind of data that you can tie to genetics and things like that, it really  is going to make the analysis of of ailments and genetics just so much better.  So imagine if all of us who use this send in our heart rhythm to that certain new sponsor.  You know what this would be good for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's that Valentine's Day gift?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here, honey.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Stacey, Stacey, when you get to be our age.  Flowers or that's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  An AFib detector.  I'm like, I've got to whack up Valentine's Day.  It's not very romantic, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is for your heart, honey.  Your actual heart.  Your actual heart.  I was going to say, so do you actually do you want to use Jeff's awesome segue?  Because you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, go ahead.  And then I'll use Jeff's awesome segue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK.  The there is.  So we were talking about data, medical data.  Now the only caveat I would throw on that is we don't medical data to your doctor is  protected by HIPAA, but it's unclear what can be done with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, so the doctor had your EKG.  He couldn't send it through the public email to you.  I don't think HIPAA prevents you from sharing your data in any way you want, including with  your doctor.  In other words, you don't have any burden of privacy because it's your data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  So here's where this is where it gets interesting, because if my Internet was working, there's  a story in The New Scientist on.  Dun dun dun.  Oh, my gosh.  Why is my Internet so slow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I realize we need one of these for the Internet.  Yeah, give it a jolt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is about an insurance company that is analyzing your voice when you call into their  health.  So yeah, that's not it's US startup Canary Speech is developing deep learning algorithms  to detect if people have neurological conditions like Parkinson's or Alzheimer's just by listening  to the sound of their voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's using phone calls to a health insurer to train.  Now this is just to train their algorithm.  Canary will not say who it is.  It's a large American health care and insurance provider.  But if you think about using something like that without any data protections, plus, you  know, your EKG data going in, all of a sudden you've really got your insurance company has  possibly more information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Especially as we lose prior condition coverage, it becomes terribly damaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm just throwing that out there as we're in this like, hey, that's actually a reason  I haven't done a lot of like the genetic testing and stuff like that, because I'm really unsure  about the protections available for my data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  And well, I was talking before the show about there's a big genome project going on.  I think a professor at Harvard, we talked to him on one of our shows years ago on Futures  and Biotech.  And the idea was they were going to gather, it's called the Personal Genome Project.  I actually applied to be in this in order to participate.  Because Leo is that public.  Well, that's the thing.  You have to be a very public person because the idea is they want to collect full genotypes  for as many people as they can, combined with your phenotype, your medical history, and  then give it to researchers.  They said, since we know we ultimately would not be able to protect your privacy to participate  in this, you have to acknowledge, we're just going to attach your name to it.  And I was going to do it.  In fact, I did apply to do it.  They never accepted me.  But a number of people in the chat room pointed out, you know, it's not just your information  you're handing over here.  Your children could be tainted by the information that's publicly available about you.  If you have a genetic flaw that's commonly passed down to children, you're in effect  revealing something about them.  And I hadn't really thought about that at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I said this to Esther Dyson, who did get in.  Yes.  And I said, well, Astros was talking to the theory of it.  But yeah, I guess if I reveal my prostate cancer reveals to my son and she said, go get over  yourself, Jeff, everybody gets it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's true. If you live long enough, every man, almost every man will get it.  But but but it is a legitimate point.  I still would probably do it.  But I would ask my kids permission first.  I think this is I mean, Esther did something and that is a real gift to humanity, which  is basically give up her personal privacy to further genetic research.  I think that's really and I would I would be glad to I should I should offer again.  You still have you have to pay for the it was like fairly expensive.  You have to pay for your testing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Imagine the price is coming down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Jean, you can do a whole genome for less than a thousand dollars.  Thanks, Illumina. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So it was fifteen hundred dollars, I think, when I enrolled or attempted to enroll.  I'm going to do it again, because I think this would be.  Couldn't you just do it on your own?  Oh, yeah, I can go to who is it?  Gina, whoever.  Who what? Who is it?  You said that's doing a thousand dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm making sure it's Illumina.  Illumina.  There's a security firm and the genetic testing firm that did it for under a thousand dollars,  so I can't remember which one is which.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, yeah, interesting.  Why is really an interesting world we're living in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Illumina, Illumina, Illumina, Illumina.  Oh, that probably makes more sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No one knows. No one knows.

Transcript:  New Android Wear watches are here finally, and we're seeing reviews.  Not so positive, frankly.  I'm sorry to say I was really looking.  Well, some positive, some not.  I'm really looking forward to getting these new Android Wear watches.  Google Super Bowl ad apparently affected some people with Google Homes in the same vicinity.  We'll talk about that.  And YouTube has expanded mobile live streaming to a lot of people.  All coming up, Stacey Higginbotham is here.  Stacey on iot.com.  Giga Stacey on Twitter.  Jeff Jarvis, her biggest fan, number one fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Buzzmachine.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I do want to mention our new sponsor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think this would be a good Valentine's Day gift.  It's 23andMe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've done this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You did it, Jeff, right?  I did it a long time ago.  My report is still there.  It's still there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm still there.  I did it a long time ago.  Long time ago.  My report is still there.  That's like six years old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was this Susan Wojcicki?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  Pardon me for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Davos.  Susan Wojcicki, who is of the famed Wojcicki family.  Of course, mom Esther Wojcicki famously leased her garage to a couple of young grad students  named Sergey Brin and Larry Page.  And as a result, both she and daughter had, I think, some role in the founding of Google.  So Susan created 23andMe.  And it is an inexpensive way to find out some of your, it's a personalized genetic service  based on the 23, that's where the pairs of chromosomes, that's where the 23 comes from,  found in your DNA.  And I've done this and Jeff has done it.  You know, I was just going through my report before the, because I did this month, years  ago and I just was going through my report because I haven't looked at it in a while.  And there's some cool stuff.  They've added new stuff.  For instance, I found an ancestor.  By the way, I don't have a lot of Neanderthal in me.  I have 265 Neanderthal variants.  I have 266.  Beachhaw!  Oh crap.  I am, I have less Neanderthal than 68% of 23andMe customers.  My Neanderthal ancestry accounts for less than 4% of my overall DNA.  However, I'm in fifth place out of family and friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just think this is so cool.  And one of the things I discovered is a second cousin whose last name is the same as my grandmother's  maiden name.  That is wild based on his 23andMe chromosomes and mine.  You also get a wellness report, traits.  I found out that my hair is likely to be brown, my eyes likely to be brown.  Actually, you know what the most interesting one is the ancestry report.  If you've ever wondered where your ancestors came from, here's my ancestry report.  Mostly European.  In fact, all European, but this is by generation.  So the first three generations, British and Irish, then go back three through five French  and German.  And then if you go back five or generations or more, I have Scandinavian, Italian, Ashkenazi,  and Iberian.  I think this is so cool to find this stuff out based.  Now all I had to do was very simple as a cheek, saliva rather, it's not cheek swab.  I just spit into a little tumbler and then you send it back to 23andMe.  You can see how your DNA breaks out across 31 populations worldwide.  Found out where your ancestors lived more than 500 years ago.  In fact, you go further back over thousands of years, trace parts of your ancestry to  maternal and paternal haplogroups.  You can find out how much Neanderthal DNA is in you.  You can even connect with other people who share DNA with you.  23andMe has a very big database now, more than a million genotyped customers worldwide.  So that's why when I went back to my ancestry report, I was able to find people I hadn't  met before and you can contact them, which is pretty awesome.  Here's a second cousin, third and fourth cousins and on and on and on.  Here's Anthony who shares my grandmother's maiden name.  So I know that they kind of nailed it on this one.  I can look at what genes we share in common.  It's really cool stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I was saying earlier that before we were on that I don't really know what my last name  would be if my great grandfather had married my great grandmother.  If you know what I mean?  Yeah, but you find out kind of where they're from.  I think it might be Riley.  I think it might be Riley.  Well, look for some Irish in there.  Yeah, well, I look for that day.  Well, yeah, I look for that day when 23andMe gives me a relative named Riley, which would  be cool.  And also, I thought I had a lot of German in me just because that was the family lore.  But it turns out I'm 63% British and Irish, only 7.4% German.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you and I have a lot in common as well as very, very white skin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I am very likely to be pale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm 66% likely to have lighter skin.  So this is actually they're going to do a $20 off for Valentine's Day.  See, I think this would be you could do it for you and a loved one.  It would be so cool.  Spit honey, spit.  I think it is kind of romantic to find out this kind of stuff.  And actually I was talking to one of our employees who's engaged to get married.  She said, you better believe I'm going to get my future husband to do this.  It's kind of romantic.  23andMe.com.  $20 off when you buy before Valentine's Day, a little less than a week.  23andMe.  I have to say I did this a while ago and I always thought it was super cool.  And what's interesting is as more people join the database, you get more and more information,  which is very neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it would be cool to do it with your two kids and see what the differences are.  I'd like to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's also, and I think this is new, you can get the database of the entire, you can get your entire data,  the raw data that you can download and do further analysis on.  And I think as time goes by, this is going to be more and more useful, right?  As we learn more and more about what these various genotypes mean, what these markers mean.  You can actually search for specific genes and markers of interest.  You can view or download your data at any time it's raw, uninterpreted format, your A's, your T's, your G's and your C's.  All right.  Here's your science test.  Everybody remember what ATG and C stand for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Adenine, cytosine, guanine, something.  Very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the T?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You did well.  That's really good.  Stacey, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wanted to be a genetic engineer.  Very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm impressed.  Thymine?  Thymine.  Is it thymine?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Our timing.  There we go.  I couldn't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am so impressed.  Very good.  No, we did electrophoresis in high school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we were doing those CSI type.  What matches with this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are the four proteins that combine in your DNA?  That's all it takes.  Yes.  Just four.  Thank you 23andMe.  23andMe.com.  $20 off when you buy before Valentine's Day.  A little less than a week.  I'm glad to have you as a sponsor.  I've been a customer for a long, long time.  Android Wear 2.0.  We knew it would come out this week.  It is official.  And as a result, we're seeing a lot of reviews of the first Android Wear 2.0 watch, the LG  watch, sport and style.  Both have P.O.  LED displays, four gigs of storage, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.  There are two different specs, though.  There's the sport has a built in gyroscope, accelerometer, barometer and GPS.  And it's also bigger, 1.3.  Lots of antennas, too.  Tons of antennas.  LTE and NFC.  And this is the one I want to get because you can use it with Android Pay, kind of like  an Apple watch, right?  Also, it's got more RAM and a much bigger battery.  So the sport is the one probably most of you want to look at, except if you've got small  wrists because it's a lot bigger.  1.38 inch screen compared to the styles 1.2 inch screen.  Styles also lighter, has about half the battery.  Three color options, two titanium, rose gold and silver.  Straps are leather, but no LTE, no GPS, no NFC, no Android Pay.  Cost difference?  The Wear style is the cheaper one at $249.  100 bucks more for the Wear sport.  You can get it from Google or at AT&T or Verizon.  In fact, let me run, not walk.  I didn't see it.  I just checked the Google store and I didn't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Huh?  Sagan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, the 10th.  Oh crap.  Well, I guess I'll be getting up early on the 10th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's a good Valentine's Day present.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I, yeah, maybe.  Do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do.  I mean, watches are like.  You would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I would.  Well, if your husband or wife is a runner, actually, you know what?  Yeah.  Maybe.  Lisa and I have.  Wait till next week.  Apple watches.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait till next week.  Because Kevin will buy one super fast and he'll tell me because he's an actual runner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's a runner.  It does have Google Assistant in it, by the way, which is a big deal because you could  only get it on the pixel before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, I have a really random question I have to ask you guys.  Yeah.  Y'all are super blurry.  Everything on my on the camera is super blurry.  Is it super blurry for anyone else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Check your heart.  Stacey, check your heart.  Quick.  Don't you get her in one of those alive course.  You don't write.  You might want to lie down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacey, put both hands over your head.  Smile.  No.  Yeah, if we're blurry, it's probably something we've been having a little trouble today with  Skype.  You look great and sound great.  You're looking good.  So it is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good.  But great.  I wasn't fishing, guys.  That's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Put both hands over your head.  Hands up.  OK, everybody worried about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She can be OK.  All right.  All right.  So obnoxious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We are so obnoxious.  Carry on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's Skype, not you.  It's you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it me or is it Skype?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's Skype.  I don't know what it is.  It's it's blurring on me, doctor.  smartphones in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is a great phone.  I got to say.  Number 20, Blackberry Classic.  Number 20.  Number 20.  Number 20.  Number 20.

Speaker: UNKNOWN

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Number 20.  Number 20.  Number 20.  Number 20.  Number 20.  Number 20.  Number 20.  Number 20.  Number 20.  Number 20.  Number 20.  Number 20.  Number 20.  Blackberry Classic.  Number 19, Blackberry Priv.  Number 18, Moto G4.  17G5, LG.  Galaxy Note 5.  Number 16.  That's a year old phone.  I like this one, the Axon 7.  That's a nice phone from ZTE, only 400 bucks.  The LG V20.  The HTC 10.  The Moto Z.  The Huawei Mate 8.  The OnePlus 3T comes in at number 10.  The iPhone SE, which was a big best seller, the 5 inch iPhone, comes in at number 9.  Then the 6S.  I guess they don't care about time.  If it's still available, I guess it could be on this list.  The 6S Plus is number 7.  The S7 is number 6.  If I'm not confusing you with the numbers.  That's confusing.  The S7 Edge is number 5.  I agree with that one.  That's a nice phone.  If you can get over the Samsung cruft.  iPhone 7 number 4.  I think a lot of people might be a little upset to see the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7  Plus number 3 so low because besting the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, Google's Pixel XL.  And the best phone is the little Pixel.  Oh, no.  I don't know why.  It's the one I carry.  It's royal blue.  Yeah, I didn't get the blue one.  I thought that was dopey.  Really?  You would go for the color?  That was my choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the reason I don't want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's only 32 gigs of storage.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Everything I have is in the cloud.  I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, 32 is actually probably enough, but I hate to buy a phone with 32.  It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How much did I get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I forgot.  The Business Insider folks say that the screen on the Pixel is lighter, is better, and has  useful features like fast charging that are missing in the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's quite nice, I got to say.  I was my usual grumpy self in the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  On the face of it, somebody sent me an email saying, I know you like the Pixel, but I sent  it back.  It's so boring.  It is boring looking.  It's not very beautiful.  It's a phone, people.  It's a phone.  It's very functional.  I'm pro-function.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't need a lot of sex appeal in my devices.  What do you carry?  I carry the Nexus 5X.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because I wasn't convinced that I needed to upgrade for the latest and greatest.  I'm still not really super convinced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would you get the smaller or the bigger one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The smaller.  I'm a one-handed caller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been very happy with the Pixel, the little one.  It works with VR too, although that seems counterintuitive, but you can use the Dream.  By the way, Verizon is feeling terrible that people can't get the Pixel from it, so they're  now giving you a free Google Daydream visor if you buy it from them.  The weights are long.  The sweatpants.  Really?  The sweatpants, the sweatpants VR.  Okay.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's one for the ladies.  Uh-oh.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm ducking.  Ready?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go.  Google is helping H&M construct a custom dress based on your personal data.  That's why I say it's for the ladies, because I don't wear dresses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can see you doing it because you're curious about the data.  I would do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like kilts.  If they did a skirt, I'd wear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a company that fitted you for bras based on your data and everybody else's data,  and that actually worked out really well, so I would buy a dress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you go into a booth and they take 3D pictures of you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For the data dress or for the bras?  For the bras.  So for the bras.  You answer a questionnaire.  Really?  No measurements?  Yeah.  It was super accurate.  That was what was kind of stunning to me.  That's odd.  It's not that odd.  It's basically like, here are things we think predict how a bra is going to fit, then they  give them to you and you tell it and it's based on what you send back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's not size, it's just design.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's size.  Size too?  Yeah, well, it's size and how you're likely to fit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whether you run a lot or stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Something like that.  So I don't want to go too far down this road and get in trouble, but on the subways in  New York, they're advertising a bra and billboards in New York with no straps and no back.  Oh, like little cups?  Cups.  It's called suction cups.  How does it stay on?  Adhesive.  Adhesive.  And how does it do its job?  Adhesive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  You're not going to be able to jog or run a marathon if you're a big, chubby woman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's so you can wear a strapless dress or, you know, off the shoulder dress and you don't  want to see any lines.  It just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google fashion tape, Jeff.  And you're going to be...  It's a whole world of exciting things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really?  Oh, wow.  Fashion tape.  Okay.  All right.  So I was just trying to figure out the engineering of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fashion tape requires a lot of engineering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Got it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what does the dress do, Leo?  Thank you.  Let me get out of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're trying so hard not to say anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google's teaming up with a digital fashion house.  Don't know what that means.  So, they're working together on an Android app that will track wherever users go, the  weather where they live and whether they're having casual or formal hangs.  This is the verge.  Yeah.  I don't know what a hang is.  With that information, IV...  Hangs on your body?  Yeah.  Whether they're...  Do you go to casual events or formal events?  Oh, that's...  Oh, got it.  Hangs.  Hangs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think.  And then that's like hangouts, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then they're going to design an individualized data dress that you can buy.  It sounds like the bra, frankly.  So if you're in Sweden, it'll be black velvet because it's cold.  And if you like to go out dancing, it'll have diamond details.  There's not really that much tech in it, but Google has...  No.  Google has...  See, this is based on Google's awareness API, which uses all the sensors on the phone.  And actually, the mostly where I hear about the awareness API is as a form of authentication,  right?  So based on your gait, where you go, Google can uniquely identify you, but they also can  use this...  It knows whether you've got headphones plugged in, where you did that, what weather conditions  were, and then somehow it makes a dress based on that.  The dress starts at $99, which is in the world of fashion, not a whole heck of a lot of  money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's a way for them to personalize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry.  No.  I still don't understand what phone data is going to contribute to your dress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, like I said, if you live in Sweden, they'll make it warmer.  If you like to dance a lot, they'll make sure there's slits down the side or whatever it  is people need for dancing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, that's stupid.  This is dumb.  If you're going to use data...  Seriously.  For good, not evil.  No, this is just dumb.  It's not even evil.  It's just...  It's not very interesting, I have to agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry, I put it in the rundown.  No, I mean, it's a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Using that type of data to market products or offer products to people is interesting.  It's just that use case doesn't make a lot of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could just ask somebody, or maybe even better, have a rec where people can look at  dresses and say, that would work with my lifestyle.  That's interesting.  What a thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's like, what if I'm going to Sweden, but Google doesn't know yet?  Google doesn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, but it does.  Because I bought airplane tickets.  It knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it does know.  It knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Google knows all.  It knows.  It knows all.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like, I love the idea of like being able to say, like a bunch of people who are your height  bought this and it fit too small or this fits generally too large.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's that kind of data feedback is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  And Amazon actually does 3D scans of shoes now.  And so you tell it what kind of how your shoes typically fit for you and then they match  it to the particular shoe you're looking at.  And they're like, you should buy a size smaller in this shoe.  That's interesting.  So that's useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a company they bought last year called ShoeFitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you put your foot inside it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they scan the shoe and then they scan the shoe.  Okay.  They just bought some shoes and they're like, how do athletic shoes normally fit on you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's good.  That's so it's kind of.  So do you like these?  What are you not like?  When I went to buy running shoes, I went and I was strongly recommended that I do this  to a store where you actually they look at your gate and they and they say you pronate  in and you need a shoe that's going to give you better support here.  I mean, I mean, that kind of customization, I don't think Google could do.  I really think somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, oh, you ready?  There's a company called Sensoria.  They make connected socks and they will tell you, they will tell you, they look at your  gate and they tell you if you pronate, if you whatever the other one is and how you  run and what types of shoes would work better for you.  So it's out there, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I need connected socks.  That's for sure is out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They see.  Oh, you found them.  Yes, they they smart socks.  They I think do sports like sports bras and other things, too.  So it's not just like it's so you can run better, basically.  Oh, yeah, there's there's a sports bra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No relation to the 2015 horror film about Caroline, a woman in her late 30s who was  searching for a new beginning and realizes she is not as alone as she thought she was  in her new apartment.  Not that Sensoria.  I don't know.  That's a good that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Socks.  You might not be as alone as you thought you were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a little different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The socks are really soft, too, guys.  They're very good for you.  You have them.  I have reviewed them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, you have connected socks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  I used to I gave I sent them back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Aren't you afraid of when insurance companies get your connected sock data?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, because I don't usually run a lot.  So they'd be OK.  They'd be like, oh, this person is a couch potato.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, you know, this whole thing is, of course, the argument, one of many.  But this is the kind of chief argument people use about privacy is, oh, you're not going  to want insurance companies to deny you coverage because they saw you ate an extra donut.  But I always thought that that might be a red herring, because my experience when you  apply for life insurance is they not only do they send a nurse out and take all your  vitals, they have a long questionnaire in which they ask you all sorts of ridiculous  things.  Do you climb on ladders?  How often do you climb on ladders?  How high are the ladders?  Do you ever wear a safety harness when you climb on ladders?  And I realize the point is not to screen you out beforehand, but if you lie, then and that  which they hope you will do, they hope you will say, no, I don't smoke and I don't  climb on ladders because then when you do die from falling off a ladder, they can deny  you, your heirs, any money.  So I don't think they need all this information because they just put it in the questionnaire  and they're praying you're going to lie.  They don't want to know really what you do.  They want to be able to what they want is to collect premiums but not pay out.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, that is such a cynical view of insurance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's exactly how it works.  It's not even cynical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Evil industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's this profit.  It's capitalistic.  Do you think insurance companies want to pay your insurance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course not.  No, it's all based on actuarial data.  There is a really cool thing if you want to go nerdy on what real time masses of easily  collected data on people means for actuarial predictions, but that's, that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, of course.  So actuarials just statistical and frankly, that's sufficient for them, right?  They just take a population pool and you know, 13% of those people are going to die  of a heart attack in the next three years.  And so they make the insurance premium such that they will still make a profit if that  happens.  It's all math.  I understand that.  But the question is, are they interested in this kind of additional, thank you very much.  This is the actuary magazine in case you'd like to subscribe.  Are they interested in the data, you know, from your, from your TiVo and your, and your  Visio and all of this stuff in order to somehow deny you coverage?  No, I don't think they are.  I think they don't care about that.  A, because of the statistics, but B, because they want your, they want to give you coverage.  They just don't want to pay you.  So all of their energy is figuring out how to avoid paying off.  Not and not getting new customers.  In medical insurance, it might be different.  In medical insurance, they definitely want to screen out people who are going to cost  them money.  They'd like young, healthy people, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I've been thinking about this lately.  They're there.  You know, insurance is selling fear, right?  Is fear that you're going to die and your family's going to be I would submit there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a difference between life insurance and health insurance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, I agree.  I agree with that.  But various things can sell fear.  And then I've been thinking lately about all the fear I hear advertised all over.  Right.  Here's the nice white male who's worried about his  fear.  Work, fear is a motivator.  As there's a dark force behind.  Right.  There's things about your identity and your credit and your data.  There's a serious add on right now that has a new thing that women should carry in their  purses, they say, that acts like a cat's claw and not only harms your attacker, but also  collects DNA.  This is an ad on Sirius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you could just get DNA under your fingernails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just scratch them.  That's good enough.  Well, so Jeff, I would submit it's because of what you listen to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't I don't get those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The media you're following.  I've never heard of that.  I get hopeful.  Here's what is it serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I listen to the talk stuff like I'm SMBC on Sirius.  So when the TV gets the real commercials, I get the really I have a lot of experience

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because I've worked in radio for 40 years and radio discovered this.  And you saw about 20 years ago with the advent of Rush Limbaugh that a certain kind of programming  did very, very well.  And it has taken over the at least the AM radio spectrum completely 100 percent.  And, you know, it's just it.  Yes, it works.  But I think we're moving into an age and we know this from from Trump's Facebook advertising  and the Cambridge Analytica stuff where they will target an ad to your mental state.  So for some people like Stacey, they may not target her with fear ads.  They may target her with Let's Make the World a Better Place ads.  In fact, I'm pretty sure that's what they target you with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Probably or food.  I really like food.  Let's eat more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they know that, by the way, Stacey, they know that exactly.  So I think that that's kind of old world is scare everybody.  And, you know, I mean, not to get political, but it's pretty clear that that was Trump's  message throughout the campaign, even in his inaugural speech in the American Carnage  speech, that that fear was very effective to get him elected.  But I think we're getting even more sophisticated than that.  Fear works in a general with a general brush.  But some people it doesn't.  I don't think Stacey probably responds well to the fear message.  I would almost guarantee you.  Try me.  Scare me.  Let's see.  What would scare Stacey?  Stacey, you know that all those Internet things, devices in your house are providing a target  for hackers who can get in, reach in, see everything you're doing and kidnap your child.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know that's not true.  But OK, son of a bitch.  She's smart.  This is why fear may not work for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I was always told and I've told this story before, but when at Tech TV, when I  was talking about how we should really aim for the smart technology enthusiast programmers,  I said there are 14 million programmers in the US at the time.  Why aren't we aiming at them?  That's a great audience.  And the boss said, Leo, let me tell you something.  Brand is the refuge of the ignorant.  Advertisers don't want smart people because like Stacey, they know, I'm not scared.  You can't scare me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they want you can scare me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That just didn't scare me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, but seriously, they don't want people who are too sophisticated because you people  do research on products and try to be rational and blah, blah, blah.  I'll scare Stacey.  Go ahead, scare Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, scare me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, you can get food allergies in the middle of life.  That's scary.  Oh, that is scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But not to anything good, right?  Is there anything I could do?  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff, is there anything I could buy to prevent that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are there allergy drops?  You have to buy a new diet that only gives you...  After the AFib, people have their own cures.  Drink a lot of water.  Yeah, I was dehydrated.  But then inevitably carbs.  Carbs give you...  We've been eating bread for a long time.  Jeff, you're gluten intolerant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not giving up my bread.  Jeff, you've got to stay away from the gluten.  So my pizza, not door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the ultimate running bra that just happens to be smart.  Oh, you're going to get us in trouble now, aren't you?  The Ohm bra, not related to Ohm Malik.  The Ohm Signal, yes.  You know about this?  Those guys are great.  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have not tried...  They didn't have a running bra.  They just had a fitted shirt when I was trying my connected clothing.  Is it connected?  It is.  Well, it's got sensors in it and a battery pack.  It coaches you.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Say goodbye to bounce.  Say hello to comfort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a big deal, you guys.  You move and bounce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah, you're right.  I don't know.  Well, we have some of those issues as well.  I don't know what Stacey is.  I got older.  This is actually very cool.  I would get this.  I should.  Oh, now, I should get this Valentine's gift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What was it on Seinfeld?  Was it the Man's Ear?  Man's Ear.  Man's Ear, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So tell me, is this a...  Would this be a bad Valentine's Day gift?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If... for Lisa or for you?  No, for Lisa.  I don't need a bra.  They have a shirt, you guys.  They have a fitted shirt for boys or men.  No, he's asking for Lisa.  No, but I'm thinking for a Valentine's gift for Lisa.  If Lisa is into fitness and runs...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's training for the Avon Walk for the Cure.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, yes.  But if not, then you're telling her something that no woman wants her husband to tell her,  which is get off the couch.  No, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's a fitness...  She's fitness all in it.  Okay, then you're fine.  That's good.  All over.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Now, but I have a problem.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tell me your problem, Leo.  Oh, I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can talk about that offline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what guys, they go into Victoria's Secret and they say, she's about...  She looks like...  She's about your size.  She looks just like you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People used to tell me that a lot when I was younger.  Not so much now.  Not so much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, the bro.  They're saying the Seinfeld Man's Ear was called the bro.  Oh, nice.  That was the Man's Ear?  What size, baby?  I don't want one.  Oh, she doesn't want one.  Nevermind.  It's like it measures...  No?  It would help?  No?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to be on her list.  She's going to be like, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not Stacey.  I came up with that one.  Okay, got it.  She came running in and said, don't get that.  Okay, good.  How do you feel about a...  Not if diamonds forget it.  How?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?  If it's not diamonds, forget it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not even if it would detect your afibrillation?  Afibrillation.  No?  Okay.  I better cancel that order.  Diamonds.  She wants diamonds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have some lovely connected jewelry I can tell you about.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, she doesn't want anything connected.  In fact, she started wearing...  I said, because you're training, you should wear your Apple watch.  It would help you with the training.  She tried it first.  I hate this thing.  She doesn't want all that stuff.  Google overtakes Apple as the world's...  You know, I didn't do this story on MacBreak Weekly.  I probably shouldn't do it on this week in Google.  It comes from a...  It's so meaningless.  It's just dumb.  It comes from a company...  Even the name of the company should tell you, Startup Echo.  The world's most valuable brand, Google.  Apple's dominance has ended.  Well, actually, this comes from brand finance.  Startup Echo is just repeating it.  Google is now the king of all brands.  But I don't even know how they measure that, right?  Brand goodwill.  It says, Apple has failed to maintain its technological advantages,  repeatedly disillusioned its advocates with tweaks  when material changes were expected.  I wouldn't disagree with this.  Apple over-exploited the goodwill of its customers,  mainly because of its failure to generate significant revenues  from products like the Apple watch  and its inability to demonstrate that genuinely innovative technologies  that are desired by consumers are already in the pipeline.  I think that's accurate.  What do they say about Google?  Google has definitely benefited from increased revenue.  Brand strength score is also a factor in its success.  Its brand strength score was up by two points,  indicating underlying brand equity.  Higher brand equity means the brand is more likely to retain customers.  Well, where are you going to go?  Even command a premium price.  Number three, Amazon.  Number four, AT&T.  I don't think so.  What?  I don't think so.  I guess they include revenue.  I don't know what the methodology is.  All right.  I have a story I want to ask you guys about  because I don't know what this is going to mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. Well, I'll be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's in March, April, March, usually right through 13.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, wait, I haven't asked you.  You still have to explain something to me.  Hold on. OK, OK.  Oh, Google.  Google Now.  Google Now launcher app possibly being removed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, let me explain that to you, little lady.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where's my punch?  Leo button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sweetie, let me tell you, sweetie.  Come over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you don't use the Google Now launcher, so you don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not what happens when I show up when I scroll over in my Nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, you might you might be using that now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does it look like here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So so this so what we're talking about is the stock launcher on Google phones.  Yeah, that's so you slide left.  You get now. Yeah, that's what you're using.  But I love that the both the pixel has a very similar launcher.  Don't have the pixel.  No, but I think that they they will just offer.  First of all, because you have a five X, you're going to keep.  I think you'll still have the now watch. I don't know.  I'm not mansplaining this so good.  But this but the pixel launchers the same.  The only thing is it has assistant.  But you swipe left for Google now and and you don't hit the center

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  button at the bottom to get the apps you just scroll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you don't get. Yeah.  OK, so that some people have first bothered me

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  because you don't. It's still I end up at launching messenger  all the time and I don't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know how on your dock, Stacy, you have two icons  and then an apps icon and then two more icons.  They got rid of the apps icon.  So now you can have five icons on the bottom.  But and that bothered me at first.  I thought, well, how do I get to my app store?  You just slide up to go to the app store.  And that actually becomes a very intuitive move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, yeah. OK, then I can handle it.  It's good. It's fine.  I liked having I liked being able to flip over and get the weather  and some news stories and my shipments.  That's not change.  OK, then I feel good. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Google's part of Google's problem is they have way too many  versions of everything, right?  And I wish they do the same with their messaging apps.  Just prune a few of them out.  So so, yeah, they're going to discontinue it, they apparently,  because they have to.  I presume that the pixel launcher will take over  where the Google Now launcher is.  But many of us, one of the reasons I don't pay any attention is I don't use either.  I use active launcher.  A lot of people for years, I use novel launcher.  A lot of people use third party launchers.  We don't use the stock.  I don't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You guys are so like cutting edge and cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's geeks. We like to moddy twiddle stuff.  Yeah, it were really twiddlers.  I am not Jeff. I'm a twiddler.  So they're going to remove it from the optional Google services package  starting the first of next month.  So existing devices can continue to use the Google Now launcher  and it will still be updated using the Google Play Store.  But it just won't be listed in the Google Play Store as a separate download.  And future Google devices, including the rumored new pixels coming out,  I guess later this year, will all have the pixels.  Later this year, we'll all have the pixel launcher on it, not the Google Now launcher.  Not a big loss. I think that that's a minor.  It was just two different code bases they didn't really need.  Okay. Yeah, there's probably dozens.  That's a good question.  And it made me feel very manly to answer that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel very patronized now. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff and I both know you're much smarter than us.  The world is in it. Amen.  We're not, believe me, in any way diminishing your brains.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, we know better. And older.  We're older too. So whatever brain power we had, we're losing.  Did you just say you were born after 1977, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  1977 was a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was the year I would have graduated from college had I continued.  It was a year after I began my career in broadcasting.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. Just checking.  I don't know.  I have ties older than you.  I was in assistant city of the Royal Chicago Tribune.  No, they're coming back in style, Stacey. It's good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're this wide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Excellent. Okay.  Do you want to talk about the fine from the FTC or do you want to talk about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. That's we got the Vizio story.  We've got Google's court loss.  Oh, yeah.  Let me start with this one.  So Microsoft, a district court last year ruled that Microsoft did not have to hand over information to US law enforcement that was stored in a server in Ireland.  This is a magistrate. So it's a lower court than the district court.  Magistrate Thomas Reuter in Philadelphia ruled on Friday that Google did have to hand over data stored outside the United States.  He ruled that transferring emails from an international server so FBI agents could review them locally as part of a domestic fraud probe did not qualify as a seizure.  So I guess I gather he would say, well, if you were seizing data held in a warehouse in Ireland, say,  I would stop you from doing that.  But since you're just asking Google, copy this data over to the US server so we can see it.  The judge says there's no meaningful interference with the account holders possessory interest in the data assault.  So that should be legal.  He wrote through the retrieval of the electronic data by Google from its multiple data centers abroad.  I'm sorry, though the retrieval has the potential for an invasion of privacy, potential the actual infringement of privacy occurs at the time of disclosure in the United States.  I'm not sure I disagree with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, isn't the arguing I mean, isn't the argument about possessory interest simply because he's saying they don't have to have a hard time physically delivering the product that it doesn't count.  Right.  But all digital information would be subject to that then, right, because it's not hard to grab digital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, Google said and I think they didn't help.  Well, we don't even know where the emails lie there.  We for for practical reasons, we distribute them all over the place.  And if in effect that sounds to me like Google's and they didn't mean it this way, but that what Google's saying is, well, it's it's physical location is not material.  Because we don't even know where it is.  It's just it's just in the cloud.  And I think the judge is quite rightly saying, well, this doesn't harm the defendant.  Because it's doesn't matter where it is.  It's bits that are stored in some imaginary space.  It's isn't it kind of ridiculous to say, well, one third of the email is on a server in Germany, one third of the emails are serving Italy and one thirds in the United States.  Well, why should that those two thirds be protected?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, because all those other countries who don't want another American servers because of what we can do.  Well, I agree. There's political.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, I understand the political issues, but the judge isn't supposed to, you know, consider the implication.  The judge is supposed to say, well, does this fit the law or not?  I agree that there's supposed to consider implications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, that seems like a lot to say to the judge.  Well, you got to see this is going to cause us political trouble or this is going to cause a company economic trouble.  I think you'd have to argue that.  I don't think Google argued that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you could now you could argue that this is outside of the FBI is the FBI outside of their jurisdiction because the data is not in the U.S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what if a third of the email is and Google handles hands that third over, which isn't very useful because it's like every third bit.  I don't see why data should be protected just because Google's process involves spreading it around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Their legal argument may be flawed.  I'm not. But if you think about this in a bigger picture, it does open us up to lots of problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, certainly I agree with that.  I mean, I understand why Microsoft doesn't want to be liable for something held on a server in Ireland.  And Russia, for instance, says you can't like Russia put LinkedIn out of kick-lick that out at Russia because they don't store the data on Russian servers.  So Russia doesn't have access to the data.  But I think we also should be reasonable, shouldn't we, about balancing the needs for law enforcement to do their job?  I mean, how much of a harm is this to somebody?  Do you don't think about when you put something on Gmail, you're not thinking, well, thank goodness, Gmail is being stored somewhere else.  You don't even think about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, but if you're in Canada, you do.  If you're in Germany, you do.  You do. Yeah, you want it not to be.  In fact, if you're a corporate client, I think of Google services, you can say where you want it stored, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. And there are actually technologies that'll cache data in certain...  You can run something that'll say store this only in this Amazon data center, for example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess my argument is that Google is using an artifact of its technological solution to try to defend the privacy of its users.  I applaud their desire to protect the privacy of their users, but I don't feel like this is that strong of an argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. And that's... I mean, Google lawyers, bad legal argument. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In any event, they're going to obviously appeal.  And the reason they're going to appeal is because the higher court, the Second Circuit Court, did say that Microsoft could not be forced to turn over emails stored in Dublin.  I think we get... I think... I mean, it's thorny. I'll have to listen on Friday.  I'm sure Denise Howell will discuss it on This Week in Law with some actual lawyers.  Ooh.  What a thought.  You know, the ACLU, US Chamber of Commerce, lots of technology media companies agree that it shouldn't...  You know, that... you shouldn't have to hand over data stored on servers outside the United States.  On the other hand...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think their argument is weak?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know. You know, there were four dissenting judges on the District Court.  So it wasn't a unanimous decision by any case.  In fact, the dissent called on the Supreme Court or Congress to resolve this, saying the decision hurt law enforcement and raised national security concerns.  So they said the Supreme Court should weigh in on this.  This goes back to the Distorted Communications Act of 1986.  And one of the things that did get fixed by Congress just a few days ago was this crazy notion.  That if you didn't... if email was stored on a server for more than six months, 180 days, then you didn't... you lost all privacy rights to it.  That it was considered abandoned at that point and that no warrant will be required for law enforcement to access that.  That's been the law.  Now Congress has passed an act saying, no, no, no, no, that's still your private property.  Because, frankly, usage is... you know, the law is cut up with usage.  People leave their email on servers forever and it's still considered, you know, theirs.  It's not abandoned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, no, that was the law. There was a period...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was until just last week.  Actually, it may still be the law.  I guess it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It has to be printed in the Federal Register.  President Trump has to sign it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And no one knows it'll happen then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, they should... can we make it just so that he just has to tweet it?  Email? Email? Is it Clinton's email? Is it Hillary's email? Oh, well, that changes it all.  If he just tweets it, it should be law.  Just tweet it and it'll be law.  Well, that's what he thinks. That's exactly what he thinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We were so close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know, I know, I know. I had to get in a shot. I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  Google Interns Work saves one and a half gigabytes a day.  It's the famous, soon to be famous, broadly, compression algorithm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, wait, was this on Silicon Valley?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No. Yes. What is this? What is the score?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do they call that? The Ryman score?  What is the score that they talk about there?  Anna Maria Cortilea, who was an intern, is now from Romania, now a full-time software engineer.  When she was at Google, as an intern,  she perfected the Brotli compression and installed it at the Google Play Store  to streamline app installs and updates.  And because so many people download from the Google Play Store, 65 billion downloads,  it's estimated that this compression, which reduces the average update size 65%,  has saved a massive amount of data.  An intern did it. Isn't that great?  They used to use GZip, but Brotli is so much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is cool because it shows kind of, I don't want to say it wasn't,  I was going to say low-hanging fruit for both algorithms and software efficiencies,  but it may not be low-hanging fruit. It probably was really hard.  But it's very cool to me that in a digital world, you can actually do these sort of tweaks  and have a really big impact very quickly.  So that's one of the reasons I feel kind of optimistic about things in this area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it also tells you something about Google's scale, right?  Yes, that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A little tiny improvement at Google's scale saves its estimated, get this,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's really true.  This should be your number. I'm sorry if I stole it.  One and a half petabytes a day, a day.  One and a half petabytes of data transfer from the Google Play Store every day.  A petabyte is a million gigabytes.  So that gives you an idea. One and a half million gigabytes of data every day.  And I think that an intern could do that is so awesome.  Yes.  We've talked about Brotli on security now.  It's an interesting compression algorithm.  I don't know. It's been around for a year or so.  It replaced Zopfli.  So you typically, if you're using compression, you know, using zip on Linux,  you'll use Bzip or Gzip.  But this is much better and faster.  20 to 26 higher compression, percent higher compression ratio over Zopfli.  And anyway, so that's I like that story.  You're right, because it shows it shows how one person can make such a huge difference.  An intern from Romania.  Hey, they've got a lot of smart people in Romania.  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.  She's a she's a graduate of the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics at Babes Boli.  University. I'm sure that's mispronouncing that Babesh Babesh Boli.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this is not a language that I could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Romanian Babes Boli University Babesh.  Probably Babesh. That's what that little thing underneath there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's that? Is that a city? No. What is that called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you call? In fact, that thingy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This thing is made up. It looks like it doesn't look like it's in the font.  They just drew it on there.  We need a Romanian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, someone's asking about the square kilometer array.  What's that?  That's a giant telescope that they're building in Africa in or maybe Australia and South Africa.  Sorry. It's going to create so much data.  I think actually learning how to deal with that amount of data is going to lead us to all kinds of new science.  I wrote about it like years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. Five kilometer diameter.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ska.  And of course, you know, I mean, even even like the Arecibo telescope produces huge amounts of data.  This one will be out amazing.  Phase one of Ska was 650 million euros. Phase two's cost is not even established.  Nice. It's a radio. It's a radio telescope, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. That's probably important to say to people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is that? Well, we're just, you know, we're listening for the Howard Stern show.  We've built giant dishes so we can all listen to Howard Stern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We talked about this last week and I don't know if we really kind of explained it properly.  So I'm going to try to do a better job.  This time.  This is Google Brain.  Remember, they trained a pair of neural networks to zoom enhance, zoom enhance.  And we showed this, but I don't think I described this properly.  This graphic.  And now I'm not sure. I thought I understood it this morning, but maybe the coffee wore off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anybody want to try?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the pixel. This is what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So at left, this is what the computer was given. An eight by eight very blurry picture, right?  At right, what they call ground truth is the actual photo.  In the middle is what the computer using AI.  Generated from the eight by eight input.  Look how close it got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  First one, not so much.  That's too better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They got the lips a little wrong, but it doesn't have that data.  I mean, this is all it has is the eight by eight.  So we are, you know, that whole thing that you see all the time and, you know, like 24.  Oh, look at this blurry picture.  Let's zoom in on it and see if we could see what that person is, which always annoyed me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Magic software. That's what we call it. Yeah, magic software.  It's not so magic anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's kind of amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unfortunately, according to Google, this was a one off research exploration.  They have no current plans to use it. Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We just invented this amazing thing, but we're not going to use it. I promise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. Enough of that. We're going to take a break.  A word from legal zone.  The holiday hangover is over.  New Year's dust is settled. Now you can actually do something.

No.  So let's do it right now. Would everybody get your Google home?  Turn on your Google home. Why don't you do this too, Jeff?  Okay, Google.  No, no, no. You don't have to do anything. Just put it next to the speaker.  Okay.  I'm going to play this ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, hold on. I don't have a speaker.  No, no. Just put your home next to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, your headphones are something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. I already did this earlier today. Yes, it does it.  Does it do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  So the lady's getting home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, Google. Turn on the hall lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did your hall lights come on, Jeff?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Turn off the music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did your music go up, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it had no music. It just, the little lady light went around and around and around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what's interesting is Amazon has somehow, and I would like to get this technology,  modified their commercials so they don't wake up the Echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought they said they were working on it, but they hadn't done it.  Because I asked them that last Super Bowl if they had done some technology,  and they were Amazon, so they didn't actually answer the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My Echo has not woken up to the TV in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the Google does have a better speaker, sorry, better microphones than the Echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So UUL in the chat room says, my Google Home went nuts during the Super Bowl.  Gadget Nut in the chat room is saying, Amazon underlies the audio of their commercials  with a 5 kHz tone that I guess is inaudible, but that the Amazon Echo knows enough to,  oh, oh, this isn't real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I was like, what? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So wouldn't that be audible, a 5 kHz tone? No?  It's got to be within the range of TV speakers.  Obviously it has to be able to reproduce that.  Here, let me, what was the tone, 5 kHz?  5 kHz.  Listen, this is a, that's a 5...  What, do you hear something?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do.  Do you hear anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I do.  I'm just kidding. Sorry.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, wait, wait. All right. Let's try this.  Okay, everybody, put your Echo near the speaker here.  Oh, Echo.  Alexa, order me some roses.  Did that work?  No, you made some noise. Don't make any noise.  Shh. Okay, ready?  Alexa, send Leo $100.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think Suppy Sale's got in trouble for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there's no FCC in podcasts yet.  So I know that hurts some people because they have hearing.  Did that really hurt you? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that, Stacey. I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they actually talked to Wired about this and in that story, both Google and Amazon are working on this, but neither of them have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that was a recent article?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that was like Monday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so Dr. Mom says hers woke up.  UUI says, I'm not sure what you meant by that question.  Laundog says his Echo Dot did wake up, but he didn't understand what she said.  I think that now and somebody saying again in the chat room, what they're doing is they're clipping the A word a little bit off.  Oh, that could be good.  Oh, that's interesting.  And Guy Smiley says he's getting an order of four dozen red roses. Congratulations, Guy.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Man, Leo, I'm like, ugh. My ears are still ringing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry I hurt your ears. Really? Do you listen really loud? It wasn't that loud, was it?  No, it's just piercing. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It hurt? It was like, it was like fingernail on blackboard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's because you were born after 1977. Those that were born before 1977 don't even know what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We got back at you, didn't we? We got back at her, didn't we, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's so mean. I'm so sorry. I didn't know it would be that painful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Earlier you said we were old, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How old are we, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, so I'm going to hit the punching button. You can have the five kilohertz button.  Can you hear this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, did you see the guy who's made a dash button? Okay, this is a little political, but it's still...  This is great.  It's still a great story. So it actually is kind of a neat, geeky story.  You know, the Amazon dash button allows you to push it and automatically order stuff.  And this guy says, you know what I'd like?  I'd like a dash button that I can push that will donate to the ACLU every time I get mad at the TV.  So Nathan Pryor is a 41-year-old designer, programmer, tinkerer, crafter, maker, and take apart her.  And he likes to make stuff. He made a Tetris jack-o-lantern. So he's created an ACLU dash button.  That's the greatest.  It actually turned out to be a little bit tricky. Amazon does give you kind of an interface to the button.  Did you talk about this on your show today, Stacey?  I did not do the IoT dash button, but it is a good story.  It's a good IoT button. And it turns out there isn't really an API for donations.  So charities, you might want to think about that going forward. Have an API for donating, right?  Then people can write this. So he wrote a script in Python using Amazon's AWS Lambda service, which is a very cool service.  It also works with the Echo voice services, Amazon voice services.  When it's triggered, his Python script opens the donation page, fills in the fields with his name, address, and credit card info, then presses the submit button.  And then if it's successful, sends him a text message to let him know.  He was so worried, though, about bugs that he used a prepaid gift card just so there wouldn't be an infinite loop of donations, which was probably smart.  And he got the acknowledgement from the ACLU.  He said the real hard thing was getting the IoT button registered and linked up to the script.  But he was able to do that. So now he has a button on his computer whenever he sees something he doesn't like.  He just presses the dash button and sends 10 bucks to the ACLU.  I think that is brilliant. I think that is just a really that's an interesting use of the dash button, isn't it?  And you know what you can do? You can do an if this then that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then any time you press it, you could actually send an email to Donald Trump or Mike Pence saying, oh, might as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You just did this. Just so you know, that tweet. Exactly.  And folks will be fair, you could donate to Breitbart, too. Why not? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or, you know, you could do Twilio. Can you do Twilio? Make phone calls and make a phone call. Tell your senator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're going to just piss me off.  The other favorite thing I have is all kinds of people are making Teen Vogue subscriptions for their senators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because Teen Vogue's been very political. It's been amazing. Amazing.  So we have a friend we have had him on the new screensavers who runs a company called the Jolly Roger Telephone Company.  You may remember this. He he created robots that if you get a call from a telemarketer, you could transfer the call over to their robot and it will tie them up for hours.  Oh, yes. Hours. Here you want to hear one just after months of asking for help.  Somebody finally teaches Sally how to record her favorite TV shows.  So this is one of the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hi, my name is Stephanie. I'm a customer service manager for home. Hello. I'm just following up. Yes. Hi. Hi. Can you hear me? Hi. My name is Stephanie.  My name is Stephanie. I'm a female service manager. The loud voice is the robot.  Yeah, I'm just following up on a request for information that was made about a walk in bathtub.  The Vance therapeutic walk in bathtub. Yeah. Okay. So like, can you get to the point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So mean. And I feel bad for the telemarketer because it's just it's not that's a poor nice lady who's just trying to do a job.  However, there are some telemarketers I would very much like to punish.  The people call you say, hello, I'm calling from Windows and your machine has a virus on it and I can help you remove it.  You know those guys? It's become a plague. So the Jolly Roger Phone Company is creating an outbound bot.  When you get the pop up on your screen, you just send the number to the Jolly Roger Phone Company and he's going to have hundreds of his bots call that number and harass them.  I'm sure it's illegal, but I love the idea. We're going to actually interview one of the new screensavers on Saturday and maybe we'll even try it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't call me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't call me. It's probably illegal, but maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not under this FCC. Nothing's illegal now, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, your FCC buddy is doing all kinds of things, fella. What's new by the way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, did I get it wrong? Because I was talking about Lifeline last week and I had seen the story that nine companies were knocked off of that.  But then I got a text message from one of our good friends, Allison from Nosilla Cast, who said no, there are still 891 companies still doing it. Is that the case or is Lifeline?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are a lot of Lifeline companies.  So Lifeline broadband is not dead.  Those guys were kicked off mostly for a procedural issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So I want to correct myself. So Lifeline broadband is not dead.  Or is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it all of the Lifeline broadband people? Because there's Lifeline and then there's Lifeline broadband, isn't there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's Lifeline, which is phone service. And last year the FCC extended it to include broadband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the question is, were those nine the only ones providing broadband through Lifeline?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And here's where we're going to find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm looking. He defends it saying there was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  14 projects participated in the broadband pilot program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But he in his Medium post, Ajit Pai said, first, our action only impacted nine of the over 900 providers participating in the Lifeline program.  Maybe he's misrepresenting that as the Lifeline telephone program has 900 providers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Lifeline broadband program had 14 originally. How many of those are still there?  So in that case...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a very misleading Medium post from Ajit Pai.  Oh, well, yeah.  Because he's saying 900 providers participate in the Lifeline program. But we're not upset about that.  We're upset about the Lifeline broadband program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and this I'm still trying to find out that actual number of folks in the Lifeline broadband program. If you'd asked me ahead of time, I could have told you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry. We need a reporter. We need somebody like Stacy Higginbotham here.  Anyway, if you want to read more, and maybe this is a hyperbolic headline, but it does sound like the program to provide...  I do like it, frankly, that he is posting a response on Medium. Right?  That's at least reaching out and participating and saying something.  I would hope that this would be fact-checked.  By whom?  By Stacy Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Lord. I don't know if you pay me enough to fact-check Ajit Pai.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know, really. But what I'd like...  All right. I'll tell you what. I'll go home and I'll fact-check it. I'll do some research.  Oh, I know. I'm looking for it right now.  We can post this as a comment in this Medium post, which is one of the advantages of Medium posts, is you can annotate them.  But I do want to say, I may have misstated that, and so we're going to figure that one out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm digging through the Lifeline modernization FAQs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is the problem. It's kind of obfuscated. My sense was that people are not going to get Lifeline broadband service.  They might get Lifeline phone service, but the Lifeline broadband program is gone.  But I may be wrong, and we'll check.  YouTube mobile live streaming is here, starting with channels above 10,000 subscribers.  I've had live streaming on YouTube for a while. Samsung offered it on some of its phones with its 360 camera.  But if you didn't have one of those, or you weren't a verified user who was allowed to do this, or whatever it was that you had to have,  now anybody with more than 10,000 subscribers on YouTube can do it.  And eventually, YouTube says everybody who has YouTube and has the ability to stream live from a phone will be able to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm surprised that, frankly, it's taking them so long, because Facebook's competition, Facebook Live, has been out there for eight months now.  YouTube has much more experience in video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's got to be expensive.  Yeah, that's what they said about YouTube originally.  YouTube's expensive, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  YouTube is expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's talk about Facebook.  So this was a number, but I'm going to have to do it for myself, which is fine.  What's the number now on Senator Warren's...  So when she got kicked off the Senate floor yesterday, or told to sit down...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She was told, you may not read this letter from 1986 by Coretta Scott King.  It was sent to the Senate during Jeff Sessions' confirmation hearing for being a federal judge.  Coretta Scott King saying that Sessions had tried to suppress voting by black voters.  Elizabeth Warren tried to read it last night on the Senate floor and was stopped procedurally by Mitch McConnell, who said it was impugning a fellow senator.  That's a rule in the Senate. You can't impugn other senators.  However, another senator then read the cover letter.  Many senators have since.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, more than one.  Oh, lots of men have, and they weren't stopped.  Oh, that's bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know the Republicans don't like uppity women.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, maybe they kind of probably knew that Elizabeth Warren was going to do it and had procedurally prepared for it.  Maybe they weren't prepared for 50 other guys to do it. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the argument on Morning Joe this morning, why do I watch that?  But the argument Steve Schmidt made, which is that McConnell wanted to do exactly that because Trump once Elizabeth Warren to be his opponent in 2020, and so they're setting her up to be the leader of resistance because they think they can beat her.  How cynical is that?  I just put on the on the rundown chat, there was a great thread that then explained, was it rule 19?  Rule 18?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, Pat, impugning a fellow senator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it explains the, like the Electoral College itself, it has racist roots going back to abolition.  I'll put it up later and read it later, but it's kind of fascinating.  John Quincy Adams was involved, and they basically tried to shut up the abolitionists.  And that's what led to rule 19.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you saw the Spielberg movie about Lincoln, you saw how vicious the debate was over the, what was the amendment, I can't remember, but they were really calling each other names so I can see why they were.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was wonderful, by the way. That's a great movie to watch if you ever want to enjoy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So anyway, Elizabeth Warren's video now has more than 9 million views.  Wow!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it is a huge meme on Twitter, she persist.  Persist!  Persist!  Yeah.  Kamala Harris, our senator from California says, by silencing Elizabeth Warren, the GOP gave women around the world a rallying cry, she persisted.  She was, this is what McConnell said, never, she was warned.  She was warned and now she persisted.  So yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nevertheless, she persisted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  T-shirts have been made already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, God.  It works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Resist, persist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Resist and persist.  And then of course all the women who persisted like, like, Susan B. Anthony and Sojourner Truth and on and on and on.  Alright.  Just another thing to wear when you go to that next march.  Let's see, what else?  Facebook launches fake news filter in France.  Actually, that's because the French have an election coming up.  An election coming up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So yes, Facebook and I think Google is working on this too.  So yeah, they're doing cooperative stuff there.  So that shows they can do it.  Getting ahead of it.  They can do it.  Well, yeah, that shows they're doing what they did here and they're trying to get ahead of it this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it just my Facebook feed or has Facebook, at least the way I see it, has replaced to some degree Twitter as a newsfeed?  Facebook no longer is pictures of doggies and my friends' new babies as much as it is news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's also learning about you.  Is that because of me?  Yeah, I had an off the record meeting with a bunch of product people on Facebook a week ago.  Fascinating.  Absolutely fascinating.  But one thing they said that I think is one of the phrases they use is news whales.  Am I a news whale?  Yeah, you're a news whale.  And if you're in some news whales will end up 95 percent of their feed will be news.  Some people will have zero news in their.  Oh, interesting.  So it's just me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that like casino whales?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, but you hope it's not like the news whale and the fail whale are cousins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I get, you know, I still get a few things, but a lot of a lot of political.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's also just the times and the politicization of our friends and people are talking about this stuff and they're making jokes.  You know, I have my new hip hop name, EZD.  You know, it's a lot of here's Dan Lyons with an EZD joke.  So it's just it's just the topic, you know, of the moment across tons of conversations.  So I don't think it's just the personalization.  I think it's what people were talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's kind of interesting.  I mean, boy, if nothing else, we're seeing how important social media has become to the body, politics, to the to the national discussion.  Is it a good thing?  I think it's a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All in all.  But I think that the issue we have now is still the civility problem.  I mean, I mean, I well, the civility problem and the echo chamber slash filter bubble problem, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because you have people unfollow.  People don't agree with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So here's let me try this idea out on you.  So what I think is what the Internet enabled first was speaking.  What it didn't enable was listening.  And everybody's good at speaking.  We can all speak now.  Everybody can yell up and speak.  And there's no conversational requirement, really.  Right.  You can go on and shout and that's the architecture.  That's the architecture of the of the thing.  Yeah.  And how we find better conversational mechanisms.  I mean, Zuckerberg, when he wrote his 13th birthday bar mitzvah post about about Facebook, I'm assuming it's male.  You know, talked about the goals and talked about it.  And I think I think Facebook has a lot more opportunities.  It's barely begun to connect us in meaningful ways and introduce us to strangers and encourage us to have conversations that are civilized.  And I think there's a lot a lot more it can do that it's it's still yet young.  But the problem is that we don't listen well as a society.  We shout well, because that's the opportunity we have now.  But then you're not heard.  That's frustrating.  So you shout louder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's a function of the media.  And I think it's probably a function of the media being dominated more by punditry, a certain yeah, punditry, a certain personality.  I mean, if I think about like why I was thinking about this in relation to Donald Trump and the idea that the Defense Department might take space in the Trump Tower in comparing that in my head to what happened when Hillary and Bill were like leasing out the Lincoln bedroom.  And when I don't don't kill me, Jeff, I'm just thinking about what drives the aggravation behind all of these and why one might be OK to the other, but not the other is is the people yelling about it on cable TV, to be honest.  I think so. I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I listened to a really great interview.  Alec Baldwin's podcast.  Here's the thing is so good.  And a couple of months ago, he interviewed.  Oh, Bob, is it Bob Garfield?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, the media critic.  He's media critic.  And he said he's very funny.  He's very good.  And he says, I stay away from all cable news shows because they're not journalism.  They're punditry.  He says there's not that many news stories to fill a 24 hour news cycle.  So what it mostly is, and he's absolutely once he said it, I thought, oh, he's right.  And what happens is you watch the cable news network that follows your that feeds your vision of the world and and and it becomes a nonstop stream of kind of conformational bias that just solidifies you and your thoughts.  And I said, I think it would be good for all of us to turn off the cable networks, you know, read newspapers of record, maybe, but not, you know, where there's actual news.  But isn't Facebook, it's kind of the same thing now.  It's just this confirmation bias.  So Facebook is with your friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would say, though, the problem is.  So Rachel Maddow, yes, she has a very definite political bent.  But earlier on, especially she did a lot of things trying to explain how stuff worked to people.  And I think people just don't want to you don't want to sit and watch that on the television when you're tired from working a day's work, because it's hard to think.  I beg to differ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am trying to break this.  I got addicted.  And I had these channels on 24 seven.  All the time for the last three or four weeks.  And I realized I was getting, you know, a drip, an intravenous drip.  And I just have to cut it off.  Not because I don't want I'm not engaged.  I don't want to engage.  I do want to engage, but I don't think it's helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I went off Twitter this weekend and I felt much better on Sunday evening.  Welcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just because I watched Twitter nonstop during the Super Bowl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, see, it was fun, frustrating because I wanted the other guys to win.  Oh, sorry, Jeff.  It's OK. So I put up.  So this happened to me.  So I put up a tweet.  I was having fun, I thought, and I learned that Pat's fans and Trump's fans have a high Vendee diagram overlap.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Because Tom Brady.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly.  So I put up a post that said, you know, trying to be humorous doesn't work terribly well in those circumstances.  I put up a post on Twitter that said tonight, all right thinking, decent, civilized, intelligent, Democratic Americans are from Atlanta.  And then I put up a post at the loss and I said, God hates us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I saw God's hate sense.  I didn't see the previous one.  And I was very puzzled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Somebody somebody put that together in a gift for the purposes of having lots of frog people come after me.  And it got that that gift got retweeted by America's best known Nazi.  Oh, you're kidding.  Spencer retweeted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Got a.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So so what it meant was probably got started again.  I hope that there's no Venn diagram overlap with twig fans.  Please, please don't tweet this, folks.  But what happened was my Twitter feed was useless for 36 hours.  Useless because it was nothing.  But you've got to be very careful.  Tears and all this stuff.  You don't want to stimulate that conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When that happens, you just got to log off and grab your little A-fib card.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So yeah, there's a new gesture in town.  So so I went.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, I went off Twitter as a result.  I was forced off Twitter for 36 hours.  And yeah, in a way, Stacey, you're right.  I kind of felt better.  Why did I go back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel better when I leave social media and I'm going to atlant social media and cable news and I'm going to put them together and turn them off.  And life is so weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The thing Twitter Twitter now says they're going to try to do some things to make this better.  I think it's it's I saw that announcement.  Quixotic.  It comes back to hiding from you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  The crap.  The crap that's going on around you.  Yeah.  That doesn't work.  No.  Somebody.  So I took somebody did something awful.  I won't say what it is.  And so I sent it.  I thought, well, what the hell I sent it to Twitter and they responded quickly saying, screw you, Jeff.  Really?  What do you have to do?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  What do you have to do to violate Twitter's rules?  Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I guess I should read the rules because lately Twitter has does seem to be both more helpful and less helpful.  I think it depends who you get.  How many people do you think they have?  I mean, there must be thousands working in the abuse department.  Facebook says we can't monitor all posts for racist language.  We don't have the means.  This isn't a German court case.  Is this even credible?  I mean, can't don't they see every post?  How hard would it be to write a filter?  Well, you don't know what's racist and it changes all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, there are certain things that, yes, you could screen for.  But, you know, if you screen for the word Nazi, that might preclude historical documentation.  Well, or somebody saying, you know, yes, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what I did, by the way, instead of watching cable news a couple of nights ago, I watched downfall again, which is that great German language story of Hitler.  With the actual dialogue?  With the actual dialogue instead of the meme dialogue.  But, you know, there's a wonderful moment, and I wish I had a way of clipping this and posting on Twitter, when Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda minister, is confronted by a general who says, you've got to stop the Volksstürmer.  These are the the the citizenry that Hitler mobilized in the last days of Berlin to defend Berlin.  Children, women, old people, people who weren't in the army.  And the general comes, you've got to stop these guys.  They're being slaughtered in the streets.  And this is what I want to clip, is Goebbels saying, well, I have no pity for the people.  We have a mandate.  They knew what they were voting for when they voted us in.  And I thought, that's kind of a nice quote.  I'm listening to Volker Ulrich's biography of Hitler right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, good stuff.  There are some interesting historical.  And it is good.  There are.  There are.  And what it shows you that that resistance matters, that when you give up on the resistance,  it's an issue.  But it also shows it was fascinating.  I didn't quite realize this.  I mean, the the the language in after Weimar was quite clear.  Democracy is bad.  We're going to get rid of democracy.  The world wants a dictator.  And that was what they said.  Get rid of the press as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The media, the newspapers that were reporting on all of this.  And they said, you know, and the very, very first thing Hitler does after the Bihar pooch  and goes to jail.  But the very first thing they do is shut down the Munich newspaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Have you seen the Alt POTUS 45 Twitter handle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's brilliant.  There's one today right now.  Day 18.  Have a no dick wads allowed rule of the DOJ told McConnell that he's a low life POS sent  Bill to Nordstrom's for sensible heels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I've been trying not to read Twitter.  Jeff, do you mind?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's what I'm going to recommend.  You do this.  This will make you maybe feel better.  Plus, it's a damn good movie or darn good movie.  I found the Eyes on the Prize, the PBS documentary.  Is that a great movie for breaking?  Awesome.  You can stream it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You couldn't watch it because the Martin Luther King.  Right.  State said, well, you can't broadcast that without paying us because I have a dream speech.  I guess they've backed down on that because Eyes on the Prize is back and it is well worth  watching.  And while you're watching that, watch 13th on Netflix, which is the history of the 13th  Amendment, which I was trying to remember earlier.  And it is a damning, a damning but brilliant documentary on racism and the history of racism  in America.  You know what else I watched?  A couple of Steve Bannon documentaries.  That was fun.  Oh, you watched them?  I was very curious.  This isn't really for this show.  So after the show, I'll tell you what I learned.  You want to hear?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got an update on the Lifeline data that I did some reporting for you.  Yes.  Would you like to know the details?  Please.  So according to Mark Wigfield, a FCC spokesman, there are over 900 Lifeline providers and  they are all allowed to offer broadband.  We don't have a number of how many do at this point.  The program is at a transitional stage right now.  Eventually, all Lifeline providers will have to offer broadband in order to get the support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  So then I think Ajit Pai's statement is accurate.  That is to say that the nine they were shut down, shuts down the broadband Lifeline project  is not accurate.  So I want to retract that and correct myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there you go.  And do you want the further information from them on the details here?  A distinguishing feature of the nine going back for further review, which is what happened,  is they were cleared by the FCC to be nationwide Lifeline broadband providers.  So they didn't get designated state by state.  And the tribal lands people, they said, we want to have the states have challenged that  portion of the order saying the states, not the FCC, can approve providers.  So now you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you.  I appreciate your work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My email.  My 22nd email to the spokesman at the FCC.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, really?  That's how you got that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, reporting, actual reporting.  So impressive.  We're not worthy.  No, we're not.  We're old and not worthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not a good pundit.  I can only report.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's something we've needed on this network for a hell of a long time.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there you go.  Thank you.  Facts.  Facts.  That's my weakness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  And I admire that greatly.  I really do.  Twitter's head of diversity is leaving, but that's another matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who's I think the chef in the kitchen is leaving too.  I think everyone's left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The chief HR officer has already left this according to TechCrunch.  The VP of diversity inclusion.  I think it's great that they had a VP of diversity inclusion, but he's left for personal reasons.  She's left.  Oh, no.  Renee Atwood, the human resources officer has left for personal reasons.  We don't know why Jeffrey Simonoff, the diversity guy.  He came from Apple where he was director of worldwide inclusion and diversity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Twitter's stock's up today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I've been noticing it going up.  Even when the stock market's been going down, it's been ratcheting up.  I don't hear any more sales.  It has to be a sales thing.  It has to be the market knows about some sort of or maybe Jim Cramer pushed a button.  Yeah.  By Twitter.  But it's been going up pretty steadily over the last week.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Not sure why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you see Amazon has hired this is one of your numbers.  One hundred and ten thousand people last year.  I know.  It's amazing.  Most of them.  One hundred and ten thousand.  Poorly paid.  They hired one hundred and ten thousand people.  A third of their workforce in one year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What I wonder is how many of those are warehouse.  They've got to almost all be delivery.  Yeah.  You know, I'd love to know what the what the kind of employment percentages is are of Amazon  in terms of, you know, engineering, science, marketing versus warehouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they ain't working at the new Amazon Go store.  Apparently, the Go store should be called a ghost store because you only need as few  as three employees and a max of ten to this is the store where you just go in, pick up  what you want and walk out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Though did you see Bezos mocked a report that he was going into the grocery business big  time saying on Bezos' Twitter feed he mocked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there it is.  Why would why would he want to do robot run supermarkets?  Well, because you did one, Jeff.  Oh, well, now he knows.  I mean, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are all of those employees?  Were they all full time or were some contract?  Oh, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, who knows?  I don't know.  Oh, I'm sure that were contract.  Let's see.  You asked the tough questions.  At any given location, a max of 10 human employees.  Wait a minute.  This is the New York Post.  I'm not sure I trust this.  They plan to use six people per shift on average with Amazon relying on robotic automation and  software to most of the heavy lifting.  But that kind of makes sense because that's the whole point of it, right?  How Google fought back against a crippling IOT powered botnet and won.  Stacy, Stacy, tell us, are we safe?  This is actually the Krebs on security story.  Port, I feel so bad for Brian Krebs, who is a great security reporter for years at the  Washington Post.  Then he went out on his own, does a great blog.  He was doing excellent reporting on the various, which one was it?  It was on, I can't remember.  He kind of blew the lid off of one of the hacking groups.  As a result, his site was taken down by a massive sin flood, 130 million packets a second.  Then up to an even stronger attack using the Mirai open source botnet.  That was the one that brought down the DNS, DynDNS servers.  This is a botnet that takes advantage of hacked routers and Internet of Things cameras.  Internet enabled cameras.  At one point, 140 gigabit per second attack.  Holy cow.  Google jumped in and used, they have a service called Project Shield.  Project Shield?  Yeah.  Designed to protect news, journalists, and human rights organizers from digital attacks.  It's basically DDoS protection, but it's free to those people, which is awesome.  Krebs was able to use it to mitigate the DDoS attacks because Google has more bandwidth than the bad guys.  He was on Akamai.  He was on Akamai and they brought it down.  Akamai pushed him off saying, you're killing our network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To be fair, Akamai was hosting him for free.  This was actually economically not viable for Akamai.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The way you survive a DDoS attack, the reason these work is because you can forge your origination.  If I sit here, initially it worked because I could forge my origination.  If I'm sitting here firing a million packets a minute at you, I have them all with random IP addresses.  That was the raw sockets technique.  More recently, because of these massive botnets, people don't even care.  They don't bother because you take down one, you still have a hundred million other Linksys routers aimed at you.  The only way to mitigate in both cases is just to put a big pipe there because the way they work is they jam the pipe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google is saying that they have a terabit of spare capacity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're being flooded, you just have to have a bigger pipe than the flood.  There's no other way to do it.  My information is a little out of date, but a SYN flood, the way the web works is when I open my browser and say go to Yahoo.com,  I send them a synchronized packet, which is basically a knock on the door saying I'd like to have a conversation.  Yahoo sends an ACK back and then we have a back and forth conversation, which mostly includes me downloading content from Yahoo servers.  The way these DDoS attacks work, one way these DDoS attacks work is with a SYN flood where they knock, but they don't care if you respond.  No website can afford to not respond. That's how people get on the website.  Every single one of these knocks, as you know, SYN packets, you have to respond to.  The website very quickly can be overloaded.  No website is designed to handle a million requests a second.  But if you're behind a giant shield, we use a similar service, I won't say from home, but if you're behind somebody with a lot of pipe, you can handle it.  All those SYN packets come into you. What happens is the DDoS protection holds them.  It sees them, holds them, and then dribbles them out so you can respond to them so it can hold back the wall.  And what that generally means is that response from the site is slower, but it's not dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you outlast them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you outlast them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Someone in the chat room said that Akamai was not hosting Brian Krebs. They were offering for free. They were offering DDoS protection for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that is a point.  And one of the things that's gotten worse is besides these botnets, which is a big one, using IoT devices that are not well secured.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, let's stop calling them IoT devices. I'm serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cameras and routers in the case of Mirai, but it's anything that's on the net could be used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so, but yes, but 90% of what we think of when we think of IoT devices are things that are actually very small and not likely to be useful in these attacks because they don't have the capacity or the compute power.  So your thermostat is going to be a really crappy element for a botnet attack because it doesn't have any bandwidth.  It's limited. So I think that's an important thing to say to people because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not convinced of that.  Because remember, they make it up in volume.  So if your thermostat could send one packet out every minute, it's okay if I've got five million of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My thermostat is sending its one packet out every minute to Nest. So Nest filters it there.  Because it's well designed.  Well, okay, yes, but also something like my light switch doesn't have the compute power inside to run a bot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the way Mirai works is it infects the router, which does have RAM and processor and so forth.  It sits in RAM and basically takes the route over. It says you got a new job now.  And obviously that would be a lot harder to do with a thermostat or a light or a switch.  I'd hesitate to say it couldn't be done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not saying it couldn't be done, but it's not, I guess, economically efficient from a capacity or effort standpoint.  Well, not while there's things like routers and cameras lying around.  Cameras and DVRs lying around.  Those things have been out forever, like a decade or longer.  So, okay, that was my...  I know, because you like the Internet of Things.  It's not just that I like it. It's that there are legitimate security woes about these devices.  And we're not talking about those.  We're talking about something that is far removed from what the problem is today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. But it does argue for all devices that are on the Internet to have be an updateable firmware,  passwords that are not hardwired in, things hardcoded in, things like that.  And these routers were like that. And as a result, they were commandeered.  And there's also another issue. Some of these attacks are using an amplification.  And those are really scary because somebody doesn't have to have a lot of bandwidth.  Your Nest does not have to have a lot of bandwidth.  It merely needs to send a ping to an appropriate server.  Often, it's... I mean, of late, it's been NNTP servers, the time servers.  But there are presumably other servers out there and create a flood.  So what you do is you ping the time server with a forged IP address, Brian Krebs IP address,  and you say, send me everything you know.  And then the time server floods Brian's IP address with crap.  So that's another kind of attack, an amplification attack that is also very widespread.  And that argues for Internet software like the NNTP server software to be kept up to date.  That sad story of NNTP is it's one guy who's maintaining that and not paid by anybody.  And he can only do so much to fix this stuff.  I'm sure he's fixed that bug because that was a well-known amplification attack.  All right, we should wrap this up.  I'll tell you what, I'll give each of you a choice of one or two stories you'd like to make sure we get in.  You first, Stacey.  Anything I missed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is... I have two.  You want to talk about Visio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I could talk about Visio.  I'll bring that one up. You got two. I'll bring that one up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK. One is... and I'm only bringing this up because you mentioned this device.  So I thought it was worth adding to this. Plus, it's a cool feature.  The Logitech... is it the Zero Touch?  Yes, I have it.  Dashboard mounting system?  Yeah.  So now it is connected to the Amazon Echo.  And yes, when you wave your hand in front of it, if it's set up and you've enabled the skill,  you can actually ask the Echo anything you want in your car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No! I got to get it back out.  Yes! Go play with it.  So it puts an Echo in my car.  Yes.  So this little thing is a magnet. You put a little plate on the back of your phone, Android or iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Play Discover Weekly Playlist on Spotify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can wave your hand at it. And there's always been a few things you could do.  But now you could do anything that the Echo does?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I believe so, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice. Because I bought Amazon Unlimited Music.  What would you like to say to Lisa?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well then you, my friend.  I'm on my way.  The whole joyous thing ahead of you.  Oh, yes. Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It works pretty well. I don't keep it in there because both my cars have their own voice stuff.  But nothing as good as Echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the Tesla. I'm constantly like, oh, if only I could ask she who shall not be named.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I do. Like Tesla, you can say because it has Slacker, you can say, I did that on the way in.  Play medieval music. And it has radio stations. So you can say that.  What?  Yes.  I like medieval music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just like, that was not what I was expecting.  And it's also very different than mine's like play Justin Bieber's greatest hit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, you would like the medieval music I got because it played a nice, you know, medieval concert.  And then it played Drake.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you might like it.  I might. You're right.  I think it's because that song Drake said, I'm going to go all medieval on your ass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, Google. Play medieval music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's a Google Play music station called Folk Metal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Folk Metal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is even what even is Folk Metal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's awful.  I gave my love a jerry that had no stone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, Google.  Next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no more folk metal.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's like that's like  that's like drop the drop.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's Patrick Norton's favorite music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, stop it.  Stop it.  Stop.  Okay, Jarvis, stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. Your other is an echo skill because I wind about this.  And then so I went I had to go find something for me.  This is called Sergeant Tabata.  T-A-B-A-T-A.  And last week, I think it was that I was talking about high intensity interval training and I needed a timer.  Well, holy cow. This does it.  This is a it does.  Oh, you can do custom intervals.  It's an interval timer.  So I'm like, hey, she who should not be named, you know, start Sergeant Tabata.  And then it's like, do you want to custom or do you want it every, you know, 20 seconds on 10 seconds of rest?  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does he go, hang him up, drop and give me 20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is all of the echoes fitness things, including the seven minute workout drive me nuts because it's always the same voice and it's so chill.  And sometimes when you're exercising, especially if you're going to be trying to go all out for 20 seconds, it's hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're kind of like, yeah, you need to be driven.  I need a little more.  Yeah.  My my trainer is a former Marine.  You would like him.  I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like anybody who's like, oh, oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, Jeff, your story.  So I just put this up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's kind of cool.  So Lufthansa held a in honor of New York Fashion Week held a fashion show flight.  So on the flight, you had the it was a runway.  And see, this is one thing I actually don't like about modern flying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They they they I hate it.  They do the announcement saying we have a lovely catalog full of wonderful things and they go down the aisle on some airlines and try to sell you crap.  This is just one way to do that.  Now you have models walking by you.  What's the wrong with that?  I don't like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just want to keep my head down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff, are there any hot male models out there?  I'm sorry, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are there any hot male models?  Because if there are not maybe I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There might be.  I don't know.  I forget whose there was whose line it was.  They had a line they were doing.  All right.  Well, never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So much of my friends didn't Lufthansa just do a big collaboration for new uniforms or was that somebody else with like high fashion designer?  Hold on.  They might have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They might have.  I forgot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ivy Reveille.  All right.  Give us a number.  A number.  A number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One thousand three.  So last weekend, meetup held a three day hackathon.  But there was a meetup a thon where they decided to enable a thousand resistance meetups.  Sorry, it's political, but that's where it is.  And in combination with the likes of ADL, Amnesty International, Planned Parenthood, Human Rights Campaign, and they're using it to get people together.  I found kind of interesting.  Nice.  Stacy Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got something for us?  Oh, those are my things.  Oh, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I gave my things early.  I saw.  Oh, you already did your things.  Oh, I see.  Those are things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I wasn't thinking.  So what were your things?  Just remind me.  Sergeant Tabata, the new Echo skills.  OK.  And then the update on the good Logitech zero.  Oh, are those acceptable to you?  They're.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I will give you a pass, young lady, this time.  OK, because I have a pen that erases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mine is just for all the lovers out there.  Netflix last two years ago for Christmas did a very strange, a very merry, very Murray Christmas with Bill Murray.  You remember that?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I know what you're going to say.  They got one now for this one.  This for Valentine's Day.  For Valentine's Day, it's a Michael Bolton Valentine's Day special, but it's tongue in cheek.  It actually is available now on Netflix for streaming.  If you're it's put together by the folks who did who are Lonely Island.  Right.  So it's going to be funny.  In fact, up because guess who plays Kenny G.  Let me see if I can find the the trailer for Michael Bolton's.  I'm watching it tonight with my honey and her new sport bra.  Let's see.  No, that's right.  We're not doing that.  Diamonds, diamonds and her new diamond.  You want to see the apparently there's a giant eagle involved.  It's very tongue in cheek.  This Valentine's Day, spend the evening with the world's greatest lover.  I'm Michael Bolton.  I've been waiting for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I believe in two things.  One ghosts and two that there's somebody out there for everyone.  The good thing is.  Can every day be Valentine's Day?  I think this looks pretty funny.  So if you're not making love already, you will be soon.  Fred Armisen's in it will Fort Sarah Silverman.  That's how I found out about Sarah tweeted this morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Michael Sheen, Maya Rudolph, Adam Scott, Chris Parnell is one of my favorite fake doctors ever.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What is that sound?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  What is that sound?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Andy Samberg as Kenny G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why do you care so much about this stupid holiday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  I think this is what's been missing in Valentine's Day all these years.  What the f*** is going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the tale of Captain Jack Sparrow.  Anyway, you get the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what I'll be doing tonight.  I hope you'll be doing something equally lovely.  Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for joining us for this week in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacey Higginbotham from Stacey on IOT and the IOT podcast at IOTpodcast.com.  Akiga Stacey on the Twitter.  Thank you, Stacey.  Have a wonderful evening with your June Oven.  Me and the June like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It feeds you.  Like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's my Valentine's Day gift for Andrew right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, right there, baby.  And thank you, Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I forgot. I almost forgot.  So I wore this t-shirt in honor.  F8 registration is now open.  Oh, is that an F8?  Is that a Facebook F8?  It's an F8 t-shirt, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice.  It doesn't clear at all.  They have t-shirts too.  They do good t-shirts.  Are you going?  I hope so.  Will you cover it for us?  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right.  Remember last year I had to sit on the floor.  I know.  That was awesome.  So I'm going to get decent Wi-Fi.  That was awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't talk about the Vizio's, but we did it yesterday on Security Now so you can listen  to Steve Gibson's take on it.  The Vizio TV apparently, Vizio has settled with the FTC since 2014, been gathering information  about everything you've been watching on TV.  And selling it.  And selling it.  Although, as I pointed out to Steve Gibson, I remember 15 years ago being offered that  same data from TiVo.  Presumably everything that knows what you're watching has some value and everything that  knows it is probably selling it to somebody.  The Vizio did something quite clever because it's not like a TiVo.  It's not a tuner, but most people don't.  So it would do pattern matching to the pixels on the screen to figure out what you were  watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is actually really interesting technology.  It's clever, isn't it?  I mean, a grace note for TV shows would be really, like Comcast should really get up  on that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, they've consented to create with the FTC.  They're not going to do it anymore and they're paid a $2.2 million fine.  But I got to tell you, I would guess that any device you connect and watch TV on is  probably collecting.  Why wouldn't they?  It's collecting that information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, wait, stop, Leo.  Stop, Leo.  So many of your devices, like Netflix collects that information.  The difference with Vizio is three things.  One, they didn't tell people about it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's one of the things they have to do in the consent decrees, tell people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Two, they collected data not just on its TV, but anything watched over that TV, unlike  a service like Netflix or Roku Box, right?  Which is only collecting data from what you're doing there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but Roku watches across a bunch of services, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It puts your data with your IP address, which is the worst.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  I agree with you.  The data should always be anonymized.  And I'm sure the TiVo data that we got didn't specify, oh, Stacey watched and rewound this  episode over and over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey watches Buffy whenever she's sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And who doesn't after all?  Hey, thank you everybody.  It's been a great show.  Thank you, Stacey.  Thank you, Jeff.  Thank you for watching.
