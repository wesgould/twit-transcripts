Hello Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hello, great to be here.  Nice to see you.  Good to see you too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On the other side, we have Mr. Jeff Jarvis,  who today is in Stockholm, Sweden.  Hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are you doing in Sweden?  I'm speaking at the Web Days Conference.  It's a different word in Swedish,  but I can't say it, tomorrow.  And so I'm over here,  one of my favorite cities on earth.  I actually, I'll tell the story tomorrow,  but I actually came here the first time  after having visited the first Ikea in America.  Wow.  And I said, any country that can make this,  I gotta go see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I love it.  Well, he's in, what, tell us the name of the hotel,  cause you're getting incredible bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, this is the Scandic Grand Central Hotel.  They're nice enough to have me in a conference room  where I'm getting 58 down and 72 up.  And I'm not pink people, I'm not pink.  There's no buffer bloat either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the best, I mean, I can't believe the quality,  this is fantastic.  This is better than satellite.  We should all move to Sweden.  All our hosts should live in Sweden from now on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff is a professor of journalism

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  at the City University of New York  and the author of Public Parts and blogs at buzzmachine.com.  We also have a guest in studio with us,  which is really nice,  Bradley Forrest, hello Bradley, Brady, not Bradley, Brady.  I added an L.  Good to see you, Brady.  From O'Reilly, he is also responsible  for the O'Reilly Location Conference,  the Weir Conference at weirconf.com,  normally in Seattle, but down here,  and it's nice to have you.  Thanks. Welcome.  Appreciate you coming in.  Location is big, isn't it?  Holy cow.  Yep, and Google is a big part of it.  Yeah, no kidding.  In fact, you got a Google map  right on the front of your website.  But also everything else.  So we'll talk a little bit about that as well.  But before we go much farther, breaking news,  I think a huge story,  Zynga just bought OMG Pop for $200 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Henry Blodgett says they left $800 million on the table.  Really? You think it's a billion dollar company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OMG Pop is an interesting company  because they've been around for some time  making apps that hadn't really gone anywhere.  And then they made something called Draw Something,  which came out-  Last week was a Sunday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I watched you play it for an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I played it on the air for an hour.  It's one of the most fun things ever.  The idea is it's kind of pictionary, basically.  I mean, there's nothing new under the sun.  They give you a word.  It's the Merv Griffin style of gaming,  in which really the game is trivially easy  and makes you feel good about yourself.  Merv designed Wheel of Fortune  so that the contestants on screen were incentivized  to be slow solving the puzzles.  The longer they went, the more they'd make.  And it was brilliant because people at home  would solve them immediately  because they were stupidly easy.  And all the viewers go, I'm so smart.  And I'm smarter than that guy.  Unlike Jeopardy, which makes you feel stupid,  Wheel of Fortune makes you feel smart.  Hence Merv Griffin, multi, multi, multi-billionaire.  OMG Pop, same thing.  It's a very simple game.  They give you words.  You can choose an easy word or a hard word.  You draw the word.  Somebody has to guess it.  And they even get Wheel of Fortune style letters  to choose from.  And it's fun.  You cannot really go wrong with it.  It's a lot of fun.  Even if you can't draw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you paired randomly or a stranger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There it is.  You can choose your friends.  See, nobody draws that well, by the way.  Even my mom, who's an artist,  her stuff looks like stick figures and crap.  And that's the other thing.  Because nobody on a,  now it's on Android, it's on iPhone, it's on iPad.  But anybody's drawing with their finger.  Can't draw.  Nobody draws, you know,  you can't draw well even if you're an artist.  Well, plus they feed you the letters like Jeopardy.  It's very, couldn't be easier.  Wheel of Fortune, couldn't be easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Leo, you have a spin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have a phablet.  You do.  Well, and that's, I have a little advantage.  Unfortunately, I'm still a crappy artist,  but I can play it on my note with my spin, my S-pen.  And so I'm not drawing with a finger.  I'm drawing with a pressure sensitive stylus.  And still my stuff looks stupid.  So there's no excuse, frankly, for how badly I play.  But it is, it's a fun game.  It's actually more fun on the iPad just because it's bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to say the bigger screen  kind of gives you a little bit of an advantage, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, but then you're drawing with your fingers.  Right.  Anyways, $200 million.  And that's the funny part.  They could have gotten a billion, you think?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so it's, let's see, Simon Califf,  CEO of mobile analytics firm Flurry,  according to Henry Blige, it says that it's so way too early  leaving 800 million on the table.  Is that nuts, asks Henry?  Based on draw something's early growth, no, it's not nuts.  But of course, that's just their one big success.  It's six weeks old.  Top app in 79.  Six weeks old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Basically, they made $200 million in six weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, top app in 79 countries.  Been downloaded 20 million plus times.  Has 12 plus million active daily users.  Generates $100,000 of revenue per day.  That's the interesting number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but the company's been around for a long time.  So it's just like Rovio in that they  had a string of games that didn't really go anywhere.  So it's not like they made 200 million in six weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think that's where the billion comes from  because Rovio is worth a billion.  Oh yeah, but there's characters.  On the strength of one, but there are characters  and they can sell action figures and plushies and pillows.  And a movie.  There's an Angry Birds movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've heard that there's talks.  Of course there is.  But they want to go for like a Disney franchise  around the characters.  It is worth, that's worth a billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wouldn't you go to a theme park with them?  Oh, it'd be great.  If I had a three year old, yeah.  Yeah, or if you're mad, you can throw the three year old.  No, I'm just joking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's an interesting chart from Silicon Alley Insider.  Words with friends, daily active users plummeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Although, I mean, look at that plummet.  Look at the scales of those.  So I mean, there's two, you know,  the scales are totally off there.  Yeah.  But.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, OMG Pop has 12 million active daily users  in six weeks.  But see, that doesn't go forever.  Or does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a bit unfair.  The same story says it took AOL nine years  to hit one million users.  Facebook nine months,  for something nine days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  But that doesn't mean it's the next Facebook or AOL.  No, it doesn't at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's a simple little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, if I'm them, I take $200 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and it wasn't a bad price for Zynga.  They got tons of cash, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was it a, well, I think that's a good question.  I think Zynga might have overpaid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  Well, they got a hit game  and buying a lot of studios.  So they already bought area code in New York  to become Zynga New York.  So this is just adding to that pool of developers.  They have Zynga Seattle.  And it's just, you have a hit game,  pull it into the Zynga fold  and then promote the next game.  Yeah.  It's kind of like cheeseburger  where they kind of acquire new memes.  Right.  Acquire the meme.  They don't just rest their laurels on cheeseburgers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're in the meme acquisition business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I like that a lot, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's why we invited Brady.  We needed somebody.  We needed somebody like him on this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Peter Kafka says,  we'll pay 180 for Draw Something  and 30 million in employee retention payouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, that's the key because you hire these guys.  You want them to do more games for you.  You don't want them to say,  okay, you got OMG Pops, see ya.  Right.  And then 30 million in retention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For how many employees again, was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  How big is it?  Small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then Anthony DeRosa on Twitter says  that Facebook drew 12% of its total revenue  from Zynga in 2011.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's significant too.  And of course, Zynga has started its own web page  where you could play all the Zynga games  minus the Facebook annoying interference  from your friends and all of that stuff.  You just play it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and Facebook is hoping to roll out  the credits program beyond just gaming.  Right.  So hopefully it's dependent on-  Facebook wants to be a global currency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  OMG Pop is a 40 person company in New York.  40 people, wow.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good for them.  I have to say, it is a very derivative game.  It is not anything that people haven't seen before.  There's nothing original in that game, would you say?  Except perhaps the monetization.  It's a free game and they make their money  on in-game purchases, which seems now to be the trend.  Give away the game.  And then, so if you want more colors,  for instance, you start with a very limited palette  of colors, if you want more colors,  you can buy more colors.  But you earn coins as you play,  but most people are impatient.  So this is one of those things where you can,  I never gave them a penny,  but if you want more bombs or more colors  or more other features, you can pay for those.  And that's where they're making $100,000 a day.  But still, 200 million, that's a lot.  That's 2,000, $100,000.  That's two years worth, three years worth,  four years worth, six years worth.  Six years worth of $100,000 days.  I don't know if they're worth that much.  That's a lot of money.  Speaking of, we don't know how much money,  but speaking of acquisitions, it looks like Kevin Rose,  our friend Kevin Rose, and Milk were acquired by Google.  Kevin's first day was Monday.  He got a haircut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did he?  Well, he scheduled his haircut,  according to his Google Plus account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  His on-site Google haircut.  Yep.  He has to fit to be-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  His free cut.  He'd been waiting, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nouglers get, first thing they do, they get a haircut,  and then they go eat lunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like the military, you get a shaved head.  You get a shaved head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And if you're a new Apple employee,  you get the shakedown from the security team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  You get fed disinformation for the first six months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you get to work on non-existent secret projects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, man.  Don't you want to go work for Google?  It surprises me because, now,  there's still a lot of speculation  about why Kevin went for this.  We don't know how much money there was.  The day before the news broke,  they closed down their one and only product at Milk,  which was Oink, which we liked,  but it was not successful.  So they had no successful products.  Also going to Google, Daniel Berka,  who is a great designer, really talented designer,  and he did the dig design.  Not all of the Milk team has been invited  to stick around, however.  That's the way Google acquisitions work.  The two developers moved on.  They didn't want the programmers.  They said, we have plenty of,  this is all rumor.  Google's not saying anything.  They said, according to the stories,  we have plenty of engineers.  We need designers, but that's...  Well, they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They need designers who understand social.  There's...  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, they really do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a big difference.  I never really got into Oink,  but when I heard about it,  it struck me that it was sort of like  plus one everything in the world.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there's a synergy then between them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A little bit, and dig, obviously,  is similar.  Plus one is similar to dig.  But it did surprise me.  I mean, I don't know Kevin very well,  but I know he's big into...  He loves the iPhone.  He talks about how he loves the iPhone.  Milk or Oink was an iPhone app,  and he just posted on Google Plus  that he's looking forward to switching to Android,  which is interesting.  So I don't know if he's on the Android team.  That was the rumors

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that he was gonna go to work for Android.  Now, the original rumor was he would work for Google Plus.  So it's all speculation,  but that sounds like he's gonna be starting to write  for Android, not for iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, actually, I looked that up just now,  and the article that was posted on that on Android and me  says update, nope.  Nope.  And you know what I was thinking about the designer thing?  It's not that Google needs more designers  or needs designers who know social.  They need designers that the devs will listen to.  Because I think that's the...  I mean, it's such a dev-dominated culture there.  And...  So the designers with cred.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  With developer cred.  Well, certainly...  With the product vision

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that they can get through the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kevin is not a designer.  Kevin's just a smart guy.  Daniel's a designer.  He's a great product person.  He's a great...  Yeah.  Well, he's a good...  And by the way, I think Kevin's a good friend.  I offered him a partnership in Twit when we started,  along with Patrick Norton.  He declined.  He had better things to do, which he was right.  But I don't know if...  I mean, Dig was a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oink was a beautiful product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oink was a beautiful product, but I used it for a week.  Yep.  It wasn't very sticky.  I don't know.  It's an interesting thing.  It surprises me because Kevin is also an angel investor.  He took money out of Dig.  He has enough money.  I don't think money is a motivator at this point.  And he's invested wisely, in many cases,  as an angel investor.  It surprises me that he wants a job as an employee.  He hasn't been an employee since he worked at G4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's something about learning.  Going to a larger company,  you get to learn how they do things at scale.  So maybe that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He wants to...  He is a young guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then there's also just the scale  of the products there at Google.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We tried to get Kevin on Twitter.  He wouldn't come on, right?  Yeah.  Did we ask him for him on Twig?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did not ask him for Twig.  Let's see if we get him next week.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Let me ask a question, guys.  Why Dig is where it is and why Reddit is where it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Reddit almost immediately started beating Dig.  I think Dig...  Reddit came after Dig.  Dig was the original idea.  But as soon as Reddit came along,  it immediately started beating Dig.  Just period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What was it that Reddit did better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or did it...  Reddit developed a very active community.  And I think they fostered the community better than Dig.  Agreed.  Dig got so...  Yeah.  And Dig got so gamed so early on  that they had to start taking draconian measures  to avoid gaming.  And that pissed off the community.  It just didn't feel...  It may have been hoisted by its own success,  but it didn't feel as small and tight a community  as Reddit did.  I don't know.  I'm wondering, why did Reddit beat Dig?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dig, they say, became a troll fest.  Subreddits is a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Subreddits are great.  We use subreddits for a couple of our shows.  Tom uses subreddits and I think subreddits are great.  Reddit allows porn.  You know what?  Don't undersell that.  By the way, Google pulled a user-created Reddit app  from the Play Store because of the porn.  I didn't know Google was anti-porn.  I thought they liked porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They restored it though.  Did they?  Oh good, thank God.  They did.  It was automatic.  The NSFW warnings kind of flagged,  I think flagged their review system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Listen, I don't think this is about technical features.  Like, social apps community is its best feature,  bottom line.  I mean, not only the community.  Certainly you have to have product designers  that are listening to the community  and adding in features that help the community  help themselves.  But yeah, definitely about community with Reddit  and good designers helping them along.  Well, I like the subreddit theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because in Digg, they have this sort of semi-war  on their most popular users, like Mr. Baby Man.  Right.  And there could only be one Mr. Baby Man for Digg,  whereas with subreddits, it didn't really matter.  Everybody can have their own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's the essence of scale, isn't it?  Yep.  JC Calhoun in the chat room says that Digg 4 ruined Digg.  I think to some extent, it's true.  There's that jumping shark moment for a company  where a design goes too far or something goes too far.  And I don't really understand the subtlety  of what happened with number 4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody pointed out the irony of the fact  that the Kevin Rose story getting bought by Google  did not make it to the front page of Digg.  Which really tells you something.  Because it used to be if Kevin farted,  Digg would put it on the front page immediately on Digg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've got to admit.  When Businessweek put Kevin on the cover  as the $60 million man, I think it was.  I wrote in my first book that Kevin was gonna be  the next Murdoch, before Murdoch was evil.  Well, wasn't as evil.  And I still have great respect for Kevin.  I like him.  I adore Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think he's brilliant and he's wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think it's a second novel pressure, right?  You come out with Digg and Digg Nation to the side.  And Kevin's personality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Digg Nation was Kevin's greatest success.  I think there's no question that was the greatest success.  It really was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so it's a second act problem.  And so maybe, I agree with the idea that the large company,  but it's also that the pressure of getting milk going  and saying, maybe I don't have a great idea right now.  And to go to Google and learn,  and you're gonna learn in a tremendous amount.  I think it makes sense.  I would still bet, I'll bet Kevin Long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I would too.  I would too.  Although, I shouldn't say this.  If I didn't, if I weren't good friends with Kevin,  I might say that the story here is  how few great designers there are out there  and how hard it is to find talent for a company like Google.  And I think that, to me, that's what this indicates to me.  That they pick up milk, which is not a huge,  it's not OMG Pop.  But of course it didn't sell for $200 million.  I don't think.  But I think they really, good designers, talented people,  people who understand social are hard to find.  And Google needs them.  I am, I'm very jealous of Kevin.  That's exactly it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's a really good move for Google.  I don't quite understand why it was a good move for Kevin,  but good for him.  He's happy. Yeah, exactly.  I do think he's a great product designer.  Oink didn't go big, but it was really beautiful.  It was beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's Daniel right there.  Really talented.  Chris Hutchins, very talented.  Really, it's a good group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What should Kevin do?  What do you wish Kevin would do anywhere at Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Google Plus needs his,  I mean, that was the original idea,  was people thought maybe he'd go to Google Plus.  But you know where he,  I think that the second theory  that maybe rings a little truer is YouTube.  They need somebody, Tim Shea at Next New Networks  is the guy right now who's bringing in content to YouTube.  They need somebody like Kevin,  who's really more of a foreground guy  to cultivate and develop talent.  Oh, I never even thought of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, yeah, so Tim Shea is really training people  how to make good stuff.  Does Kevin become a star there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I think Kevin becomes-  Behind the scenes.  He's not behind, he's a foreground guy,  but it's really about marshaling great talent  and great content to YouTube.  Clearly Google wants to do that,  and that would be a great place for Kevin.  That's something Kevin loves, wants to do.  He brings the hip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does he have a conflict of interest with Rev3?  How's Rev3 doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I believe he has a stake in it.  Is he on the board?  I think he's on the board at Revision3.  I'm not sure.  It was his, he started it.  So I'm not sure what this is.  But that's why the rumor, my thought,  if they do do that,  is maybe they also acquire Revision3.  Because Revision3 is much like Next New Networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you see, I keep arguing here  that Google can't own content.  They may be stupid enough to go do it,  but with Next New Networks,  they're basically sloughing off the shows  and keeping the expertise.  Revision3 is its show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that's not true.  Revision3 pivoted.  Revision3 was a content creator.  They've become a content aggregator.  Their biggest shows now are YouTube stars that they,  just like Next New Networks, that they, like,  what is it?  Epic Meal Time.  Epic Meal Time.  That other guy, whatever.  I'm not a YouTube expert.  What's his name?  Philip K.  DeFranco.  Philip DeFranco.  I think.  Those people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So their value is in what?  Monetizing, distributing, educating, all the above?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and they know how to create content.  They know how to, they know how to,  they're very much like Next New Networks.  That would be the argument against it,  is there's some redundancy there.  I don't know.  Just a thought.  We're gonna take a break.  I think the big story,  or the one I'd love to talk about is,  what the hell's a Wall Street Journal smoking?  They say big time search changes coming to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really?  They just learned how to use it, you know?  That's what all looks due to them.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really?  We've been waiting,  because that story was a week ago.  Still hasn't happened.  Maybe it's coming.  What are they thinking about?

Saying Google is about to make one of the biggest changes  in the history of offering web search.  Semantic smarts, direct answers,  the Bingification of Google.  When?  When did that happen?  Over the next few, maybe it's still gonna happen.  Over the next few months, Google's search engine  will begin spitting out more than a list of blue web links.  It will also present more facts and direct answers  to queries at the top of the search results page.  I admit that's one of the things we talked about  last week, didn't we, Gina?  The calculator and all that.  Yep. Converting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or, I mean, definitions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Definitions. Yeah, one box, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Always have loved that.  So are we gonna see more of that?  Paralines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I've been saying for a long time.  Bradley Horowitz has been saying  that Google is not just gonna be 10 blue links.  He said that months ago.  We've said it on the show ages ago.  Right. We've ordered it.  So what is it?  We've seen Google going to answers.  There's nothing new here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Danny Sullivan did this great, great piece,  just tearing this article to bits, saying exactly this.  There's nothing new here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They already do.  I think you hit the nail on the head  that the journal just started using Google.  And so this is all new to them.  Wow.  I wanna see a piece in the Wall Street Journal.  Find anything on the web fast.  This thing called google.com.  Amazing.  What is Google Squared?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was their old kind of data app  that came out right after Freebase.  And I think Fusion Tables is the successor of that.  They closed it last year.  Yeah, but Fusion Tables is their new one.  It's still in the search.  Well, it's more of a data app that you can use on the side.  So it's where you can gather, visualize,  and share your data online.  So it's a way of making data mesh apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What Danny says is,  my take is that Google is pushing these technologies  for good PR.  In other words, the Google PR people are calling.  Well, that's kind of cool.  Where do I find that?  Fusion Tables.  I'll just search for Fusion Tables.  That Google's PR has been pushing this  kind of in response to the negative coverage  of Search Plus Your World to counter that bad PR.  And places like Mashable and Wall Street Journal  are just saying, yeah, yeah, we'll write a story.  I guess, you know, for real people, it's news maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it does seem like it might've just gone,  PR gone a little bit bad or a little bit out of hand.  Amit Singhal posted on Google Plus saying,  some recent news coverage sparked interest  in where we are and where we're headed.  And he basically said,  we're improving our search every single day.  And we're trying to understand what you mean when you say,  what is the deepest lake in the United States.  Right now, we don't know what you mean by deep  or what you mean by lake,  but we just try to pick a webpage  that gives you the right fact.  We're working toward that semantic search  where we do know what a lake is  and we do know what deep means  and we will be able to give you an answer.  Similar to Wolfram Alpha.  But this is what I love about,  I like that he was just kind of like,  this nothing has changed,  we just decided to talk about it.  I gave an interview and hence the media coverage.  He didn't quite say that,  but that's what he was saying,  if you read between the lines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is what Brad was talking about,  this is the fusion tables.  Gather, visualize and share your data online.  So is it an API to maps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It works really well with maps,  but it's just a way you can,  they have a lot of public data sets  and you can mash them together.  So the data and the map comes from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, public data sets.  I mean, you could also,  AWS has a lot of public data sets.  It's a way of kind of locking you in.  There's a, G-O-I-Q is another company  that does exactly this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if I use Amazon Web Services,  I get access to these special data sets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And thus you don't pay for storage,  you don't pay for transfer.  Even better.  So it's a way of kind of keeping people in the system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Boston Globe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Down the line, you can picture AWS offering geo data  and mapping tiles,  and open street maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This becomes terribly important in news  and I'm trying to work on some grants now  and some projects where,  we just have to make open data about government,  from government about our community  is more of a standard.  And then once you have enough of it,  then you start to get into a critical mass  of saying that you can treat it the same  in a thousand communities.  And it scales.  Right.  And then if you get it in a thousand communities,  then the comparisons you can do  and the higher level of data you can get is great.  And we've just really got to push this.  The problem is the news organizations  aren't that data savvy.  It's hard to find data people  because they think it's a special skill.  But there's great opportunity there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I'm on the fact page for Fusion Tables.  And my favorite one is,  how to work around the JavaScript restrictions  on Google sites.  So if you want to embed a Fusion Table,  here's how to work around.  Here's how to hack.  Here's how to hack Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have those restrictions.  We're so sorry.  We're not going to turn them off,  but here's how you can hack them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And here's how to drop a cookie on an iPhone.  Parata.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How do you feel about hidden forms?  Amit Singhal writing on Google Plus said,  some recent news coverage about Google  has sparked interest in where we are  and where we're headed in search.  Let me just say,  every day we're improving our ability  to give you the best answers.  He does talk about free base as you did, Brad.  So anyway,  I guess I think it's PR.  I think it's Google PR saying,  why don't you write more stories about our answers?  Those are good.  Those are really good.  Somebody else said that the big story  is Mac cuts and backlinks.  So I'm going to search for that.  This is from our chat room.  Apparently Google is going to penalize sites  that use backlinks.  Is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's a backlink?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  Let me see here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whatever it is, it's bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's apparently bad.  And yet here I found a video on how to use backlinks.  What's an effective tool for building links?  I don't know.  What they're talking about is that people  who do too much SEO,  attempt to improve their Gurgle search results.  Gurgle, hey.  Just thinking.  Will be punished for doing too much optimization.  They're changing their algorithm  to punish websites that use unnatural sounding  search engine optimization to increase their page ranking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, question.  The Google bot's going to figure out  when the raising is unnatural for humans  and actually written for the Google bot?  Yes, that's it.  There's some recursion going on there.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  Overly optimized sites.  who do not concentrate on optimization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's no different from being good at being able  to figure out when you're getting pitched a line in a bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true.  It's true.  The Google bot's going to figure out  when he's getting a bad line.  If I had a beautiful website,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  if I told you you had a beautiful website,  would you press it against me?  No.  That's very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey honey, you want to parse?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd like to scan your links.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know your robots.tech says no,  but your website saying yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, yes.  It will target websites that have too many keywords  on a page or keywords placed awkwardly in a sentence.  Wow, I love that.  They just kind of, if you just like,  if you write ungrammatically, you're,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can it punish grammatically incorrect sites as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Too many back links and don't have relevant content  that solves a problem.  I mean, that's hard to do.  This is something a human would do.  The backlink emperor is dead.  Wait a minute, let's, I got an ad here.  This is from justaskkim.com, an SEO.  Apparently she's an SEO.  The backlink emperor is dead.  Long live the backlink emperor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, isn't it bigger that, I mean,  Google will never fully win this,  but the goal is to kill the dark heart of SEO.  Yes.  Kill it.  Yes.  Personalization is the first stab  by the wooden spear in the heart  of the dark wizards of SEO, makes me my horror metaphors.  And constantly just trying, now it's a catch point too.  If you're really good at SEO, I'm not gonna hire you  because you're too good, because it's not gonna work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's blackouts SEO, right?  And there's why, I mean, I think there's nothing wrong  with a blogger or somebody setting up personal website,  making sure their title is set.  You have a site map and you know.  But there's a line of manipulation.  And that is SEO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a line of manipulation.  And that line is constantly moving on both sides.  The spammer finds the new way to do it.  Google comes back and basically what they wanna get to.  And I think you said something important there, Leo,  you're recording that.  It's about trying to become human.  And that's what Facebook and Twitter are is us and human.  And so Google, I mean, you wanna talk about AI,  this is Google trying to get more human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, Google's always said, just make good content.  Make your site useful.  And so what the problem is that a human can determine  that very easily.  We can look at a site that's SEO optimizing,  oh, come on, please.  Or a site that really is genuinely trying  to make good content.  It's hard to do it algorithmically.  And I guess that's, Google, these guys are smart engineers.  And I think they think everything  is algorithmically solvable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they-  I think they're just checking the client lists  of SEO firms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's another way to do it.  You know, that would be the way.  So Matt said this at South By.  This was perhaps the nugget of information  that came out of South By Southwest.  He said that the new penalty be rolled out  in the next few weeks.  There's the over-optimized Matt Cutts.  This Danny Sullivan's panel at South By.  The senior product marketing manager of Bing was there.  Who?  Didn't say-  Stephen Weiss?  Doesn't say the name.  Doesn't say the name.  It was-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, we can say whatever we want about Matt  because he's currently on a news diet.  And I believe that includes Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For the next month, he cannot listen to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he can't listen to us.  So we can just talk about him.  Ha ha!

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How convenient right after South By  in making this announcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's a transcription of Matt's audio.  What about the people optimizing really?  I can actually play it.  Look at that.  How about that?  We have the technology.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This internet thing is amazing.  I forgot the name of our session.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is this gonna be the whole session?  It is.  Doing stuff with the engines.  Dear, being in Google helped me.  All right.  I don't want the whole session.  Here's the relevant paragraph.  What about the people-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm happy to South By flashbacks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're standing out in the hallway  in the convention center.  Right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In 2009, Matt did a video saying  there was no such thing as over optimization.  And he would not penalize it.  Now he's saying, yes, we will.  We will penalize you.  What about the people optimizing really hard  and doing a lot of SEO?  We don't normally pronounce changes.  This is Matt Cutts speaking,  but there is something we are working  in the last few months and hope to release it  in the next months or few weeks.  We're trying to level the playing field a bit.  All those people doing, for lack of a better word,  over optimization are overly SEO  versus those making great content and great sites.  We're trying to make Googlebot smarter,  make our relevance better,  and we're also looking for those who abuse it,  like too many keywords on a page  or exchange way too many links  or go well beyond what you normally expect.  We have several engineers on my team  working on this right now.  His team is the spam fighting team.  So they're basically saying  we're treating SEO over optimization as a spam problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and Matt knows all the SEO guys.  I mean, he was the original Google guy  who appeared in the newsgroups.  And I used to work on Emisen Search.  In fact, that's how Gina and I met.  Yeah, I was at Microsoft.  Microsoft bought a company I worked for,  Mongo Music, which was kind of like Pandora,  back in 2000.  I ended up bounced around for a while  and ended up on Emisen Search.  And I, during like my first year on Emisen Search,  it was before we had launched with the new search engine,  I went to SES, Danny Sullivan's show at the time,  search engine strategies.  And I had a couple come up and yell at me  asking why their lawn furniture site wasn't at the top  of Emisen Search.  And it was at that conference that I realized  that the internet was not a shiny, bright park  and candy land of your intention.  It was my moment of disillusion.  Was that show and working that booth.  The loss of innocence.  I remember the moment well.  Sad moment.  Trying to explain it to them was really depressing.  Happened to me last week, that's why I know all about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought the internet was a bright,  shiny, happy place for a long time.  And then milk was bought?  And then milk was bought and it was all over.  Well, so anyway, I can't say there's anything wrong  with that, everybody knows that.  You go to a site that's doing it, you know immediately.  You as a human know.  We don't want to see those at the top of search results.  So I can understand why.  Why that's happening.  This kind of ties into the new spam box feature.  On Gmail, be careful with this message.  It might contain a virus or malicious file  and then learn more.  Why is this message in spam?  Well, because you marked this before  or it's similar to messages that were detected  by our spam filters.  This is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a really good feature.  I've had a few false positives in the past few weeks.  I pretty much never look at my spam folder,  but I realized that I'd missed an email  and then found that it had been spammed.  And so this new feature will tell you why,  which is helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can you correct it though?  It doesn't have a button saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I assume if you unspan it, that's a learning ability.  Okay.  Or if you respond to it.  Yeah.  You're saying this is important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can say this is not spam.  So if it says the reason why is because you marked  this person as spam before,  you could go back and undo that, I guess.  That would be nice.  Or if it's a link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had the reverse happen this week.  I used priority inbox  and Kickstarter added their new follow feature.  And so I just got slammed with hooray,  blah, blah, blah, I was following you,  which is awesome.  Turn that right off.  I kept unimportanting it and they just kept coming in.  So finally I just created a filter  to remove it from my priority inbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is good.  So here's free trial enlargement sent me a note.  Saucy young college hotties.  And be careful with this message.  Similar messages were used  to steal people's personal information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Also it flagged it as a phishing attempt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because it has a link.  And then you can learn more.  This is good.  Good for Google.  That's a great educational feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they're scanning the links inside messages.  And if they know that one is malicious, they flag it.  I like it.  Yeah.  There's a couple other new Gmail features  that just rolled out.  Minor ones.  The buttons across your Gmail inbox,  you can change the icons to be text labels.  So in fact, just the other day,  I went to go mark a message to spam.  And I was like, which button is it?  It's the exclamation mark icon.  That's like not very clear.  But if you go into settings,  you can change the button labels to words,  which are just easier for people who have bad eyesight  or just forget what the exclamation point means.  And that was one little thing.  And then the other little thing is  that you can label messages before you send them  or as you're sending them.  So if I'm sending Leo a message  and I want to make sure I follow up with him in a week,  I can add my follow up label as I compose it.  Whereas before you had to go label it after the fact.  So it's really neat to see that after all this time.  They're not resting on their laurels.  No, they're not.  Gmail is still getting better.  Yeah, Gmail is one of Google's best products,  I think even better than search in some ways.  So it's good to see that they're still working on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why is this message in spam?  It contains content that's typically used in spam messages.  It's good.  So this is really, this is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I agree with you, Gina,  but I just really do not like the redesign  of the calendar in Gmail.  It's just, it takes up way too much room.  I prefer the older.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got a long email from somebody complaining  that contacts no longer had a call this person number button.  Oh.  Google, it's so funny.  You have such, Google wields such power.  Anything they change.  It affects millions of people.  It affects billions.  I mean, it's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Brady, you mean that the widget inside Gmail,  the calendar widget inside Gmail  or just calendar in general?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Calendar in general.  Yeah.  I mean, I love the calendar widget in Gmail when it works.  I find it's like a 60% time I can add an event.  But no, just the amount of the header has increased  on both of those apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep, right.  Because they added the search box across,  like the unified search box across all the products, right?  So push is, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and yeah, and the black bar.  And the black bar and the sand bar.  They just seem to add a lot of header space  even beyond those items.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a question, geniuses.  So Gmail's been telling me,  asking me the question constantly,  should Gmail be allowed to open these links?  And then I go to the explanation page  and I can't figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, the email to links you mean?  Yeah.  Yeah, so if someone's email address shows up on a webpage,  you can, in Chrome now, and in Firefox as well, I think,  you can say, make Gmail, web-based Gmail,  my default mail handler.  Yes, drives me crazy.  Whoa!  Yeah, so that just means that  if you click on someone's email address,  it'll open up a compose page with the two field filled in.  It's pretty useful.  But it asks you every time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  Oh, it just-  Look, I don't answer it.  Yeah, you have to say, yeah.  That's because the explanation page was awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's asked me several times  because it had many computers, right?  So each computer asks me again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  While I'm on the subject of things that drive me crazy,  when I was going back and forth today  trying to test this with Eileen,  once I get signed, I have two Gmail accounts open, right?  And I have things that string off of them,  reader and plus and so on, out of each one,  different things.  And when I get them both running,  it works fine for a few weeks.  And suddenly, if one thing hiccups,  trying to get them back both running  without killing each other, it just drives me nutty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Google doesn't understand the-  The Switch user dropdown?  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It introduced the heck out of it.  Oh, jeez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, that happens to me as well.  The Switch user works kind of like Brady said,  like 60% of the time, it's great.  It can be signed into an account.  But if one gets signed out  or your cookies get screwed up somewhere  or you go to an app that doesn't support,  like if I go to checkout, yeah, things get screwed up  and then you have to reconfigure.  Now that's not just you, Jeff.  I think that's across the board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I suddenly reminded,  I use a Chrome extension called 2Pain  that I just tweeted to you, Leo, and to Gina  that allows me to shrink the black bar.  So there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow, it's nice and tiny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep, it makes it-  It goes away.  It's really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like that.  We're gonna take a break.  When we come back, $150 Nexus tablet.  Now this is a rumor I like.  We know that $99 was the right price for the HP touchpad.  How much would you pay for a Nexus tablet?  But first a word from Ford,  the Ford Motor Company, Ford Motor from the Ford-  Ford Motor Company.  I called it the Ford Forest the other day.  The Ford Motor Company, ford.com slash cars slash Taurus.  Wants to talk a little bit about some of the technologies  they're putting into their new vehicles,  in particular this 2013 Taurus with curve control.  Actually, if you go to ford.com slash cars slash Taurus,  you'll see a whole bunch of new technologies  in the Ford Taurus.  The adaptive cruise control,  the collision warning with brake support,  the torque vectoring,  of course that great EcoBoost engine we've been talking about.  But let's talk about this curve control  100 times a second, 100 times a second,  every 10 milliseconds,  the car's computer looks at the roll rate, the yaw rate,  the lateral acceleration, wheel speed and steering angle.  It's what it's doing though.  So that's the roll rate, the yaw rate,  the lateral acceleration, the steering angle.  It's trying to figure out if you're oversteering.  If you're trying to turn the car faster than it can go.  And if it says, you know what,  this car is gonna break away.  It immediately takes action, it reduces the engine torque,  it applies four wheel braking,  it slows the vehicle up to 10 miles an hour per second,  wet or dry payment.  The upshot of this, and you gotta watch the video  because there's a really dramatic video of this,  is that your car just corners beautifully,  much more securely.  You don't even know, you don't even know it.  It just does it for you.  I think what happened is as technology improves,  we can make these cars safer and safer and safer.  And it's not building an autonomous car,  it's building a car that helps you drive better.  And I'm just really impressed with how Ford  is putting engineering front and center,  making 21st century vehicles.  If you wanna find out more, best thing to do  but you go drive one at a Ford dealer near you,  or visit the website ford.com slash car slash Taurus  and watch the video of the car with the control  without the curb control, it's really amazing.  Ford.com slash car slash Taurus,  and we thank them so much for their support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I see worlds colliding here,  I imagine Matt Cutts saying to a SEO guy,  you're over-torquing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Break, break.  Leah Busk will join us on triangulation this afternoon,  by the way, four o'clock Pacific, 7 p.m. Eastern time.  She was the founder of TaskRabbit.  It's such a cool story.  She and her husband were talking thinking,  it would be so cool if we could find somebody  to do this chore for us,  what it was, is putting together the furniture.  I can't remember.  It was something like putting together  Ikea furniture or shopping.  And she said, there ought to be an app for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She was also an engineer at IBM, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, oh, she's smart.  So she wrote the software, they put out this app,  and they just recently got it huge.  Was it $21 million in venture capital, something like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, she's great.  She's speaking at Weir, actually.  She's one of our main stage speakers.  I guess it is a location-based thing, isn't it?  Geo component to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure, because you don't want to help her  in New York City doing your shopping  in San Francisco, wouldn't help you.  Waiting for your iPad.  Wouldn't that, oh, that's what you needed.  Oh, I know people who did that.  Pay somebody to get in line for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's more important for the iPhone 4S  than the iPad.  The iPad, you could go right now and get one, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Weir Conference is coming up April 2nd through 4th  in San Francisco.  So Brad is responsible for this conference.  So tell us a little bit about,  I mean, this has just taken off the last couple of years.  When Marissa Meyer was put in charge of location at Google,  then you knew this is important.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, she spoke last year,  and this year we have Brian McDonald, BAM speaking.  And he was one of the co-founders of Keyhole  with John Hanke.  Keyhole is, who, did Google acquire them, right?  Oh, Keyhole is Google Earth.  Google Earth.  So I mean, back in like 2006 when Microsoft,  or when O'Reilly launched this conference, 2005,  we had Brett Taylor take the stage, now CTO of Facebook,  and launched the Google Maps API.  And when Wear was launched,  Google Maps wasn't in the cloud.  I mean, we, like, it was not there.  They were still working on it.  And Google Earth launched at Wear,  Virtual Earth launched at Wear,  Street View launched at Wear,  and this year we've got a lot of great speakers.  Google's gonna be there, Foursquare's gonna be there.  And you know, one of the big things  that we're gonna be talking about is  kind of the place of Google Maps versus OpenStreetMap.  Right now.  Yeah, that's gonna be hot discussion, isn't it?  Very interesting.  It's a big topic right now.  I mean, the way I look at it is Google changed map,  changed the web forever  when they released Google Maps in 2005.  With an API.  Well, with an unofficial API that was hacked  within 48 hours by Paul Rademacher and Adrian Halvati.  And then five months later,  when they released a formal Maps API,  and they completely democratized mapping on the web.  Not the data underneath, but mapping in general.  And suddenly a website could put maps on it.  And then this past fall, they've decided,  they've started adding significant costs  to using their maps.  And that is driving a lot of companies.  StreetEasy, a New York company, Foursquare, another one.  Even Apple.  Well, I think that's a different strategic bet.  They just don't like Google.  I mean, Apple has bought, they bought C3,  they bought PlaySpace, they bought Ali9.  They're gonna do it themselves, in other words.  Yeah.  Well, they bought, so one of the things  that's happening with OpenStreetMaps  is people start to look around, well, wait a minute.  I'm going from free with Google Street, or Google Maps,  to suddenly have to pay, in some cases,  hundreds of thousands of dollars for it.  Right.  Is there another option?  And when they see OpenStreetMaps,  suddenly they're like, oh,  but I can have a little more control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The cool thing about OSM is it's open source.  It's volunteer driven, 400,000 volunteers with GPSs,  or even without, because what you can do  is if you know an area, you can correct the map.  You just sign up for an account and you can say,  that's a one-way street now.  So presumably, with that kind of crowdsourcing,  these would be really reliable up-to-date maps.  The only negative is in sparsely populated areas,  the maps just disappear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I mean, it's competitive with Google.  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And in places, in places.  Certainly in populated areas, no question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They both have their strengths and weaknesses.  Okay.  And I mean, Google has amazing.  Google buys its map data, right?  They used to.  They used to buy from Teli Atlas and Navtech,  which used to be independent companies,  and now they're doing a lot of their own.  So if you look at the bottom right-hand corner  of Google Maps, you can see who the data provider is.  And about a year and a half, two years ago,  they switched over to doing a lot of their own data.  Is that in the process, the Street View process?  In the process, Street View, they've got hundreds of cars  that they send around, and then also Map Maker,  which is an online tool where you can correct streets.  You can correct that dead end where your house is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So in this case, when we look at Petaluma,  where we are right now, that's Google data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep, and Edit in Google Map Maker  is a button right next to it.  Now tell me about that.  Well, if you click on that, you could then.  I can fix it.  Exactly.  A la OpenStreetMap, very similar.  So they have taken on this task of basically  allowing people to change their maps.  Teli Atlas does the same thing.  I think, I'm not sure if Bing does or not.  Well, I mean, Bing Maps has now become  Nokia Maps effectively.  Through the, that was part of the Windows Mobile deal.  Was Nokia took Windows Mobile, Bing,  Microsoft took Nokia Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Brady, is MapQuest still in the play in any way at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As far as I know, they are the second largest  kind of mapping site.  So it goes Google, then MapQuest, and then Bing.  Bigger than Bing?  Yeah, that's my understanding.  It's something like 35%, 30-something percent.  And where does MapQuest Maps come from?  They probably use NavTech, Teli Atlas,  but they also have been investing in OpenStreetMap.  And the founder of OpenStreetMap is now at Bing,  Steve Coast.  Oh, that's interesting.  He went there about 16 months ago.  And so you've got two of the biggest brains  in the geospace.  You've got Steve Coast, and then you've got Blaze,  who created Photosynth.  Maybe you've seen the Ted Talk.  Yeah, that's amazing.  He's one of the chief architects at MSN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's brilliant stuff.  But on the other hand, I love the idea of having an open,  I mean, look, this is our data.  The Earth.  I love the idea of it being open.  What about companies like Foursquare?  Do they obviously create their own database?  You're always adding venues.  Do they then sell it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, not yet.  So they have a large POI database at this point.  Well, Instagram uses it.  Instagram uses their?  When you go to locate on Instagram,  you'll see a powered by Foursquare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that free or are they licensing it?  I wonder.  We don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There'll be, it's free, I think.  And then there's companies like SimpleGeo.  There's interesting stuff coming out in that space.  SimpleGeo is no more.  SimpleGeo was bought by Urban Airship about two months ago,  and the engineers went to Urban Airship.  And Urban Airship is a Portland-based company  that does messaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the idea of SimpleGeo was it was a backend provider  of map information, then they were aggregating data  from all sorts of places.  And so if I wanted to do a new app and I needed that data,  I could sign up and get the SimpleGeo database.  Was Urban Airship gonna continue doing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It doesn't seem like they are.  That's very interesting.  But maybe it wasn't a good business.  Well, down in LA, there's Factual,  and they do a lot of great stuff.  And Tyler Bell, who used to run Geo for Yahoo,  is working for them as a VP.  And then, but the people are really gonna capitalize  on this switch to OSM are Development Seed,  which is a company out of DC run by this guy, Eric Gunderson.  And that's who Streeteasy and Foursquare both used.  And I was chatting with him the other day,  and it's really, like in the past year,  the data's gotten better,  and the open stack has gotten better.  So Leaflets is a JavaScript control for maps.  Mapbox is Development Seed's product  that they serve the maps from.  And then TileMill, which lets you make your own tiles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is there-  What company is that, Brady?  I'm sorry.  Development Seed?  Development Seed, because ThinkUp uses the Google Maps API  and they're deprecating version two and uncharging,  and ThinkUp installs don't get enough views  to go to the charge tier.  But because ThinkUp's open source,  I've been sort of thinking about using OSM.  But I started to look at OSM  and I didn't see a lot of API information.  So is Development Seed offering an API for easy kind of-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah, yeah.  I would go check with them.  I can put you in touch with Eric.  I mean, I'm sure he's-  That'd be great.  The other thing to consider, Gina, is mapstraction.  Okay.  Mapstraction is a JavaScript framework  that lets you easily switch between, say, Bing, Google, Yahoo.  And it's just a framework so that-  Also, it's an abstraction layer on top of the APIs

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that you write to.  And then if Google says, say, we're going to charge you,  you say, well, I'll use Bing,  and you don't have to do anything new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Very cool, very cool.  You know, Foursquare switched to OSM on their website, right?  But not on their mobile apps.  And so that's me signaled, like, oh, the API,  there isn't a good mobile API quite yet.  So in my head, I kind of, you know,  it's like, oh, the API must not be as good.  No, it doesn't sound like that's not the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's a change.  I think it's just a matter of, like,  working through all the bugs.  I think updating a mobile app  that you have to release through Apple  probably takes a little bit longer.  Plus, you know, mobile is their lifeblood.  So the website, they've got to, you know, try it out.  Yeah, try it out.  You know, drive the Lamborghini around for a little while  before you, you know, buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The nice thing that both Apple and Foursquare did,  they made their own tiles on top of the OSM data.  So they actually look beautiful.  The OSM data, it looks like everybody's a map.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's important to realize, like,  Google Maps enables mapping across the web right now.  Right.  And it really did.  It's key.  It's absolutely key.  It changed the web in that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So was it in the end, back to where you started, Brady,  was it a mistake for Google to put a paywall up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It depends on their goals.  I mean, they claim that I think only 1% of sites  will be affected by this.  And gathering all that data is very expensive.  They need to monetize it, I understand that.  They need to pay for it somehow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does feel like a little bait and switch though,  where they will give it away until you're dependent on it,  and now we're gonna charge you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, but without Google,  they would have already been paying tons.  So in some ways, you could look at this  as they're no longer subsidizing a market,  and they're allowing startups to thrive.  One thing that scares me,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and it scares me about OSM when I hear that  their leader went to Microsoft, things like that,  is I remember what happened to CDDB  when it was sold to Gracenote,  and all of a sudden this database  that had been created by users freely giving their time  suddenly became a commercial database,  and in effect, they capitalized on the efforts of users.  Is there anything to guarantee  that OSM data stays open and free?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the licensing is much stronger around that.  Also, I think Microsoft now understands  the value of open and open source,  and if they were to try to take that back,  I don't think they could.  I mean, just the licensing on OpenStreetMap  just wouldn't allow them to do that.  Steve doesn't own that.  So I think it's actually like a great endorsement  for the open model.  And they have to get permission  from the people who contributed the data  to change that licensing.  And at Microsoft, I don't think there's anything  that's gonna change the licensing of OpenStreetMap,  at least by Steve going to Microsoft.  I don't think it has anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, I'd hate to see that happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A number of the other people on the board  of OpenStreetMap would not allow that to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So in a way, now, OpenStreetMap lacks the satellite images.  Those are expensive, and obviously,  you're not gonna do that in an open source free place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but companies like Digital Globe  make the satellite images available  to the OpenStreetMap folks to create new maps.  So OpenStreetMap.  So they start from the satellite.  Well, no, it's more that they can use that in some areas.  They start like in the US, they use the Tiger data,  which was released by US.  But in, say, Haiti, so when Port-au-Prince  had the earthquake, they needed maps.  And so Digital Globe, and I forget the name  of the other company, my apologies, you guys,  immediately sent their satellites there  and then made the images freely available  so that OpenStreetMappers around the world  could create new maps and let people know.  Same thing happened with Katrina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really great stuff, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that was, you know, OpenStreetMap has saved lives.  And the humanitarian OpenStreetMap team  is currently still working in Haiti and in Indonesia.  And actually, I hope to go to play with them this summer.  Neat.  That's really neat. Oh, good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That sounds awesome.  It's a vacation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's what we call vacation.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, that's a fun vacation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a Bradycation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Brady, you are a fountain of knowledge.  That was a crazy second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am fascinated by location.  I think it's really an exciting area.  And I certainly talk a lot about it  as we talk about Google,  because clearly Google understands that,  I mean, look at Eric Schmidt's pants example,  that search is, and tying search to location  really adds to the value of the search result.  Oh, yeah, totally.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I really want, is my phone,  my phone knows where I am.  Right.  I want all the services online  to know where I am based on my phone.  Like, I want contextual,  I want location added to everything  when I want to share it  based off of the smartest server.  You kind of,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, you get some Wi-Fi location based.  You get some, yeah.  But it's very granular.  It's not very granular.  It's very macro.  So moving along,  Nexus tablet, according to Android and me,  the Asus Nexus tablet may be priced as low as $149  for a seven inch tablet.  We know that $99 was enough to sell the HP Touchpad  to millions.  The Amazon Fire selling quite well at $200.  Is this a sweet spot?  Would you run out and buy another tablet for $150?  It's a Quadcore Tegra 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  $150 is very tempting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't even know if they can make it at that price.  Extremely affordable.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's close to an impulse buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Would Google be subsidizing it at that price?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think it's the question.  The question isn't whether we'd buy another one,  though we would.  The question is obviously whether  this would increase the volume immensely.  And let me throw in a new number I just saw.  I won't use as my number.  And I got it because I can't remember the source.  I saw it just before showtime  that activations of smartphones in China  just exceeded those in America.  Wow.  Daily basis, right?  So you start to go back to everything Brady was talking  about mapping, go to the $150 tablet, look at Nokia's.  Why is Nokia still, even though it's on death rows  in our view, why is it still huge?  Because it's cheap, it's inexpensive phones  and it owns that part of the market.  I was just talking with an executive here in Stockholm  and saying we're all iPhone people,  but saying that Android's gonna take over the world.  I think $150 really starts to motivate people  who never would have considered a tablet to get one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you get the Google wage email?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, talk about the final mail in the coffin.  I got that email and I was like,  oh, this is a joke or it must be spam.  Like one of my friends is messing with me.  No, no, like this was the email that went out.  Reminding everyone that Google Wave was shutting down,  Wave with a V, but the from name was Google wage with a G.  So it was a typo in the from.  So the G is right above the V on your keyboard.  But it was just like, I think,  I mean, it seemed like such a sad,  but yet appropriate ending too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like there's one intern responsible at this point.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google wage.  It was a good run Google wage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry, I shouldn't rub it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's okay.  I'm glad.  It's cathartic for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The good news is they are putting spell check in docs.  I don't know if it's related,  but they're gonna have web-based spell check built into docs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cause it's spell check that learns from Google's index.  So if you type, you know, Ickland is in Ickland,  it knows to suggest Iceland for the first Ickland  and Island for the second one.  Wow.  So that's, it's really smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is much better than anything we've seen before.  That is really-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's for the Wall Street Journal to write about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  In six months.  In six months.  I just realized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The email could have come more appropriately  from Google wake.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh.  That would have hurt.  And we have to show time.  It's too far away.  Google wake.  Let's see, what else?  I'm just looking, we have a few more stories  we could get to, or we could take a break  and get our tool tip and number of the week.  I don't wanna skip anything,  but there's an awful lot more privacy probes.  Of course, the Wall Street Journal writing about this.  About this.  You know, they also, by the way,  just so you know that it's not limited just to Google.  The Wall Street Journal had a headline today about Apple.  I got it.  That was actually, let me see if I can find this.  It was talking about the Apple iPad.  Oh, it was a great article.  And it just showed that at this point,  they called Apple faces concern over iPad speed trap.  Video speed trap lurks in new iPad.  I think what's happened is they've told the headline writers  of the Wall Street Journal, please drive traffic  because the story basically says the new iPad's LTE  is so fast you may be tempted to watch more video  than before.  That's the story.  What?  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That makes no sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the speed trap.  That's the speed trap.  Watch out, you might have to spend more money  because it's so fast.  Not that because, you know,  and I think what they wanna encourage people to think is  because LTE downloads so fast,  you'll be paying more money for your bandwidth.  But that's not the case  because a movie is a gigabyte is a gigabyte is a gigabyte.  You watch a movie,  it doesn't matter how much faster it is,  you're using the same amount of data.  So what they're really saying is,  but because it was so easy to watch that movie,  you'll probably watch a lot more.  And then you'll have to pay more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What I saw was tweets from people who were saying that  they realized that watching a whole movie  is pretty much the month's allocation.  And I think what that means is they never watched movies  before because they couldn't.  Right, because it's a gigabyte.  And they said, oops, this doesn't take you very far.  It's a rotten deal.  That's a story.  But it's a very different story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a different story than the speed trap lurking  in the new iPad, what they should say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the worldview of the Wall Street Journal now  is always, you know, bad technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, it's very interesting.  I mean, I think that, I mean, it's not just Google.  It's not just privacy.  It's, you know, even Apple, which,  as we know, the journal loves.  Yep.  Google defends hosting site under attack from the MPAA.  Hotfile.com is in trouble with the Hollywood folks.  It's an internet locker service.  The Motion Picture Association of America says,  people are putting pirated films on there.  Google has filed an amicus brief right on Google  saying Hotfile is protected by the DMCA.  Of course, remember that YouTube would also be under fire.  And it's important that people understand  how the Safe Harbor provision works.  So Google filed in favor of,  a friend of the court brief in favor of Hotfile.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They definitely have a hoarseness race,  but it's nice to see them stand up for the little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep.  Yeah.  And here from all things D,  Comcast Verizon say they're itching  to fight Google and Apple.  This is Peter Kafka writing,  so there's a hearing today,  Comcast Verizon testifying  in front of a Senate subcommittee  saying why it's okay if we work together.  We really, it's not a bad thing.  By enhancing the cable companies  and Verizon's own products and services,  the Comcast Verizon joint venture will compete  with similar solutions from AT&T,  Dish, Google, Apple, Microsoft and others,  spurring them to respond,  perpetuating a cycle of competitive investment.  So it's okay if Verizon and Comcast team up.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nothing to say about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Moving on, I'm just throwing these,  I'm throwing them out.  If you have something to say.  Almost.  You can say something about it.  Let's see, another Wall Street Journal headline.  Amazon adds that robotic touch.  It's actually a fairly cool story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I read it in the New York Times though,  but this is Amazon buying Kiva,  second largest purchase, the Kiva robots.  It's almost a billion dollars, $775 million.  A billion dollars, $775 million.  Right, and what I didn't realize about them  is that what the robots do is they pick up an entire rack.  It looks like a rack and bring it to the pick and ship person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People have, I'm surprised Mike Daisy  has not done a monologue on this.  People have said that it is horrible.  He's busy doing other things.  It's horrible.  Those poor robots.  Those poor robots, the life they lead.  No, no, people do say it's not fun working  at an Amazon facility being the pick and pack person.  I imagine it's hard work being a warehouse worker in general.  So having robots do the heavy lifting is kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Back in the early days at Christmas time,  all of Amazon would empty out  and everyone from execs down would be at the warehouse.  And it was only in the past four or five years, I think,  that that stopped happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Crate and barrels using these robots, GAP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Amazon wants to have services for everything.  And services for your stuff.  Even robots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Kiva robots cost between a few million dollars  to as much as $20 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What fascinates me, and this is by the way, Brady,  is the email I just sent you a little while ago,  or we're going to send you.  Oh, about Tim?  I'm fascinated, the mail industry, right?  The first class letter is dead.  It subsidizes other mail, which includes advertising.  That's going to go.  And the only profitable portion of delivery, of course,  is physical goods.  And I've been arguing for a long time  that retail at a local level becomes  more and more inefficient.  It's only good for things that expire  or things that require immediate gratification,  whether that's certain things at the drugstore,  or whether that's I gotta have the new,  whatchamacallit pad.  But other than that, retail's going to shrink and shrink.  And so every time Amazon makes consolidation  and fulfillment more efficient,  watch out for the consequent effect on local retail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I mean, in Seattle, we have Amazon Fresh.  And I'll tell you, it's awesome.  What's that?  Oh, it's grocery.  Amazon delivers your groceries.  I could have my, I'll be home in Seattle tomorrow,  I could have my food waiting for me.  When I get there, you can get, I think you can get booze.  You can definitely get frozen goods.  You pick the delivery time, it drops it off at your door.  It's great.  And they have CDs, DVDs, books,  various electronics if you need it.  Cool.  And it's something like, if you order enough in a month,  you become a big radish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, I got one for Jeff.  The New York Times has now said,  not 20 articles a month, you only get 10.  That's it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Listen, when people think that I'm against paying  for content and insert plug for Gutenberg, the geek  or two books here, I'm not.  And people think that I've said that paywalls  will never work.  No, I've said that it'll work at the New York Times.  And it has worked at the New York Times.  The question though always becomes,  what's the definition of worked?  And will it work for others?  So what's happened here is the Times has always had levers  and they went to what they, in one sense,  is a high number of pages before you hit the wall,  20 pages a month.  And very few readers hit that number.  And those who did, who were the most loyal got subsidized  for the last six months or so by a big advertiser.  So now the Times is saying, okay, well, we didn't die there.  Let's change the lever and try to get more revenue.  Now, a couple things about this.  One is the Times can afford to do this,  but other newspapers can't because the Times  is sells advertising at such a premium.  And other crappy newspapers can't.  So the Times doesn't want to sell out.  It doesn't want to sell what the market will bear.  It doesn't want to reduce the cost of its inventory.  It actually wants some old and sold inventory,  just less of it.  But it has to maintain its prices at a high level  so it can afford to do this.  It can also afford to do it  because it's the New York Times and it's that goddamn good.  Now, the contrary of this is the tragedy to me in this,  the unspoken story in this,  is that when the Times tells us that very, very few people  ever hit 20 page views a month,  that's a terrible commentary on its engagement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And-  Or on their tracking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, one or the other, but I think it is the engagement.  I think that this is true of news sites generally.  When we did research at CUNY,  we found that news sites as a rule  have about 12 page views per user per month,  whereas Facebook gets that every day.  I'm not saying newspapers should be Facebook,  but I am saying that the target's somewhere in the middle.  So, to me strategically, what the Times should be doing  is coming up with ways, instead of lowering the wall,  make more people hit it.  Or I wrote a post a few weeks ago  looking at the idea of a reverse pay meter.  I know some sites that get traffic  from out of their market that is useless to them.  So what I've told them,  and I'm supposedly an enemy of pay walls,  I've said to them, put up a pay wall  where after the first page, you get hit  because those people are not valuable to you.  You can't monetize them.  They actually cost you money, the minimus, in bandwidth.  And what you should be doing instead  is rewarding the people who bring value to your site.  They bring value to your site by reading you,  by clicking on your ads, by contributing content,  by recommending you, by doing tasks, all these things.  If newspapers looked at themselves  as being in the relationship business  instead of the content sales business,  it would turn the economics of the paywall 180.  But having said all that,  see, you started me, Leo.  I knew I would.  I just wanted to show you how I done this.  I haven't said all that.  Yes, the Times is magnificent.  I pay for the Times.  We even get it in paper.  Thus, I get the paper free online.  That's how I get it.  I use its app.  I would continue to do so.  However, on my iPad,  I'm gonna confess something to you  about my iPad in a second.  On my iPad, I read the Times  and I now read The Economist.  I tried, for example, The New Yorker.  It's still even virtually piled up in the corner unread.  I know.  I know.  But at least it takes up no space.  So I didn't wanna pay for it, so I canceled that.  Before the show today, in fact,  while I was sitting in my cozy conference room here  killing time, I was looking at the apps,  the magazine apps and so on  in the news store newsstand for Apple.  And I can't find anything I really wanna buy.  The notion that the Times paywall works  is true for the Times,  though it has an impact, I think,  on the strategy of the Times and how they think.  But that's their decision.  But I also caution it's not gonna work universally.  Jeff, do you think-  I'm gonna make my confession now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead.  Yeah, no, no, no.  I wanna hear your confession first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  iPad confession?  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a different confession.  All right, well, then let me put this out there.  Earlier you said that you thought that the Times  needs to concentrate on its engagement.  So do you think that they should do something like  if you've got more than a thousand Twitter followers  and you tweet a New York Times link,  then you get to look at 30 pages a month versus-  And we talked about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and obviously, Gina.  That's a good idea, I like that.  That's right, he was thinking of the 101 ways  this could be spammed and gamed, right?  Right, right.  Well, he wouldn't be thinking this if he were watching us.  Look what you're missing, Matt,  but you don't know you're missing it.  Anyway, right, I think what you have to do  is look at the relative value of readers.  And one company I know started looking at the value  of readers in market versus out of market,  and it's a huge gap.  But that's a kind of negative valuation.  If you look at the positive valuation  of how people can contribute to the value of what you do.  Right, so number one, I think, is recommending what you do.  And if that, the pure link wouldn't work,  because obviously you create a Twitter account,  nobody reads and you do it to get,  you've got to have some Twitter clout,  and it has to have some market value.  And there was just a study, oh God,  I had to put it in the, who did it?  Somebody just did a study, chat room,  help me, but you're not media wonky enough  to have read this.  That finally gave some, a monetary,  oh, Googled it, Googled it.  Of course, they wrote a post giving a monetary value  to social links.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really, where's that?  I want to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's, oh, chat room, help me, help me.  Look at all the Google blogs real quick.  There's three little diagrams,  one on top of the other,  and it shows what the value was.  Now, come on chat room, come on, you can do it.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So similar to clout with a K,  what they're trying to do is like give everybody a score  or a number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait, is this based on their post-rank acquisition?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it might have been,  and what they're doing is they're giving a financial value  to social links.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is why we get knocked off every time on YouTube.  It's that.  It's all my fault.  It's your fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, my singing of it was so bad,  it would have got us knocked off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here, boy, look at this.  There we go.  Look at that, chat room is so good.  Kurt, our winner from the analytics blob in Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Awesome. There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, so social value.  The best chat room ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Capturing the value of social media using Google Analytics.  So tell us what we're looking at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it tells you that there are a lot of circles  and you can make points with circles.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't understand.  Circles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are 20,000 in a given population,  or short of the population was there are 20,000 conversions.  Of that 11,000 were assisted social conversions, right?  And of that 2300 were the last interaction  was a social conversion.  That's why you can give them credit, kind of, right?  And it gave a monetary value to all of that.  So the conversions, and I don't know what the definition  of conversion was in this context, but it's relative,  was worth $113,000.  The assists were worth 48,000 of that.  The last interaction was worth 8,000 of that.  So obviously, if you can manage this  and get more of those last interactions,  you can make a lot more money.  So out of 424 assisted conversions,  they put a value to that, so you could know what to do.  Then, interestingly, the source of assisted conversions,  number one, t.co, which is Twitter,  number two, plus.url.google.com.  No, it's not dead, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Number three, Reddit.  It's half the size of Twitter,  and Reddit's, again, a fifth the size of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I don't know what the methodology is.  But this to me is really, really valuable  because it starts to put numbers behind the link economy  and the value of those things.  So now, Gina, don't get me started, back to your question.  So yes, if you could monetize the value  that you bring to the New York Times  when you specifically tweet an article,  the New York Times would be very wise to say,  thanks, Gina, here's 20% of that value  that we recognize, that's incremental to us because of you.  And you know what?  We're not even gonna pay you that.  We're gonna do it as a discount against your sub.  And ideally, what's gonna happen here  is you're gonna end up with 100-year credit.  And you won't care because it's non-money then.  It's non-money to you because you'll never pay,  and you're still motivated to play the game.  It's non-money to the Times because the Times  is obviously making more from your value  than it would from your subscription.  about this, and they're doing the opposite.  Why?  Because they think they're in the content-selling business,  not in the relationship of data business.  You shouldn't have got me started.  Wow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  I fear and look forward to the future  where my Twitter follower account  or Facebook subscriber account or cloud score or whatever  sort of earns me freebies.  Well, cloud does, right?  Passively.  Cloud does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You get stuff from cloud.  It's all crap, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Isn't that how you ended up in that Vegas club?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You get stuff for having cloud.  I haven't looked at it in a while,  but I think I got coupons for stuff.  Perks, cloud perks, right?  Turned off their email.  Did you guys do the five-dollar thing?  Yeah, me too.  I don't want any perks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you do the five-dollar for $10 Amazon thing this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, what's that?  Oh, I did.  Yeah.  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What?  I tried to use my Amazon gift certificate to get the deal,  which wasn't gonna work.  I know, that was awful.  It was almost like stealing.  You pay $5 and you get $10.  It was Amazon local thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is there a way of thanking you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Try to get more business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it's Amazon local, okay.  Look, my cloud's just plummeting.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh no.  I have never looked at my cloud.  I have zero idea what cloud is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see our perks.  Let's see what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm gonna give you a cloud badge just for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't have any perks.  I really have never looked.  You haven't participated.  Oh, I haven't participated.  But where can I find out what perks I get?  Where do I get them?  I want some perks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've updated our privacy policy  to continue participating in cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I signed out a cloud and now I'm back.  Just for you.  Giving K's.  It's just so stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you're gone again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I should sign out.  Yeah, I should just sign out again.  All right, let's get to our tip.  This is not a tool that I would like to share with you.  Let's get to our tip, our number.  And we're gonna have two tools  because Brad's gonna do a tool and I'm gonna do a tool.  Double tool time.  One confession.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Double tool.  Double tool time.  So let's start with you, Ms. Gina Trapani,  your tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My tip of the week is thanks to Eileen.  Thank you so much.  Humblebundle.com.  It's a bundle of games and apps for Android, Mac,  and Windows and Linux.  You buy them for a price that you choose.  All the money goes to charity.  There's 12 hours left as of right now.  So hopefully by the time this podcast goes out,  the audio and the video goes out,  people still have time to purchase it.  And yeah, it supports charity.  You can unlock the games on Steam.  Looks, lots of good titles here.  And they would retail for $57,  but you can pay what you want and it all goes to charity.  So it seemed like a really good cause.  Eileen, had you done, this is Humblebundle 2.  Did you do the first one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The last one had like World of Goo and Osmos  and really cool games.  Yeah.  I haven't done this one yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So these are never before seen games for Android 2.  I don't understand.  It says for Android, but it's also for Apple.  It's for anything or no, this bundle is for Android 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's for a lot of platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Says the games were created on Mac,  Windows, Linux, and Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Android, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm confused.  Well, anyway, they work everywhere.  In fact, Windows users are buying much more  than Mac or Linux users.  So get on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So get on it, yeah.  Get those numbers up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Get on it.  You could choose any amount from $100 to a custom amount  and then how you divide it.  Developers get some, charity,  and a humble tip goes to Humblebundle itself.  That's neat.  So everybody wins.  Yeah.  Good one.  Yeah, thanks Eileen.  Jeff, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've got a few choices.  Today is Twitter's sixth birthday.  Today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Today?  2006 it started.  I signed up in December 2006.  You are the pioneer.  But see, I quit.  I would love you.  I quit in like March 2007.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cause you're like, this is stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I liked it, but I was mad.  He over-torqued.  No, I got mad cause I thought that they were a silo  way back then.  And I didn't like the idea of contributing all this content  to somebody who was going to hold onto it.  So I quit.  Same fool that I am.  And then Justine is Zarek.  You joined in September 2006, Bradley.  Brady.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Brady.  That's how you get to be in the first name club.  Yeah, you have your name at Brady.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Except Leo won't find you cause he's looking for Bradley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know.  So that's me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's just me.  You and like my seventh grade teacher.  Bradley, why didn't you do your homework last night?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Brady falls in the forest and there's no one there.  So 2006, wow.  And so early too, March 2006.  But it didn't really take off until South by Southwest  in 2007, a year later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a year later.  That's when it had its big.  That's when I finally signed up.  I said, ah, I keep hearing about the stupid Twitter thing.  Let me just sign up and post my first tweet.  I'm in the under 1 million club.  You can see if your user ID,  if my user ID is just under, it's like 930,000.  I take a lot of pride in that.  That's my early adopter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm mad at myself for quitting  cause I would have like a really low number.  What is your number, Brady?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's like 5,000.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nice.  So you can enter your Twitter username at twobirdday,  T-W-B-I-R-T-H-D-A-Y,  and find out when you joined Twitter,  but it won't find my first one.  It'll find my,  Justine Azarek talked me into rejoining in April 2007.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like the was born on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And my godfather, this is the first person I followed,  was Miss Rogue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My godfather was Laughing Squid.  I'm in the 92nd percentile.  Wow.  I'm in the 95th.  So how could that be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have Miss Rogue.  Oh, I was looking at Miss Rogue.  She joined in July.  Yep.  That's Tara Hunt, of course.  So let me back up.  She's wonderful.  She's in the 82nd percentile.  That's fun, isn't it?  You could see who your first follow was,  and when you joined,  and you get a little birth certificate.  But that's not my tool.  So happy birthday, Twitter.  You got another number?  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Happy birthday, Twitter.  Well, I just want to go real quick.  I found this interesting.  On March 18, a weekend day,  which is important to this tale,  Google's share of the browser market exceeded that of IE,  but only for one day,  because that's a weekend day when we have a choice.  But it shows where it goes here,  that I think the IE,  the EU went after IE,  evil Microsoft with Internet Explorer,  was going to take over the world.  Nevermind.  Forget about it.  Well, that's what happens

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  when you stop working on something for about five years.  Yeah.  People stop using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Plus, you don't put it on a platform like the Mac,  which has beaten the hell out of you.  And then I want to make a little confession here,  just to force all things.  I'm going to return my second iPad.  But what?  Wait, I'm only doing it.  I'm only doing it because I made a mistake in an AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You want Verizon LTE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want Verizon, and it's still unopened,  so I don't pay the $52 charge.  Yes, folks, I am going to return a second iPad.  But I do love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No re-boxing, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I can't re-box it because I didn't have the restocking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I didn't even take it out of the shipping box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  Yeah, no, I think Verizon is the way to go,  especially you're in New York, right?  You'll get great performance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the Wall Street Journal scared me, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, I got a silly tool, but I thank the chat room  for this one.  They recommended Yumly, which is a semantic search  for recipes.  It understands what you're saying.  And the best, and one of the things they've added now  is they have a Facebook app.  So when you search for English cucumber vodka infusion,  everybody on Facebook will know what you're up to.  But my, oh, it has some nice filters here.  You can have it less salty or more salty,  less savory or more savory, sour, bitter, sweet, spicy.  You can have food allergies.  You could say, I'm a pescatarian, or a vegetarian,  or a vegan.  Got nutrition, time and price, time and cooking, of course.  This is a very nice search engine for recipes.  But my favorite part is it's social.  And if you turn on the social, you can have friends.  Your friends on Yumly are called taste buds.  And I like that.  That's the only reason I'm recommending it,  because you can have taste buds.  Yeah.  But Brady has a very good, very good one.  You know what I'm going to do is I'm going to give you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or you could just bring up the, oh yeah, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, if you have some fun searches you want to show.  Sure, yeah.  We've talked, I think we've talked a little bit about if  this than that before.  But let's see what a master of geolocation can do with IFTTT.  Oh, this is going to be good.  .com, yeah.  So I don't know if we'll have to do anything magic to his.  He's going to do that.  And then can you see him?  No, I don't.  You're going to have to probably change  your resolution on your.  I don't know, it should be the same.  Ah, yes.  Yes, he's going to 1080.  Is that what you did?  I just turned on the master of Ignite.  Yeah, mirroring is what you want.  You're the master of Ignite.  You should know how to do this.  And Ignite master should know how to immediately take  us an hour ahead of time.  I know.  That's yeah.  So are you finding me, Eileen?  No, Jeff.  Well, I'll do it here.  You walk me through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you got to give it back to court.  Here you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tt.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So if this than that, if you go to if this than that dot com  slash WTF.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Then I have too many T's in my FTT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do that sometimes.  If.  So basically, if this than that lets you tie together  different services.  So I can tie together Evernote, Gmail, Foursquare,  Instagram, BuzzFeed.  So you know, as I like the joke, I  can automate my watching of finding lolcats.  But I use this for stuff like I send all my Instagram photos  to Facebook.  I have all my Foursquare check-ins  go to my Google Calendar so I can look back  and see where I actually went.  I have some selected tweets go to Google Talk.  If I favorite a song on SoundCloud,  it goes to Dropbox.  All my Facebook and Instagram photos go to Dropbox.  All my Instapaper links go to Evernote.  And so it's like Yahoo pipes, but much easier to use.  I've described it as like Yahoo pipes,  but designed by 37signals.  So it's like very straight to the point and opinionated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So for instance, if I post a new bookmark to Pinboard,  then it automatically tweets it.  And if my mom emails me and texts me,  yeah, it texts me and says, mom just emailed you.  She'll be very happy to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And there's tons of recipes.  There's about 40 different services you can tie together.  Just browsing the recipes, which is  how you share what's been done before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a good one.  When Amazon adds a new album to its top free albums,  that's good.  Send me an email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Kindle top books too.  Yeah, that's nice.  If it's raining tomorrow, send you an email.  You can automate thanking people in Twitter,  which doesn't seem like much of a thanks,  but I guess it's something.  Thank you for following me.  Oh, start a Gmail.  Send it to Evernote.  That's kind of awesome, actually.  Archive my tweets to Google Calendar.  They've really added.  They've added stuff since I've seen it last.  I bet it's all user-based.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do we imagine the business model is?  Well, I mean, jeez, I don't know for sure.  But you could easily picture this for the enterprise, right?  You know, letting folks sign up for enterprise accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't want it to die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, neither do I.  I would pay for this in certain cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like you unravel.  It's like pulling one thread from your sweater,  and you're going to end up in a bundle of yarn, right, Brady?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's like a there's a great post  by the fellow who runs Pinboard, Maché, about why  you should yell at anybody who doesn't charge for their app.  Right.  Because then it will go away.  And you're totally right about if this and that.  And they just came out in the past year,  and they've got some amount of funding,  but not so much that I think they can just  last forever without revenue.  So I'm pretty sure they have plans  as they're perfecting the service.  I really do see a lot of enterprise uses for this.  Just kind of like the GitHub model of it's  free if you use it publicly, and you pay to use it privately.  I like this.  Which I think is a great model in general  for these types of services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sync readability to Instapaper.  Then I don't have to choose.  Yep.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What I would really like, the number one feature I would like,  and this is more on Marco's side,  is Instapaper content goes to Evernote.  Because almost anything that I read on Instapaper,  I want to be able to search for it on Evernote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On Evernote, yeah.  This has a nice Evernote integration.  Yep.  If I'm mentioned on Twitter, give me a call,  and tell me who said what.  It'll phone you.  Well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like that.  I would love that, except for when  whatever the Brady quarterback guy is playing.  Yeah.  I get lots of like, go long, Brady.  Because you're at Brady, at Brady, at Brady.  Yeah, that's not really.  That's a different Brady.  I just started blocking people who  don't know how to use Twitter.  He's the Brady.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is he?  I don't know.  You're the Brady.  I'm saying Brady's the Brady.  This other guy's the quarterback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now we've got a Tebow story coming up.  Tebow Brady is going to be huge, by the way.  I don't know, Swartz, but even I know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you.  It's so nice to have you, Brady Forrest.  If you haven't yet signed up for the Wear Conference,  not much time remains.  It's coming up April 2nd through 4th in San Francisco.  Go to wearconf.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We've got a 25% discount for everyone watching.  Sorry.  What do I type?  What do I type?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tweet?  Tweet.  That's easy.  Register online right now.  These are all the various.  They even got an exhibit only for $25.  But if you use Tweet, you'll save some money on that.  This is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Buy yourself a latte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, thank you.  Very nice.  Thank you, Brady.  Really appreciate it.  Thank you for having me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was glad that I was down from Seattle to be here.  I am really glad, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you should go to Google I.O., everybody,  and watch Brady's Ignite presentation,  because Jeff Jarvis will be one of the speeches.  Yeah, and we'll put out a call for talks for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ignite is so much fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ignite's awesome.  And last year's at Google I.O. was particularly good.  I've been to a bunch of them, but the Google I.O. one,  I do remember it.  It was really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  We had to, unfortunately, Jane's addiction  was practicing upstairs during it.  But we got beer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's good.  Brady Forest, thank you so much for joining us.  Gina Trapani is at smarterwear.org and thinkupapp.com.  And of course, on Google+.  And that's it.  That's all.  And she wrote the book on Google Wage.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's it.  After sitting shiver for it.  No more Google Wage.  Now, I think there's an app in there.  There's an app, a Google Wage.  What could that be?  It could be like a database of wages or something.  It could be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's where you only get paid by Google Wallet credits.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what I thought you were going to do the five bucks for.  Because everybody who has a Google Wallet  got five bucks extra because they did such a crappy job  or something.  I don't know.  Thank you, Google.  How many people?  That tells you they don't have very many users of Google  Wallet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they're wanting more.  That's for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We'll give you five bucks.  It's probably five people.  Nothing.  Jeff Jarvis is at buzzmachine.com.  That's his blog.  He's also in Stockholm speaking.  And you can.  Yaskoje via and omelette.  Are you going to talk about public parts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's all I'm going to say tomorrow.  I'm going to go up stage and say that.  Public parts.  Yes.  Actually, I'm going to ramp it up a little bit.  I'm going to act like the Wall Street Journal  and get us sensationalistic and say that our internet is  in danger, people.  Ah, I like it.  And this is a country where they protect freedoms.  And we need them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why you have so much bandwidth.  Buzzmachine.com.  Buy the book.  Thank you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Gutenberg the Geek.  Kindle Single.
