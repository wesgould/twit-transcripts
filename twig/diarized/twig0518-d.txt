Transcript:  It's time for This Week in Google. I'm Jason Howell filling in for Leo Laporte, who is  vacationing somewhere in this country, this fine, fine country right now. Definitely not  on the show today, but joining me on the show, of course, the return, Stacey Higginbotham,  creator of the IoT Podcast at IoTPodcast.com and the Internet of Things newsletter at staceyoniot.com.  How are you, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Man, I'm great. You did that all in one breath. You get a prize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, my lung capacity. I've been working on it, working on it just so that I could  introduce you once again. It's good to see you again.  Likewise.  And the new setup. I don't know that I've seen the new setup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yes. This is my I've moved to Washington State, living on Bainbridge Island setup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right on. I like it. Looks good. It's good to see you also joining us. Jeff is out this  week. So filling in Jeff's shoes. I don't know if they were the same shoe size, but  Kevin Toffle about Chromebooks.com and also IoT Podcast.com. How are you doing, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I'm good. I can guarantee you that I do not fit into Jeff's shoes, literally or  figuratively. And I look like crap today. I'm working on my Wi-Fi after a device review  today. So hopefully that will clear up over time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's all right. You don't look like crap. You look great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You do. You look you're in soft focus. Yes.  Barbara. Barbara wah wah focus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a new security thing to fuzz out my face so that way nobody can, you know, use it for  machine learning and such.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Just a little Vaseline on the lens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is intentional. Well, it's good to have you. You also got a new pair of glasses, but  we may hopefully later in the show get a clearer view of the glasses. But in view in  blurry form, they look great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can see fine, you know, so I'm good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, right on. Well, it's good to have you both here and I'm happy to hop on with y'all  on this week in Google. Where do we even begin? I'm scanning through trying to find the obvious  thing. Well, actually, OK, so so when you when you've got a blurry video feed like you do  Kevin Toffle, then it prevents people from scanning your face.  And so that'll be my segue into this. The top story that I chose on the fly.  Did you hear the story about someone who apparently was propositioned five dollars for face for  a face scan by a Google employee?  So apparently your face is only worth five dollars.  And I guess that kind of seems quite a bit. Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel like it seems low, but you know, they did a study probably in 20 either 2012 or 2014  where they bought people's Social Security number for a cookie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, OK, I feel like by comparison.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait, what flavor? It was a chocolate chip cookie.  OK, that's that's a pro. That is plenty. All right.  So, I mean, you know, that's more of a barter as opposed to a dollar figure.  But I feel that five dollars for a face is fair.  What did strike me is the fact that this guy was like.  And it's not five dollars cash, it's five dollars at Starbucks or Amazon, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was an Amazon gift card. Yes, Amazon or Starbucks, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which I thought was hilarious because, you know, Amazon probably could use some faces themselves.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Someone notable that they're not giving out their own Play Store gift cards, but  also that makes a whole lot of sense that they wouldn't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can I buy five dollars?  I mean, five dollars aside, if this person or anybody offers five dollars for Google to do that,  does that does Google still have the right to scan their face and other photos and such?  Other than the five bucks, are they getting any extra privacy over their data?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a really good question. Like I have to imagine.  So what happened, at least in this ZDNet story, and I think there was one on 95Google,  of another person that, you know, they had a report of this happening,  but they were sitting in the park. Man walks up to them and offers five dollars to scan their face.  They say, I work for Google. We're collecting data to improve the next generation of facial recognition phone unlocking.  So pretty, I mean, reasonably specific as far as what they're saying that they're using it for.  Who knows if they have more and more uses for this face scan than just that.  But that's what they're telling people.  And then they were given a phone in a case that made it difficult to discern what the phone was.  Many people are are positing that it might be the Pixel 4 because there might be a sensor on the Pixel 4  that would facilitate face scanning in order to unlock.  And then you use the phone to take a selfie at different angles to get the different kind of direction shots on your face.  And then you're handed this five dollar Amazon and Starbucks card.  I have to imagine if you're agreeing to this, you must either sign something or maybe there's something in the app that you're taking a selfie with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They did give him a contract. He just didn't read it.  Oh, which is unfortunate because I'm like for for five dollars.  I would like to see what you're giving over.  Well, I mean, he's writing about his friend who's an engineer and who is probably like, yeah, I'll give him my face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I'm. Yeah, probably one of those.  They've already got everything. So what's what's my face?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, his exact quote was, yeah, well, I wanted to see what they'd ask me to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. I don't care what they're going to do with it.  I just want to know what they want me to do. Curiosity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure. I mean, without seeing the contract, we don't know much more.  I'm actually wondering if this wasn't a face scan, but a face scam in that maybe this wasn't Google at all.  Because that's a really good question.  Yeah, I'm thinking, you know, why would Google have to go out and do this when they have between contractors and regular employees, you know, 80,000, 90,000 faces to scan already?  Well, I don't really see the point of them going out in the public and doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What they don't have is someone playing with their phone, trying to unlock it.  That's that's what this was for. This was I'm with Jason.  I think this was testing the Pixel 4 unlock feature.  So they needed someone to be able to kind of look at it from various angles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that could well be. But I mean, when I was at Google, most of the people I work with actually carried iPhones.  So if you wanted like a new user group, you got it there.  It's trust me, they have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. Yeah. And I don't know that I read anything about them actually.  Like like in this report, there was nothing in there that said that he was actually unlocking the phone with his face.  They were just scanning it from multiple directions.  I just wasn't sure if they were actually using the Pixel 4.  Nothing. Yeah.  I'm not sure that we've heard Google say anything.  If it was a scam, they probably would have by now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is an assumption.  I naturally ask Google what it would be doing, but the company didn't immediately respond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, so let's call Google.  Let's see what they have to say right now. Right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wish you know, that would be so awesome.  If we had a hotline like a bat phone to the Google PR team, I mean, it would probably be the PR team.  But we had an actual Google person who would talk to us.  I'd be even better. Yeah, we would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We would do it like three, maybe four times before we realized they always give us the same answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's more effective, actually.  Just, you know, OK, you're not going to talk this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, exactly. We have nothing to announce at this time.  OK, well, that that bit is done.  I guess we're done with that one.  But I am curious to know what this leads to.  Kevin, I had the same question.  It's kind of like Google is already cataloging all this information in the cloud,  like insane amounts of data and on faces with Google Photos and all this kind of stuff.  It's not like they don't have plenty of data to work with.  But, you know, maybe it's just the fact that that data hasn't been cleared for this particular application.  And in this way, it's a little more explicit, maybe kind of above the above board in doing it in such an explicit sort of way.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or maybe like this guy doesn't say if his friend, I mean, is this friend white?  Is this friend black? Is this friend, you know, because there is a variety angle that could be important here in terms of two heads.  Does he have two heads? That is, yeah, there's probably not a lot of data about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What if he has no face, like no face at all?  You know, a blank face?  Possible. Not very possible.  All right. Possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like we're moving down a rabbit hole we shouldn't go down to.  All right. I think you're right.  We're talking about faceless face scans. We're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. We've reached the end of that one.  But I am excited to see if we'll find something along these lines in the Pixel 4.  Although the idea of a Pixel 4 without a fingerprint sensor that's all in on face scanning makes me a little nervous.  I don't know.  I don't like it.  Yeah.  Like, I just don't know that I'm ready for that, but I haven't used the iPhone X long enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The leaks we've seen don't have a fingerprint sensor on the back.  They don't.  And they don't have a space for it on the front.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So maybe they have the ultrasonic one as part of this.  I mean, that's that's an option, but those aren't awesome.  But yeah, I.  Or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or?  Could be in the power button.  That's been done before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That has been done before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's Sony has done it a couple of times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I guess you're right.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Sony's definitely done that.  I feel like we've seen it elsewhere as well.  But I feel like any of the renders that have been leaked about the Pixel 4 don't seem to allude to that.  I haven't read anything about that.  I also haven't really read any of the rumors about specs that have leaked to indicate that there's an in display fingerprint sensor.  Anything that we feel like we know with almost certainty is the fact that there just isn't a fingerprint sensor that's visible,  but not hearing anything that seems conclusive about an in display fingerprint sensor.  And even if it is an in display, it's just not my preference.  Like I've used a number of phones with the in display fingerprint sensor.  And at this point, and it's just it's just not as ideal for me.  I like having the hardware button somewhere on the device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do too. But I also like having the headphone jack.  And yeah, I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, right. That's true.  You get used to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm like, or you just accommodate and move on.  But I am excited.  I was going to say I am excited about the Pixel 4 because I just cracked my Pixel 2.  It's not a huge crack.  So I can I can handle it.  But I'm like, it's almost time to upgrade my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What will I get the display or the back?  You could get exactly the display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could get pretty much the same phone with the headphone jack right now.  Yep. That's the honor.  The 3A. The 3A is just as fast as the as the two.  And it's got a headphone jack. And I love it.  And I'm trying to get more people to buy it.  You are. You're like everybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Get on the bandwagon. Come on. 3A forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How much is the 3A, Karsten?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Four hundred bucks.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, four seventy nine.  Yeah. If you get the right, the expanded storage version, if I remember correctly,  which you probably want to do if you're getting the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The base is sixty four, which I think is not that bad.  Yeah, it's got night. Expanded is one hundred twenty eight, which is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does. Has the same camera.  Yeah, it's got the same.  I think it's got a better camera than yours than yours currently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So na na na na. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So na na na.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it does. It really does have it.  So it has a headphone jack and USB.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A headphone jack and USB-C and the same camera as the three.  And sold. And it's so nice.  Yeah, it is. It is a really great phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sure I told you about this phone months ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I didn't need it. And I don't remember.  I wasn't in the market then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, my bad. Bad timing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It really is a fantastic phone, especially for the price.  I don't want the XL.  Three ninety nine.  Yeah. All right.  There you go. Or you can wait three months and find out what the four is all about.  But who knows? Maybe less than three months.  I have a hard time believing that that Google would confirm the leaked images so early on  and then wait practically six months until the phone gets announced.  Like that's that seems like a long time for them to like reveal something very solid,  as solid as they did when they confirmed those promo images a few months ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we're within three months now.  But not over within almost two months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  So in a week. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. This feels this feels about the time we start getting hyped up for our fall device cycle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. That hype is happening.  The Note 10 and the 10 the Note 10 plus apparently there's going to be two different sizes of the Note 10.  And so there's going to be your super large Note 10 as as we're used to and then an even larger Note 10 plus at least larger display.  Apparently they're going to fit it in the same design, but just grow the display even further.  So, you know, what does that mean from a cost perspective?  Because the Note 9 already cost more than a thousand dollars.  And if there's a larger Note 10 than the base Note 10, what are we talking about?  $1,300? I don't know. But really expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You you actually had the on the screen just now you have the rumored prices in euros of 999 and 1199 or 1149.  Oh, yeah. 1149 in euros, whatever that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  1149 for the 10 plus. There it is. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. But chances are it's not going to be a conversion.  It would switch to 999 dollars and 1149 in dollars is my guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. OK.  Still, still very expensive. Yeah.  Still a lot of money, no matter how you slice it.  That's three pixel three A's. That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just I just got it. I'm like sold.  You can you can outfit your family. Everyone with pixel three A's.  And I mean, well, it's a really great fun.  I'm giving this one to my daughter because the crack is at the very bottom of the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK. Put a screen protector on it and a case and you're fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's already a case, although it's a live case.  And I'm sad because it's no more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No more live cases. Yeah, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pour one out for live case homies.  Let's see here. What what else do we have?  We've got a lot of things. I think I'm overwhelmed with options.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We have so many things. We just don't have great segues.  Yeah. I'm like, I'm sitting here looking like, oh, I'll apologize in advance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got a really bad night of sleep last night and I was doing Windows Weekly earlier tonight today.  I was just realizing while I was doing the show, it's been a long time since I've had this bad of a night of sleep that it's like it's affecting me today.  Like I'm like I feel like normally I can just like fly with with it on these shows.  And I'm having a hard time with my segues.  You could get your two your pixel to fixed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I don't know where you're going to be able to find an ad for to find a business.  That's true. Fix it. Yeah, you won't be able to do that.  Segway. That was good. 20 minutes in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Excellent. That was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think what you're talking about is not an in-house ad, but an article by Kevin Purdy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I fix it.  So basically, yeah, so this is interesting.  So Google had some rules that they that they implemented not too long ago.  I think this was last October that banned tech support by third party providers for consumer tech products and online services from actually appearing in search results.  And the idea here was to target what ends up being a lot of like bait and switch operations like hey, cloud services.  You know, somebody hops online because their computer is really slow.  They're like, repair my computer and you get a website for a place that is really just more of a fraud offer than it is, you know, some sort of actual reputable repair company.  And so Google took action on this and actually has made it difficult next to impossible for companies like that to actually get a website for their computer.  So, you know, if I'm in the Bay Area and I do a search for a local repair shop, I'm not going to get ads from my local repair shop because they also fall into the same category or are being lumped into the same category as these fraud outfits.  And that's kind of the point of Kevin Purdy's article is, hey, that's not right.  There are a lot of legitimate repair outfits that are not in the same category as these fraud outfits.  And that's kind of the point of Kevin Purdy's article is, hey, that's not right.  There are a lot of legitimate repair outfits out there, repair businesses, and they aren't getting the views that they need in Google search results in order for their businesses to thrive the way other businesses can enjoy.  And it's just it's just kind of interesting that this very legitimate, you know, segment of the of the electronics market is basically left out on the cold because Google's implemented something to clamp down on fraud outfits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this happened. This started actually almost a year ago, if I recall correctly.  October.  In the last October. OK, so Google said they were going to have like a verification process to kind of weed out the good guys and the bad guys here.  But maybe they are still working on that process. But it doesn't sound like it shouldn't take a year for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wouldn't think, especially if it's like consistently affecting these businesses.  Like a year is a long time. And there could be a future of a business right there.  Right. Exactly. If you run into business and and you relied on that and then suddenly it's gone a year could could mean you're out of business.  You're no longer a business. So, yeah, they had promised some sort of a verification program.  It still does not exist. And I don't think there's any indication whether whether Google is actually still working on it or they just decided they want to make another messaging app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's also it gets to the issues that I mean, basically it's very easy to figure out how to game an algorithm.  Right. It's easy for humans to figure out ways to game computers.  It's very hard for people to then come in and fix that in a way that doesn't affect everyone.  So, I mean, yeah, we'll see this again and again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it shows the power that Google has on the whole Internet, even though it's there just a subset of it.  I mean, sure. Yeah, that's that's kind of scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's actually led I fix it itself, which Kevin Purdy is writing for to remove a referral service that they had integrated into their site because they were being swept in it, too.  They were they were putting users in touch with local certified techs to help help them out.  And because they were making that connection, Google kind of lumped them into this category.  So certain search terms, you know, they wouldn't allow for.  And so they had to remove it in order to appear for those search terms, because I fix it, of course, is all about fixing your computers and your technology and all this kind of stuff.  So they are a part of it as well.  I'm actually talking with Kevin Purdy tomorrow on Tech News Weekly.  He's he's booked for the show. So talk to him about this.  But yeah, it's an interesting, interesting byproduct of I think I think the the goal here was good by Google, but the follow through apparently not so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We need a hotline to Danny Sullivan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, that's what the phone would connect to our our Google phone would connect to Danny Sullivan.  Yeah, that's what we did.  That's how we get him on the show again.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are a bunch of so all of the FTC approvals and the court case approvals for Google.  Do we want to talk about some of those?  One of them I'm super into and one of them I completely forgot about.  I'm like, oh, which kind of shows how I guess how slow these things can be.  No kidding.  No kidding court system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  So you're talking about the number of lawsuits that seem to have all reached some sort of a settlement in the last week.  Right.  Yeah.  All these things.  Oh, hey, Google can feel like the weight of the world isn't resting so heavily on its shoulders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they're just about to get part of it swept up in another investigation.  But, you know, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just clearing the path for something bigger.  Yeah.  Busy week for Google in the reaching settlements side of things.  Why spy?  Which dated back to 2010.  This would totally about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's where the Google Street View cars went through and took your pictures of everything for Street View.  But they also sucked up your Wi-Fi access point data.  And apparently the settlement only goes to a couple of people who filed the case, which honestly makes sense because I'm not living.  Even if they sucked up my Wi-Fi data, it's totally different.  Like nine years later.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Two houses removed from that situation.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what data did they suck up at that point?  And, you know, for some people, they would not be OK with any data, I suppose.  This, of course, only happened from unencrypted Wi-Fi access points.  So if you're encrypted, if you're encrypted, you're OK.  Unencrypted, you are one of you.  You are one of many who received a total of 13 million dollars of a payout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Say if you have a nice product, they already have your Wi-Fi bits anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, yeah, that's they have my Wi-Fi bits all over the place.  So many products.  The other one was age discrimination.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I was I was surprised.  I don't know if I didn't remember this, but it's job applicants over the age of 40.  I thought it was like 50.  So I'm now of an age where I can be discriminated against.  And that makes me sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, me too.  Me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's hard.  All over the hill.  Thanks it were useless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Class action suit represented 200 people.  And let's see here.  Google still denies and disputes that discrimination occurred.  However, they agreed to an 11 million dollar settlement, which comes out to about 35000 each.  So I mean, I guess that's a good settlement for those people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although no, implementing some practices to rectify that would have been better.  Would have been better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, fixing the problem.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not saying it absolves Google and 35000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, not that's what like like a month.  There are school teachers.  Yeah, it's a good.  It's a good payout for a teacher.  That's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are teachers in Alabama who get paid more than that.  So that's how kind of lame it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess I'm I just can't help but put it into the context of like class of a class action suit where you get in on it and then you get your  check in the mail and you open it up.  It's like 13 cents.  So I'm like, all right, 35000 dollars better than the 13 cent check I've received for class.  Yeah, that's at least worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's worth the postage at least.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then the last one involves minors using YouTube on violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.  I'm less aware about this.  The specifics of this one.  There isn't actually a public disclosure of the figure of the settlement.  But yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, yes, the reason you're unclear is because the FTC hasn't made it public and the company hasn't made it public.  So it's not your fault.  It's not your sleepless night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So just department's going to come in and either approve or tweak the settlement.  So I think that's the the issue.  I'm interested in this mostly because I have a kid who's about to turn 13, although I'm interested also in the sense that I'm like, my child is about to turn 13, but still she's still a kid.  So that's Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google runs into this quite a bit.  I see it in the education space with Chromebooks.  And it's typically, in my opinion, not Google's fault when you have kids under the age of 13 with Chromebooks that were given by the school.  But then those Chromebooks are not properly managed by the school's IT department.  And the kids have carte blanche to surf and go wherever.  But yet it often comes back to Google like, hey, what's going on here?  And, you know, they make the tools and they make everything available.  But you still have to you have to actively manage these things.  And I think this is one of the trickiest bits of legislation or laws that any of these tech companies have to deal with because the technology is so accessible.  You know, you can have a five year old kid who can walk up to an iPad or a fire tablet and just start using it.  And well, wait a second, did they agree to all the proper terms of service and so on?  There's just so much that is a challenge with with copy.  It's a great thing.  Trust me.  I believe that.  But the technology is just so accessible for the kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, in back in like a couple of months ago, the there was a group that sued on behalf of kids with Amazon and Google and smart speakers collecting information and keeping them.  But the challenge there is that back in 2017, the FTC actually tried to explain how COPA would affect digital speakers.  And they were like, yeah, it's OK.  The poll they said it will not take an enforcement action against an operator for not getting parental consent before collecting the audio file with a children's voice.  When it's fulfilling a search request, as long as it's only held for a small amount of time, what then they came back, this lawsuit rests on the idea that they keep it.  So I think there's also it's not just difficult, like is there a 13 year old or younger trying to use my services, but it's also what are they using it for?  How can we separate their data so we can treat it differently?  It's a mess. And then tracking all that's a nightmare.  Oh, absolutely. And what do you what do you think about this Google patent titled gamifying voice search experience for children?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is kind of related. It involves turning search into a gamified experience for toddlers.  So, you know, they're working on ways to improve voice search for kids because, you know, when they are using when kids are using voice search, they're not going to be able to use voice search.  And so when when kids and toddlers might be a little young, but when kids and I know I've seen it with with my youngest when she's using the Google Home, a lot of times, you know, her search query, because maybe she stutters or gets nervous or maybe slows down her speech and stops talking for a second.  And so Google is thinking, hey, we've got to come up with ways to make this more facilitating for younger children, also screening out inappropriate content when it knows that there is a younger child using the device, that sort of stuff.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think less the gamification, but the ability to identify a child using the system and then reacting appropriately, such as screening is something that Google is probably incredibly interested in doing.  Totally.  Just because it's a vision for the smart home that actually makes a lot of sense.  And I think we may talk about it in a little bit.  But one of the examples that Rishi Chandra gave when he was talking about the smart home was, and I could be wrong, it could have been the writer of the piece who gave this example.  But when you walk into or when you're listening to inappropriate music and your kid walks into the room, it turns off.  You know, which anybody like my sister-in-law loves her gangster rap and I could totally see her really appreciating a feature like that.  But or or maybe your kids listening to inappropriate music and when you walk into the room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, boy. Yes, they'll turn it against. They'll turn it in the other direction.  But it would be useful for me when I was a kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so it may not.  The writer may have hit on the gamification angle as part of the patent, but it may be something else in there that's more interesting to Google, if that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that makes a lot of sense.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, I agree with everything you said.  I just kind of wish that the like the local on-device natural language processing that's Google showed off at Google I.O.  where they'll basically push down or push up what it's learned from the model up to the cloud and therefore make everybody's NLP experience better if they can do that with the kids as well.  I don't because because that's not sending the actual data at that point of that of the speeches, what the kids are saying.  It would actually just say, hey, this didn't seem accurate.  We need to make this better in the model.  And that information, the metadata goes up, not the kids actual conversation like that.  So I would rather see that than some kind of gamified Google voice search for kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And mind you, this is just a patent.  So this isn't like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although if anyone's seen the little YouTube video of the little toddler trying to get, I think it's Madam A to play baby shark and tries so hard, it is it is really heartbreaking.  I mean, it is so frustrating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anytime you see a little kid try to use these things, you're just like, oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, especially if it's like I've had many moments where I'm watching my kids like they love using our Google Home to play music.  You know, they love putting on dance shows and everything.  And I'd say it works for them about 75 percent of the time.  The other 25 percent of the time, it totally should work.  Like I listen to their query. They've learned it by now.  They know how to control Google Home.  But for whatever reason, time and time again, they repeat the command and then I come over and do it and it works for me.  So, you know, it's frustrating.  It's frustrating watching your kids do this.  Now, at the same time, another thing that this article pointed out is this idea that, you know, the as we as Google works on creating voice control for younger children, you know, some people are worried that this in turn hooks kids too young on the technology, which I think is kind of ridiculous.  But I'm curious to know what you think, because I feel like it's kind of part of the it's part of the world we live in at this point.  Well, voices, I don't know what the right answer is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is actually developmentally a lot better than if they're if they're talking to Google rather than interacting with Google on a screen.  Yeah, this is this is work.  Working out the kids voice is actually a beneficial thing for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And Google.  Oh, no, it was Amazon.  Google may have this too, but a polite mode.  They listen to parents who are like, look, my kid is being a total jerk to these things and I would like that not to happen.  So they're even making efforts.  And if we don't call it gamification and we just call it like teacher kids how to talk to something like a respectful entity.  You know, maybe the ability to turn something like that on helps.  I mean, because even as adults, not all adults, but some adults, when you're talking to a kid, you generally give them more slack.  Maybe wait a little longer when they're trying to come up with words and, you know, you speak differently to toddlers.  So, yeah, I think this is way better if they start implementing like dark patterns to keep my kid hooked.  Yeah, I think the ship has sailed on this anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, there are kids that their first words are actually the wake words for these devices.  I don't want to say them because I don't say everybody's off.  But, you know, and I agree with what Carsten said.  I mean, that's it is it's more intuitive, natural.  It's far better than interacting with a screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, yeah, yeah, I agree.  I agree. All right.  So today we're doing something a little different.  It is time to take a break, but I'm not going to give you that break.  Leo is going to come back from his vacation really quick.  Sit in this chair and give you that break right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thanks, guys. Sorry to interrupt, but I wanted to mention our sponsor.  Maybe you noticed how white my teeth have been lately.  It's because I'm using these incredible Crest 3D white strips.  You know, I love my coffee. I love wine.  All that food and drink over the years takes a toll on you, how your teeth look.  If your teeth are looking a little yellow, that makes you look a little bit older.  That's why I love the Crest 3D whitening kit.  It removes over 10 years of tough set in stains from coffee, wine and smoking  to give you noticeably whiter teeth.  100% guaranteed.  People will look at you and say, what are you doing?  Did you lose weight? You look younger. What's going on?  You can tell them or you don't have to. It's the Crest 3D white strips.  By the way, this is the same treatment you can get at the dentist's office,  but it's a lot less expensive.  Hundreds of dollars less than those expensive dental treatments.  For the same results, in fact, they're using the same active ingredient dentists use  to whiten your teeth, hydrogen peroxide.  These soft, sticky little strips go right on your teeth.  You sit there. I watch a TV show. By the time it's done, the strips are done.  But then, this is the extra part.  It uses this LED blue light to help target stains.  And that makes the ingredients work faster and better than just white strips alone.  This is exactly the same LED light technology dentists use.  Crest white strips are amazing.  No gels, no trays. You put them on in your own house.  No slip grips so you can talk, you can drink water during the treatment. That's fine.  But you'll love how you look when you take those strips off.  You won't believe it. It's guaranteed to deliver 100% noticeably whiter teeth.  And if you're not satisfied, you're money back. It worked for me.  Right now, listeners of our show can get $20 off your first Crest 3D whitening strip kit  by going to crestwhitesmile.com and use the promo code TWIG at checkout.  Free shipping included.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, Leo. Maybe you weren't in this exact chair, but you're in another chair in this room.  And now back to your vacation. We'll talk to you later.  What do you say we talk a little bit about IoT here? Google Nest Max.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. Kevin and I don't know anything about IoT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know. I realize I'm just like, I'm taking a big risk.  But I thought we should just like change things up a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, shake it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google Nest Max. Are you guys excited for this? Apparently it's going to be out September 9th, $229.  It's the device that has the 10 inch display in the camera for video chat.  Finally has a date and a price. What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we were so not excited about this that we didn't even talk about it on the show this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cool. I'm happy I led with it in the IoT block.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But hey, we can share our thoughts now.  I have larger screen devices already. I have a 10 inch Lenovo smart display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I do too. And we never use it to talk to each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the Lenovo smart display does have a camera? It does, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does. And it has a, does it have a manual shutter? I think it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, it does. Yeah, that's right. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, yes, I love this device. It mostly it sits on my desk.  It's right in front of me and it mostly shows me pictures and the weather.  And it actually still shows it to me in Austin time because Google, I thought I reset it, but apparently I haven't reset that one yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, OK, well, then how about this? Rishi Chandra, the VP of product and GM at Google Nest, actually chatted with Forbes.  He says some interesting things about the smart home.  He actually says no one asked for smartness for the smart home.  And he alludes to the fact that Google is deviating away from smart home, moving more toward helpful home.  Is this a difference with what is the saying? A change with no difference or whatever? What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Semantics. Semantics. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Partially, partially. I mean, at I.O., Google said, you know, the new assistant will be more helpful.  They touted helpful, helpful, helpful all throughout. Yeah.  So I think it's a a trying to rebrand a little bit and also to get people to stop talking about, well, smart devices collect my data, you know, and so on and so forth.  Helpful means to me, well, if you give us some of your data, we'll be more helpful.  So hopefully it's trying to tamper down. That is my thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Instead of it being an all knowing device, it's a device that can assist you.  It can actually provide value and help in your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this is this is nothing. Yeah, total semantics.  This isn't actually different from it.  When Google bought Nest and Tony Fidel was in charge of this, he actually went in very early on.  Like, I remember Wall Street Journal op ed in like twenty eight late 2014, early 2015, where he was like, look, the smart home concept is dumb.  We want the intuitive home. We want a home that anticipates your needs and gets there.  And you know what? Bless their hearts. They have been trying this forever.  We are not there yet. The reason we're not there yet or one of the big reasons is there are no standards.  And so until we see in Google, actually, Rishi addresses that later in the interview.  But they basically talk about it like they're streamlining what they're doing, which they are by getting rid of the nest APIs.  Google's bringing everything under one controllable place and they will still do integrations.  I do believe that. But this is not this is not news.  This is frustrating because we've known this is the problem.  We know why it's happening and it's still happening because no one wants to have real standards and interoperability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, Rishi points that out in the in the interview.  He says that he's hopeful that standardization will occur and actually compares it to like web browsers.  Back in the day, web browsers. Instead of being hopeful, Rishi, do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why don't you do something about it? You're Google.  Yeah, that's true. Turns out that's like me.  You have the potential to lose weight. Yeah.  Yeah. In my household saying to my daughter, man, I hope you get food on the table tonight.  That would be awesome. Yeah, I would.  Maybe I should do something about it. All right.  I'm sorry you got there. That would be helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be a helpful home. Even smart.  Who knows? OK. Both could exist.  The both are true. Kevin, you wrote about on this site called Stacey on IOT.com plug.  You wrote about the firewall. Tell us about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so this is a really small but powerful device.  I mean, it's literally the size of a USB phone charger. It's very small.  You connect it to your router at home and it just kind of hangs off there.  And what it does is it's like a network monitoring tool on steroids.  And I say that because there are some good networking monitoring tools out there.  Like Stacey has Eero and its subscription to kind of track what's going on with her network and her data.  But this actually takes it a whole step further.  It literally tracks for all of your devices all the way through to the final endpoint servers.  So you can see, for example, like my Wyze cam, I wanted to be sure it wasn't sending my videos to a server in China.  It tells you exactly where these videos are going when they get uploaded.  And I find out they're on Amazon Web Services and I got the IP address.  And it tells me that it's actually using the June API. So it's all legit.  So the idea here is that all of your devices, not just your phones, TVs, tablets, computers, but everything is monitored and you can see exactly where the data is going.  So from an IoT standpoint, this is just spectacular, in my opinion.  It has a ton of other features. It has a built in VPN server, which is fantastic because there's no subscription fee.  The server is actually in your house and it's there if you want it.  And I tested that out and I wanted to make sure that I could stream video content from away from home.  And sometimes that's a challenge when you go outside of your home network area or you're in a country that maybe doesn't support Netflix, you're kind of out of luck.  But because the VPN servers in your house, Netflix doesn't know that I'm connecting through my home VPN.  So it serves up the content wherever I'm at, which is fantastic.  And again, no subscription fees. Other features it has, it detects malware on your network and on your devices.  You can block porn sites. You can block social media. You can block gaming.  And you can even do that for like a set amount of time for the entire family with the touch of a button.  Just block all social networking for an hour. Boom and done.  It's got a built in ad blocker. Again, whole home, not device by device.  Everything gets blocked on all devices when it comes to ads with this thing.  And shoot, there was one other feature that I thought was fantastic.  And now I'm drawing a blank. But Stacey read my post, so she's going to remind me, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not because I was reading about the FCC or FTC Facebook settlement because I already knew about Firewallet. Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. So, so regardless, the device, I think the normal price for the lower version, lower version, by that, I mean,  it's really meant to for home networks that can handle up to 100 megabits per second.  That device is one twenty nine ninety nine on sale for one oh nine ninety nine right now.  I tested the blue Firewallet, which goes up to or supports up to one gigabit per second connections.  And that is only one ninety nine now on sale for one seventy nine.  So really, I was very impressed.  I did have a problem. And in fact, that's why I'm fuzzy right now with Google Wi-Fi network routers.  The only way I can get it work and it's a known issue with the Firewallet folks.  I had to basically disable the mesh network and just use a single access point with the Firewallet.  And obviously, that's not great.  But the feature set was so outstanding that I tell you, I almost could live with one access point.  So it's I'm very impressed. Very impressed.  If you want to know where your connected device data is going, this is fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's really interesting. So my question for Kevin after hearing this was this is not the first time Kevin has had Google Wi-Fi problems.  Google Wi-Fi behaves badly with I think it was was it your ring doorbell or was something ring was an issue for a while.  Yes, that's correct. And then something else that you had.  And I was like, Kevin, I think it might be time to get rid of the Google Wi-Fi.  And Kevin is I mean, I could. Absolutely. I could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the ring issue that I had had to do with the two point four gigahertz requirement and mesh networking in general kind of bonds together.  Your two point four and your five gigahertz networks.  So that may or may not be specific to Google Wi-Fi.  I have had a couple of problems in general. It's been pretty good.  I could I could swap it out. But it's like another router mesh network setup is going to cost me two or three hundred bucks.  And this pretty much frankly, I don't pay you enough.  I didn't say that.  I mean, you know, I mean, ever since having not really worked full time for two years, I'm watching my budget.  So it's a tough sell. It's a tough sell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, you guys are getting paid. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Secrets out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the the the mesh factor can definitely mess things up.  I have the euro at home and just full disclosure, you know, as a sponsor on the network.  But I have a a particular smart plug for outside and it requires two point four gigahertz.  And because it's a mesh network on the inside, there was no way for me to get the smart plug to recognize the network the way it needed to.  It's like because of that met mesh network kind of split between two point four and five, there was no way for me to lock it in.  So I had to do some really interesting things, you know, like like pulling the device far enough away that it would trick it into only connecting to one and not the other in order to get it to connect and just set it up.  And then once it was set up, it was fine.  But it was just like getting that initial connection. Sometimes that can be a challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The whole two point four gigahertz and just about all these connected devices of late is annoyed the crap out of me.  Stacey knows at CES we always talk to all these vendors.  Why are you doing that? You know, you're missing out with mesh networking and causing problems.  And I think it really comes down to cost, you know, the cost of the chips.  You could, Jason or anyone else, if you have a two point four gigahertz specific device for your house, some guest networks on routers will let you set the band or the channel.  So that's an option.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Even even though it's like a distributed like mesh network throughout your home, the guest network, you can lock that into a particular band on some of these devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think that Stacey, the guest network, I don't think is truly a mesh network at that point, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My mesh network on Eero is a, my guest network is a mesh network on Eero.  Others may do it differently, but it is still a mesh.  There are things like, it's such a mesh.  It's a mesh and, you know, everyone's going to behave a little bit differently.  So your mileage may vary depending on who you have, because again, the mesh isn't, well, it is standardized, but no one's using the Wi-Fi lines as standard for it.  So, right, right.  Easy mesh.  Easy mesh.  That's it.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the answer here is, well, try, the answer basically is try a different mesh router, which is a terrible answer to give anyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yay.  Absolutely.  Why don't we stay with things that you guys are writing?  Chrome, we can kind of hop into a little Chrome news here.  Chrome OS 76 Stable is coming to Chromebooks next month.  Kevin, you wrote about this at AboutChromebooks.com.  What are some of the features that you're excited about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the biggest feature is, that I like anyway, is the virtual desktops.  And I don't know if other people use these on their Windows, Mac or Linux machines now, but Chrome OS is finally getting virtual desktops where you can have up to four desktops, workspaces, whatever you want to call them.  And that way you can group your different apps and tabs into separate sections.  Maybe you want one for social media.  Maybe you want one for work, one for content consumption.  So again, it's been standard on a lot of desktop platforms in the past.  It's finally, I think it was coming in 73 and they get push, push, push.  It's coming in 76.  It works pretty well.  I've been testing it.  They just figured out how to make a four finger swipe to swipe through your desktops, kind of like you use three fingers to swipe through open tabs.  So I'm like super psyched over that one right there.  So I don't know if you guys, do you guys use or will you use virtual desks?  Like Stacey's got a Mac, for example.  Yeah, I was like, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, hey, no.  I don't have a Chrome.  Well, so I don't have a Chromebook, but this is just Chrome.  I've stopped.  I've tried to stop using Chrome as much.  How come?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Out of curiosity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just because I like playing with other browsers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's just me.  Okay.  I've been using a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It works really well on mobile and it's got a few bugs on desktop, but it's, I don't know.  I like it.  I have been.  I have used Brave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What else?  Brave browser is based on is it bravest?  Bravest Chromium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's got one.  Key combination that doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's got a bug on paste without paste as normal formatting, which is a very specific deal killer for me.  But no one else.  But other than that, it's just like Chrome, except much less ads and tracking cookies.  So it's very nice.  That's nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to go with that.  So it's very nice.  That's nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've been using Quantum, which is the Firefox one.  I was like, I was trying to remember what the, I was like Firefox, fire something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I will definitely use the virtual desktop because I use that all the time on my Mac computer in the other room.  So I like having kind of the multiple spaces to be able to swipe between and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like having external monitors only they're not external at that point, which is really, really handy.  So just kind of to remember what's where and everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yeah, it is set up the right way for you.  Then that becomes pretty easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Android has a has a feature that I guess Chrome is kind of replicating back in Chrome 76 or Chrome OS 76.  Send to self so you can push web pages to your other devices.  So instead of from a phone to a computer, now it's you push a web page or something from Chromebook to any other device that has Chrome.  So that's kind of handy.  OK.  Is it like Chromecasting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like I could push it to a TV if I've got a Chromecast in it or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's more like like a web page sending from one browser to another from one device to another.  Chromecasting is pretty much built into Chrome OS.  So right.  You know. Yeah.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there is another feature that if you're a publisher, you probably don't like coming to Chrome 76.  And that is that Google is making some changes to how incognito mode works.  Now, if you have gone to publishing publisher sites, pay walled sites, let's say that offer a free kind of number of free articles every month.  And, you know, suddenly you go to the article and says, well, you can't read anymore.  You've reached your five free article limit or whatever.  For a while, people had realized that by using incognito, they could continue to get those free articles.  It would always keep that number, that tabulated number set at zero viewed articles.  And you could continue going back.  Well, at some point, some of the new sites began to realize that they though they could not identify, you know,  they couldn't place cookies or anything to track how many free articles you've read in incognito.  They could identify that there was a change in the file system API that was used to detect incognito mode because Chrome was disabling the file system or Chrome is going to disable the file system API.  But prior to this, there was just some sort of recognition that the file system API was being used and the sites could see that.  And so they there was then changing their behavior to say, well, if you're using Chrome and you're using incognito, then we aren't going to let you have any of these free articles.  So there's going to be a change that Google is going to roll into Chrome 76 that will prevent that trace from happening.  So I guess if you want to use incognito to read more articles, you can.  I do not imagine publishers will be very happy about that.  But Google is doing that for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this is kind of a security issue.  And actually, Steve talks about it on Security Now this week that people were kind of misusing this.  And it's not a good thing to leave open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think people believe incognito mode is like super safe, secure and private.  And it depends. It's really the best answer.  I mean, if you never close the tab, you know, it's I guess they call it a thermal or a formal, a formal mode.  The ephemeral. There we go.  That's why. Yeah, that's why I didn't work with that team.  Yeah. So, you know, once you close it, everything kind of disappears.  But it's not as private as people might think.  It's not carte blanche to just do what you want and think you're not being tracked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Yes, there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is definitely a limit while that you run up to private in some ways, not private and others.  I'm curious about this one.  You wrote about the pixel slate that's on sale right now.  If you go to the play store, you get 100 bucks off and you get a keyboard along with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You do. You get your choice of keyboard.  And this deal started on the 21st of July and ends, I believe, the 27th.  So end of this week, there'll be a couple of days after the show, you know, goes out across to everybody that you can do this.  So you get 100 bucks off any model, even the sixteen hundred dollar model, which I wouldn't recommend to anybody.  It's just overkill. I mean, I don't know.  It's it's I mean, I want a core i7 Chromebook, but I don't want one with the mobile type processor because it just doesn't really buy you that much.  But yes, you can get the core M3 model or the core i5 model.  That's the one I bought instead of nine ninety nine.  Mine would be cost cost eight ninety nine.  And then I would get a free either Google Pixel Slate keyboard or the Bridge type G keyboard, which is actually quite good.  You know, see if your choice.  You know, I see a lot of people kind of scoffing at this.  Like there's a conversation on Reddit and they're like, yeah, make it two hundred dollars and I'll take it.  Or the companies already said they're getting out of tablets.  So why would you bother?  I think that's kind of harsh because it doesn't mean they're not going to support these things as clearly as we've already said, they're continuing to improve the tablet experience in Chrome OS for all Chrome OS devices, including the Pixel Slate.  So, you know, if the device is not for everybody, I'm not saying everybody should jump on this deal.  But, you know, if you're split between, say, 50 percent media consumption or tablet mode versus 50 percent laptop mode, it's possibly worth considering.  If you are a pure Chromebook user, no, this is probably not the best deal in the world for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's the right advice right there.  And I am, you know, I am now using the pick my my Pixelbook from the year prior.  I had been using the slate up until up until the news actually that you were just talking about where Google, you know, kind of I can't remember if they officially announced or what the what the what the the wording was around that.  But basically them getting out of the tablet business.  But that at that point, it was kind of my indication that, OK, I can I can go back to the thing that actually works better for me, which is the laptop environment.  I have I really ended up in my however long I was using the slate since it since it launched up until like maybe a month ago.  I had never taken it out in tablet mode and had any sort of use for it in that particular mode.  So I think you're absolutely right. If you if you envision wanting to use it in a tablet sort of way, maybe media consumption or something along those lines, it makes a whole lot more sense.  But if you just want a Chromebook, just because it's the latest one that Google put out doesn't mean you have to get that one.  The Pixelbook is fantastic. And I have to imagine they're going to update the Pixelbook this year at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I believe they are. And something hit the FCC about three hours ago from quanta.  I know it's not on the list, but I literally just wrote it up before the show.  So nine to five, Google actually found this in the FCC filings.  Quanta has gotten the OK to I guess it's a change in what they call it.  It's a change in certification or something.  Basically, they're going to use a new Wi-Fi chip from Intel, the Intel wireless 9265 in some device.  That device happens to have a device ID that sounds very much like the Pixelbook and Pixel Slate.  So chances are it is the likely Pixelbook successor.  And we pretty much said unbelievable.  That's to be the Atlas Chromebook, which has been in the works for a year and a half throughout all the code commits in Chromium.  So I think October is looking good for whatever Atlas is called.  I think the Atlas is called Pixelbook 2, Pixelbook 2019, Jason's Pixelbook.  I don't know what they're going to call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, totally. I think you nailed it.  I think that's what it should be. Awesome.  Well, I will look forward to that because I love my Pixelbook.  It really is a great laptop, great computer.  I feel just as productive with this as any machine that I have.  The Slate was fine.  And like operationally, the Slate was the same.  I mean, Chrome OS is Chrome OS, right?  So it was the same. The keyboard was maybe a little less.  You know, I liked it less than I like the Pixelbook keyboard.  But and definitely kind of the extension.  I ended up with the Pixel Slate keyboard, the kind of like flexible one as opposed to the bridge one.  And I like it for some reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, sorry. Yeah, it has a big footprint because of the way it's designed.  Mine is sitting right here next to me and it's still my daily driver.  I do use it in just like pure tablet mode to watch content when I'm lounging around the house.  I've actually found it useful.  I take it to campus, you know, two, three times a week and do my my CS coding on it in Java.  And then when we have study groups, it's so much easier to just like take it out and just pass it around.  People look at code as we're going over things because it's it's just a tablet at that point.  That's a really specialized use case.  And again, most people don't need that. They'd be better off with a pure a pure Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, agreed.  Cool. We got some late breaking news in there as well.  Also, Google has announced in well, they announced last May that be looking closely at Chrome extensions to be sure that they're playing nice with personal data.  Well, this week, Google announced two new Chrome Web Store policies to be enforced sometime later this year.  They switched from from developers being encouraged to abide to required to abide by policy that requests access to the least amount of data.  I don't know how you how you justify what the least is, but there you go.  They are now required to do that.  Also, extensions dealing with personal communications and user provided content must post privacy policy policies.  So this is a is a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I think it was just last week where some browser extensions gathered data from like four million users.  Right. You know, it's it's it's not good.  So, yeah, that's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bad, bad. We don't like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We like good. We like rewards of up to one hundred fifty thousand dollars.  If you happen to be a Chrome OS bounty hunter, you can make up to one hundred fifty thousand dollars if you demonstrate an attack that compromises Chromebook or Chrome box in the restricted guest mode.  So if you're looking for a big payday and you got some time on your hands, you know, no big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kevin, this is how you could fund your new mesh network purchase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was just thinking, I mean, heck, yeah, I could remove all the ads from my site.  I could get new mesh network in gear.  Yeah. Yeah.  This one is all it takes.  It's like winning the lottery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We solved your problem. You can't play.  You can't win if you don't play.  That's right. Yeah.  That's how it goes.  And then finally, I love that we have this Chrome block.  This is a nice solid Chrome block here.  Kevin, you wrote about the Dell Dell's upcoming Chromebook with integrated LTE.  What's that all about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. So we don't see too many Chromebooks with integrated LTE anymore.  The last one, I think, was the Samsung Chromebook plus V2 that came out about a year ago.  Obviously, the second Pixelbook had LTE.  Was it the first one? I forget which.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not Pixelbook, the Chromebook Pixel.  Yeah, the first one had it.  Yeah, Jeff really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is a feature Jeff has been hankering after.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I haven't seen based on the Wi-Fi chip on the Atlas.  I don't think we're going to see LTE in there, but it sure looks like well,  I'm pretty much 100 percent feeling positive about this.  Dell has got two Chromebooks in the work.  One is called code name Sarian.  The other is called Arcata.  And there's been some testing being done on the Verizon wireless network  for integrated LTE on Sarian.  So I captured this right out of the Google Chromium bug reports.  So it's legit.  It sure looks to me like at least one of the two from Dell will indeed have LTE.  Dell hasn't announced these, of course.  One of these may be detachable based on Chrome commits.  One appears to be a traditional two in one.  The reason I say Dell is the likely brand is because some people with Dell  email addresses have actually responded in the code commits to approve the code changes.  So it's again, pretty likely that that's the case.  So don't know when.  Hopefully by the end of the year, we'll see two new options and at least one of them with LTE,  which you're right, Stacey, Jeff and many other people want LTE in their Chromebooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a bummer we don't see more of them.  That was a really cool feature.  And I mean, you know, these companies should know that if they make one, Jeff will buy it.  So, yeah, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. Maybe no one else will.  Jeff Jarvis, customer electronics business.  I hear that's a highly lucrative market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Someone's just got to take the reins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A lot of people don't see the benefit.  At least I've gotten comments from my readers on the LTE integration and they're like,  I don't see the benefit.  I've got a phone that can be a hotspot and I've got unlimited data.  So what do I need this for?  And I get that.  I understand that.  But using your phone as a hotspot eats through battery very fast.  And it's like, what do you need at the end of the day?  You need your phone to have a charge, you know, maybe not your Chromebook.  So I tend to not use my phone as a hotspot.  Integrated LTE would be nice.  Yeah, agreed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Agreed.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  And when we come back, we'll talk about a few other things going on, maybe a little  of the antitrust stuff, the Department of Justice, Facebook has some interesting stuff  going on, the change law.  We've got a few things to still wrap up.  But before we get there, I want to welcome our old friend Leo Laporte back to the show.  Leo, pull up a chair over in the corner over there and tell me something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you don't mind, I'd like to interrupt real quick just to mention a new advertiser that  I think has a great product.  I know a lot of you will want.  They're called Ahrefs.  Now, it's a little confusing because the A is silent in Ahrefs.  It's spelled and anybody who knows HTML will recognize the pun here.  Ahrefs.com.  You know, it's a problem.  Anybody who's got a website, whether you're a big business, a small business, maybe you're  a freelancer, getting traffic to your website is always tough.  It's not always clear what you need to do.  And if you ask Google this, it would just make better content.  No, no, no.  There's also a lot of SEO snake oil.  People are selling you expensive services that really, frankly, don't do anything.  I love Ahrefs.  It's an all-in-one set of tools for search engine optimization.  It gives you the tools you need to help you rank on Google.  And it really works.  For instance, Ahrefs has competitive analysis.  Are there sites that are showing up better than your site when they search for your category?  Those competitors are beating you out.  How are they doing it?  Ahrefs will show you how your competitors are getting traffic from Google, what they're doing.  You'll see the pages and the content that sends your competitors the most traffic.  You also find out the exact keywords your competitors rank for and which backlinks are helping them rank.  And from there, you can replicate their strategies or better yet, improve on their strategies and improve on your ranking.  If you're not getting significant search traffic, Ahrefs tools will help you find topics worth creating pages on or content on.  Topics will drive traffic for you.  You can easily see, in fact, what kind of search volume you're going to get from that particular new page or content.  You can gauge the traffic potential.  They have this keywords explorer tool that will let you try ideas and see what kind of results you're going to get.  It really helps you direct your efforts into the most effective way to build traffic to your website.  And after all, building traffic to your website means building business for you.  If you're getting search traffic already, you might want to know things like the top pages report that helps you break down which of your pages are bringing in the most traffic, which aren't.  It really is helpful to know all this.  Information is power.  And I think this is so good and it's so affordable.  In fact, they offer a lot of free information.  If you check out the Ahrefs blog or go to their YouTube channel, you get step by step tutorials.  And I love the tools.  Seven dollars for seven days.  That is a great trial.  Seven day trial.  Just seven dollars.  Here's how you get it.  Go to Ahrefs.com.  A-H-R-E-F-S dot com.  Get it?  The A is silence.  Play on Ahrefs.  A-H-R-E-F-S dot com.  The A is silent.  Seven dollars for seven days.  I think you're going to find these tools incredibly valuable.  We thank Ahrefs so much for supporting this week in Google.  I thank you for supporting us by going to Ahrefs.com.  Now, back to the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, Leo.  I catch the ball.  You go back to your vacation.  I've got this.  Settle down.  So, a few interesting things of note.  Tony Roem at the Washington Post had a scoop earlier this week that the FTC was going to  issue a five billion dollar fine to Facebook for privacy violations that were related to  the Cambridge Analytica kerfuffle.  It's two times today that I've been able to say that word from last year.  And the FTC mold stronger penalties, ultimately deciding to go with five billion as the fine  that officially today the FTC announced this, the largest fine in US history for privacy  violations.  Although many people are thinking it didn't go far enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, how much did their stock go up that day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's a good question.  So this was a couple of...  Six.  Six, in fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Six billion, their stock went up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A couple of days ago when it was rumored to be happening.  When it was rumored to be happening, yes.  And then what is the change today now that the FTC has officially announced it?  Let's see here.  What's there?  It's still going up.  I mean, yeah, it's up 1.4% today.  So, I mean, Facebook's doing all right.  Not too shabby.  I mean, there's other components of this.  It grants federal regulators 20 years of access to Facebook's business decisions.  Facebook basically has to create some sort of an independent committee in its board of  directors to monitor and oversee privacy and then report quarterly to FTC on compliance  for the next 20 years.  Facebook was not required to admit guilt.  Facebook is absolved of anything prior to like 2018.  So, I mean, many people just kind of are on the edge of the edge of the edge of the edge  and are arguing that $5 billion is a bargain for the fact that Facebook got away with so  much and doesn't have to change any of their ad practices going forward.  What do you guys think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the orders that came through with this are pretty lame.  I mean, they're like, hey, Facebook encrypt user passwords and scan to detect if any of  those user passwords are in plain text.  Like everyone should be doing this and don't use or don't grab email passwords from other  services.  That's not the issue.  The issue is things like tracking pixels and back, not backhanded agreements between  companies to share data that consumers may not be aware of.  Facebook is prohibited from using telephone numbers obtained to enable a security feature  for advertising, which is like the bare minimum.  I don't know if you guys all remember, but they had done this thing where they were like,  hey, give us your phone number for two factor.  And then suddenly people were like, hey, they seem to be using my phone number for other  stuff.  They also said that they were going to take action against Cambridge Analytica, take legal  action against the FTC announced they were going to take legal action against Cambridge  Analytica.  But overall, this is pretty lame.  Oh, and there's a thing about facial recognition saying that they are Facebook must provide  clear and conspicuous notice of all its use of facial recognition technology and obtain  affirmative express user consent prior to any use that materially exceeds its prior  disclosures.  So basically, if it wants to do new stuff with your old photos, it has to get more consent  from you on that.  And going forward, it has to ask.  But again, these are.  Table stage.  Yeah, these are basic.  This is not new ground.  But the FTC feels uncomfortable going too far because there's no actual legal.  There's no congressional rules.  And this is an area where we do actually need Congress to step up and come up with some  sort of privacy regulations because the FTC is right.  It cannot go forward and make new laws, right?  It can only regulate the existing laws on the books.  And Facebook could come back.  It didn't in this case, but it could have come back and said, hey, you know what?  We don't agree with you, FTC.  And then this could have went into court.  And even the basic recommendations that Facebook had agreed to might have been lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I kind of an agreement.  I mean, everybody you can debate if five billion is enough or not enough, et cetera.  That to me, that's not the issue.  It's what are they?  What does the company have to do going forward?  Not too much different.  I mean, you have to be a little more oversight and so on.  But and then it's I think it's a missed opportunity.  And I wonder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Again, I would say it's a wake up call to say, hey, we don't have our regulatory agencies  don't have the tools they need to actually go after these problems that we're seeing with the  the world that we have in front of us with technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I don't disagree.  It's it's a shame.  I mean, it's not like Facebook is a new company or any of these social networks like brand new.  I mean, heck, not that they're involved with this, but I think I joined Twitter in 2006 or 13 years ago.  You know, that's when you started having all this social networking really taking off.  And if you didn't see this coming, it's like, come on, guys, what are you doing?  But one question I have, where's the five billion dollars go?  Because it was individual citizens whose privacy was was, you know, abused basically.  And yet we're not getting the money, are we?  No, no, absolutely not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a really good question.  And it'll be interesting to see like what you're talking about at Congressional oversight,  like, you know, also in the news today, Attorney General William Barr announced this was today or yesterday.  But the Justice Department is opening a big antitrust review of all the big tech companies.  Facebook included yesterday.  Facebook included, of course, but also Google, Amazon, Apple to really take a look and examine the online  platforms, their practices and search social media retail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that feels way more political than it does a legit effort to enforce real private or to implement real privacy regulations.  That feels like a Trump said called Barnes like I'm pissed at these companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fix it. Right. Right. Make their lives miserable.  At a tariff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, in fact, didn't even tweet about this.  Many people are talking about these companies getting too big.  May ask Barr to look into it.  What do you know? Barr is looking into it.  How about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the Justice Department will be working alongside the FTC.  The FTC had already created a task force to monitor tech competition last February.  Now they're going to be working together to explore these issues.  I think they already have to some degree.  But yeah, so I don't know.  I don't know if that will influence what we're talking about as well with Facebook somewhere down the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The FTC issued a really excellent report all the way back in 2015 about the dangers to people's privacy.  It had the same things that we've talked about in terms of social networking, in terms of like metadata collection,  in terms of location data collection.  It had all of this.  And the FTC's ultimate conclusion was this report is like, this is a big problem.  As an agency, we don't have the legal grounding to protect consumers.  Congress, please write a law.  Four years later, we are still waiting for that law.  And this was a report that was started in 2013.  It took them a year and a half to make this report.  It drives me absolutely bonkers.  Because we look at this like this is something like this is something they can actually solve and they can't.  And we keep ignoring the fact that we actually need to do something from a legislative perspective.  And given how slow we are here and the fact that we have nothing credible on the table, we're still three or four years out.  And we this fine, if anything, shows you're like, oh, it's a billion dollars.  But basically it shows this is like the literal limit of what the FTC can do.  And it's pretty lame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a good way to put it.  I think you're I think you're spot on.  I agree.  Barr also, by the way, yesterday said that encryption should include backdoors for law enforcement to protect us.  So we've heard that one before, too.  Who knows where that's going to lead?  And he's considered legislation to force tech companies to do this.  I'm not surprised.  Not surprised at all.  What am I missing anything before we jump into the change log?  Anything that that we've skipped over that you guys definitely wanted to talk about?  Figure we can do the change log, do some tips and picks and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought that the German courts deciding that Deutsche Telkom for the owner.  Well, it's not the owner T-Mobile anymore.  But saying that they couldn't use stream on and zero rating was kind of a useful thing.  It's not in the US.  But I was like, go Germany for enforcing net neutrality, even if it's, you know, benefiting consumers because it's the principle that we need to implement.  OK, that's it.  I miss that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And actually, again, related to that, I think I think I just read today and I'll see if I can dig up a link real quick.  But in India, is it Netflix that is coming out with a two dollar service or three dollars?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There it's a mobile only service.  So, yeah, that I would I would like that.  You're not in India.  Although I already have Netflix for everything.  Yeah.  So DVD quality.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  It's it's for it's for it.  Is it?  Yeah, it's for 80.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep.  OK, but still to 88 a month when you do it.  But it's a hundred ninety nine rupees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't need like 1080p on your phone.  Oh, totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I guess it depends on your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You will with that Pixel 3A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you'll be missing it on the Pixel 3A.  But even then, if you're only paying three dollars a month, who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of cell phone providers will only give you for 780, 720 or 480.  That's it.  So, yeah, or 80 for 90.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somewhere around there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's that's pretty.  That's a that's a bargain right there.  As far as I'm concerned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When I win that dog bounty, I'm going to move to India.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The money's going to go.  Oh, we'll never record again, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It'll be way too early or too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is true.  And it's time.  Why don't we jump into the Google change log?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Log, log, log, log, log.  And we've got a few bits and pieces in here.  Google Photos updated for Android or is updating rather.  I don't know that I've seen the update yet to bring live video preview into the the main photos tab.  So if you're scrolling through, there happens to be a video in there instead of just showing you a video,  a little indicator that it or like a thumbnail with a little indicator that it is a video.  That video is going to start playing no audio.  So the little thumbnails will start playing one at a time.  So if you've got a page filled with a bunch of videos, it's not going to like have all of them playing.  That would be kind of chaotic.  It'll play the oldest one and then move to the next one.  But it'll play in full if you hover there long enough and don't want to hear the audio.  There you go.  I find myself like when I'm scrolling through social media and there's a video there, I do it all the time now.  Like, I don't even think about it.  I end up watching and reading the subtitles instead of actually listening.  It's a feature I never thought I would I would be happy to use.  And yet I do it all the time.  So me too. Yeah, it's very useful.  Google announced a ban to root certificates that are owned by dark matter.  This after Mozilla actually banned them two weeks ago.  Dark matter is reported to be involved with surveillance operations affecting human rights activists, journalists and foreign governments.  So Google is cracking down on the dark matter.  That's a good thing.  Also, I like this.  I think this would be really cool.  Google's updating fast pair functionality in Android later this year to allow for better battery life information, better battery life data for wireless earphones.  They're basically going to rope this into Android Q, the UI, you know, in the settings or whatever.  So it's going to allow you to to see if you're using a fast pair enabled earphone brand or model, it's going to allow you to see the remaining battery on each independent earphone, the remaining battery inside of the charger, whether the charger is open or closed, be able to un-pair, which I mean, I think you can still do that.  Also to ring them and track them and find in what is it?  Find my device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So and it may not just be for Android because there are bits and pieces of code and some screenshots on Reddit showing it on Chromebooks as well.  Oh, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would make a lot of sense.  That'd be really cool.  I like that.  I think that's an awesome feature.  This is neat and very useful.  Google research team built something called Smiley.  Smiley, it's a tool that acts as reverse image search for aiding in cancer diagnosis.  Smiley stands for similar medical images like yours.  And essentially what it's designed to do, it's a tool that the user would drop in a sample image from a patient and Google's machine learning algorithms would then compare it to the cancer genome atlas to compare regions.  And it gives, you know, gives doctors or whoever happens to be using this tools for closer specification, for determining what results the system should return.  It's basically all about identifying what exactly they're looking at compared to other samples in the cancer genome atlas.  It's an experiment for now.  Doctors who used it said they preferred it over their traditional interfaces.  That sounds like a really useful, useful technology for something like this.  And I just have to imagine we're going to see more and more of this sort of thing in medicine.  That is really cool.  And then finally, Google will mark apps in the Play Store with a new label when an app is not meant to target younger age groups.  It will be not designed for children will be the call out.  It'll appear just under the install button and show like a little yellow triangle to get your attention.  It will always be present there.  Developers are required to specify target age range for their apps.  They have a deadline of September 1st to make that happen.  But that'll make it easier when you're in the Play Store to know whether this is something that might not be appropriate for younger, younger children.  ScooterX in chat says it's already there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel it would be fun or interesting or helpful.  Is to actually I guess they can't do this without creating like keeping data, but giving parents the ability to create a like an account for their kids.  And I know there's family is a family link family.  Family link. Yeah.  Yeah. So and then being able to put that over an entire device that you could actually lock to even just Google services would be interesting.  So like then the YouTube like it's tied to the hardware, not necessarily to the hardware, but to the whole OS for the phone.  So like it's like an Android for under 13 set.  Right. And that way the pair it would make it easier for parents trying to manage stuff.  But things like safe search could be by default, figuring out the app store would only show these appropriate apps.  Oh, I see what you mean.  So then would be YouTube kids.  Yeah, they would be so pissed.  But so I don't know.  I mean, like you could even I mean, when do you do this right now when you upload a YouTube video?  Can you specify age range or explicit content?  I can't remember. It's been forever since I've paid attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't uploaded a video to YouTube in a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, yes, people will still game the system, but you could verify things.  And maybe that makes it like maybe by adding just a few extra constructs when you upload content, you could you could still make it relatively easy for stuff to be vetted.  I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe I'm hopelessly naive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's a good idea.  And I don't know if you can do that on Android.  I know on the Chromebook side, you can kind of do that and like limit access to the Play Store or a subset of apps or et cetera.  But I don't know about Chrome OS.  I'm sorry about Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ScooterX coming to the rescue again says age restricted videos are not visible to users who are logged out or under 18 years of age or have restricted mode enabled.  Nice.  All those things and a link in the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But how do you know if something's age restricted?  Thank you, ScooterX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Well, I have to imagine that the person uploading the video adds the flag.  But of course, not everybody's going to have that flag if they especially if they have ill intentions.  So how is that? How is that tracked and enforced?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this is yeah, this isn't going to.  Yeah. Anyway, I mean, because I just think of things like on the like Apple with the with iTunes or with podcasts, for example, you know, we keep our podcasts clean because we don't want to get flagged.  Right. I think you guys probably do the same thing as explicit because then that one show off into this.  Netherworld. Oh, sorry.  I would assume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no. Maybe you won't.  Oh, you will.  You will. OK.  Because it's just the worst when you have that build up and then you don't end up sneezing.  I feel cheated when that happens.  Bless you.  Bless you again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been sneezing for a long time, you guys.  Bless you, Stacy.  The point is Google is not as active as Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're allergic to this story.  I get it.  I understand.  Well, then why don't we move into pics and Stacy, I won't I won't I won't select you first.  We'll give you time to recover.  Kevin.  Give me a minute.  Yes.  Kevin, what's your stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's rather timely and historical, I think.  There is a YouTube channel of a guy.  I think the channel is Curious Mike.  I forget.  But I've got a link in the show notes.  And what this guy does is he repairs, he buys, finds and repairs computer hardware from the 70s and all kinds of old, old stuff.  And he stumbled onto a guy who bought the actual Apollo guidance computer for the moon landing.  No way.  Yes, he did.  He was.  He restored it.  And this is a lengthy video and it can be boring at some times.  But what he's done is he has literally replicated the lunar landing or an attempt at it.  And you can see how difficult it is to program this thing because it's all done by numbers.  Like he would say, OK, program 65.  We're going to run that for 45 seconds.  And he would literally type 65 enter 45 enter and then wait.  And the program would kick in.  And what amazes me, not that just that he restored it and can replicate the landing.  It's just amazing to me that this is what was used to land on the moon 50 years ago.  Like he's entering.  Yeah, that seven key is stuck.  He's entering, you know, whatever the ignition now.  And then then he has to put something else in.  And that kicks off the sequence for something else to happen.  That's the interface.  It's all numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, 50 years ago, this was like crazy high tech right here.  And it, you know, it's it's a level technology.  Yes. And it's only crazy now.  Think about it.  It's science people.  Things have changed so much since then.  But this was the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the whole series.  I think this is like this is like part 21 of restoring the Apollo computers.  But he debuted this on the day the people landed on the moon and 50 years later.  And it was just amazing to see and how challenging it was to use.  I mean, these guys were able to quote unquote land on the moon with us.  But even so, their horizontal speed was like 21 feet per second.  So they would have tipped the lunar lander over.  So just amazing that we could do that with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding.  That is really something that is worth the watch.  Worth the watch.  Worth more views than it has.  Something like thirty four thousand views.  It's kind of crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People don't seem to care about computers from the 60s and 70s like I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I'm going to watch the hell out of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Carson is going to have it on repeat in our office.  I'm going to come in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is this is this a thing for you, Carson?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am I am fascinated with the with the computer technology of Apollo 11.  I have a little Lego Lego figure of Margaret Hamilton on my desk.  Very nice.  So, yeah, this one's for you.  Thank you very much.  That would be Carson's stuff as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, Stacey, you feeling better?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Recovered.  OK, I think so.  What you got?  What do I?  Oh, I know what I have.  OK, this is this is something I bought at the beta store because I'm going to be  at the beta store because I don't know.  I was at the beta store and this is for bras.  So this is probably 90 percent of your audience is going to be like, no, done.  But I was fascinated by the idea that this is a where to go.  It's called the Soma.  Let's see. Innofit.  And it is made to you put this guy over you.  It's like a little sports bra looking thing.  And you try it on and it measures your boobs in your chest basically to give you the  right bra size.  Oh, and here I am showing mine.  But you've got that up on there.  So great.  And it's it is accurate.  It works with your phone.  And then the downside, though, for me is I paid twenty five dollars for this because  it's connected and I had to try it.  But it locks me into buying only bras from a certain brand.  And I haven't gotten my bras yet, but the wire cutter says that they may not fit as  well.  And that's disappointing because I love the idea.  The company that does this is called Like a Glove.  And their goal or one of their goals is to make products like to allow you to buy clothes  virtually that will fit you and that you'll have like.  But it's only as good as like how the data is applied.  And this doesn't look like it's being applied very individually.  So that's like being able to time my measurements to a given manufacturer is really useful.  And for the guys there who may not realize this, bras are sized very individually.  So a thirty four C in one brand is not the same as a thirty four C in another brand.  And it's very frustrating when you're trying to actually buy a bra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if I could make a recommendation, my wife's newest favorite subreddit is R slash a bra  that fits.  And they go way deep into this.  If if we have listeners who are having trouble getting bras that fit, go to Reddit,  reddit.com slash R slash a bra that fits and they will help you out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They might even have a review, their own review of the of the Soma, the Soma InnoFit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which, you know, it I'm also curious about like, hey, sensor technology and clothing is always like one of my favorite things.  So but but yeah, I was a little disappointed in in the experience so far.  But we'll see if the bras I get are like a revelation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Oh, my goodness. Never, never better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, because if not, then true and co, which just has you to a questionnaire and basically algorithmically comes up with different across many brands like the ones that would work for you,  which is a way better idea than this. Right. Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Having to buy like a piece of technology to figure it out versus just going on a site that's really good at understanding the numbers between all the different brands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of like which future is going to be our right.  Which is the better future here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know which one I want.  But if this is more accurate, I'd rather have that.  Yeah. Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the Soma, you know, fit and we've included a link in the show notes to wire cutter review of that as well to check out.  My pick is a new app that Google actually just announced today.  It's called Gallery Go.  And, you know, Google has a lot has released a lot of its main apps in Go versions, which are basically meant to be low footprint apps, very lightweight apps that replicate much of the functionality of their full size apps.  They're full size app counterparts.  But in many cases, you know, it's very much intended for locations around the world that are maybe, you know, less access to data or people don't, you know, have a data plan in some cases or whatever or their devices might be lower specced.  All of these so they don't it doesn't have the enough storage to hold the larger apps.  And so this falls into that category Gallery Go and actually, I don't know if you have the all about Android over the shoulder camera.  I forgot to.  That works. Yeah.  I mean, kind of.  It's okay. They're my pictures anyway, so you don't need to see them full screen.  But it's it's all on device.  It's 10 megs for the app entirely.  It's all offline.  So none of this is synced to the web like your normal Google Apps would be.  It's just everything that's stored on your device.  It has an auto auto coloration function and I can kind of do a before and after there.  But cancel that also got some basic editing controls like rotate crop and a number of different filters and stuff that you can hop between.  And you can save a copy once you're done with that.  And I mean, that that's really it.  You've got the images, of course, laid out there.  It seems to denote screenshots that are saved on my phone.  So that's kind of interesting.  I guess I have a lot of screenshots saved on here.  And then it does have a section, a separate section for video files as well that you can go into as well.  So if you're looking for a lightweight gallery that isn't the full blown Google Photos experience, you can look for Gallery Go.  It's actually available today.  It's a two day like I said, it's designed for developing markets, but it's available to all and you can find it in the Play Store for free.  Of course, that is Gallery Go.  And that, as they say, is that and we've reached the end of this week's episode of this week in Google and Stacy and Kevin, thank you so much for hopping on today with me.  This is a lot of fun.  It always is.  It is getting the chance to chat with you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had a chance to see Kevin's glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we know.  Yeah, no, it's still kind of a fuzzy feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The good I got the Google Wi Fi access point working on a break.  And for some reason, it's connected to this new Wi Fi point, but the upload speed is utter crap.  So I'm going to deal with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Well, if it's any consolation, I think your glasses look great in like 280p or whatever we're looking at right now.  Not even.  Thank you.  You bet.  About Chromebooks.com is your site.  And of course, you also do the IOT podcast along with Stacy.  Anything else you want to want to plug, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
