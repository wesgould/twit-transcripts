Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hi, great to be here.  Happy to be here.  Yes.  Happy and gay to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's happy and gay today.  She's gay and happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Always gay and happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When did gay stop meaning happy?  That's my question.  It should still mean happy.  One word does it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. One word does it all.  In my case, it does mean happy.  As well as.  As well as gay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay. We were talking about the president's decision that in fact,  people of the same sex should be able to marry, but it's up to the states.  Really. I ain't got nothing against it, but it's up to the states.  Or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a journey of many small steps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. It's politics.  You know, it's politics.  And it's politics.  First, they said, Joe, I can just imagine this call.  Joe, you got to do it.  You got to go out there and take one for the president.  So Joe Biden, like three days ago, says gay marriage is fine.  And they said, apparently somebody said, Mr. President, that's not sufficient.  Oh, right.  Also with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On Twitter, the world is asking for Joe Biden to come out in favor of legalizing marijuana.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There you go.  Joe, Joe's the guy.  Joe's that's the why.  That's why you don't want to be vice president.  Mr. Jeff Jarvis is here from Buzz Machine.com.  He's a professor of journalism at the City University of New York.  Have you been watching VEEP, the new show?  Yes.  Love it.  Elaine from Seinfeld as a vice president for an unnamed president of an unnamed party.  But it's exactly, I mean, it's perfect for her because she's always a little bit angry  about things anyway, right?  And she's just got no power.  She keeps asking her assistant, has the president called?  Her assistant says no.  She says no.  It's very funny.  It's very funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's about it took about 10 minutes, 12 minutes to get you into the groove.  And then once you were in the groove, they established everything and you knew the sense  of humor and it was very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it's just perfect for them.  And they apparently improv a lot.  So there's really, oh yeah, there's some wildly just kind of crazy moments that I just enjoy.  Good.  Well, I'm glad we got the TV critic to watch one of our shows, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I got support last week for Mad Men.  Really?  I got people saying you're right about Mad Men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's the greatest show ever made.  Easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's better undercurrents of it being overrated.  I don't see it because I love it, but I've heard some people say, you know,  this just isn't what it's cracked up to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not as good as I was looking back at the earlier seasons and really it was better in  the first couple of seasons without January Jones.  I don't like it quite as much.  Although there's a you got to love Zubi Zubi Zoo Lady, but I don't know.  Anyway, enough of that silliness.  We could talk about Glee some more, but we're going to do a television show.  Clearly.  We clearly have to do a show.  But then Jeff, we'd have to make him watch TV and he doesn't want to do that anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I know I do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's your favorite show right now, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see.  HBO.  I end up watching.  I watch.  Not sure, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, now that he's not a TV critic, Jeff, for how many years,  for decades you're a TV critic.  So now he doesn't care anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had a crush on What's Her Name on Weeds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love her too.  Jennifer spoiled Weeds for me because she pointed out that  she's always holding her frappuccino with a claw.  And now I can no longer watch that show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She does.  She has the claw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'm sure she can do the sexy schwerp with the straw.  I hate that.  Oh, no, it's very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  You know, me too.  What's her name?  Mary Louise Elizabeth Parker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm quite enamored of her.  I'm sorry, Leo, I'm leaving you now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm in love with her too.  We could marry her together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's it.  Yeah, because we, after all, once you go to gay marriage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, animals, four at a time, whatever, anything goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Girls is very good.  Bruce Bryce is liking girls.  Girls took, it's taken a while to grow on me, but I'm kind of liking it.  Game of Thrones.  Okay.  That's because you read the book, right?  Game of Thrones is kind of sick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's getting dark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's very disturbing and dark.  All those heads on spikes are really getting to me.  Enough with the heads on spikes.  It was one thing to read it, another thing to see it.  I can't believe I'm liking the big C.  You know, I didn't like, I like her.  I've gotten into it.  I've gotten into it too.  All right, I'll have to watch some more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nurse Jackie, I was not hot on her.  Love Nurse Jackie.  Love Nurse Jackie.  Borgias.  Borgias is great.  But Jeremy Irons, how can you not love Jeremy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sherlock is the best show.  Feld is right.  Sherlock is great.  The best show on television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Modern Family, The Middle.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love Modern Family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Modern Family is okay for a network sitcom, it's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Community.  Community is pretty good.  Oh my God, community is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a sleeper though, isn't it?  I mean, I don't know if people know that that's a good show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A lot of people DVR that show, so they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They'll know someday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The one I don't like much is, which gets me in trouble with people, not as much as Madden.  Don't say Smash.  No, no, no, no, no, of course not.  I wouldn't say that.  Love Smash.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Smash is glee for grownups.  It is.  So good.  For theater geeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For theater geeks.  So good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Parks and Rec.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that's horrible.  Amy Poehler is horrible.  Okay, you agree?  Okay, yeah.  Horrible.  It's not funny.  It's like they're trying to be The Office with that talent.  Yeah.  Actually, The Office is pretty horrible these days too.  It is now too, yeah.  God, has that gone downhill.  30 Rocks still?  30 Rocks still great.  Tana Fey, she's not lost her touch.  What happened to this show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This week in television.  Did you ever do it?  Edit this all out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Edit this all out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You should do the TV show.  We'll do the TV show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We do a TV show.  It's called Frame Rate.  Right.  Tom Merritt does it.  We could just make this one into one.  We could just make this Frame Rate 2.  Yeah, exactly.  Let's do it.  We'll really piss off the chamber.  We should really talk about your favorite podcasts,  your favorite YouTube channel, that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will plug then, since you opened it up,  one of my entrepreneurial students, Ashley Miltite,  formerly heard of often on public radio's marketplace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Her name is Ashley Miltite?  Miltite.  Ashley Miltite.  Wow, that's a name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's great.  Actually, what turns out is that her father decided to just add the Milt for the heck of it.  It's not even like a name.  No, but she's got a great British accent.  She's hyphenated.  I love that.  So she's from XMPR, or X Public Radio, pardon me,  and has a new podcast called The Broad Experience.  And she interviewed none other than our very own Gina Grapani.  It's a great show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's great.  She's obviously pro, has NPR experience.  The show is short.  It's 8 to 10 minutes.  It's on women in the workplace.  It's really good.  I really enjoyed doing the interview with her.  I'm glad that I got in on it.  Kind of only a few episodes in.  I think she's only three or four episodes in.  But she's still in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's actually at The Broad Experience.  It's not there.  I tweeted it.  It's not on her website.  I know she screwed up.  I just emailed her.  The guy's going to downgrade her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love the name, The Broad Experience.  God, that's a good name.  It works on so many levels.  Let me see if I can find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought it was.  I know it is on her website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is there.  Okay.  Somewhere because Google said it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you go up to listen, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is there a listen?  Archives about subscription.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Broad Experience.squarespace.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're a Squarespace user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're our sponsor today.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, if you're smart and you're doing a podcast.  Oh, you see you can subscribe right here.  I get it.  By doing that, she gets free bandwidth.  Well, 16 bucks a month for bandwidth unlimited.  So that's a really smart thing to do for a podcast.  Anyway, I've just subscribed to it apparently.  Thank you very much.  Welcome to The Broad Experience.  Oh, look, and she's also using SoundCloud.  You know what?  She's smart.  She's doing all the right things here.  She has a great accent.  And she's appreciate.  So you are on episode two?  I think episode three.  Women in Technology.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Welcome to The Broad Experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With my other student named Ada who's  starting a book, a business called.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  God, she has a great voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, she's got a great voice.  She's been talking about being hotly debated at the moment.  Women and technology and why so few women work in this sector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She should read Winnie the Pooh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I asked her whether her father added Milne because he was a Pooh fan.  She never had thought to ask him that.  I think she is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He is Milne type.  At least it's not milled type.  I don't know what that would be, but it sounds like a part for a car.  All right.  We do have tech news of some kind here.  Hangouts on Air is now everywhere.  And there's a lot of excitement about that.  We use Hangouts on Air for Trey Ratcliffe's podcast.  Right.  Yeah.  Trey variety hour.  And so we've had he's had access to that for a while.  Cocoa Club used it this week.  So what is different in the Hangouts on Air?  How does that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's live and it's archived and automatically saved on YouTube.  And anybody can do it.  Yeah.  So this week the Coco Army did it with their hero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know who I mean?  Oh, Coco Army.  I'm being stupid.  XNBC.  Not Keith Olbermann.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Conan O'Brien.  Conan O'Brien.  Okay.  Whatever happened to Keith Olbermann?  You know, I ran into the new president of Current, David Borman, who's an old friend.  And I said that must have been really interesting because  Olbermann was hired before Borman became president of Current.  And he just went, someday I'll buy you a drink and tell you the whole story.  You need to buy him one.  So you can broadcast publicly if you check the box.  In fact, we could do it right now, I think, because I think I have that.  Capability, I believe.  You check the box that says, enable Hangouts on Air.  You can broadcast your Hangout live from the Google Plus stream,  your YouTube channel or your website to the entire world.  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's really cool.  I mean, this really kind of gives anybody the ability to do a Twitter style,  talking at show at any time.  Right?  And you can embed the live stream onto your website.  Right.  So somebody doesn't have to go to Google Plus.  That's great.  And I believe you can do it from mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you can do it from mobile as well.  I think you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is the new Hangouts on Air interface you'll see.  And so, it's a little slow right now.  There we go.  Enable Hangouts on Air.  You check this.  You could even, we'll use your YouTube channel.  And of course, you've tied your YouTube channel to your Google account.  And then you say, okay.  And then you can restrict miners.  You can start, you know, playing about that here.  Yeah.  You could say who this is and I could, you know what I could do  and what I did last time is I could say technology journalists.  That's always nice to limit it to those for my Hangouts.  And then, or you can join an existing Hangout.  Now, and then it's going to record it and put it up on your YouTube channel.  This is cool.  Hanging out is fun with friends.  Or I could just click on these people, I guess, and say, hey, come on in Tom Merritt.  Should I do that?  Yeah, do Tom and Kevin.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's do Tom.  I'm sure Kevin's sitting there watching.  Probably.  All right.  And then what else do I have to do?  Okay, that's good.  Name it.  Oh, let's say testing on air and then Hangout.  Then it does the usual, you know, I see myself.  Oh, that's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin is there.  Kevin is on chat.  So here we go.  Hi, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now I have, I have, boy, that I guess the picture is getting a little bit better here.  Let's start the broadcast.  Click that button.  And so that will put a tweet out on my, oh, there's Tom Merritt joining us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin, Kevin.  Come on, Kevin.  Hey, Tom Merritt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's drinking.  He's drinking heavily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On company time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now I can turn the microphone on, camera on, settings.  There's some Google effects.  We've already seen these, but just in case you haven't, I can use a Google effect.  But I'm going to have to get a new computer.  This thing is like...  Yeah, this is way slow.  Mo-lasses.  Oh, now I'm hearing myself.  That's even better.  All right.  So I can be a late night host.  That guy you were trying to remember.  This is kind of cool that they actually give you Conan hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How does he get that?  That's very funny.  I can also put a hat on if I want.  This is of course all stuff that everybody has a logitech camera has been able to do  for ages, but Google's decided that this belongs in.  And there's Kevin Marks joining us.  Hello there.  Hey, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hang on.  Hey, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is very bizarre because you're actually streaming on the other...  I know.  It's probably very confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hang on.  It looks like my camera's not happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apparently, I still have this hat on.  Well, we get the idea.  I mean, I just...  And then I can have a birthday cake or a mustache.  They've added stuff since...  I feel like Josh Topolski with these glasses.  Joshua Topolski joining us right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you can't give someone else effects.  You can only add effects to your own.  Only yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And apparently, they're cumulative, which is interesting.  So you can really make yourself look like an idiot.  Hey, Mario.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Will they replace the background too?  Is that what I chat used to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I chat does that.  I guess not this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like a fake green screen where you just hit it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  would have got out of shot and then it...  Right.  I'm in Hawaii right now.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Stuff in like fish.  Okay.  Tom Mary just put a beard,  Topolski glasses, and a top hat on.  I have a Mario mustache and a cat in the hat hat.  And...  But I might go for the dog look here.  Let's see how...  Have you ever seen a dog with a mustache?  Get ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a slow news week, folks.  No, it's not.  That's the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it's the Monopoly millionaire, Tom Merritt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  The dog is pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The dog with a mustache?  No, it's...  It's...  For people who are listening and not watching this podcast,  trust me, you're not missing anything exactly.  You're very lucky.  Just keep...  Just fast forward.  Yeah, just fast forward past this section.  Look at Tom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've got a hangout invite on my phone as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I want to talk about how YouTube and Google replace  network television.  I'll point to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, this is exactly what network television has wanted for so very long.  But I do think that this is a very empowering technology  for somebody who wants to do a podcast.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's that looking like a pig?  It's not a pig.  That's a dog.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a little...  I mean, look, they got a little work to do.  It's a little slow.  It's a little funky.  And I guess depending on your bandwidth, it's probably not going to...  You need a lot of bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kevin's not sending video on purpose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you're looking pretty good to me, but you clearly didn't like my camera today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I must have had Skype open a little.  But look at Tom Merritt.  I mean, just fantastic.  Until he drinks a beer.  And then his beard, glasses, and hat just get left behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Something...  Trust me, this is actually a sort of actual anonymization technique.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you could use this.  It certainly would take a boring podcast and make it interesting.  Not that it's done that for us, but in theory.  In theory.  Anyway, I'm going to let you all go.  Thank you, Kevin.  Thank you, Tom.  See you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  See you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thanks, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice mustache.  Or beard.  This Hangout is now over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you are broadcasting publicly, as we will...  Oh, maybe not.  No, I didn't say public.  I said those people.  Your recording will now be uploaded and automatically replace the live video on the player.  Please allow a few minutes for the upload and processing.  So when you go to Google+, instead of saying, hey, he's doing a Hangout or he missed a Hangout,  just like this, here's Trey's Variety Hour.  Here's Trey's Variety Hour.  You'll actually see video.  Which is great.  Yeah.  So they've in effect made a podcast just that way.  It's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So bully for them.  And I think it's empowering technology for people.  Let's them do their own thing.  Google Maps now has offers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is...  Well, there's two things.  This is a big deal because Google Maps will now be more in the local space,  which is really important.  But also today, Foursquare announced that they're doing Groupon's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All this with Groupon's stock plummeting.  And I guess everybody thinks...  As well it should.  Yeah.  Well, we can do that.  And actually probably is one of the reasons why the stock is plummeting.  Because in fact, Groupon doesn't seem to have a monopoly on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not only that, but Foursquare and Full Disclosure,  I've been talking to them with one of the companies.  I love Denson.  They're great.  They're great.  And Jay Crowley, his brother is doing this.  I've been talking to them.  But Foursquare encourages loyalty.  Groupon does not.  How does it do it?  Because when you want to be mayor, when you want to come back,  when you want to get a badge, when you want to do those things,  that's what Foursquare is pushing is for you to come back.  Right.  And then the opportunity is to give rewards on that basis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Groupon just says, come get 50% off a massage.  And then run.  And then run, never come back.  And that's the problem is does it create a new customer  or does it just create a drain?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this all together becomes a huge impact on the newspaper business  because it's low hold.  Right.  Because coupons...  And radio too.  Yeah.  But coupons are the last reason to print a paper.  The last good reason to print a paper are coupons and circulars.  Good point.  And when newspaper circulation falls below a critical mass,  that's going to have an impact on that.  So at the same time, coupons online are starting to work more.  I've seen studies say they're going to work more.  Plus you have Facebook and Foursquare coming into the coupon business.  And in the coupon business, not just at a proctor and gamble level,  but at a local level, this becomes a big deal.  We're going to release out of CUNY a study in about a week or two.  We went and surveyed online 500 businesses in a neighborhood of Manhattan  and 500 businesses in a town in New Jersey to find out how digital are they.  And it's very interesting to see how few in some ways, to my mind,  have still Facebook pages, websites, YouTube channels, Twitter handles, and so on.  But Foursquare is interesting and Google Place pages are interesting  because you're already there.  Right.  The only question is are you doing anything with it?  Are you maintaining it?  Are you helping it out?  So I think offers on maps is a big deal in the business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yet it doesn't have that thing that you mentioned that Foursquare has.  It doesn't have that loyalty building thing.  It's just a map.  There's no check in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  I mean, Foursquare, do you use Radar on Foursquare?  Yeah.  Does it buzz for you when you pass by things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Do you find that useful?  Is it working?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, mostly just says, hey, you're home.  You want to check in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's mostly what it is.  I'm big on using the to-do list.  So if I'm nearby a place that I put on my to-do list,  it'll say, hey, while you're nearby,  that juice place that you want to try is across the street.  I followed a lot of lists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it will say, yeah, that restaurant that's on your best places to eat  in the whole wide world, you're there.  So that is kind of cool.  That is very cool.

Transcript:  The thing about Foursquare is that it's still...  I don't have numbers to back this up, but I get the impression like you either  are really into Foursquare and use it all the time  or you don't at all wouldn't consider it.  Right.  And the thing is that Google Maps on your phone,  that's the way everybody gets directions,  especially on Android because the navigation is so fantastic.  I really miss the navigation on the iPhone.  But people go to Google Maps to get directions.  They've been doing that since 2005 or 2006 when it launched.  So to add offers to Google Maps, which you're going to have open anyway,  like Google Maps is your go-to for location stuff for most people.  I mean, with Foursquare, you have to get into the habit of launching the app  and checking in and only a very small kind of dedicated group of users does that.  So I think offers on Google Maps is really a big deal.  I think that it's probably will be the first experience with  location-based coupons that most people will have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because you're using maps all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because you use maps all the time anyway.  People are walking...  It's installed on your phone when you get it.  You're walking around getting directions to go someplace anyway.  So you're going to see them.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's only on Android so far, right?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  This is actually Foursquare on iOS.  Sorry, it's so bright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do think Foursquare's specials are or coupons.  It sounds like coupons are similar to specials are better for business, right?  Because often it's like on your third check-in, get a free appetizer for the mayor,  you know, that kind of thing.  That makes a lot of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I do think these lists, if they can get more people to do the lists,  are going to be huge too.  Here's Dan's list for when you go to New Orleans.  You got to get off Bourbon Street.  Seven things to do in New Orleans, not on Bourbon Street.  I mean, things like that.  I love this.  Huge value.  It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the tips when you go to a restaurant, you know, someone you know says,  try the this.  That's really valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is really useful.  I mean, that's the thing about Foursquare makes you identify with places.  It's funny, like I don't check in if I go to the, like, you know,  the Ralph's, you know, because I'm going grocery shopping.  Nobody should know that.  The cool coffee shop, I'm going to check in.  A lot of ways, it's an identification thing,  you know, which is a deeper, much deeper experience.  It connects customers with places a lot more strongly.  But also there's that hurdle of getting into Foursquare.  I mean, people who don't use Foursquare are just annoyed by Foursquare check in  notifications and badge notifications on Twitter and other places.  You know, they probably just see the app notifications on Facebook and think like,  what is this?  You know, I think it's a very split group.  You're either really into it or you're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, you know, it's funny because somebody's saying, well, you know, Google does have  check ins, of course, latitude check ins.  In fact, they're automatic, though.  I think one way that's a disadvantage because you're not doing anything.  So you never really see those check ins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a lot to come on.  Maybe the other stat that came out this week, I don't think we have on the rundown,  is how much more Facebook use is happening in the mobile league.  Right.  And, you know, we're at the bare beginning of seeing how this stuff is going to be used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we've been, you know, it's funny because we've been saying,  oh, this is going to be huge.  Location is going to be huge.  Search gets replaced in some ways by location.  And it's just took a while to catch up, but it's happening.  It's starting.  It's happening.  Did you know that according to Eugene Volokh,  Google search results should be protected by the First Amendment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because he says, interestingly, that, and this was, we should say, commissioned by Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's a professor of law at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And a libertarian, early, early blogging guy.  But Gene says that search is opinion.  I find this really interesting.  Thus, it is free speech.  So the algorithm is not fact, it's opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  That makes sense because he says Google, Bing, Yahoo, and other search engine companies  are rightly seen as media enterprises, just like the New York Times or CNN.  They're media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which they don't say.  They've never said before.  So now they're trying to get under the media umbrella on the First Amendment,  which I find really, really interesting.  But then I would.  It's a wonky thing to get interested in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this, of course, hasn't been an issue in the U.S. yet,  but they've already been sued in Germany and France over autocomplete and things like that.  But they haven't.  Right.  Nobody's attacked them in the U.S. or have they?  For search results.  But I imagine they think it's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, not yet.  But this is where you get to this idea that Google is a utility and that it has to have  fairness in search, which when you think about it for two seconds, it makes absolutely no sense.  Because who's to say what's fair?  Who's to say what that is?  But no, that does get raised a fair amount.  And I just, this way, I've changed my tack with reporters calling.  I had a reporter call yesterday about evils of Facebook and stuff.  I had consumer reports last week about evils of Facebook,  and I said that they were in moral panic.  And then I had a reporter call me this morning trying to compare Google to Standard Oil  as a monopoly 100 years ago.  And I just lost it.  I just, that's your starting point.  That's your starting point.  It's always big, bad, evil, Google, you comey.  So yeah, I think there are efforts to say that Google is too powerful.  We have to control Google.  And we'll control Google around this idea of saying that search is something that should  be regulated.  Well, no, search is speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Livehoods.org, a new way to understand a city.  So these public, these check-ins are public.  There's an API for this, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So if you set your check-ins to public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And most people do.  So each dot on the map represents a check-in location.  Groups of nearby dots of the same color form a livehood.  The shapes of livehoods are determined by the patterns of people.  If many of the same people check into two nearby locations,  these locations will be part of the same livehood or livelihood.  This is how people kind of congregate.  So when you have a lot of dots of the same color, this is like a neighborhood.  Click on a location to learn about its livehood.  This is livehood number 17.  The top five places, the 24th Street Mission BART station,  Ritual Coffee Roasters, Phil's Coffee, Beretta, and the Tacarilla Cancun.  This is the mission district.  It even tells you what phone service people are using.  Here's the Sparky's 24-hour diner location.  Mission Dolores Park, Safeway Golds, Jim 20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What ties them together? I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't either.  What makes it a hood?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People check into many of these same...  They follow...  Oh, like set theory. Gotcha.  Set theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Same groups of people.  Well, if you're going to say it the fancy way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's set theory, okay?  Don't you know?  So this is the Sundance Kabuki Theater.  So if you live in one of these cities,  I know San Francisco well enough to say,  yeah, these are demographic clusters.  Here's the downtown demographic cluster.  That's really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And these are the...  That's using public data from Foursquare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and then they say, well, if you like this livehood,  you'll like these other five livehoods that are closely related.  Similar groups of people.  And then stats.  Wow.  This is pretty cool.  This is really cool.  This is Livehoods.org from Carnegie Mellon.  Wow.  Their mobile commerce lab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm looking through Foursquare's privacy  because you got to have a really large amount of public data to do this well,  which it seems like they are doing it well, at least in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me do Brooklyn for you because you'll know this one, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, can you get anonymized data?  Gina, I wonder whether you get anonymized data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not people.  There's no people's names on this.  These are locales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think maybe you can get...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just a stream of check-ins without personal...  Like aggregated.  Yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what it's about because that's how you see things like  trending restaurants and other stuff like that.  That's the ballot.  That's a great deal of value in Foursquare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's the Williamsburg neighborhood.  This is really interesting.  Brooklyn Bowl.  Yeah, this is interesting.  Williamsburg Bridge, MTA Subway,  Rattigus Tall and Beer Garden, Blue Bottle Coffee.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here, related neighborhoods.  And it would make sense.  We got downtown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So go to Christopher Street or Chelsea or something like that.  I want to see if it kind of marks other gay neighborhoods.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like if the West Village is linked with Chelsea.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, now you're getting sophisticated on me.  Do you think these lavender dots represent anything?  Oh, sorry.  That's the South Street Seaport.  Never mind.  I don't know.  There's the Apple Store in Soho.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So like West Village would be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got the Lower East Side.  How about that?  Whole Foods, The Meatball Shop, Cat's Deli, Piano's and Spitzer's Corner.  Yeah, they're all kind of related.  I think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pat should use this, right?  To understand what it is.  It's not a zip code.  This determines...  This is the first best way I can see to discern a neighborhood rather than trying to use existing  boundaries.  Well, that's their point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These are better than neighborhoods.  It's emergent data, right?  Yeah.  That's really interesting.  Isn't that interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I have a business use for that tomorrow.  I'll be in a local business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good.  All right, we're going to take a break.  This is fun.  We're just kind of messing around.  It always is, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was in a rotten mood when I came on the show.  Thanks to you, my rays of sunshine.  We're just messing around, man.  I'm happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're just doing our thing.  Kind of getting down.  Gina Trippani is here.  She's from Brooklyn.  That's cool.  Yeah, you know.  Jeff Jarvis.  He's from, I don't know, what neighborhood is City University of New York in?  I'm in Times Square.  Times Square.  Center of the universe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or otherwise known as the Schmada District.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The gray lady sits outside waiting to consume.  We're going to get back with more in just a bit.  I want to talk a little bit about never going to the post office again.  See, no more four square check-ins at the post office because you've got stamps.com.  See, this is going to be different because as people's behaviors change, for instance,  they're not going to the post office.  What they're doing is they're using their computer and printer to print their own postage.  And it's so cool.  We do it here.  In fact, I say I notice a proliferation of stamps.com USB scales.  Jordan has one.  Now, Frederique has one.  I think we're never going to have to buy stamps ever again.  You go to stamps.com.  You can take advantage of this special offer.  It's a no risk trial.  Includes $55 free postage.  The digital scale is free.  You just pay for shipping and handling.  It's $5 supply kit and a four week trial.  All you have to do is use the offer code TWIG.  So you really get an idea of how stamps.com works.  Mac or PC.  Just go to stamps.com.  Click that funny old microphone in the upper right hand corner to get the special deal.  And now see that it will, for instance, print out the forms you need for priority mail,  express mail, even international mail.  You'll always have the right postage because the scale weighs it.  If you're an eBay seller, you're going to love this.  It actually takes the data from eBay and populates it.  So it prints the labels, everything.  This is so cool.  If you use QuickBooks, you'll do your invoices this way  and never have to type in another address.  I just love stamps.com.  I know you're going to like it too.  But that's why we arrange this no risk trial.  So you don't have to worry about it.  Just try it and see.  $55 free postage, a free digital scale, a supply kit, and a four week trial.  All at stamps.com.  Use the offer code TWIG.  Stop going to the post office.  No more check-ins at the post office for you.  Stamps.com.  Moving right along.  I'm sorry about that Channel 4 video.  Let's cut that out.  I already made a note.  I don't want YouTube to pull us down again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I made a note for Tony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you.  There have been some court cases that actually support this idea that Google  is the search is free speech.  In 2003, an Oklahoma ad company accused Google of hurting its business when it  downgraded the company in search listings.  The federal judge threw out the case on free speech grounds.  Google's protected.  Free speech, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As the author of the algorithm, essentially.  Yeah.  Instead of the editor of the content.  Yeah.  Well, the algorithm is an opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kind of makes sense to me.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, an algorithm kind of is an opinion.  I mean, it is a set of values and rules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is what we're kind of grappling with though in all sorts of ways.  Patent law and everything is what is a computer program?  What is an algorithm?  What is it?  As a programmer, I think you would say it's an expression of it is speech, right?  It's an expression of something coming out of your brain just because it's not.  Written in prose, it's written in a language that's different from English.  But it's just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it's logic flow.  It's logic.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's speech.  So now, the next web has a picture from the Google Glass project.  By the way, Kevin Rose said, I'm going to get you the goggles.  To me.  One?  No, no, no.  Three.  I'll make sure that we get three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the greatest thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a really neat photo.  It hadn't occurred to me.  Well, we should probably describe it for people who are listening.  It's somebody who's wearing the glasses, has his small child,  and is spinning his small child around.  And you can see this person, it looks like a guy's hand.  So you can see this man's two hands.  It's a hands-free photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sebastian Thrun is the guy who does those code lessons, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's in charge.  He's doing all the online.  He does the new online school.  He was the chief engineer behind the Google self-driving car,  and he's in charge of the lab stuff.  He has the greatest freaking job in the world.  He is the coolest guy ever.  He's the only one that can do it because he's got to be that smart.  So he's wearing the goggles, and he's spinning his son around.  And you see the son is in focus, and everything else is blurry,  because he can do that, and there's no hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But what do you do?  How do you do it?  Do you blink?  Do you say, take a picture?  I think it's audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe it's a timer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's audio commands.  Well, remember, that's what the video said it was going to be.  We don't know, do we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the crappy picture that Sebastian took when he was on Charlie Rose.  That's terrible.  The color, everything.  But maybe the lights were throwing it.  We're seeing more and more of these glasses in the wild, though, right?  Yeah.  Not just prototypes.  Well, they are prototypes, I guess, but not just broken prototypes.  Actual glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saw a video.  Sebastian was on, I forget where it was.  He was interviewed about the car and said that people would see them,  and they drove all those miles and see them,  and they had all these guesses about what it was,  and there weren't many guesses of self-driving.  It was other guesses.  And then finally, people started guessing right,  and that's when Markov called and said, is this what it is?  And they invited him in.  Oh, interesting.  The New York Times, John Markov, for a drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good man.  John's a smart guy.  So the state of Nevada has approved self-driving cars from Google.  The Las Vegas Sun says that...  That's what we want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess we do want that.  A bunch of drunks, not hitting people.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That law requires a person behind the wheel during the test,  so you do have to kind of sit there.  But I think that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could program it for gamblers anonymous  and it won't let you drive to the casinos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the presumption is you're not going to drive down downtown  Vegas Boulevard that you'll be in the wilderness, I hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they've been driving around the Bay Area.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why did they have to get permission from Nevada  when they've been doing it in California?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they want to take them to Vegas for some show or something.  I think they wanted to do something.  They're trying to get a market.  They're trying to get approval state by state  so that they can actually make this a sellable technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the first state in the nation to approve testing driverless cars.  Google has equipped a fleet of at least eight vehicles,  six Toyota Priuses, an Audi TT, and a Lexus RX 450h.  The license plates will be unique.  They'll have a red background and feature an infinity symbol on the left-hand side.  DMV director Bruce Breslow says,  I feel using the infinity symbol was the best way to represent the car of the future.  Lee.  Man, woman, birth, death, infinity.  Apparently Google's going to go to other states to try to get permission as well.  I guess they don't have it yet in California, but that didn't stop them from doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guarantee them New Jersey will fuddle the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where am I? What am I doing here?  Hey, you got a prophetess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's in the county where I used to live.  And we're in Jersey City in Hoboken,  where there is, honest to God, there's a different constitution there  that says that people turning left have right of way over all forms of life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm turning left here. Get out of my way.  Really, is that true? No.  It is in practicality, I'll tell you.  You can turn left in New Jersey. It doesn't matter. Who's in the road?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got a prophetess?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My people are from Jersey. I apologize. Galaxy S3, did you guys talk about this last week  when I wasn't here? Did you? No, it came out on Thursday.  Came out after? Oh, all right.  It's one better than the S2. It's big, 4.8 inches, ice cream sandwich, LTE and HSPA+.  It'll run on all the high-speed 4G networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Give me a refresher on that, which carrier is which, where?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  AT&T and Verizon will be offering LTE. T-Mobile offers HSPA+, as does AT&T,  but AT&T also offers LTE. T-Mobile does not have LTE.  And Sprint currently has WiMAX, but is moving to LTE.  So LTE is the thing to go.  Oh yeah, LTE is the future for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  LTE, okay. How are regular people supposed to understand that?  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, don't get me started. It's not even 4G, even though they call it 4G,  because 4G is supposed to be 100 megabits down and nothing's ever even close to that.  What's the name of the ITU, the International Telecommunications Union,  gave a kind of a waiver to the United States saying, well, it's faster than 3G.  So go ahead, call it 4G. LTE is the future. Just remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm going to be in Korea in a week and a half.  It'll be LTE, yeah.  I don't know if one can buy phones or can I buy a note or something like that.  What should I look for? Something that's LTE?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've got to know that's LTE.  Well, okay, here's the other thing is they're on different frequencies.  So there's LTE in Korea, may not be on the same frequency that LTE in the US is.  So that's why they have multi-band phones.  Actually, in fact, T-Mobile has announced that they're going to do HSPA plus on 1900 megahertz,  which means you can run the iPhone on it. You couldn't do it before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fascinating. I'm still confused, but that's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Galaxy S3, it's nice. It's a nice phone. It's big. It has some neat features.  For instance, it's kind of smart. It knows what you're up to, right, Eileen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it watches you. It's kind of creepy in the way that it...  Well, the camera is using the camera or is this a separate sensor?  There's a sensor on the front of the phone and it waits until you actually stop looking at it  and then it will go black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I've talked about and I love that program called Screeble that I use that uses the  accelerometer. If you've got the phone tilted up, it says, oh, you must be looking at it.  I won't turn off the screen. So you can set the screen time out to like the minimum, like seconds.  And as long as it's not flat or upright, and you can change the parameters,  Screeble will just keep the screen on. This is better than that because it's looking at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's looking at you. Yeah. So there's a video commercial where the dad is holding his kid and  he's about to drift off, but he's reading and reading and then he closes his eyes and then  the phone turns off. Oh, isn't that nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's neat. The screen seems to come very close to the top of the device itself.  It looks like it's mostly screen, which I kind of like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They don't have the bump anymore either. It's like a very thin profile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The bezel is really thin and I hear that some people do complain that the buttons are a little,  there's not as much real estate for the buttons if you're used to using them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, I'm just glad that even though it's ice cream sandwich, it actually has buttons.  It's got the home button and it's got menu and back. Not menu, I'm sorry. It's not that menu  anymore. It's that task switcher, which I think is completely useless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It does look kind of plasticky though, like the button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what? I think it looks very similar to a Galaxy S2, just bigger. Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, it's curved though. It's not.  It's a little curvy. Yeah.  So anyway. That was to appease the lawyers. I think you talked about it on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. Apple says it can't look like an iPhone. Okay. No problem. We'll curve it.  So it should hit the latest is from CNET that it should hit this summer in the US.  It's actually, I thought June was what they were talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's going to be the official phone for the Olympics as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All the athletes will get one in there. It's going to use NFC. So the athletes are going to  have wallets and have pay points. They can walk around and tap their phone on stuff. That's kind

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of cool. Cool. Oh yeah. Olympic Village full of hot people using NFC. I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You went there, didn't you? I did. You went right there. Sorry.  I've heard that it's apparently just a love fest. Yeah. I'm in the Olympic Village. And I imagine

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  if I was locked up in training 21 years old, perfect body, you want to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And especially if your event is early, because then it's nothing, right? Then you got  weeks just sitting around in the Olympic Village, eating lots of food and tapping your phone.  Tapping my phone at the bar. Yeah. It's a good time. I've heard it's his name. Phelps was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  interviewed, I think in 60 minutes last week talking about how he just kind of slugged out  afterwards and didn't get it back together. And he said, yeah, I'd sleep till 11 in the afternoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like college kids. It is. It's a bunch of gorgeous college kids with nothing to do.  You do the math. We're going to talk about, I don't want to talk about Oracle. I don't blame you.  I don't want to talk about it either. Oracle versus Google.  The non-verdict. The non-verdict. The jury ruled in favor of, this is the Java, the Sun  Java issue, whether Android infringes on Java's patents and trademarks. Oracle sued saying,  yeah, your Android, you should have licensed that. That's a Java. Google said, no, it's not.  The jury said, well, yeah, it is Java. The jury said, yes, Android basically stole Java,  but they couldn't decide whether it was, what did it say? It infringed copyright or not. So now  the jury is going to look at patents next. And Google, meanwhile, says, mistrial, your honor,  I want a mistrial. So it's just, it's going to go on. There's more. That poor jury. Is it the same  jury comes back and now does patents? That poor jury. That's got to be the... So Google infringed  on copyrights, but they couldn't reach a decision on whether that was acceptable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whether or not it's protected under fair use is the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Google says mistrial. And then now this is in its fourth week already. Now they're looking at

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  patents. Yeah, this went from sort of a fun, crazy circus to, okay. The judge says, you do not have

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to answer the fair use question. You just have to decide whether they violated copyrights. We  appreciate the jury, says Google. And we know that fair use and infringement are two sides of  the same coin. The core issue is whether the APIs here are copyrightable. And that's for the court  decide we expect to prevail on this issue and Oracle's other claims. Oracle said we won, we won.  We won. I just don't, I don't like to report on these. That's it. That's the story.  Thank you. We're done. For the nonce. Let's take a break. We're talking Google, the cloud, the  internet, a lot more. Gina and Jeff and Ting, Ting, time to talk Ting. You know about Ting?  Ting.com. It is their goal in life is nothing less than completely disrupting the cell phone  industry. Okay. You got to like that. Just, you know, you got to admire their, their pluck,  spunky little Ting, no longterm contract. You only pay for what you use.  Some really nice phones. Now last week I mistakenly said you could bring your own phone, but you know,  they're based on Sprint. It's a CDMA carrier. So you can't, you have to, you have to get a phone  from them and you pay more because they're not subsidized. But I'm going to tell you in a second  how to save 50 bucks on the phone. They've got the top of the line photon. I would go with the Galaxy  S2. I'm sure they'll have the S3 at some point soon. The optimus, if you want to save some money.  But here's, you look at the plans. This is where it really gets interesting. You pay for what you  use. No penalty, no waste. This is why it's disrupting because basically you say how many  devices you're going to have. This is good for a family too, or a business. Look, you know, I could  say I'm going to have 20 devices. Let's say I'm going to have 15 devices. That's 90 bucks a month.  And then I'm going to say, well, I'm going to use 500 minutes. I'll do a hundred text messages  and I want two gigabytes of data. And then it tells you the price. That's $144 a month.  But here's the cool thing. If you use less data or less text, they refund your money.  And if you use more, they just charge you the same amount. There's no penalty.  There's no penalty. Plus you get voicemail free, picture and video messaging free, three-way calling.  They don't charge for that. Caller ID, they don't charge for that. Tethering, they don't charge for  that. Hotspot, they don't charge for that. You pay for what you use. No more, no less. It is really,  really slick. Great customer service. Once you get a Ting representative on the line during regular  business hours, they will not put you on hold. They will solve your problem. And for the month  of May, they're running a dump your contract contest. Every day this month, they're going to  buy out your mobile service contract. So if you want to find out about that, go to, go to TING.com  slash DYC. They'll cut you a check to pay your early termination fee, a minimum of a hundred dollars,  a maximum of $300. TING.com slash DYC. You can also share your ETF, your early termination fee  horror stories on the site and follow winners on Facebook. Enter every day in May to win.  TING is simple, honest, integrity. I love it. Fair prices, fair prices. And you know, if you want to  find out more, go to TING.com slash twig and you can get $50 off the new device. TING.com slash twig.  And if you want to enter the contest, TING.com slash DYC for dump your contract. Great support.  They've got, you can tweet them. You can, they have a blog. They even post release notes. So you know  exactly what's going on. It's run by a bunch of geeks who said there's got to be a better way.  And I think they've done it. TING. Try it. You want a better cell phone company? TING is the thing.  TING.com slash TING. You know what? I, by the way, somebody put this on Google Plus. The best thing  I use Google Plus for is to find out about deals on Google Play. Right now they've got like a whole  cover album thing free. They're great. Yeah. Oh really? Yeah.

And it's not you know, those cameras that are on I'm sure every street corner in Brussels  are constantly monitoring everything that's going on. There's a difference between surveillance

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and they go straight to the police. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's you know, one of the reporters I got mad at this week,  I yelled it was it was so bad when my neighbors came by said, who are you yelling at?  Was from IPN. Were you yelling at the TV? No, I was yelling at reporters on the phone. They said,  Can I talk to you for a minute about this? But the premise would be bad technology bad big company.  So one of them came in and said, well, Google got this patent to be able to use background sound  when you make research. I saw your obviously awful and evil this is. And I said, Oh, come on.  If I asked for Raptor, and I can hear that I'm in a quiet museum or I'm in a loud  stadium, it's going to guess whether what the dinosaurs or jocks and it's going to tell me and  that's okay. And I can turn it off. Jesus get off of it. I just yelled at the guy,  use the F word a few times and hung up on him. Oh my goodness. I just love that your neighbors

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  have to check in on you. Make sure you're okay. Jarvis is having a hulk moment. He's turned bright

Transcript:  green. I lead if you're really on it. I was about to do it right now. I am turning green.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Short timer. Google now is this is great because you know, Microsoft is suing Motorola.  But then Motorola came back and suing Microsoft saying, and Motorola, of course, is Google. I  don't have Motorola mobility we're talking about that. Microsoft says Motorola mobility wants to  charge it $4 billion a year in the patents that Motorola holds on Wi Fi and video technology.  So they say for the Xbox, you owe us $4 billion a year in royalties, says Google a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. Wow. Wow. Somebody should do a chart of who is suing whom for what,  because it just shows the absolute. Oh, they have they have. It's crazy. Yeah, it looks like the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Paris subway map. If the two don't come up with an agreement, the judge could stop Microsoft from  importing Xboxes into the US for sale. No more Xboxes for you. Microsoft says this amount is  insanely high and unfair. Yeah. So is life. Yeah. So wait, Google's using patents offensively here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently, I thought they weren't going to. I thought they weren't going to either. But this  is Motorola mobility. But this so the sale, I mean, it's in defense. This is Google. They

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  could make the argument. No, this is in defense because Microsoft has been going after Android.  So now we're going to come back and say, Okay, you want to you want to play that game? You owe

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  us $4 billion. One woman's offense is another woman's defense. Yeah. Depends on which side

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you're on. Yeah, right. Right. It's not a big royalty. It's 2.25%.  Motorola lawyer told the judge, Don't forget, they started this. We didn't start this.  So that's that's their response. No, it's defense. And a teacher. But that's why you buy Motorola for  what are the $15 billion? That's why you buy that billion, because that those patents are  defensive. Defensive patents. Yeah. And but if it's only defensive if you use it, if you are  you the threat to use it. Do we care about we talked about it a little bit on Twitter. We care

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  about the Yahoo CEO resume kerfuffle. Now only in that Yahoo remains even a bigger joke day by day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just getting worse. Yeah, just getting sad. The clown car. But I mean, I don't who cares if  he said he had a computer science degree and he didn't he just took some courses. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't care. My favorite and all that was was a week ago, Michael Arrington putting on his

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  LinkedIn page that he was the CEO of Yahoo. Why not? Now, do you credit the rumor that AOL AOL's  denied this that AOL is going to sell and gadget and tech crunch? And that Mike Arrington then said,  but I'm not buying. I got your money. I'm not giving any back. The Yahoo reported 70 even though

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it was denied to be there was a 70 million. Yeah, I think he sold for 20. It's a big it's a big

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  premium 30 less than 30. Yeah, I think so. Wow. What Facebook road shows ongoing. Mark Zuckerberg  offended analysts by wearing a hoodie. So here's the deal. If you're going public, you then make  you do a road show you go to the big institutional investors, people with a lot of money to buy stock  and you give them a pitch about why Facebook be a good investment. And they get in early on it.  You know, it's a it's all you know, old boy network thing. But the Zuck is just not into it, man.  So he first they make a video and they in New York, they forced people to sit through a 30  minute video of Zuckerberg. And then answer questions people complained. Because they didn't  they said we'd have enough time for questions. And and Mark's wearing a t shirt. So then  comes to another one and wears a hoodie. And the analyst said this is a sign a mark of immaturity.  Don't come to us in a hoodie kid. Mark Millian writing for Bloomberg about this, which is just  is just great. The analyst's name is let's see Pactor. Michael Pactors and analyst for wedbush  securities. Mark and his signature hoodie. This is on Bloomberg TV. He's actually showing investors  he doesn't care that much. He's going to be him. I think that's a mark of immaturity. I think he  has to realize he's bringing investors in as a new constituency right now. By the way, that's  exactly what he realizes and why he's going up yours. And I think he's got to show them the  respect they deserve because he's asking them for their money. And I think sucks. A point of view is,  hey, I'm asking you, you don't have to give it to me. If you think we're worth it, give it to me.  I'm offering you a great chance, a great opportunity to make some money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's putting forth the kind of hackers, hackers way, the hackers ethic, right?  This analyst said that he felt like this roadshow going to ask people for these amounts of money is  akin to going to a wedding or a funeral, showing up at a wedding or a funeral, not wearing a suit  that it's a sign of disrespect. He's not wearing the Wall Street uniform. So we're not. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder this analyst, by the way, issued a buy recommendation for Facebook stock.  So he's okay. He's got his moment. But yeah, he's still going to give him his money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Would you rather invest in the new CEO of Yahoo in a tie or the CEO of AOL in a tie or Steve Jobs  in a T-shirt and a turtleneck and Mark Zuckerberg in a hoodie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Exactly. It seemed like a cultural clash, right? Like New York, Wall Street versus the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Valley. It was also kind of, it was ageist, reverse ageist. It was kid. You don't know what you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  doing. You don't wear a hoodie to a, you didn't bring a knife to a gunfight, did you? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Henry Blodgett did a very, very, very, very long post, which was good. Just recounting how  Zuckerberg didn't want to go public. And if it hadn't been for the 500 rule, which is basically  gone now with the jobs act, you know, may not have. And the company could have stayed private  forever. I mean, he resigned himself to it and he's going to do it and he's going to get benefits  from it. He's going to get liquid assets and a marketable commodity for buying things. But  the hassle is high and the issue for him was control. So he managed to keep control and go  public at the same time. So F you I'm wearing a hoodie. Right on. And speaking of modern times,  better a hoodie than that shirt you have on Leo. So, Hey, this says, this is computers on it. You  don't like this? I wouldn't invest in you with that on. No, good. You're probably right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is a sign of the times. If you would doubt it in any way that Demi Moore and Ashton  Kutcher were no longer together, she's renamed her Twitter account. She used to be Mrs. Kutcher.  Now she's just Demi and apparently has put a rather provocative photo. I can't tell because  it's behind her tweets. The tweets are hiding something that it looks pretty exciting and  exotic. Oh, it does. Yeah, I know. I know. I know how to get it. Sorry, not a recent picture to me.  Okay, just saying. That's kind of sad though. I mean, but don't okay. So just to tip by the way,  Piers Morgan when he's interviewing her says you could change it to Mrs. Morgan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think she accepted the proposal. Demi follows you. Look at you, Leo rocking it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, we're just friends. You're just friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you picked right up on that one. Yeah, I did. Sorry. Isn't that what people do though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On Girls, that show, that new show on HBO, she tweets on the end of the second episode.  All adventurous women do. Yeah. It has something to do with venereal disease, I think.  Anyway, and then immediately after there's an analysis of the fact that she follows like  a thousand people and has like four followers. It's pretty funny. I paused it. I looked. Did you?  I did. That's the new thing. You go, oh, let's see. Demi's only following 246 people and I'm one of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  them. Look at you. Look at you. Just want to say. It's the shirt. She likes the shirt, Mr. Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just saying. And Demi, whatever those boots are you wearing, I like those.  Just to return the favor. That's like 30 years ago, Demi, really. And then-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of the greatest moments she ever had, I remember this, when she was on, I think was  at Vanity Fair on the cover, basically nude, body painted. Oh, yeah. And then she took the rag  that she'd used to clean herself off of the washcloth and gave it to David Letterman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he swooned as well he should have. You know, if you're a sex symbol, work it, baby. Work it.  You know, don't be apologetic. Go, you want my sweat? Why not? We're gonna take-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're gonna get that dog face back on you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually interviewed her many, many years ago when she was still on General Hospital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What could the possible tech angle have been, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, this is when I was a general, like you, I have a previous career in media.  And this is when I was just a general- Cheap celebrity stuff.  Cheap celebrity stuff, exactly. If I'd been smart, I would have started a magazine, but no.  No, it was smarter not to, believe me. Was it E or Us? What was it? Entertainment Weekly, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, there's the, let's see here, the original cover-  Right above the Osborne.  And over there is the trial cover. It was a horrible, horrible cover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I liked Entertainment Weekly. In fact, when I was a DJ interviewing people like Demi Moore,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I used it for research. I have Entertainment Weekly's 10 top 10 things we love this week on  my iPad. I kind of love it. See? See?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This was the original cover with- You were trying to do an intellectual-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that was the mistake. They didn't tell me that they'd put it in every Kmart and Calderon  America. And so, man, did this cover come back. Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. You were making, you didn't get the mission.  This was the original prototype cover. Yeah.  Oh, cool. Was that Michael Jackson?  I've been wondering. Oh, it's Fred.  I've been wondering for years. Fred Savage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fred Savage. He was adorable.  He was adorable. Still is.  It's quite adorable. But then he hit puberty and it got weird.  But he was really cute as a kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Back to TV. It all comes back to TV.  Does it go back to TV? I'm telling you.  We are the TV generation. We're going to take a break. When we come back,  we have a tip, a tool, and the number of the week. But first, a word from Squarespace.com.  What a great place to get your website going. It's hosting.  The best hosting you can get anywhere. You cannot bring a Squarespace site down.  And lately, I've also been talking about the fact that it's more secure because they  run the hosting, the software, they keep it up to date.  All the vulnerabilities that our sites and other sites are prey to,  running PHP and Apache and all that. Not on Squarespace. It's locked down.  Unless you are prepared to manage your server and keep it secure,  I highly recommend Squarespace.com.  Manage servers. Never run out of bandwidth. Really reasonable price.  And then there's this great software on top of it that lets you make a unique site.  Great templates. Themes. 85 plus professionally designed styles.  From the biggest brand names and designers.  Photo galleries are just gorgeous if you're a photographer with lightbox integration, hover effects,  automatic image resizing. They've got an iOS and an Android app. I love that.  So it's easy to post, easy to moderate. They'll import from the existing  APIs of movable type WordPress, type pad, and blogger, but they'll also export back out.  So you're never stuck. And that import is very thorough.  It gets all the links, all the images, all the comments, everything.  I can go on and on. I'll tell you what the best thing to do is just click that green  try it free button on Squarespace.com. And you've got the run of the place for two weeks for no cost.  You don't even have to give them a credit card. Just boom, you could do anything you want.  If you decide you want to buy, take a look at the pricing. They've revamped their pricing.  It's much simpler and frankly, much more affordable. $8 a month for the basic plan.  $16 a month for unlimited pages, unlimited bandwidth, unlimited storage.  And by the way, when you sign up for the annual plan, you get a free custom domain.  They'll even do the setup so that it points to your site.  So this really is from soup to nuts, everything you need at an amazing price.  And I have a special offer for you when you use the offer code twig five,  you'll get 10% off that first purchase. So get the annual plan, get the free domain registration,  get 10% off. You're really saving. Squarespace, great place to set up your next website.  Squarespace.com. Who are we talking to that did a Squarespace site? We're just talking about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ashley Miltite. Oh yeah, Ashley Miltite. Ashley Miltite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The broad experience. Yeah, the broad experience.  And you see, she's actually, it's interesting because she could use Squarespace to store the  podcast, but instead she uses SoundCloud also free. So, you know, for the storage. So she's really got

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it. And I've had her watch twit shows and said that she ought to look at doing video instead of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  just audio and then she could use Hangouts. Can we have her on twit? What is her specialty?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She worked on a marketplace for some, like seven years. Like finance, econ, business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We could use somebody like that. I love her voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She is wonderful. And the other woman she interviewed in the show with Gina,  Ada Benir is starting a show called, I mean, a show, listen to me, a company called Skillcrush,  which she doesn't say it this way, but it was really inspired by trying to teach women to code  because she found it no fun when she learned to code being around boys and their ways.  And they're going to do it a new way rather than saying, well, you want to learn Pearl. No,  you want to learn how to do this task. Whatever you need to learn to do that,  we're going to teach you that. So it's two of the businesses out of my class.  Neato. Really neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina Trapani, does your resume say you have a computer science degree?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It does. And I do. Oh, all right. I mean, I really do. I can show you my degree. It's somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was trying to impeach your credibility, but apparently your integrity is 100%.  You're even better than Yahoo. That's not saying anything. So Gina has a tip for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So my tip this week is an app I've been using for a long time now. It's called  timehop.com. And I'm surprised I never brought up on the show before, because I really love it.  If you use social media, if you've been using social media pretty regularly for more than a year,  this is a really cool app. Basically what it does is it's very simple. It sends you an email every  day with a digest of everything that you posted across different networks on a given day. So,  I mean, it sounds kind of like, you know, first I was like, I get too much email. I don't need this.  I signed up for it. So I use Foursquare, Facebook and Twitter pretty regularly. It doesn't support  Google Plus yet. And you get this email and it says, you know what? A year ago, May 9th was a  Monday. It was 65 degrees and sunny. And I checked in at the San Diego airport, the San Francisco  airport, the Moscone Center. It was Google I.O. So it's a really neat way to just kind of get  reminded of things. I have a terrible memory. I have a really bad sense of time memory-wise.  Like was that two years ago? Is it three years ago? Is it a year ago? You get just kind of-  I need it for yesterday. Yeah, seriously. But you know, you just get reminded of things,  especially if you use Foursquare. He's like, oh, that time I went to that place with a friend.  And if you start like leaving pictures places to you, you just get this really nice memory of places  that you've been, things that you've done, thoughts you've had, articles that you liked enough to tweet  or share on Facebook. You know, you kind of get to revisit a year later and remember what that was  like. So it's a really cool service. It's something that if it fills a need that I think is really  important and something I'm trying to really do with ThinkUp, which is like deriving meaning from  all these little tracks we leave around the internet and these different streams of information  that just kind of flow down and disappear. This is a cool, kind of simple, fun way to just say,  hey, this is where you were a year ago. And the emails are just well written. The copy is all  written. They also have little facts about what happened on this day a year ago. So-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I'm just going to get a daily email now from them saying this is what you were up to last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, May 9th last year, right. You checked in these places. You tweeted this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I dread. My mind's going to say, this is what you were mad about last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly. Jeff will get to relive all his rants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's hulk, timehulk.com. Your last hulk moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is one of the first big hacks with Foursquare's API. So it was built originally  on Foursquare, but it works on Twitter and Facebook as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So now it says, thanks. We're preparing your emails. I did the whole thing.  If you've got content, you'll get your first email in the morning. And this just makes you,  I think this is created by the consortium of social networks because this just encourages  you to post more. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right? Yep. And it makes you, to me, I feel like I'm putting like a little message in a bottle of my  future self. You know, like today, President Obama's announcement, a year from now, I'm going

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to feel really happy about that. Finally, somebody's going to read your social postings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You! Me! Just 365 days from now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because I often wonder, what are we putting all this stuff out for? Because who's going to,  nobody cares, but like we do. Right. Like what are we doing?  Facebook realized that the timeline is not for anybody but you.  Yep. It's true. So this is like the timeline plus.  It's cool. I like that. Exactly.  Although actually I have all those things hooked up to the timeline. So the timeline could do the  same thing too. Timehulk.com. Jeff, you've got three numbers to choose from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to pick this one. I'm going to pick, cause it's something, some news just happened  moments ago. And one of them, the Pebble watch, the E Ink watch on Kickstarter,  passed $10 million. 10 million dollars. Now here's the other news folks. Sorry. It's over.  Sold out. They capped it at 85,000 watches.  Yeah. I got mine. And so I did too. I got mine sold out, sold out, sold out.  I was, I was going to buy one more one minute ago and it just sold out. It just passed 85,000

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  watches, which is just pretty amazing. Well, wait a minute. If you pledge a thousand or more,  you can get 10 Pebbles. Yes, you can do that.  So you know, I should do that for, for everybody at Twitter. What is the Pebble?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is the Pebble? The Pebble is an E Ink watch with an API.  So you can change the face and change what it, what it shows. And so it's just, it's just genius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why, why, why wasn't this thought of before? Well, I've seen E Ink watches before. I think  Philippe Starkey. There are others. They're absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  others, but it's, but it's amazing. So what was genius about it was they couldn't get any  cash from anybody. And so they went to Kickstarter and, and they asked for-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the most successful Kickstarter project of all time.  By minds. They asked for a hundred grand and they got $10 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's yeah, that's VC money. I mean, that's, that's crazy.  Oh, easy. That's more than-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They still own the entire company. They got the best market research possible.  They're using their customer's capital to build this. You know, it's a beautiful thing. The only,  the only yes, but here is what if they miscalculated the manufacturing cost?  Right. Yeah.  You know, that's, that's the thing. There's actually a lot of yes,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  buts because I have to say there's no protection on Kickstarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, there's not. There's not. And Kickstarter says that. So once, once they pass in nine days,  the, the time limit and all that $10 million goes to them, you know, Libya, here they come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. They can walk away. That's possible.  Yeah. Yes, they can.  Or more likely, I don't think they'll walk away, but more likely there could be a hitch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There could be a hitch and then get along.  The worst that I could imagine is A, that, that what they thought the manufacturing process  B isn't or B there's a cost overrun and with 85,000 units, that's deadly.  Right. Right. And, and it was cheap to get it, right? It was only, Leo, what was it? 100?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I bought, I bought, I think I bought the $115 one, which means I, oh no, I did 125. So I could  choose from Arctic white, cherry red, voters choice or jet black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I being bland. You got the black one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. I might pledge a thousand at this point. Do you think, do you think people who  work here would want one of these? Chad? Yeah. Liz? Yeah. Yeah. John? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anything for free.  You don't work here anymore. I know. I'm not going to get it anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is how I'm trying to keep Eileen. Gee, for a thousand bucks, every one of you could have a  Pebble watch. I wonder if Molly would would be doing that for her employees.  Hey, look at this for a 1200 50, that's sold out. You can get a custom. I could have a special  twit watch face. That would have been cool. Hmm. A hundred watches are $10,000.  That's sold. That's sold out. 31 backers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  30. 31 people paid $10,000.  Yeah, that's, but they're resellable, right? There's now a market. So now that's the last  you'll ever buy this watch at 115 bucks. That's the only reason if they had to cap it,  they were, they were eating into their market. Right. You know, the reason it's going to cost

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  200 bucks or 300 bucks. Oh yeah. Incoming caller ID, email, calendar alerts, Facebook messages,  Twitter, weather alerts. But I got to point out this doesn't exist. And you're, you're kind of,  cause I'll tell you, I've, I've participated in a number of kickstarters that I still haven't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  received anything for. I have, yeah, I've got some. I have my, my little glyph, the thing that,  that holds my iPhone for a trip. That was a good one. It was a good one. I have my shoulder strap  for my briefcase was one I got from there. I ordered, we'll see if it comes, the new iPhone  case that actually remembers all your credit cards and affinity cards in one card. And all

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  of these you've got, you've received. No, I haven't got the last one yet. I, I, I did some  dice that I've never, I'm never going to get. It was some game. Oh no, I very importantly, no, no,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  no. The best thing I got was this. Hold on. The glyph was good. That was a good bet. This is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  board game startup. Yeah. See that's cool. Oh, cool. I can't even find the dice game anymore on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kickstarter site. I got hits and misses. I funded books and albums that I've gotten.  Um, I, I found, I, I funded Ze Frank show. That was good, but see, you could, you can't. So this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  is it dice age. It was like a new game. I wasn't very, I think I pledged 10 bucks or something. It

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  wasn't, I just took the pledge to Astroid, which was a project to send an Android phone into space  and develop an app and take photos. And, uh, and it didn't, you know, it didn't work out. And the,  and the person who ran the project just emailed all the backers and said, you know what, you gave  me money. I didn't fulfill my end of the bargain. Let me know if you want me to donate your, your,  your donation, your backing money to charity water, or if you want it back or what I mean,  which I felt like was the most gracious way to handle a situation. She's like, you know,  I just didn't know what, what needed to go into this. I thought it was going to be easier than  it was. And I'm sorry. And what do you want me to do with your money? I can refund it or which he  doesn't, you know, he didn't have to do. Do you think Kickstarter has any obligation here?  I think they need to come up with some sort of plan B. Like they should let a person who's  starting a project say, if, you know, give, give, give backers the option for me to funnel their,  their donation to charity, if this doesn't work out, you know, that there's got to be some sort  of structure for failure because it seems like this is, this is the refrain of a lot of people  that they're donating, you know, they're backing projects and they're not getting anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The first thing I ever backed on here was diaspora, right? The Facebook clone. I don't know  what's happened with that. They're still around. This thing is, this thing got funded in June of  last year and I still haven't received anything. I probably have my money. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, you can, you can send a message, say, Hey, what's going on? Hey man. So $10 million

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  for the pebble. I hope I better get my pebble that I'll be mad if I don't get that. I'll be mad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this is such a high profile project. They've got to ship something, right? Or it'll be a big

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  story that they didn't. We could all get a pet rock real quickly. Cause we're running late. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  just mentioned my tool is the, is the Google plus client for iOS has been updated.  You know, I thought it was, I was read that it was going to be universal. It is not, it is an iPhone  app, but Mike Elgin does a little piece on his Google plus account in which he talks about how  nice it looks. And they have to say, it does look nice on the iPad. It's still, you're doubling the  size and all of that, but it, but it actually is, is kind of pretty. They've got a new, a new  styling pictures look great. Videos look great. So it takes advantage of the iPad screen real estate  in a nice way. I wish though that look how bad the text looks on the, on the, I don't understand  why it's so hard. Text could, could be done right. That's, that's something that should be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  vector graph and should be able to work. Or just let me have the web, the iPad's big. Let me have  the web version. Yeah. Why, yeah. Why not? Why not just do it? It doesn't let you, it forces you to  go to a mobile version and it's not as good. It doesn't do things. They're so close now. I have

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a feeling that they soon there'll be an iPad. Yeah. I mean, look at it. It's so close. It really  does look good. So Google plus, even if, you know, if you have an iPhone, of course you'll get an  update, but if you haven't put it on the iPad, put it on the iPad. The new one's actually pretty nice.  Pretty nice. Ladies and gentlemen, we do this show this week in Google every Wednesday afternoon,  1 PM Pacific, 4 PM Eastern time, 2000 UTC, 20, oh, oh hours on twit.tv, but you can always download  audio and video after the fact from our website and everywhere better podcasts. Our Gina Trapani  is at smarterware.org. That's her blog. And of course, thinkupapp.com and she'll be gay all over

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  San Diego tonight. I will be happy and gay. And I just wanted to thank Eileen for being one of the  best producers on the planet, making the show so great for so long. We really appreciate it. Eileen,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you're the best. I didn't want to break it on either, but you beat me to it. Eileen, without you,  the show wouldn't have be possible. You've been all the help that Eileen gives behind the scenes,  all of the wonderful support and the great attitude and the professionalism and don't leave.  She will be missed. I'm going to have a hulk moment here and start bashing you in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I tried to give her a pebble watch. That didn't work. This has been truly an honor. It's my  favorite show on twit. And well, you made it really Eileen's producing really, as I think  Gina pointed out before the show began to put us in a different whole different level. So thank you,  Eileen. Yeah, Eileen leaving a twit to go. She'll still be doing all about Android by the way,  but she's leaving to go work for a Molly Wood and her new show always on. So you'll be able  to see her doing that. And we have not yet announced her replacement, but I guess by next week,  we better have one. You guys will be in good hands. Yeah, somebody. We didn't mention  Flipboard Android for Flipboard. It's supposed to be for the Galaxy S3, right? It is not official.  It's a leak. So it doesn't work for all devices. Yeah. So that's kind of why I didn't end.  But I have to say that is one of the few apps that are iOS only that really kind of dominate.  And the fact that it's now going to be on Android. Wow. That's a big loss for iOS, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not sure. How do you get it? You go, there's an APK on the XDA forms. And if you don't know  what that means, then you don't get it. Download the APK from XDA. Use it. There's some devices  that don't really work, but people are using it on tablets and it seems to be working fine there.  Although it's weird because it's really, it's not a tablet app. It's for the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So some guy used AirDroid to extract the APK. Yes. At the event or something. Bad man.  Jeff Jarvis is at buzzmachine.com. That's where he blogs and he's also a professor of journalism.  If you're ever so lucky to go to City University of New York, you could study with him and his

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  very strange hands. The office. I was trying to point to the office, but I get, I get, I got a  problem. I'm deciding to go to a new dance. I don't know. Thank you all for joining us

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and come back next week for another edition of This Week in Google. Stay tuned. TNT is coming up next.  Bam. Ba-da-bam. Oh, boom. Oh, he jumped. Did you give me the Squarespace copy off my desk?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you. Bye, guys. Bye-bye. Good luck. Thank you. God bless you. Thank you for everything.  We'll see you on Android. See you on the Internets. Yeah, I'm so glad you're still doing all that.
