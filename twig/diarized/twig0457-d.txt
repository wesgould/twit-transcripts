And we couldn't have a more googly panel for today's show.  Just waking up from a barbecue coma, Stacey Higginbotham in Austin, Texas.  She had Franklin's today, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She's so barbecued, bellow.  I am.  You know, if you're lucky, you might see meat sweats later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Something to look forward to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you want to, you can just lie down on that Pilates reformer behind you.  Is that an Ember mug you're drinking out of right there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, this is my just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looks like the Ember mug, the one that is USB powered and heats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, that's totally different.  And it's bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, I have one just like that.  Really?  You have this kind?  Yeah, they make a kind of more standard coffee mug as well.  What did you go for?  The brisket, the ribs, the chicken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I went for everything.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My, my.  You are.  It was all there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't have any sausage.  I'm not a huge sausage fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I always go for the links.  I like the hot links.  Love the links.  But I've been told, ATX food guy tells me you can only judge a barbecue by the brisket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's true.  And you got to judge it by the fatty brisket.  Fatty brisket.  Or the wet brisket, however you want to call it.  Oh, God, that's disgusting.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's disgusting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, Jeff Jarvis is also here.  He's a professor of journalism at the City University of New York.  But in his younger days, he judged pizza for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not only did I judge pizza, but I also judged the Russian River Slugfest cook-off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What kind of food was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Slugs?  I was awful.  The winner that year was Slugaroni, the Russian River treat.  Oh, God.  They tried to make slugs into a positive thing since they were overrun with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're really slugs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the French eat snails, but they take the snails and they put them in a barrel of  meal for a season.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, they did stuff like that to these, yes, supposedly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because then it deslimes them.  I couldn't do it.  I don't want to eat any food you have to deslime.  Just, you know, I'm just saying.  Wait, wait, no.  Okra.  Okra has to be deslimed.  People are saying, okra?  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, okra is delicious.  And all the way from San Pietro di Feletto in beautiful downtown Italy, Mike Elgin, he's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in a cheese factory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right, called Perenzine.  There's so much cheese in this building that I'm in, it's like not even funny.  There's walls and walls of Parmesan and all this different cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have to deslime my bell.  Man, I'm so jealous.  Your Prosecco event is coming up, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that starts Monday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So people will be arriving in a few days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, that's right.  Wow.  It's going to be action packed.  It's just going to be ridiculously, I don't know how everybody's going to eat as much  as we've got planned for them to eat.  For that matter, I don't know how Stacey eats as much as she just ate.  But it can be done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It can be done and it will be done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The key is not to starve beforehand because then your stomach just shrinks.  Oh.  You've got to maintain stomach volume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've got to build it up.  Build up its strength.  Is that what you're saying?  Yes, basically.  No surprises.  I am just, you know what?  I'm just grateful that I don't live in Austin as much as I would like to.  I think I would most likely kill myself.  I mean, I would just overeat and I would just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But what a way to go.  But what a way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we're all coming down from our Google I.O. high.  Stacey was at Build.  Do you feel like Stacey that you maybe made the wrong choice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, no, because I.O. did not have a lot of great I.O.T. stuff for me personally.  And Build actually had a really compelling and it pushed forward a lot of the conversation  we're having about I.O.T. at the edge.  So I actually think I made a good choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They gave all of us press free I.O.T. kits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I don't take freebies from press stuff, even cheaper stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They gave everybody it there, but yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know.  Even when they gave out, you know, when they gave the first, remember the first Google  phone?  God, what was that called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah, the H1.  Yeah, the HTC one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they gave that away and I tried it out and then a month later I gave it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When they gave out the Pixel, the first Pixel, I guess it was called Pixel.  I don't even remember now.  And it was a very high end thing.  It was a brand new thing.  And I loved it, but I actually gave it back and then bought one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I do.  You got class.  You got class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I kept it and bought one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the best of both worlds.  And then there's Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right.  Cause I'm now dreading all the stuff that's going to come out this fall that I'm going  to have to buy.  Believe me, I've bought plenty, but I'm dreading there's going to be tons of new stuff to buy  come fall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I hate it.  And every year I say I'm not buying another iPhone slash Galaxy phone slash Pixel phone.  And Lisa says, well, no, I'm sincere.  I don't want to.  And Lisa says you have to.  I mean, I do have to.  I've been using since Google I.O.  I put as effective, I think it was during the show, I put Android Android P.  God, I got to come up with a better name for that on here.  And I am really like it.  It's very stable, by the way.  I like it, too.  It's really, really nice.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have one bug where it wouldn't show me all my apps on the app view.  I reported it as a bug.  And I'm sure others did as well.  And it's fixed.  Good.  You know, it's working very well.  It's and the gestures are make sense.  I thought I was going to be sticking my tongue out and being confused.  But no, I'm fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can stick your tongue out for other reasons.  I like you know, it's simple.  I like the fact that when you press the up down volume button, you get a very nice control  center that makes it very quick and easy to control the volume right there where your  fingers already are.  That seems so simple.  It's those little things that I think make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a great discussion on all of that Android about how they arrived at that.  And they just looked at the data, usage data, and said people really actually never change  the regular volume.  It's either on or off.  Right.  What they change is media volume.  That's exactly right.  So, give you the media volume with the simple on off mute or not.  They make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And right above it is the vibrate or silence button.  Right.  So that's the call mute.  That's exactly what you want.  Yeah.  You alert it.  Right.  Either on or off.  Which was the media volume.  And then the media volume.  Those are the things you want.  If you really need to, there's a gear there if you want to get deeper into it.  I like that a lot.  The gestures.  Have you all turned on the gestures?  I really love that.  I think that's just so sensible.  Jason had to show me how to, but I did.  Yeah.  I don't know why it's not on by default.  I guess they didn't want to confuse people.  But this is a big shift for Android because it gets rid of the back home recents button  and replaces instead with a lozenge, which you slide.  With the back button when it's appropriate.  And then there's a back button as appropriate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the pull down, what do you call those things?  The pull down.  This here, the control panel or whatever.  That.  The control panel.  Yeah.  I think it's all good.  One thing I'm having trouble getting used to is that you have to hold down the press  on, let's say, Wi-Fi to get Wi-Fi.  Otherwise it just turns on rough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Didn't they always do that?  That's not.  No.  That's, oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could hold, you could touch the words below and go to the full Wi-Fi settings.  Oh, all right.  Or touch the icon and turn it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  If you just tap it, it's a quick off button.  That's what Apple does.  So I guess that's why I didn't, that didn't throw me so much.  I have to say the usability on P is, it's small details, but it's good enough, for instance,  that I abandoned my third party launchers, Nova Launcher and Action Launcher.  And I'm using the Pixel Launcher.  Yeah.  The only thing, I think we talked about this last week, they got to replace Google Now  as the swipe, you know, when you swipe right.  They got to, Google Now should have Google News.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I finally got the new Google News.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I put that as a widget right there on my second page, so I have it.  I still don't have Google News.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, wait, no, because I'm not running a P. Never mind.  No, you don't need P.  You don't need P.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you know the Google Play News Stand app?  That updates itself into something called Google News.  So if you don't have that installed, you'll need to install that.  And that'll be...  I don't want another news app.  Yeah.  Well, this is, no, you know what?  Get rid of all the other news apps.  This is the one now.  This is the one.  This is the one.  Do you agree, Mike?  Have you been using it?  Totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really, really good.  It's, they don't try to give you just the personalized news.  They don't try to give you just the generic news.  You get them both.  And it's very intelligent.  It learns.  It's just, it's really the best news app I've ever seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they made a point of saying, and I thought this was really interesting,  once you get to the tab, you know, there's the For You tab.  But once you go to the tab that's headlines or you press the button that  gives you full coverage, you get the same news everybody gets.  And I thought that was a really interesting point is that part of the problem is we're  all getting, this is that filter bubble thing, I guess.  We're all getting our own news.  And now we're all getting the same news so we can be on the same page so  we can have a conversation.  I think that's really a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Part of being informed, and this is an underappreciated idea, but  part of being informed is not just knowing what you know, but  also knowing what other people are, the news that other people are being exposed to.  So that's something frustrating, Google search, when I search for something,  the results don't tell me I'm getting these results.  I don't know what other people are getting.  It's really frustrating.  So when it comes to news, it's good to go to a place and say,  here's what Google is presenting to the world.  Then if they do something wrong, they screw it up or they have fake news or  Russian propaganda or something like that.  You can complain to them and if they fix it, they fix it for everyone.  Unlike Facebook where they fix it for you and then nobody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  These are terrible stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You just got it.  Well, that's for the For You page, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  For you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's what Google thinks I like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it'll get better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google's given eight out of the ten stories are celebrity gossip.  Jennifer Lawrence got, what is this, even has to wait for  a table at Brooklyn, Hot Spot Lillia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't care.  Yeah, you need to go to your favorites, that third tabby.  Not really, Dr. Kinnick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I got dead.  My top story is the Senate votes to save net neutrality.  Yes, that's mine as well.  It knows you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  It knows you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Number seven is Trump discloses payment to Cohen and financial report,  which I feel is larger news way above Deadpool and Jennifer Lawrence.  Not above Deadpool.  Yeah, yeah, above Deadpool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you can change that.  Go to favorites and you can select the sources that you want.  I get a lot of- Why are they getting these?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it because I'm a girl?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hope not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because I've got so much celebrity news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, see, I disabled that in the favorites.  OK, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to favorites, y'all.  Sorry.  I'm just like, why is this so sucky?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I have no celebrity news in my favorites.  I love it when you say y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you were to use the app every day and always ignore the celebrity news  and always not ignore other news, it would fade away.  You can't ignore it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't.  You can't ignore it.  That's exactly right.  You have to look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's bringing out your true essence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And this drives me nuts.  So I once, once you guys clicked on news about the royal wedding,  because as a journalist, I feel like I have to keep abreast of what people are talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And now I have to un- I have to unlike every single member of the royal family.  Do you know how many of them there are?  And more of them keep popping out.  It's it's distressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple news is the same way for me, which surface a lot of gossip.  But the problem is those are linkbaity headlines and you really kind of almost have to click on them.  So it's I don't I don't even want them in my in my feet at all.  They don't want to even have them there because that way I won't be tempted.  But you can do that. You have to you have to go to the favorites there.  I'm very happy. I agree with you, Mike.  I'm very happy with this. I think they've done a good job.  I love that they that they kind of front and center the idea of everybody being, you know, getting the same feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And they finally come up with an idea that I think is better than a newspaper.  So a newspaper. I love newspapers, especially in print.  But the idea that you that you have a intelligently curated deep dive on multiple publications,  that's really where you start to understand what's happening in the world.  Not when you read just one publication or when you're a wash in whatever social media throws at you.  If you can take a deep dive into an issue and see what what the Daily Beast says about it and what,  you know, some other publication says about it, then then you really start to understand it.  And I think that's really important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think in a way that's kind of what the New York Times was saying when they said all the news that's fit to print.  That was the all the news part. Right. But it was still one.  I understand was one editor, one journal.  Exactly. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I love the New York Times, but it's nice to you know, sometimes with these filter bubbles, it sort of magnifies itself.  And sometimes you'll go to it.  To it, for example, you read a lot of left wing publications, you go to a right wing publication like Reason or the National Review.  Reason is arguably right wing.  And you're like, oh, my God, they've got they've got a good point that they're making that you never hear in the usual suspects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I actually subscribed to I subscribe to the paper version of Reason for that very reason.  It's more libertarian, I'd say that it's libertarian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is completely libertarian.  And most of it is it's not a great, great publication like, you know, the New Yorkers like that.  But they will put out a perspective consistently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what it's thoughtful and intelligent.  At least. Right. I mean, it's not the Atlantic, but it's trying.  It's trying to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's a different perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. That's the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, without without getting individual or hate or anything, it just tries to make you think differently, which is fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you see that Facebook says that they have clobbered in the first three months of twenty eighteen more than half a billion fake accounts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hate stuff like that. Is that a lot?  That's supposed to be a lot. I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Half a billion is a lot.  Oh, I'm sorry. Wait a minute.  Four million users. Over four billion users.  Yeah. Over six months.  One point three billion.  Yeah. So what if there are ten billion things that they didn't catch?  But these are whole accounts.  So if you have two billion accounts and in six months you've killed one point three billion, that is that tells you something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, it tells you that the fake news people are creating accounts as fast as they can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because of latency, sometimes, Mike, it's going to be a little hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry. Last time I was muting myself every two seconds.  You're good. I hear you. Go ahead.  Oh, yeah. Well, too much. All too much.  You go back to that muting thing, Jeff.  We're enjoying that.  So at F8 Zuckerberg said on stage that they were killing a million fake accounts a day.  And then someone else on stage later said millions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So we don't even know what the real number is, it sounds like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The scale of this is unbelievable.  So when somebody said at F8, oh gee, more ways to report fake accounts to you, they said, well, that's nice, but it really doesn't help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Facebook, I presume, is doing kind of the same thing.  Twitter announced this week that they're going to start watching all the signals, which will help them.  Twitter is going to not mute, but slow down accounts that get blocked a lot, things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. That is the definition.  There are hardcore trolls and then there are kind of like soft trolls.  Many, many trolls don't know that they're trolls.  Part-time trolls.  They are just reacting and stuff like that.  Yeah, but they do exactly what Twitter is going after.  You have this great conversation going and some Debbie Downer steps in there and just derails the whole conversation.  Right.  That's a troll, either whether they know it or not.  And that's the kind of thing they say they're going to go after.  Personally, I would prefer, you know, Twitter, everything Twitter does is they're trying to make sure that, you know,  the solution obviously is to give users control over what's deleted in the comment thread that  falls out of the tweet, just like everybody else, like Facebook and everywhere else, where you can delete other people's comments.  They don't want you to be able to do that.  So they're coming up with some automatic way.  The problem with that is it's a black box.  You don't know what they're deleting. You don't know why they're deleting it.  It's not the kind of thing you can really criticize because you don't know it's happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a really good article by Charlie Wartzel and BuzzFeed about fake Facebook profiles that you can buy to like you.  He refers to this profile.  Audrey Mitchell is a 23 year old New York City transplant from London, an aspiring model working at KFC.  KFC?  I don't know, you know, you got to keep you got to work.  She has 921 friends.  She likes the New York Knicks.  The movies, me and Earl and the Dying Girl.  I guess that's one movie. I don't know.  And the St. Paul, Minnesota based hip hop duo Idea and Abilities.  She's currently single, but she loves cupcakes, but she doesn't exist.  Charlie says, I know this for certain because it just took me a few clicks in one painless  Bitcoin transaction on a Russian website to buy Audrey Mitchell and her believably constructed digital footprint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  13 Bitcoin? That's hella expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, $13 in Bitcoin.  Oh, I know. 13 Bitcoin.  Hey, you can have a follower too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm like, I'll sell my profile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding. Really? For 13 Bitcoin, I'd sell mine.  After the transaction, an email link offered up a downloadable file containing the unique phone number.  Audrey's account was registered under a password and a registered birthdate.  All the credentials necessary to gain access to the account.  Within 30 minutes, I was behind the wheel of Audrey's page.  So I guess there's a factory somewhere cranking out Facebook profiles that you could buy.  Now, why would you buy this profile?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because the more, well, not on Twitter, but like an Instagram, the more followers you have, the more money you can get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you're not buying her followership. You're buying her.  You're actually now controlling this account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Then you want to boost your brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am at the RightsCon conference here in Toronto.  Oh, I'm so jealous.  It's really good. It's a very good conference.  I'm giving you some really good sessions to be here right now.  Thank you.  Because you matter to me.  But I went to a lot of sessions this morning, including one with Joan Donovan, our new friend here at Twig,  where what's happening is rather than creating that new account that they recognize is new and they kill,  you buy an account that's been around for a little while, somebody invested in it,  and you use that to amplify whatever you're doing.  So you buy 100 accounts, you somehow or another have 100 accounts,  and you use that to amplify the crap you're putting out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It makes sense. If you can get $13, this is an interesting business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I also did something else today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead, Mike.  I'm sorry. $13 to get a single follower, even though you can control that follower, is actually quite a bit.  That's a lot of money for one. If you want a substantial following, let's say you want $50,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no. But see, again, they're not selling followers here.  Followers, you can make a lot of money in volume.  They're selling a whole account.  I can buy 10,000 followers for a few bucks on Twitter because that one account can be sold again  and again and again and again. In this case, you're getting control of the account.  Considering how much effort must have been put into building that account,  this is fantastic value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have a real person or someone who looks real who then can amplify your messages.  It's like a fake reviewer that's credible for anything you want to use it for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you had 1,000 of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's say you're United and you killed a dog. Then you get this person to say,  I ship my pet on United all the time. It does well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. $13,000 for a company and you have 1,000 voices, that doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or for a government or for Russia. I found out something else today at Ranscon.  So last year at IO, they announced this new thing on YouTube where you could  pay to buy up your comment, right? Five bucks in your comment. Peertyre, remember that?  Yeah. Oh, yeah.  So what I found out is that in some of these really dark worlds where they're doing horrible  racist misogynist stuff, they're making thousands of dollars that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, and I have to point out that she's an attractive young lady.  Which leads me to believe there are other ways you could use this account  to get money out of guys. I mean, there's a lot you could do with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know if I want to follow that train of thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, but I'm sure that that's the, I'm almost certain that that's the real,  that's how that's going to be used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those fake accounts will try to offend you, right, Leo?  Yeah. And all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You don't send them like weird compromising things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't, but some people might. And it's not necessarily weird compromising things.  Some of the things you do is you say, send me $10 or here's my wishlist. Send me things  from my wishlist. There's lots of ways you can monetize an attractive young lady or a  fake account by a fake attractive young lady. I think that does not, that I would guess is the  real use for that. Because if you're looking for, if you're United, let's, I'm sure United  doesn't do this, but if you're some company that wanted merely to have a lot of positive  comments, you wouldn't have attractive models. You'd have all kinds of people, mostly schlumpy,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  mostly real people, right? I guess to test that theory, we would see how much,  how these are valued. So is she $13 because she's pretty or is she $13 because she has

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  X number of followers. I think Stacey, you need to do a deep dive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I already deal with enough gross people in the world. I don't need to go here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't either. I don't have to go here because I know it's, I'm sure that that's the case.  By the way, we're going to let Mike go because the quality of his,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry. I accidentally interrupted him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, he couldn't, he couldn't participate very well because he, of the latency in the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  or those I've been there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you have. And we've let you go sometimes too. So I hate to do that, but cause I love the  contribution, but it just, it makes it hard to have the conversation. So I was really hoping for  like cheese, a cheese factory tour. I know we should mention though, even though I'm sure  it's too late for the Prosecco tour, which is coming up this weekend, that there are other  events you can go to. If you go to Mike's website, gastronomad.com, click the experiences link.  He's going to have many more events, a Provence event coming up next in June, Morocco, November,  Mexico city, December. He and his wife, Amira, Amira is a brilliant cook. They invite,  I can't remember how many it is. It's like 12 people, six couples. You cook together,  you eat together, you see the sites. They go there ahead of time and become experts in the area.  It's a really nice idea. Gastronomad.net. We'll give them a plug. So this is the article,  Facebook disabled according to their transparency report. This is kind of mind boggling to me.  Mind boggling, yeah. More than half a billion fake accounts, not to mention millions of spam,  sex and hate speech posts. I don't know, it's the internet. It feels kind of like that's low.  Do you think they've been doing that all along?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. I think probably doing more now. But what's fascinating to me is that we keep on  talking about technology being the problem and the platform being the problem. What's really  happening here is that, and I heard this at this conference today, is that governments are putting  companies in the position of being an intermediary. What was somebody called it? A large scale  micro justice where they're expected to make all these judgments and all these decisions.  And there's fear that a lot of legitimate discussion and free speech goes out with that  bath water. But yeah, right now the hot seat they're on, they're going to kill stuff right and left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree with you. That's not exactly who you don't want to put in that position, but who else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So here's the question. It's really interesting. I've been thinking about this a lot lately.  Number one, we've met the problem in guess who? It's human. It's not technology. It's not  technology doesn't lead us down this path. It's that a small number of people manipulate these  things in bad ways. And we say to the platforms, fix it. But you're fixing a societal problem.  That's difficult. Number one. Number two, we're concentrating all this energy on, sorry, so stage,  I'll do number two that I'll shut up. We're concentrating all this energy on the bad side  of things. All this resource, all this effort is trying to tamp down, which we're never going to  do. We're going to fail at it. Meanwhile, we're ignoring the quality end. We could be putting  more resources to say, ignore that junk. Yeah, there's junk there. There's always going to be  junk there. Ignore that. But here's good stuff. We're going to help you find it. We don't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And we should be able to space it. Oh, no. I'm glad you had the numbers. That clued me to the  fact that I was like, wait, no. So I would argue that these platforms, they have to recognize  their role as a tool for information, gathering information or not gathering, delivering information.  And as such, they actually do have a responsibility. And I argue with Matthew Ingram about this all the  time. He hates the idea that Facebook is going to censor people. However, if you build a platform  with the intent that people will use it, you have to build in controls knowing that some people  are going to use it in a way that is counterproductive to good citizenship or civility or  whatever else. And to say, oh, we built it. We have no responsibility.  That's, I mean, that's what we've done with like, you know, the nuclear bomb. But at the same time,  that hasn't turned out super well for people. So we have to figure out the same sort of things we  have, the same sort of frameworks and conversations we have about other tools that we've created that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  cause problems or could be used for good. Well, and Stacy, I'm just, I'm sorry, go ahead.  We know what happens if you don't do that. You get Twitter. So I think, I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  so I think it's good and bad. Yeah, but I like Twitter. Twitter is a good for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Twitter is good. Not saying Twitter is not good, but Twitter unfettered free speech on Twitter  is a became a massive problem. I think that they're actually starting to get a handle on it,  but it became a massive problem. And I don't mean for me personally, I mean, just in general,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  don't you disagree? Well, the problem, of course, it can be seen. It can be seen now.  It can be heard now. In every booth at Denny's, there was this kind of idiocy and hatred and  awful stuff going on for years, but we couldn't see it. We couldn't hear it. Now it can be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I believe it does help push that agenda and cultivate it though. It's one thing,  because when you find like-minded people who all spout the same thing, you're like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, I'm totally normal. Right. I don't think Charlottesville, it's not a coincidence.  Charlottesville happened in the Twitter era. I think that that empowered a certain type of  person and gave them an or just as it helped organize the Arab spring, it helped organize white  supremacists. It gave them a voice. It gave them a way to organize, to find each other.  And you nailed it, Stacey. It validated them. I'm not just some loner in my mom's basement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And not always to the negative. I mean, the same thing the internet has done for those people. It's  also helped people like I ran into a bunch of crazy migraine sufferers who were on the same drugs I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  was on. 100%. But that's why it is on the platform to promote the good and to at best it can damp down  the bad. And that's why I'm saying Twitter is an example of where it got out of control.  And now I think they're realizing that and they're taking it in hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they are. Look at what- I think their responsibility isn't to actively,  may not be to actively tamp down. I think their responsibility is to recognize the potential for  harm and to take steps to mitigate, may not be the right word, but have those conversations and  get the right people involved. So I actually don't want Twitter, those guys all thinking,  when Facebook decides what's harmful, they ended up banning breastfeeding pictures, right?  So you have to open up your platform to outside groups. And honestly, that's gonna be different  for maybe each geography. And see, this is why it's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The process for breastfeeding pictures worked out though, because they banned it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh my God, it was such a pain though. But they banned it and then people got together

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and said, no, you can't ban it. And after I think a good period of debate, Facebook said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  oh yeah, you're right. That was a period of debate that lasted like over a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they need to be more responsive. They have to take responsibility in both directions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's your, you're both right. But the question, the hard question, of course, is how? I  interviewed Jonathan Zunger this week about, about justice, fascinating. Can you ask him to  get come on the show? I want to get him on the show. He's wonderful. Love him. And he was the star  from Google+. He's left Google now, but I want to talk about, about this moral question. And he,  what he says to your point, what he called on was civil engineering. You had engineering,  you built buildings and you built bridges and they fell down. Oops, we can't do that.  And so you did recognize some level of responsibility and standards and governance  around that. So I think, I think we're, we're trying to reach an agreement about that technology.  I think Christon Harris goes way too far. And Roger back to me is just doing his,  doesn't call me tour and they're not being helpful.  He's hated Google for years.  Yeah, they're not being helpful. But the hard part that we're not getting to is I think we're,  I think we're agreeing that there is a level of responsibility, but there are lines we don't want  them to cross. And we don't look, but we don't have, and I include myself on that, I include  us on this, is I don't think if we sat down today and said, okay, here's the rule book, folks,  we wouldn't know how to write it. Yet we expect that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think we need a process. What if we don't create a rule book? What if we create a process  by which, because like if you think about like the judiciary, and this is kind of a  crappy example because it takes for freaking ever and it's a gameable process. But thinking about  something like that probably makes a little bit more sense because then it can change over time

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  with the mores of society. Yes. So there was an effort put up today.  I don't have it right in front of me, but somebody put out a proposal for this kind of  rules-based structure and that there are some principles include if your content is taken down,  you need to be given notice before it's done. There needs to be some measure of appeal,  things like that. So there's a process and a structure. But Stacey, here's the issue.  At the scale, at a billion fake accounts. And so then I go and game the system and I appeal each  one of those. And so what's happened in Ukraine is the Russians are going in and they're finding  anything they can to kill legitimate accounts of anti-Russian activists in Ukraine and they're  flooding the process. Right. So I agree with you. I agree with you about process, but that's hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  too. Well, so this gets back to my core thing, which is we have engineered all of technology,  all of computing to be computer-like, to be binary. And we don't think of it as adversarial.  And so this is where I think when we start trying to scale out stuff that interacts as tech interacts  in more facets of our life becomes more valuable and decides more things that matter to people,  we have to think about how people will game the system. And you say adversarial, you mean a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  process like the legal system, like the adversarial process. Yes, for everything. Otherwise we can't,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  we're basically sticking all of this on computers with the same mindset we've had since, you know,  the 1980s and 70s, which is if I program it to do it, it will do it. I think exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's what's happening right now, frankly. I think that's the conversation that's happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Henry Kissinger wrote a piece in the Atlantic, which I thought was fairly ridiculous.  By a tweet by Sparky Tweety was Henry Kissinger discovers 2018, but he's kind of arguing that  point, Stacey, where he says it's just out today. I just put it on the rundown where he says that  the pre-press, the enlightenment was about things that were not binary.  The enlightenment was about huge discussion and philosophy and all that. And that we're losing  that nuance and going back to binary. And we have systems we don't know how they operate.  And a lot of this is naive and Henry just learns what computers do. But no, I think you're right,  Stacey. I think that we have the presumption of a binary world and it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or yeah, I mean, the engineers building this stuff don't think of it as something. People now  have a bigger motivation to quote unquote hack this or to get around these things because they're  in control of so much more. And when it was just silly games or nerdy pursuits, most people didn't  have that. But now we've got financial incentives. We've just got so much. And so of course,  we're going to hack it. And now we have to rethink the way we program and engineer and build these  things and shove them out into the world. This new Facebook transparency report actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is fascinating and quite an eye opener and answers some of that question that we were asking about  whether Facebook's stepping this up. This graph shows the increase in graphic violence violations  on Facebook. This is not, I don't think because Facebook started policing it, but they've noticed  a growth of point 16 to point 19%. I'm sorry, 16 to 19% in October, December 2017 to 20.22 to 27%.  Almost a doubling. And you could see it across the board in adult nudity and sexual activity,  terrorist propaganda, how much content do we take action on? Big growths quarter to quarter. This  is quarter to quarter hate speech, spam, actually less of a growth in spam than all the others.  Fake accounts actually are down a little bit. But if you look at the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's partly because they're buying accounts instead of faking them. They're burning. One person  said today at this conference that, and boy, it's a good conference if I'm quoted five times,  said that the metrics are all wrong. The metrics are, how much should we take down?  So volume became basis. And this is so easy to scale that volume is the real measurement here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think this is, read more deeply into this report. It's really interesting. For instance,  Facebook asserts that they find about 80% of violating content before people report it.  It's not based on reporting. The little thin thing here, 5.6% of content was acted upon because  users reported it first. 95% acted on by Facebook, flagged by Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do they have- They say their

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  AI is getting better. Maybe it is. Yeah. 99% of terrorist content was flagged by Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do they have a mechanism for disputing that? I'd be very interested in like,  I've automatically taken all this down and then how much of that was disputed by-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a transparency report. It's not transparent.  Please. It's silly me.  Interestingly though, when it comes to hate speech, Facebook is not very good at detecting it.  It's hard to detect hate speech. Because it's in the eye of the beholder, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, not just that. There's all kinds of ways to get around it.  They should employ the same people who do China's firewall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those guys are good. Those guys can adapt to everything.  They're good. That's the fear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've got to show you something. So, Joe gave an example of a meme. I won't say the meme  because I don't want to spread it. But it was a racist meme that tries to make being whites okay,  kind of a meme. And they didn't put it on Facebook. What they did was they put out the meme and they  basically said, get this thing on the campuses, get it on the walls of restaurants and stuff.  People will take pictures of it. They'll put it on social media. It looked like it's coming  up independently. It looks like there's kind of a movement and media will start writing about it.  And they did. And so they're using things offline now to push back online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's also, that's been something that's been around for a while. You look at the  astroturfing efforts. I mean, this is not, again, people want to push their agenda and they're going  to optimize how they do it. And we just have to become more savvy over time about what we're  reading. And I mean, this makes it easier. It's like email suddenly made it very easy to send junk  mail to people, but we're going to get over this too. I was a direct and ringside witness to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  one of the very earliest examples of this, which was the rise and fall of DIG,  because it was started by my friend, Kevin Rose in 2004. And it was a really, I thought,  initially great idea to crowdsource news, you know, have people vote on news stories and they  would rise to the top. It'd be a great way to find the best stories. But it was very quickly,  people started gaming it and the gaming got worse and worse. And Kevin went through four or five  iterations trying to find ways to get around the gaming. But every time he came up with a fix,  the people who were doing the gaming are so motivated and so clever that they just got  around it. And it eventually put them out of business. This goes to your Chinese wife, Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just put on the bottom of the rundown, George Nima, who's an old friend of mine, who's in Europe,  went to China and learned about the social credit system. Oh, fascinating.  That is good.  It's really, really scary. What happens in China, of course, is that the populace finds things that  don't get caught. So white supremacists in America now are talking about pit bulls and killing pit  bulls is a secret language for anti-white in the view.  Oh, interesting.  So, but you look at this Chinese thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, they just say it because the pit bulls are proxies for white people.  So he writes here, George writes here,  Words cannot describe the way I feel right now. I am shaking physically.  But the Chinese government is implementing a system which will assign a social credit rating  to every citizen based on government data regarding their economic and social status.  It works as a mass surveillance tool. It uses big data analysis technology. In addition,  it's also meant to rate businesses operating in the Chinese market. If you've seen Black Mirror's  Nosedive, this is it. We have seen that. That's exactly what it sounds like.  The rating algorithm known only to the government.  President Xi's plan is based on the stated government principle, once untrustworthy,  always restricted.  That's chivalry.  Hey, we don't let felons vote.  Right. Minorities and minority opinions will be negatively rated as a result of this program.  Political dissidents, journalists, and jaywalkers, petty thieves, and others.  The consequences of negative ratings, and we've heard some of this include restricted movement,  career potential, access to services.  People who associate with people with negative rankings will also be negatively ranked.  So there's an incentive to isolate and marginalize minority opinions.  There is no appeal process. Once you're rated, that's it.  There's no system to challenge positive or negative ratings.  He CCs you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep.  Yes. Kevin and I talk about this stuff all the time because we're intrigued by it. What's  crazy is the amount of technology that we have deployed that China is using in this process.  So think the surveillance cameras, think actually they're putting wearables on workers to track  their emotions during work so they can understand what makes a person productive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We do have something very similar here in the United States. It's called a FICO score.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this is not like a FICO score.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good luck appealing your FICO score.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, but that only affects your credit rating, which I'm not saying that's not insignificant,  but this can affect if your kid gets into the right school and again, not being able to travel.  I don't think your FICO score, there's redlining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We never got rid of redlining in this country.  No.  And there's all sorts of subtle economic redlining. I agree. We are not anywhere near what China's  doing, but that is absolutely the end game, the potential for this kind of stuff. And that's why  it really is important we pay attention to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like governments more frightening than companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, so that's a good question. We assume that the government's more frightening because they  have these broad unrestricted powers, but the way our current government's going, if you look at  what happened with, oh gosh, is it Experian or Equifax? I can't remember which one.  Equifax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I called them Experian for a while, but it's Equifax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So not getting in any trouble. If you look at how companies are  corrupting our government, it's kind of boiling down to the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think that's why I mentioned FICO scores, because that is not governmental.  That is private industry. And while it is nowhere near as nasty as the social credit system in China,  it has some of the same attributes. And I mean, it doesn't have to just be government.  If it's going to happen in the US, it's probably going to happen through private corporations,  I would bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and there are insurance firms who look at your Facebook friends to see if like your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are employers who look at your Facebook friends before they hire you.  It's credit risk too.  Yeah. It's all in there. So it's just, this is a cautionary tale. This is something we should be...  Very much so.  This is the end game on stuff like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And when we say we want to get rid of bad behavior, we want to stigmatize bad behavior,  in obvious cases, I agree, but what system are you creating and how will it be used?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Going to Japan was really interesting for me because on the one hand, they do what  you've always advocated, Jeff. Instead of making a law, they use social shaming to keep people in  line. And it's...  Am I advocating that?  Well, you said that really norms should guide behavior, not laws.  Right.  Okay.  That's kind of the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's like being in a small town in the Midwest or the deep South. I mean, you could be...  You could be shaming for all kinds of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that also says we have responsibility. Right? So...  Yeah, but I have to point out...  Your day for the responsibility for the behavior of the town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to point out that, again, this can be misused, can be repressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, but in the case of the US, you can always leave your small town,  which is why a lot of people who don't fit the norms leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mobility is a good antidote, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is.  It is probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why a lot of people say, I'm moving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's it, I'm moving.  Why do you think I went to four high schools in three states and four elementary schools  in three states?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The geographic cure.  In China, you can't move because your poor social score keeps you in the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and okay, you really want to get deep. It's also why public policy in this country  really promotes people owning homes. It's why there's a mortgage interest deduction.  It's not because it's good for the country, it's because it reduces mobility, reduces  social mobility, keeps people locked in where they are.  Really?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think a lot of economists have said that that's actually a bad thing for the economy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a very bad thing. Look at Detroit, where people just abandoned homes because that was  the only way they could get out, was walking away from their mortgage and their home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Same with employer health insurance, you're stuck with your job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I've always felt the main role of government is to preserve the status quo  and to keep... and mostly that means for the affluent and successful and wealthy to have  their privilege and keep the lower classes out of the way and suppressed and working hard for them.  This is one way that government does that. It's subtle, but I think this is exactly the  kind of thing that's... I think policy often is all about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, policy has plenty of unintended consequences. If you read...  I don't think it's an unintended, is my point.  Well, okay, yes.  I think it's exactly the consequence.  Maybe. I'm thinking about things like in the army, for example, wives of people who serve  in the military often can't get jobs because their spouses move so often, but the military  has refused to create programs that could help their spouses. Part of that, I think, is just a  again, a status quo and not wanting to change things that for a while weren't perceived to be  broken. But I mean, it is hard to change things. But Leo, up here in Canada, they've never been

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  able to write off their mortgage interest and they buy homes like crazy and the real estate

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  values have soared incredibly. Well, there are many ways to get people to do what you want them to do.  Economic incentives are just one.  Okay. Yeah.  Oh, no, I really think that that's... I mean, if you're in a legislature, your goal is...  And of course, the campaign laws really promote this. Your goal is really to maintain  even kings, maintain an even keel. Let's just keep it the way it is. Everybody's happy the way it is.  And so there are lots of ways to do that. Hey, did you buy a Google clips, Stacy? Did you end  up getting one of those?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, I thought it was creepy at first and...  Now it's even creepier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Candids of hugs and kisses.  Candids of hugs and kisses. Google announced today that their smart camera,  that little clips camera that you don't control, it controls itself,  is getting better at noticing things like hugs, kisses, jumps and dance moves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, well, this is... Again, that's like parenting right there.  It is. I know this person thinks it's super creepy, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's just the link bait headline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But yeah, I mean, I want to see when my kid is dancing. That's perfect time to take a picture.  Or what if my kid is... She doesn't have a sibling, but if she were kissing her sibling as a parent,  those are the kind of brief moments that make you feel like, oh, I didn't screw this up entirely.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. If I'm programming AI, that's exactly what I'm looking for.  Moments of emotion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yeah.  Now, what would really be creepy is if it recognized when you were sobbing and started...  And now recognizes existential despair and you get all these pictures of your kids staring at the window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, I bet it does, but I bet they write it in...  Don't take a picture of that.  I'm almost certain it does and it says, don't take a picture.  Don't take a picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they'll kick in this new Google junk where it'll tell you to take some time out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're sending you some Xanax by FedEx.  We'll banning you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's when it shows you ads for retail therapy, guys.  Exactly. Have you ever thought of Skyping your therapist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'll tell you, baby, you're fucking a little piece of YouTube.  Yeah. No, that's a good...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tomorrow, actually, I am Skyping my therapist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You see, the world is a better place thanks to technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you say, Stacey, that you wouldn't mind having a computerized therapist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, like a bot for basic stuff?  I actually think it might be kind of helpful.  Yeah, for some people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why do you say that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why do you say that?  Exactly.  What do you think that means?  Uh-huh.  Yeah, actually, if you're a Freudian therapist, you don't even say that.  What do you think that means?  You just go, uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  That's all you need.  Uh-huh.  You think you should come every day from now on?  Uh-huh.  So I was hoping somebody had bought clips.  They're going to update in May, and I was just curious if any...  We probably should get one just to see the changes and all that.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, does it also recognize people to stand in the middle finger at you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Again, I'm sure it does and avoids photographs of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What would be interesting is if you could offer feedback,  so you train it on what the great emotions are for you.  Now, imagine how the algorithms could change over the life of your child, for example.  Like as a teen, the pictures you'd want or they'd want to get would be very different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they're getting signals because if you upload your photos to Google Photos,  they know how often you view those photos, edit them, spend time with them, go back to them.  But are they using them to train?  Well, what I'm saying is, don't you think Google is?  You never know.  If I could think of it, if I could think of that, I'm sure  some Google engineer has already thought of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There is actually limited compute resources in the world.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, yes, there are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not with the new water-cooled TPUs.  I saw no water-cooled TPU.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, really, that's the point of Google Photos, is it not?  I mean, they're not giving that stuff away for free for nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  Yeah, of course.  But I mean, really, come on.  That's a bad girl, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I'm like, yeah, yeah, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't you think Google knows exactly which photos you've looked at the most,  which ones you've edited?  Not just you, but everybody.  Well, it doesn't.  But it's valuable to know it about you too, because then your clips  can get a feedback loop saying Stacey wants more of that.  She doesn't know it, but she wants more.  That's what Facebook does with the newsfeed.  Why wouldn't Google do it with photos and clips?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because it's a problem.  What if you start missing things?  Your life then becomes, like your memories of your life become this weird edited thing.  Yeah, it's the new filter bubble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You only see pictures of stuff you want to see pictures of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I mean, granted, we only see the things we want in our loved ones anyway, but  sometimes you come across a picture and you're like, wait a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is this is it's photographic soba is convincing you're happy all the time,  even if you're not.  Here's the real problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In real world, this happens all the time in many ways,  feedback loops with your spouse and your loved ones and all that stuff.  But it's a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what therapy is for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a very subtle, I think very sophisticated, highly nuanced process.  Computers are by their very nature blunt instruments.  And I don't care how much you sell neural networks and machine learning and amazing  technology.  It's a very blunt instrument.  So no matter what, whether it's making Twitter and Facebook a powerful tool for good and kind  of deprecating the bad or making your pictures more use, no matter what, it's going to be  uncanny valley time.  It's going to be a little bit off because it's a computer.  They're not just they're machines.  They're not that good.  Do you watch Westworld on Sunday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't watch the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm so far behind I could never catch up.  No spoilers.  But you got to catch up because Sunday was a big one.  I'm not saying anything.  I'm not saying anything.  All right.  Let's take a little break here and talk about...  Do you remember the Moog synthesizer?  So the guy who started Moogsoft was a big fan of the Moog synthesizer.  He wanted to call the company...  See the cow on the logo?  Moosoft.  But somebody already had that.  So he said, oh, well, we could call it Moogsoft.  And a great website was born and great technology for people in IT.  Moogsoft is all about eliminating the noise.  I really wanted when I was in Japan, we didn't get around to it,  to go to a pachinko parlor and get some video.  I don't know if you've ever been.  The pachinko parlors in Japan are basically casinos now.  They used to be just those little metal balls going through and they were always noisy.  But now they've also got roulette...  Not roulette.  What do you...  Slot machines.  Slot machines.  Thank you.  They now have slot machines and it's really noisy.  You go in there and it's assaultive.  And I wanted to get a video of it because that's what it's like when you're the IT guy  and those alerts and those tickets are lighting up your monitor.  You can't be productive.  You can only go stressed out.  That's what Moogsoft is all about.  Taking all those alerts, analyzing them,  eliminating 99% of the alerts, just giving you the stuff you need.  It's an algorithmic IT ops platform.  Now they call it AI ops, but the AI doesn't stand for artificial intelligence.  It stands for algorithmic IT ops.  And it will reduce your IT alerts and tickets by up to 99%, guaranteed.  And it doesn't do that by keeping you out of the know.  It does it by giving you the alerts that matter.  Moogsoft's AI ops platform integrates with all your existing IT tools.  So look who uses it.  I mean, everybody uses this.  So you'll get all the information you need,  but they correlate events into actionable work items.  They call them situations like, okay, we got a situation and here's what you need to do.  They even have ways of recording a knowledge base of how you handle these.  And so it's getting better.  It's got a feedback loop all the time.  You focus on tackling the stuff that matters.  I'll give you a case study.  HCL Technologies, they are a managed service provider, a global business.  They have a product called Dry Ice, big award winner.  You probably heard of it.  They include Moogsoft AI ops as the event management layer within the Dry Ice platform.  That way clients can streamline their operational flows.  They reduce time in the life cycle of incident tech.  They call it detect to correct.  That's the life cycle from detection to correction of incident tickets.  And this is the big number here.  HCL experienced a 33% reduction, one third reduction in mean time to restore.  So they can support more customers with service quality  and keep operational costs low and efficiency high.  If you're a global IT managed service provider, you get more alerts than anybody.  You need Moogsoft AI ops.  That's why they use it.  With Moogsoft AI ops, you can reduce your IT alerts  and your tickets by up to 99% right now.  Look at that.  Go to moogsoft.com and get a demo.  M-O-O-G-S-O-F-T.com.  Moogsoft.  And we thank moogsoft.com for their support of this week in Google.  We started with Mike Elgin.  We had to let him go because of a bad connection in his cheese factory.  In San Pietro di Filetto.  But we've still got Jeff Jarvis here.  He's in Toronto.  And hey, Stacey Egan Botham.  She's in Austin.  She's covered in barbecue sauce.  Jeff is covered in conference.  What is the conference you're at and tell us about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis RightsCon.  So it's like 2000 people up here dealing with all the issues we talk about.  You know, about how we run the internet and preserve human rights  and what are those rights that we're trying to preserve.  It's really fascinating.  I'm going to be on the panel tomorrow about terrorist video and YouTube and the platforms  we expect them to do.  But it goes all the way from that.  That's the kind of easy end of this.  When you go down into behavioral stuff.  And so on the one hand, you have them saying, platforms fix this stuff.  On the other hand, you have a panel here about how maybe we need new laws to guarantee freedom  of speech against the platforms.  So on the one hand, we're telling the platforms, kill stuff together.  Don't kill stuff.  And you just see this accordion they're stuck in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's what you're saying is there's no more consensus there than there is here.  It's not easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is hard stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you've always said we need to dig in and address it instead of turning our back on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Put a lot of fears here.  It's also interesting about government.  Shouldn't be highly involved.  Government shouldn't.  This is a crowd that wants to regulate things and control things and guarantee people's  rights and so on.  But on the other hand, the German law, the Detz-Dez-Gay law, if you leave the speech  for 24 hours, horrible things happen.  Looking at the impact of this.  There's a lot of issues.  This is hard.  We can't fix it.  These solutions are easy.  We ought to have a lot of discussion about it, which is all we ever do is discuss and  discuss and discuss it to see we're helping the world that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, some Google employees are doing more than discuss.  We talked before about Google employees, a 4,000 signature petition saying Google has  to stop helping the Defense Department with Project Maven.  It's a project that uses face recognition to help artificial intelligence to help  the military analyze drone footage by automatically classifying images of objects and people.  According to Gizmodo, which who talked to some of them, about a dozen of these employees  have now resigned saying Google has not been responsive and they finally felt they had  to take some action.  So it's happening everywhere.  The employees who talk to Gizmodo, this is according to Kate Conquer writing for Gizmodo,  employees who talk to Gizmodo say that executives have become less transparent with their workforce  about controversial business decisions and seem less interested in listening to workers'  objections than they once did.  Google's said that this face recognition that stuff they're doing is purely defensive,  that they don't want to help the Defense Department with offensive capabilities.  But of course, there's nothing that can't be used for offense.  More of the same, you know?  I think this has all surfaced lately.  We're just all very aware of it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If I could figure out how people like how this zeitgeist worked, I would be such a better  reporter.  Yeah.  I mean, I feel like why did this why did it hit an inflection point at this point in time?  This has been going on and I think the election has been going on since November.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  2016 is how long this has been going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's been going on way before that.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But we put up with it until 2016 for some reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think we really I mean, like I found the article about and maybe it's because I'm  in Texas, but I don't know if you guys remember the Jade Helm hilarity, which is where the  army was the army.  One branch of the military was doing, you know, basic exercises in Texas and oh, yeah,  it somehow became helicopters are coming.  Yeah, we people in Texas decided that this was actually a military exercise against the  citizens of Texas and our lieutenant governor at the time was like, yeah, and they made  official statements about it and all this was propagated by Russian bots.  And so I didn't hear that part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's that's the subsequent follow up, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  So the Texas Tribune, I think it was awesome organization.  They did a story linking that to so that was actually way before the election and that  actually was an impetus to get people who were interested in using this as a form of  propaganda, fear mongering vote disruption.  We're like, oh, hey, we can totally affect policy if we if we like get a bunch of crazy  people spouting crazy ideas.  Um, so I think now we're becoming aware of it at a level that is, I guess, the politicians  care.  I I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I think a couple things happen.  I think that we, you know, that cuts was employed for years dealing with the economic  manipulation of the systems that were created.  Um, only now we're seeing the both political and psychological manipulation.  By psychological, I mean things like trolls and misogynists and all that.  And and and so I think a few things could have happened.  One is that it took them longer to learn the power of this.  It took a few big players to have a real impact.  It took the election to have an impact.  It took impact on politicians for them to understand.  It took impact on our country to understand.  All these things came together.  I think your sense is right that this was not the case forever.  It was smaller, but now it's huge.  So maybe not.  Are we over blowing this?  Are we blowing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, there are there are plenty of people who have no idea.  Like, I think we talked about this a couple weeks ago and I know it's.  But and that's always been the case.  I mean, there've always been people who are like, ah, we're worried about, you know,  pesticides in the water.  And until, you know, it takes a silent spring to be like, oh, yeah,  but even then only maybe 30 percent of the population cares about it.  So I think I mean, there's still people who scoff at like, oh, yeah,  I'm full of pesticides.  I don't care.  So I think there.  I don't know where the zeitgeist is, if it's actually changed,  like what the tipping point for like action, who you have to influence.  But definitely.  We are at a point where things will change because  the right number of people, the right people care about it.  And there are so many people don't care about anything ever.  No, they care.  No, you know what they care about?  I'll tell you.  Grocery store.  Restaurant openings in their restaurant openings in their area.  Yeah.  And if they can afford them, they're they're local,  local, not local, they're phones and device specs.  Not not to a crazy level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this from research you've done?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, this is like when I when I worked at a newspaper, these were the  these were the stories that always did well.  Not the city council meeting.  Yeah.  Oh, God, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I thought it might be kind of a fun exercise to go through some of the  Facebook ads that were the Democratic Democrats and the House Intelligence Committee  released some of the thousands of Russian purchased Facebook ads.  So all of these all of what you're about to see came from the Internet research agency,  the Russian Troll Factory ads purchased on Facebook.  Here's one from the heart of Texas, which is actually the heart of St. Petersburg.  Don't mess with Texas Border Patrol.  Always guided by God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I think I got that as a campaign ad because my husband was actually a  registered Republican.  So we get a lot of crazy stuff.  Yeah.  Well, you get both sides.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's Bernie Sanders.  The Clinton Foundation is a problem, but it's not really born liberal or Bernie Sanders.  It's it's the Internet Research Agency.  Get ready to secede, Texas.  So the corrupt media does not talk about the crimes committed by Hillary  rotten Clinton.  So why what is the here's a number of the Black Lives Matters pages.  Pages were fake.  So it's hard to understand what the point of this campaign is except to just make us all crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's divide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Division.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Sewing division because the more divided we are, the less we can do the I mean, it's classic.  It's classic warfare, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  We talked about this before.  This is this is the Rand report and the and the NATO report on Russian information warfare.  Yeah.  And you want to sow discord in your enemy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's what they're doing.  Do you feel like this is sophisticated?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's sophisticated in the sense that none of us noticed it.  I mean, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we didn't because they were dark ads.  None of none of us.  In most cases, we didn't see them.  The people.  Right.  But even the most likely were affected of it.  But it was people who were the most likely to agree with them that saw them.  Right.  They were very careful to show these ads only to people who already felt this way.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  Poor had it claimed.  Yeah.  So in that just that's sophisticated and then it's preying on like our worst or our it's not worst.  It's just our.  It was polarizing.  Gut reaction.  This is my favorite one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Satan and Jesus arm wrestling.  Satan says, if I win, Clinton wins.  Jesus says, not if I can help it.  Press like to help Jesus win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who wouldn't like that?  That one we saw at the time.  That one got around because it was so big, obviously ridiculous.  Yeah.  But you know what's going to happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, well, let me tell you how you got that.  If you had, if you showed a like, if you liked Laura Ingraham, God, Ron Paul, Christianity,  Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, Andrew Bytebart, Bible, Conservatism, Michael Savage, Faith,  Mike Huckabee or Jesus, if you showed those interests, you were the ages of 18 to 65 plus,  you would get this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  God, I don't know why I didn't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm surprised they didn't use blonde Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, well, he's he's pretty, pretty white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's super white.  He looks like Johnny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They use Johnny Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you know what's going to happen?  Facebook is going to clean a lot of this up.  You know where this is going to go?  WhatsApp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right.  There's no way to shut this up.  There's no way to shut this up.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We don't.  We're not on WhatsApp, but it's already on WhatsApp for like the elections in India  and places that actually use WhatsApp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep.  Exactly.  Colombia.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yeah, super fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  So I want to know is is Google One cloud storage a good deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've dropped the price.  Well, it's funny.  Actually, Paul Therotte put it more accurately.  They doubled the storage.  So 99 bucks was one terabyte.  Now you get two, right?  So yeah, I mean, here's what I've I discovered at one point that I had five or six of these accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I decided to cut back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so that's it's not bad maybe to have two because you can have redundancy.  Drive is I think Google Drive is a very good choice because drive  is everywhere, right?  Dropbox is also because of they've been around forever.  The Dropbox is a good deal, although now, you know, they're going to have to drop  prices to compete with Google Drive.  They're half the cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which is probably going to happen.  Yeah.  Remember when micro what was Microsoft storage?  They bought one drive.  Oh, right.  Sorry.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I still wish I could do it.  But we've talked about this a million times this show.  I still wish I could do a backup to Google Drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like all of your stuff.  I think it's too expensive to do that.  It is.  You'd fill it up.  I pay for two terabytes now.  I had a one terabyte, but I pay for two terabytes because I put all my photos on it.  But I also pay for two terabytes with Adobe and I put all my photos there too.  I think it's not bad to have two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, see, you do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I don't pay anything.  I pay for Dropbox, but I don't pay anything on Google.  Is it because I'm not using enough data?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you get a lot free.  They're pretty liberal with their.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like a hundred bags free.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  Something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  More than enough for most people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't send most of my photos to Google Photos though either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's how you fill it up or keep a full Gmail box or that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But if you use a pixel and do full quality, you don't pay for those photos, right?  I know.  What does that deal?  Yeah.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that the deal?  Yeah.  We have unlimited free storage of photos on Google.  Oh, no wonder I don't pay.  Okay.  Yeah.  Speaking of Android, good news.  Did we talk about this last week or did I talk about it on Twitter?  Maybe I talked about it on Sunday.  Project Treble is really making a difference.  We're going to see Google has said that they are going to start at some point  to require OEMs to take Google's security updates.  And of course, Treble.  Yeah, we talked about it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's talk about Project Treble and remind people what it was because I had forgotten,  which is it's their anti-fragmentation effort for Android, correct?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's even more than that.  In fact, one of the reasons Android P is available, the public beta on so many different handsets.  In fact, virtually everybody except Samsung is because of Project Treble.  Treble means that the hardware layer, the unique layer that the manufacturer creates  is separate from the rest of Android.  It's a hardware abstraction layer so that Google can say to the manufacturer,  here's the updates and the manufacturer can very quickly roll them out  because they're separate from the actual hardware.  So it's not as big a compatibility issue.  It's not as big as a testing issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We talked about this on, I'm proud to say this, all about Android too.  That's right.  You could tell that the Android folks were very proud of the impact that Treble has had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they're proud because they've done a good job and it's working.  It was a necessity because there are so many Android handsets that are not updated,  that are still on really out of date, dangerously out of date, insecure versions of Android,  particularly in the underdeveloped.  What are we supposed to call it now?  Not the third world.  Developing.  Developing.  Not underdeveloped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Developing in the less cooked nations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's not what we're calling it.  That's not what we're calling it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In the developing world.  Even that feels a little...  Not.  Because we're developed.  It does.  It's diminutive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There is another one you're supposed to use since then and I forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You went to Davos, Jeff.  That's the sole reason you're there.  Come on.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't care about that.  That's the other side.  We'll just call it not Davos.  How about that?  Not Davos.  Not Davos.  Not Davos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Non-OECD countries?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's going to start his competitive conference to Davos in China.  Who is?  Mike Bloomberg.  Who?  Mike Bloomberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mike Bloomberg.  Oh, Bloomberg.  You were cutting out at crucial moments there, Jeff.  Oh, it sounded like Oomberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mike Oomberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, really?  Bloomberg in China.  Really?  Yes.  Did you love Sunday's tweet from President Trump?  Saying, let's make China great again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, we're not going to talk about that.  Let's talk about it.  We should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's about ZTE, big Android phone manufacturer that was banned by the commerce department  because A, they were illegally selling against the Iran sanction.  So I understand why Trump would say, okay, well, that's off.  But B, because the commerce department warned that no company should be using  their products because they probably were spying on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which is the same rationale we had for blocking Huawei.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  So all of a sudden, the president talks to Xi, who he likes a lot, apparently.  It might have something to do with a half trillion dollar loan in Indonesia too.  But anyway, let's make, what is it?  Bringing back Chinese jobs.  I'm confused.  I'm just confused.  Yep.  Anyway, I actually like ZTE phones.  The Axon 7 from ZTE was my pick a couple of years ago.  It was a really great phone.  On the other hand, I'm not sure I want to use it if it's going to spy on me.  I don't know.  You know that Alexa is a much less popular baby name than ever before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would believe that.  What about Siri?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think anybody named their kid Siri before.  Actually, last year, 20 girls were named Siri in the US, one per every 100,000.  Where were there anybody named their kid Google?  I'm sure someone has named-  Or Cortana.  Alexa, in 2015, there were 6,050 baby girls in the United States.  The name popularity, according to the Social Security Administration,  has declined by 33%.  Just 3,883 Alexas were born last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right.  Were they born-  Oh, this is in the US.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, that would be the suckiest name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In the non-Davos nations, we don't know.  How many who?  Cadence?  There's only one Cadence.  Here's Cadence.  Cadence is our newest baby boy, Patrick Delahanty, our engineer,  brought him by during the show, and I missed him,  but we have a lovely picture of Patrick wearing his screensavers t-shirt.  Do you have that on the TriCaster?  And little baby Cadence, who was-  How big was Cadence?  He was 9 pounds, 7.7 ounces.  He's a big boy.  That's a hunk of a baby.  So was dad.  Dad was 10 point something.  Oh, there you go.  There's Jason, and they're the tall guys looking at the big boy.  Who looks very small.  Very tiny, but you know how fast they grow.  Thank God.  Is the Rooney rule named after Andy Rooney?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that Rooney.  What's his name?  The football guy.  It's named after him?  The owner of the first adopted in the NFL requires all teams to interview at least one person of color  each time a head coaching or general manager role comes open.  Amazon apparently is going to do that.  Good for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's magnificent, but I know for my sister who's a minister,  I know how often she would get in a list of jobs early in her career  because they needed to interview a woman.  So you can get Rooney to two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Getting interviewed doesn't do anything.  There are three women on Amazon's board.  No people of color, but there are three women on Amazon's board.  Actually, they initially opposed the policy.  Right.  They didn't want to do the Rooney rule according to recode,  which annoyed some Amazon employees.  On Monday, they said they would adopt that policy.  Women and people of color will be included in the pool of candidates for all board openings.  The board is so small that probably the board's feeling was, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Didn't they say that they did this already?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a good thing.  Candidates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we care, and we're going to make an effort here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's like the bare minimum effort in my humble opinion.  It's not hiring anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple wants a billion dollars from Samsung.  I don't even want to tell you the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We talk about those stories all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We kind of stop.  Let's stop.  All right.  I didn't mention on MacBreak Weekly.  I'm sorry I mentioned it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm so sorry.  You want to talk about, let's see, we could talk about TPUs.  We could talk about the Duplex service and Google's caving on that since we talked about it a couple.  Was it last week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we did last week.  Yeah, Google, what they said, well, we don't know what that means.  They said they're going to tell you it's a robot.  We don't know what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the new thing, I think The Verge did a story on this.  It talked about not only would it tell you that it was going to be a robot,  but they also wondered how it would fare with eavesdropping and wiretapping laws in various states.  So in Texas, for example, if I'm recording an interview, because Google records these,  if I'm recording an interview, I don't actually have to tell the second party  because I'm a one-party consent state.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're in a two-party state, so they'd have to tell.  You'd have to get consent.  You can't even record until you get consent.  So this is how the call begins.  Hello. This is Leo's Google Assistant calling.  May I record this call?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No. Click.  Let's try that again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hello.  This is Leo's Google Assistant.  I want to help save you time and bring you new customers on a holiday and know your hours.  Is it okay if I do that and record this to make sure I get it right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or how about this one?  Hi. This is Leo's Google Assistant calling to make an appointment.  Do you mind if I record this?  Um, just for quality assurance?  Yeah, okay.  Um, thank you.  How about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right. That's probably closer to what it would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody's saying we should just move Stacey's monitor to the center  and let her make it this week in IoT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was like, there's not a lot of IoT news out there.  What did you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know what I'm really trying to avoid?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yanny and Laurel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, let's not talk about that yet.  Let's talk about TPUs.  I'm trying to avoid that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. TPUs. Tell us all about it.  TPUs are the intelligence process, the tensor processing units,  the machine learning units that Google last year announced at Google I.O.  that they were going to put online for anybody using tensor flow and Google code  to create their own artificial intelligence applications or machine learning applications.  They updated them this year with water cooled or something.  I don't know. Faster, better ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I think without going into the crazy chip level details,  because that's a little crazy for everyone,  the big takeaway here that you've got to think about is Google is spending so much money and  so much effort on water cooling.  Water cooling in a data center, that's a significant investment in your infrastructure,  both to bring water cooling in.  Computers and water don't mix, so there's a lot of effort to keep them separate.  So when you think about that, you have to realize the enormous value that Google is  ascribing to these processors and what it saves them or the opportunity it gives them to reduce  their, I always think of it as reducing their cost of goods sold, which is why Google builds  their own infrastructure all the time.  Their cost of goods sold used to be serving up a web search result, right?  Now it's machine learning.  And so if you look at what's happened here, this is a big expensive investment and apparently  they think it's totally worth it.  So that's the big macro economic viewpoint on TPUs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I bet you that they did the back envelope calculation on what it would cost and realized  enough, you know, they didn't know when they announced this last year, how many people would  use it.  Enough people used it.  They thought, you know, we can because when you use this, you're using it with shared  other users, you know, they're probably making money on it.  Don't you think or you think that they're not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they're totally making money.  And the other thing is they weren't always going to optimize this.  And if you look at what they've done here, and it's unclear because I don't think we  have the TPU v3 block diagrams.  So it's not 100% clear how much has changed one year between chip iterations is actually  not a lot of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All we know is they're eight times faster.  That's a that's that's a for one year.  That's a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Well, I mean, they they I think they did they when is it for it's four times the cores.  It's hold on.  They they four times the core four times the quadrupled the cores.  So that's not actually crazy to get 8x performance from that.  I mean, that's not actually a lot of optimization on the actual silicon.  It doesn't seem like that seems like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, if you look at this TPU 1.0, which is two generations old, was 28 nanometers  at 700 megahertz, consumed 40 watts of power to TPU 2.0, which announced last year had  single precision floating point, eight gigs of memory to each TPU to improve performance.  This is from Extreme Tech.  A TPU cluster was last year, 180 teraflops of computational power, 64 gigs of memory  and 2400 gigabytes or 2.4 terabytes of memory bandwidth in total.  But we don't know.  You're right.  We don't know what the specs are yet for TPU.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  And so TPU.  So what's really noticeable is their power consumption effort.  So I put in a story in the chat from the next platform on the TPUs because they have a lovely  chart where if you look at TPU V1, they've got a 40 watt power consumption on a 28 nanometer  process.  And as your die size shrinks, sorry, as you go from 28 to 20 nanometers to lower,  you should be able to reduce your power consumption.  But what they've actually done is boosted the core count.  So they went from 40 watts to 200 to 250 watts, estimated from one to two and three  were still at 200 watts.  So they're doing some further optimization here.  But again, these are pretty nerdy deep stuff and I don't really know how many people care  about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, our audience loves it.  Are you kidding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I mean, big takeaway is the other thing, they have their own metric.  So the supercomputing world talks about floating points, the math, the high precision computing  world.  So supercomputing, deep science, math kind of things.  But they actually have a brain floating point format, which I don't, this is optimized solely  for Google.  It's BFLOPS?  It's, I don't know if it's BFLOAT.  So this is floating points.  So yeah, so BFLOPS, you're right.  BFLOPS.  But they call it BFLOAT.  And this is a good indicator of like, Google doesn't care about your workloads because  Google has its own workloads.  And they're totally, again, optimized for this.  This is such bad news for like the big chip players because they're being cut out of this  market effectively for one of the largest customers.  It's basically like what Apple did with their phone chips and what they're going to do to  Intel on the PC side or the laptop side.  So I think it's fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's pretty amazing.  What I find interesting is the lead that Google has at this point over anybody else.  Not only with doing their own AI, well, maybe not over China.  I don't know what's going on over there, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  I mean, people don't talk.  This is really like deep competitive stuff.  So Microsoft has their FPGAs and they've had those for a long time for various processing  and their brainwave stuff that they announced last in 2016.  They're...  They talked about that again at Build.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google has Mindshare.  Maybe they don't have technical advantage, but they certainly have Mindshare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't...  I mean, Nvidia has all the Mindshare in this space right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Only if you're a Bitcoin miner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They actually said this quarter that their Bitcoin revenue is going to be going down  as one of the courts has the story.  Good.  The court is on it.  There's a picks and shovels update on the Bitcoin mining rush right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then you said, okay, you mentioned TPUs and what was the other thing you wanted to  talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I already forgot.  Look at me.  I got so excited about it.  I'm like, Silicon Baby.  Let me go back.  Oh no, we talked about it.  Duplex.  Oh, Duplex.  Yeah, we talked about it.  You poo-pooed my Duplex ideas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I poo-pooed them?  What were your Duplex ideas?  No, they were fine.  We talked about them.  I apologize for poo-pooing them.  I just really wanted to...  I like Duplex.  I can't wait to have...  By the way, I think they implied that they'll be available the next month or two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What?  I would...  Although...  So who calls to make appointments nowadays?  The only person I call to make an appointment with is my doctor.  And my doctor would probably say, no, you can't record this because of hyperpigilation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  No, I think...  Yeah, no, the call thing isn't that interesting to me.  I just want better voices and more human sounding interactions with me.  That's really...  I mean, really, isn't that the most interesting thing?  If you could have an interaction with a Google Assistant that is as  rich as the ones we heard on those phone calls.  Yeah, I don't care about making a dinner date.  Think about Chuck E. Cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I don't want that.  I don't want to have such a close relationship with a computer.  I'm lonely.  I need that.  I'd become like that dude in her.  Yes.  Yes.  That guy was sad.  Those people are sad.  Come out of that world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just you wait, Stacy Higgins.  Just you wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just you wait, Stacy.  That's good. I like that.  Yeah, that's not that line.  Just you wait, Stacy Higginbaum.  Just you wait.  You'll be sorry, but your tears will be too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love Lonchid Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The TPUs in Spain fall mainly in the water cooling vein.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I could have IOT'd all night.  Oh, God.  I could have IOT'd all night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then the blinds won't close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there any IOT news or you just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, the Wi-Fi stuff.  That's what I was saying.  Wi-Fi.  New Wi-Fi EasyMesh.  What is EasyMesh?  What is EasyMesh?  On Monday, you have not heard about EasyMesh?  What is EasyMesh?  So on Monday, the Wi-Fi Alliance announced a new standard for mesh Wi-Fi.  Oh, wait.  Don't go there.  Go to Stacey on IOT and read Kevin's story because it's way better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Much better.  Although the ads aren't nearly as rich and exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, they're not.  And you're going to have to close my little sign up for my newsletter thing.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do that every time.  It's okay.  I signed up.  That's the thing.  You got to know somehow that I signed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, so it's supposed to only pop up every two weeks.  This is an argument I have with my business partner slash husband.  Anyway.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what's happening here is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The good, the bad, and the ugly from Kevin Toffle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Historically, you had to buy all in on IRO or all in on Orbi.  And now with this, you could buy in...  I'm going to buy the Orbi router, but then maybe later you're like,  eh, I would like to use some Google Mesh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there is a standard for how these work.  Yes.  Yeah.  So who's not into this?  IRO.  IRO.  A sponsor, IRO.  So yeah, IRO is not enough.  I saw, by the way, the first Comcast ad showing off the plumes.  Oh, yes.  That's...  Yeah.  Infinity Wi-Fi.  They'll be distributing those.  So I can kind of think about what IRO might have said, which is something like,  well, this might be a standard, but we've got better proprietary technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is exactly...  Gosh, Leo, you are so smart.  That is exactly what they said when we emailed them just to make sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can get excited about Easy Mesh, but we've got True Mesh.  And I've got Gunnish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So anyway, I think this is a little too late because many people have already invested in these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I also have to say that anybody who's had any experience with Wi-Fi Alliance's standards,  and I put that in air quotes, knows that this is not in any way a good...  You know, I mean, if there really were standards and everybody agreed and blah, blah, blah,  but you can't use Wi-Fi extenders that are supposedly compatible if they're not from the  same manufacturer.  So I don't have high hopes that this is...  Maybe it will.  Maybe...  I love mesh.  I think it's a great thing.  What is, though, really this key feature of mesh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's that you get coverage everywhere in your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it the duplex conversations between the back end and the access point?  Is that the main thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's an easy way to extend coverage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the technology that makes that so exciting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, like the actual technology?  It's a software overlay that connects, that allows these things to see each other as one big network.  So that's its software.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, there's all sorts of cool, like dynamic spectrum sharing.  Those are all cool things that some companies have, but not other companies.  And those are oftentimes like part of a mesh system, like Plume, for example, does dynamic  spectrum sharing.  But that's not every mesh company does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's a deeply technical infographic that will explain it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Lord.  Yeah, that is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So let me just help.  The internet comes in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is your gateway.  And then the internet goes upstairs, downstairs, and even to the garage.  Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm really glad they provided all the technical details I'm needing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, that is definitely not, you know, the technical photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Wi-Fi Alliance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who is the Wi-Fi Alliance when they're at home?  Who is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They throw a hell of a party, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.  Answer to that is no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fortunately, their webpage has a handy link.  Wi-Fi Alliance is the worldwide network of companies that brings you Wi-Fi registered trademark.  From the moment we coined the term Wi-Fi registered trademark to today,  Wi-Fi Alliance has worked diligently to make Wi-Fi one of the world's most...  Here's why I don't like the Wi-Fi Alliance.  I'll tell you the truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have screwed up WEP.  They have screwed up WPA.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, okay, but for a standard, I will say Wi-Fi has been really successful.  It has.  I can bring my computer into any Wi-Fi hotspot, and the problem is we're putting  more and more features onto Wi-Fi.  So it became from a base radio.  Oh, it's so a mess.  But it's still better than like, oh my God, look at the hot mess that is Zigbee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I guess if you compare it to Zigbee, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or like look at DLNA.  Oh my God.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good point.  By its very success, clearly something went right with Wi-Fi.  I think probably there are companies out there like Cisco that would say,  well, yeah, but we did all the work or whatever.  But anyway...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, someone has to do the work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In 2005, Wi-Fi was added to Merriam-Webster's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  According to the Wi-Fi Alliance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was, wasn't until then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We didn't have, I mean, remember when Intel was doing the unwired laptop commercials?  That was like 2005 or 2004.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So way back in the day, I worked on a, it's in the office, but I worked on a tablet Intel  never released.  And it wasn't Wi-Fi, it wasn't Bluetooth.  It was, what was the Intel version?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was anywhere, any company...  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I remember this.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the idea was you had your desktop, because that's all you had at the time.  You had your desktop computer there in the den.  And this used whatever their version was on a tablet.  I've got it in my office where you could sit on the couch and all it would do was mirror  the computer.  So anything you did on the tablet would do it on the computer and then do it up to the internet.  But yeah, they made a mistake and didn't use Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll tell you, the big complaint, and Steve Gibson makes this complaint about Wi-Fi  Alliance, is that they keep all the protocols proprietary and closed so that people, that's  how they got in trouble with WEP, that people can't look at what they're proposing except  the people who pay $15,000 a year to be members of the Wi-Fi Alliance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what UL does.  And yet we're talking about, and ISO.  I mean, so that's when we're talking about security standards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But don't they publish standards?  Yeah, I guess if it's a security standard.  I don't know.  I feel like this one, Steve Gibson, would be better at talking about this than I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not saying that it's the right thing to do.  I'm just saying it's not uncommon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that makes sense.  But it's where you get into trouble because you assume, oh, we know how to do crypto and  then they don't.  And then you put out a standard that is easily broken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Who assumes that?  I mean, you have got to be the craziest person in the room to think, yeah, I got this crypto  thing down.  That's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Crypto almost never benefits from being closed.  You need other cryptographers and experts looking at your protocols, trying to figure  out what's wrong with them.  You can't just do it yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, look.  That's like a philosophical divide.  It is.  Insecurity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Securus, speaking of insecurity in the news.  This is a company that works in the highly valued inmate cell, inmate phone booth space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  God, such a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's a profitable business to be in.  It's almost as good as jails themselves.  But in addition to providing service to provide and monitor calls for inmates, they apparently  for some years have been offering law enforcement in the United States unfettered access to  location data from all the major cell phone carriers.  And at a low cost.  It's one of Securus's fabulous features.  Unfortunately, it has been misused in this New York Times story this week.  They talk about Cory Hutchison, who was a former Missouri sheriff, who's been accused  of using Securus's service to track judges, members of the state highway patrol.  He has pled not guilty.  So I don't want to convict him in the court of public opinion.  And then hackers now have just recently, after this story, of course, the hackers got to work  and hacked Securus.  So it was really, it should be called insecure us.  And let me see what they came out with.  This is from a motherboard article that came out today.  Hacker breaches Securus and has provided motherboard with the login details for a company  that buys phone location data from major telecom companies and then sells it to law enforcement.  The hacker provided motherboard with a spreadsheet marked police.  Includes over 2800 usernames, email addresses, phone numbers and hash passwords.  Plus security questions of the popo stretching from 2011 up to this year.  So just, you know, if you have been using Securus, if you're a law enforcement  official has been using Securus, you might want to change your password.  And motherboard now knows who you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, do you want to talk about Comcast and their $90 installation?  Oh, isn't that sweet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh Lord.  What's the deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  John Botkin over at ours Technica has a lovely story, including Comcast saying that's not true.  And then coming back after he gives them their own data from their website saying,  oh yeah, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I don't think anybody who's a Comcast customer doesn't already know that  Comcast will charge you $90 for nothing.  I mean, this is, this isn't a surprise.  Even if you provide your own modem and plug it in yourself, in many cases,  they will charge you an installation fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The key here is that if the house already, even when it's not warranted,  so it's fine if they're going to come out and set it up.  Fine.  Couldn't they have used to call that a hookup fee?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Truck roll.  They used to say, oh, we have to get the whole walkway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  We got to flip some switches.  It's expensive.  It did not cost me anything, I don't think.  But then again, the problem with this is it's often just kind of in your bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's a profit grab for, by a company that has a veritable monopoly on high-speed  internet in many areas.  Oh yeah.  So if you want, if you want over a hundred megs, you're going to have to go with Comcast.  And if, who doesn't want that nowadays?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Comcast cares.  AdSign.  Comcast cares.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, Comcast did email me.  I should see what they said.  They say if the customer at a home that currently has service  disconnects or schedules a future disconnect, then a customer ordering new internet only  service to that home would get a self-install option.  Right.  Now, a lot of people schedule the disconnect.  Like I disconnect my cable before I move in.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't want to leave it on for the next person.  So you disconnect it.  And the question, and this is not a truck roll.  There's no truck roll required.  You plug in your modem and all that has to happen is somebody at the central office has  to go, oh yeah, let's, let's re-enable that.  Now, sometimes a truck roll is required.  I think that's fine.  That's appropriate to charge for that.  Cause somebody's going to come out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Months and months and months and years and years and years of money on you.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  Because their modem fee, I didn't realize this because I hadn't been tracking it since  I don't cover broadband anymore.  Their modem fee is now $11 a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that outrageous?  You could buy a very good cable modem for under a hundred bucks.  So you'll quickly make that money back if you just do your own thing.  And it's probably a better modem than Comcast provides.  But then they get you because you noticed by the way that they said, if you only,  if you order internet only service, I don't think this is a cash grab.  I think this is a way to punish and set, and set people to get to triple play.  Cause if you only have a double play, you might get paid too.  According to the ours article, if they want, if you get the triple play, we'll wave all fees.  It's really about, I think Comcast really wants to incent people.  They don't like cord cutters for obvious reasons.  And they would love you to get their phone service too, for obvious reasons.  So those fees, I think are as much to encourage you to do that as to get a little extra out of you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you know, this is one, it's a hard argument to win because they can say, well,  you don't understand it's going to, you know, we've got to flash the modem or whatever,  you know, they're going to good news and bad news.  The good news is the Senate has voted to overturn object pies, net neutrality repeal by 52 to 47.  The bad news is now it goes to the house.  And if, if unaccountably the house passes, it is still going to get best the president.  So it's really more one of those tilting at windmills kinds of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll say though, you know, the way the president goes right now, he might get a wild hair.  Make China great again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It could just, you know, we'll have president Xi call, say, I'll tell you what you make,  you give an open internet, but we'll, we'll give you our social credit system free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what we have to do.  Yeah. We have to start lobbying Xi and Putin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're talking to the wrong people.  Don't talk to Democrats.  They've got no power.  Talk to somebody who knows how to wield power.  Maybe that do tear take guy will help us with the net neutrality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's his name.  Do tear take.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like to eat meals.  That's all right.  It's too late now.  I say in for a penny in for a pound.  I'm going to get a red hat that says make China great again.  I am, I swear to God.  Let's take a break and we'll come back.  I think we really need something lighter here.  Don't you?  Perhaps, perhaps a thing of the week from Stacey, a number of the week from you  and a caution of the week from me.  How about all of the three?  But first I have a recommendation.  By the way, I see that my electric scooter has arrived.  Oh, my eco Rico that I ordered an Indiegogo in July of 2017.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I nearly got killed by those damn things in San Jose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Were they the birds?  Did you see the birds?  They were all over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought, man, I saw lots of close calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a very controversial thing.  I first saw it down in Santa Monica.  There's electric scooters just littering the sidewalk all over the place.  It's been very successful down there.  And then they came to San Francisco and, man, the supervisors did not like it.  I don't know if they're still there or not, but because people just leave.  I think it's a good idea.  It's a good idea.  You're right.  You just get a scooter, you scoot somewhere and you leave it there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you go around.  Did I ever tell you the dumbest thing I ever bought?  The single stupidest thing I ever bought besides Google Glass?  What?  I bought a moped in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Couldn't kill anyone.  Oh, Joe.  This show.  That's adorable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This show is moving about as fast as a moped in San Francisco.  All right.  You were saying, Leo.  By the way, notice I'm wearing, it's a little late.  Anzac Day was a few weeks ago, but I'm wearing my Anzac pin  thanks to one of our fine Aussie fans.  It's one of them Aussie hats.  What's it called?  Slouch hat.  And underneath it says, Australian New Zealand Army Corps.  That's what Anzac stands for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was going to ask, I'm like, what esoteric tech acronym is this?  It's not a tech acronym, but it is an esoteric acronym.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unless you're in Australia, New Zealand, then you know it.  Because they have Anzac Day every year.  But are the armed forces of New Zealand and Australia still coming?  In some situations, if we go down and attack them, they will get together.  100 years of Anzac.  And the best thing about Anzac Day is Anzac Bickies, which are a lovely cookie.  Bickies?  Bickies, short for biscuits.  I speak Aussie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wish I spoke Aussie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, man.  It's Australian for oats.  Flour, sugar, and coconut.  They're really good.  Look what I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Better than Tim Tams?  Yes.  Actually, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  Tim Tams are good.  Anzac biscuits are amazing.  And they keep forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's usually not something that tastes good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How bad could this be?  Oats, flour, coconut, sugar, butter, and golden syrup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It sounds like a Nature's Valley granola bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It does.  I think that was the inspiration for the Nature's Valley granola bar.  They've long been established with Anzac because they were sent by wives to soldiers  abroad because the ingredients do not spoil easily.  This is what I'm looking for in a baked good.  They keep well during naval transportation.  There's a really bad joke in the Master and Commander series where Captain Jack Aubrey  has one of those crackers that has been on the boat for four years.  And they tap it and a couple of weevils come out.  He said, well, I prefer the lesser of the two weevils.  Yeah.  That's the one joke in the whole 21 book series.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  No, it's really good reading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have many of my, all my male friends have said this to me.  It's kind of a guy thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Riding this roaring main on the big sea boat under poop deck and  you know, fighting with swords and cannons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It seems to be the books you read right before you switch over to like World War II and war  histories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  What is it about us guys?  We just, we just want to blow things up.  Actually, Master and Commander is a very, very good series.  If you're into naval warfare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what's going on.  You know, I'm always punchy by the time I get to the end of my week.  Right.  Which is funny because my week's two days long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But for some reason, by the end of it, I'm just exhausted.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm just, I'm exhausted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So go to your spot.  I'm going to go to my spot and then we're going to go to your number.  Our show today brought to you by the folks at World War II.  And we're going to go to your number.  And then we're going to go to your number.  Our show today brought to you by the folks at WordPress.  Love the WordPress.  Leo Laporte.com.  My blog is on WordPress, but I've been using WordPress since 2003.  I think it was Matt Mullenweg first put it out there.  I had used all the other con they call them at the time.  They call them blogging engines, content management systems.  And I came to WordPress and I said, hallelujah.  I've found the platform.  Even back then I knew this is, this is good stuff.  But I was doing it wrong because I ran my own server and installed WordPress on that.  And that meant I was the one to keep it up to date.  I had to get the plugins.  In fact, I spent so much time managing my WordPress server.  I didn't put a whole lot of content up there.  Fast forward a few years, I found WordPress.com.  All the benefits of WordPress, but they host it.  They keep it up to date.  They put all the plugins and the features in.  You don't have to.  And it costs less than it did for me to have my own server.  I love WordPress.com.  They of course have great customer support team there.  They're 24-7 Monday through Friday, weekends too.  So if you ever have any questions, you can get them answered quick,  but you probably won't.  You don't need to be super technical.  You're not doing the coding or the designing.  WordPress gives you everything you need to get your site up and running.  My daughter, Abby, just set up her site and I've been watching her do this  because it's been informative to me to see.  And she really loves it.  She loves the templates.  She asked me, she said, I want something really professional looking.  So she's on a vacation right now.  When she gets back, we're going to pick out a really nice,  you get hundreds to choose from.  You also have great plugins.  I use the probably the best anti-spam plugin ever made for comments on blogs,  the Akismet engine.  I use the Google AMP plugin that makes my pages load super fast on mobile.  Of course, HTTPS everywhere,  which means you're not only more secure,  but you're going to rank higher on Google because of it.  If you've got a business and you need a website,  if you are an individual, the reason I wanted Abby to do this  is because I want her to put her best foot forward.  People search for her name.  I want them to see her best work, her portfolio, her articles.  That's where you do it.  That's where you take over the internet.  You put yourself out there, WordPress.com.  And of course, it's very affordable.  Plans start at just $4 a month as you get more professional.  If you want a commerce solution, they've got that too.  Everything from a simple and effective buy button to a complete online store.  They have SEO.  That means you're going to rank higher on search because of those features.  Social sharing, which is awesome.  That helps you rank higher too because your viewers, your readers,  the people who visit your site, your customers,  when they share, when they put your content up on Twitter and Facebook,  it helps your ranking and it helps spread the word.  And of course, no matter what your needs,  hundreds of great specialized plugins.  It really is no surprise.  30% of all the websites in the world, 30% globally,  all the websites in the world, 30% run on the WordPress platform.  That is pretty amazing.  Get started today.  You get 15% off any new plan purchase at WordPress.com.  Twig, create your new website at WordPress.com.  We thank WordPress for their support of this week in Google.  Stacey, you have anything you want to talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have a device for people who want to control their smart home locally.  It is from a company called Hubitat.  This is a $115.  This is a smart home hub.  It actually runs Groovy, which is what the SmartThings platform runs on.  It was created actually by the guy who created the rules engine for SmartThings.  This is a local hub.  When you connect it to your stuff, you can actually control all your data,  control all that stuff.  If your internet goes down, this stays up, all the stuff is executed there.  This does limit some of the things you can do.  If your internet is out, you can't make cloud-to-cloud connections.  Talking to Madame A or Google is not going to necessarily work,  but the rest of the time it will work.  They actually have already supported a bunch of big name devices.  Ones that they haven't supported yet are Nest and Ecobee,  but they have Philips Hue, Fibaro, a bunch of nice products.  This is a pretty cool option if you're a nerdy developer type.  If you are a normal person who does not want to play with your smart home,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  don't buy this.  Would this replace the Hue Hub?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It works with the Hue Hub because you actually have to talk.  Now it could because it does have a Zigbee radio in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Z-Wave, I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Z-Wave.  So Zigbee, Z-Wave, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.  Now, you won't be able to do from the Zigbee.  If you don't have the Hue Hub, you won't be able to do all the fancy things.  Some things you just can't do with their SDK.  But this will control your lights and turn them on and off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is really interesting.  And it has an API so you can...  That's what's interesting, right?  That you could create your own rules and stuff.  Exactly.  Turn off the echoes at night, that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. And you can actually post your rules and then other people can download them to their hub.  But it's all a pull request as opposed to being pushed out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there will be perhaps a library, an app store.  Oh, that's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's small.  I thought this was cool.  It's very tiny.  So that's interesting.  This is a software engineer's answer, response to the Tower of Babel that has become...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and it's a little bit easier to use looking at what I've seen so far.  It's a little bit easier to use than some of the things like OpenHAB and HomeBridge  and I think Home Assistant.  Some of those are pretty tough.  I mean, it spares you the effort of getting everything up and running on a pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looks like you have to add your own Wi-Fi to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That dongle is for Z-Wave and ZV support.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It comes with it.  Oh, I get it.  And then...  I'm trying to get my head around it.  Because normally, in a way, your hub would be your phone for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, usually for things like this, that's only in HomeKit world.  Everybody else, you have a specified dedicated hub device.  Like the SmartThings hub.  Like SmartThings, like Wink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like a pie running OpenHAB.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not supporting Nest and Ecobee is kind of a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean...  Those are the big guys, aren't they?  For one particular thing, for thermostats, I think they support...  Do they support Nest cameras?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do they support Nest doorbells?  Ecobee locks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ecobee doesn't make locks, but...  Well, then they don't support them.  You're right, they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ecobee makes a light switch and they make a sensor for temperature for your air conditioner.  Those are the only things Ecobee makes right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very nice.  This looks kind of cool.  I kind of think Kevin Toffle might buy and try to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Kevin Toffle is actually going to get a review unit and test it out for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What I suspected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We actually fought over it.  We were like, okay, rock, paper, scissors, who gets it?  It's always fun with Kevin and I fight for a device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis, do you have a numero for us?  Oh, you're muted.  Now you are muted.  Oh, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  United Airlines retired its last 747, making a big hula out of it.  But they're going to milk a little more out  because you can use your models in an auction to go visit the boneyard.  Oh, I'd love to do that.  I thought that's why I put this in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought you'd like that.  I've always wanted to see the boneyard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In the last 747 and then you have dinner underneath it.  And then I don't know if you can see them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're actually, it's kind of like accompanying...  It's kind of like going to the funeral, like accompanying it to the graveyard.  Yeah.  Wow.  Now where is the boneyard?  The boneyard is where hundreds of...  Boneyard is an...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I forget now where.  Shoot.  Is it an air assembly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Must be somewhere dry and spacious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought it was Arizona, but let's see.  Is it Memphis?  That Memphis isn't dry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where is it?  USA today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The highlight for most would be the June 2nd visit to nearby Tupelo, Mississippi,  where it's the Universal Asset Management Aircraft Disassembly Center.  So they're not just sitting there.  They're taking them apart.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The military aircraft boneyard is in apparently Tucson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the one I want to go to.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Davis-Munthan Air Force boneyard in Tucson.  I'm not sure I really want to go to Tupelo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, is it in...  Oh, Tupelo, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tupelo Honey is?  Tupelo is where Elvis was born.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wouldn't mind buying...  You know what?  Sometimes I get so much work done on a long flight.  I think I want to buy one of the business classes.  It's your new office.  Yeah.  And just leave them on a plane with no Wi-Fi working and I'll get stuff done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good idea.  Mike Elgin, who unfortunately we lost because of poor internet,  was going to mention as his pick Squid, which used to be Papyrus.  It actually, I think it comes with the Pixelbook.  Maybe not.  I know mine has it.  And he says this is a great way to take notes on not only your Pixelbook,  but any tablets or Android devices you have, you write with your finger.  Or the nice thing about the Pixelbook, it comes with a stylus.  That's why I feel like my...  Do you have Squid on your Pixelbook, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I do.  Let me look it up right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like it comes with it because of the stylus, the pen on the...  Yes, I do.  So this is a handy little note-taking app.  I have yet to really...  I know I can do it.  You know what I do?  I know.  Yeah, I want to type most of the time.  But there are times I need to sketch out things  because I'm trying to figure something out and I need to make a drawing of it.  And it's good for stuff like that.  I do do that a lot.  Yeah.  Mostly on my Apple iPad though with a pencil as a put, but you could easily do it on this.  And you know I use my pencil or my pen on my surface all the time.  Yes, you show us all the time.  And I have a pick that isn't available yet.  Maybe hugely expensive, but it's so gosh darn cool looking that I just...  I want it.  And it's the new Microsoft Surface Hub.  Have you seen the video for this yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is very, very sexy.  So the Surface Hub...  Actually, this is not their video.  I want to find their video.  Here's their...  Here's Microsoft's video.  It's on YouTube.  And let me just play this a little bit and you can salivate.  So the Surface Hub as it stands now is a fairly expensive 55-inch Windows,  sort of Windows device that allows you...  Corporations buy it for their conference room and stuff.  Now they're showing the guts,  but when we get to the screen part, this is very exciting.  Now Microsoft's pre-announcing it.  It won't be available till next year.  And what they didn't say is how much it will be,  but they did say it will be less expensive than the current Surface Hub, Surface Hub 2.  Which we're hoping...  Now, A, look at that.  She just rotated it into portrait mode.  Now here's another thing.  That's a fingerprint sensor.  As soon as it saw her fingerprint, it logged her into the hub.  Now she's going to use probably...  Well, there's the whiteboard,  but she's going to probably use Skype for Teams here.  And now you're having a conversation with somebody in full human scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It rotates.  Look at that.  Not what I want.  Oh, that's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's cool.  It's got a pencil.  You can draw on it.  Here's why I'm waiting to see what the price is.  But one of the things we always wanted to do...  Well, there's a price point I'd be willing to pay for this  because one of the things we always wanted to do with our avatars...  You guys, for people watching the video, see our hosts in landscape TV displays.  But my original idea was to have them in portrait.  So you would be roughly like...  Yes, but that's the problem.  We never...  John was that we couldn't figure it out  or that it was just too expensive to buy the additional hardware that would make this...  It would be very expensive.  But now this Surface Hub, man, maybe I could...  Maybe you guys will be living in one this time next year.  Look, you could put four together in portrait mode.  In landscape mode, you could put two side by side,  and they're synced together.  So the four together make one giant display.  55 inches, here's the catch.  Not available till next year, and they didn't say how much it would cost.  An arm and a leg.  If you have to ask...  Well, you can get for $8,000, you can get the 55 inch now.  So it'll probably be less, like $79.99.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Too rich for my blood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Burke says you'd need a scaler for each TV.  No, because I don't think so, Burke, because they're designed to work with Skype.  So I think you just need to use Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We don't use the business Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We would start because by then I think we'll have to.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is how I feel about the Microsoft Business Skype.  I know everybody hates it, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But imagine you could be sideways, life-size next to me.  So when you punch me, it'll really look real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I feel that like then...  Did you see that woman?  She had to wear pants.  So, you know, that's kind of a downside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why did she have to wear pants?  Because of the hub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because our whole body was like on display.  She's also standing.  I would not do the whole show standing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I see.  I work with refused to ever use Skype video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because they have to wear pants?  No, because they're very confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't want to be...  I don't want to...  I'll use the phone.  Oh, yeah. My mom won't do it either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. I hate using video for like a lot of...  Phone calls.  Yeah.  Phone calls.  Or when I'm taking notes because then I'm like trying to do my job  and take notes on a call and they're like trying to make eye contact.  And I'm like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not good.  Do any either of you use Duo ever?  Google's...  Yes.  You do?  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  With only two people that I managed to finagle into like calling and using it.  Which was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of which was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not my husband.  He's like, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good. Maybe you and I can Duo because I can't find anybody who will do it with me.  But is it better than FaceTime or Skype?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's better than Skype just because it's easier.  But it's not...  It's definitely not better than FaceTime because you always...  Here's what you do.  I get...  I text...  Or I'm like, oh, I'll call them on Duo.  And then I send them the text because they're not on Duo.  And then I have this text conversation.  Stacey, did you send me this or am I being trolled?  No, I sent you that.  Can you download this app?  Why would I want to download that app?  Where would I go to download that app?  Stacey, no one's downloading this app.  Oh, it wants my password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I sent texts because it says invite people.  I'm invited by both my mother, who I do a lot of FaceTiming with,  and my daughter, who no longer has an iPhone and can't talk to grandma anymore.  And I was trying to matchmake them.  I said, you can use Duo to talk to each other.  Neither one signed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this was my...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  All right.  And somebody in the chat room, Trust Noan, love it, good name,  points out that the Google Jamboard, which looks similar to that other Microsoft thing,  the Surface Board, is only five grand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that uses Hangouts, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think...  I think it's...  We have a Jamboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's cool.  We got one.  How does that work?  Works pretty well.  It really does.  You can collaborate and do things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, five grand, it's considerably less than the Surface Hub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if it's as cool, however.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait, did you just call a Microsoft product cool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that interesting?  But it's only cool in juxtaposition to the Etch A Sketch look of the Jamboard.  All right, kids.  All right.  Time to call it a day.  Thank you, Jeff Jarvis, City University of New York.  CUNY, we call it.  He's also at BuzzMachine.com.  It is always a slice.  You can find Jeff's work everywhere, but do get the books because they're good.  What would Google do?  Public parts.  And there's others.  Geeks bearing gifts all about reinventing news.  Always a pleasure, Jeff.  Thank you.  Always, sir.  Always, boss.  Stacey Higginbotham.  Soaked now in a fine mist of barbecue sauce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I thought you were going to say meat sweat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And meat sweat.  Well, doesn't it come out your pores later in the day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I don't think I ate enough for meat sweats because I would have them by now.  Darn it.  Everyone here is very disappointed, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I learned about meat sweats from Stacey in Austin, Texas.  So thank you.  Happy to broaden your notes.  You'll find Stacey's work, wonderful work at stacey on iot.com.  Subscribe to her free newsletter.  Listen to the podcast she does with Kevin.  Kevin's great.  I'm so glad he can podcast with us now.  It's been really fun when he comes on.  So give him my regards.  We should get him on again soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll be gone next week.  I'm sure you could convince him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There you go.  Thank you, everybody, for joining us.  We do this week in Google right after Windows Weekly on Wednesdays.  About 1 30 Pacific 4 30 Eastern.  Okay, we were 15 seconds late today, but pretty much 1 30.

But if you get serious about it, get an IRC client and all the instructions are there  at IRC.twit.tv.  Now, if you can't watch live, and I understand middle of the day,  Wednesday is probably not ideal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Feels ideal to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You come on really at dinner time.  It's kind of dinner time for you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.
