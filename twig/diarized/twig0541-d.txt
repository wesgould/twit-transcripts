Transcript:  It's time for Twig this week in Google. I'm Jason Howell filling in for Leo Laporte this week.  We've got Jeff Jarvis, we've got Matthew Ingram. We spend a lot of time talking about the consumer electronics show.  Google, of course, has announcements there. We've got announcements from all sorts of companies.  OnePlus has a concept phone that they show off. Samsung has a number of announcements,  including the Neon Artificial Humans kind of chat bot thing that's really strange.  Plus, we talk a little bit about a leaked memo from Boz, from Facebook that's really interesting.  And Fry's is apparently going away. Well, it's really kind of uncertain and we're sad if it does.  All that and more coming up next on This Week in Google.  This Week in Google is brought to you from LastPass Studios.  Securing every access point in your company doesn't have to be a challenge.

So Leo's in Vegas, along with Ann Pruitt.  They are both just traversing the many halls of the Consumer Electronics Show and checking out all the stuff that we're just going to talk about here in the studio.  I'm Jason Howell, always happy to fill in when Leo is out on This Week in Google.  And joining me today, of course, Jeff Jarvis, your first twig of 2020.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know, we've been gone for a month. I've missed you twiggy.  It kind of feels that way, doesn't it? It's feeling the same way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm loving that I can say the 20s now. For some reason, I enjoy the fact that the 20s is no longer the old timey 20s.  It's like the future. But let me be clear. Let me be clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The decade does not end until the end of this year.  It's been an awful decade. The 20s start in 2020.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to have this discussion on pretty much every show of this network, I think.  I get what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would think, Karsten, I would think you would be the pen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I will go with the 21st century started in 2001 because that's an ordinal.  But the 20s are not an ordinal. The 20s are the 20s.  Jeff, Jeff, any 10 years is a decade.  I got to step in, Jeff. The only thing you cannot say is that this is the beginning of the 201st decade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is incorrect.  That would be incorrect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what everybody was saying is the end of a decade. It wasn't the end of the decade.  A decade is any 10 year period. A decade just started two seconds ago.  I'm just trying to keep the tension from Matthew here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Well, I'm curious. I mean, we know. OK, so we know where you stand, Jeff Jarvis.  What about you, Matthew Ingram? Matthew Ingram, of course, chief digital writer at CJR.org.  What do you think on this hot topic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I think Jeff is technically correct, but it feels as though I mean people just like round numbers.  And I think they like to start new things. And so it works better to start with a round number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's nothing quite like a nice round number. I totally agree.  The way that I where I stand on this is when we think of like compilation CDs or CDs.  That's so ancient. Compilation albums of like decades.  We include 1980 in the 80s. We include 1990 in the 90s.  Albums of the greatest hits of the decade. So therefore, in my mind, it makes sense.  Sorry, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sigh. You win. You win.  You're outnumbered. You're outnumbered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Aha. So it's good to have you both here. Is Stacey at CES? Is that why she's not on today?  That is correct.  So she is wandering the halls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She and Kevin are both finding all the best IoT things at CES.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just put up, I just saw this, a Weber Connect smart grilling hub, an IoT grill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Weber Connect smart grilling hub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hub. So your Weber grill should now be connected to the Internet.  Okay. Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because everything's connected to the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everything should be. It's going to be the law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, at some point it's going to be weird if you have something that doesn't connect to the Internet.  I just don't know why my grill needs to be on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe they'll start profiling people that way. Like, you know, Homeland Security. If you don't, if you have devices that aren't connected, it'll be suspicious.  That's suspicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, when the Guardian did the Snowden story, they assumed they were doing good hygiene by getting burner phones and turned out, no, no, no, no, that makes you more suspicious.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  And if you use Tor, that's a red flag. As soon as you use Tor, it's like, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. What are you up to?  Wait a minute.  Exactly.  What are you trying to hide?  Exactly. Okay. So connected to grill. Yeah, you're right. Everything's just going to be connected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you see the Charmin bot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. So what was the name of that thing? The Charmin robot.  I forget.  I'm happy we're starting with the really great products from Consumer Electronics Show.  Yeah.  Charmin's toilet paper robot. It's a robot that brings you toilet paper when you need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why are we starting out here?  Enough to already have it there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You've got some huge problems.  Is that a handy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The roll bot. That's what it's called. The roll bot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this assumes that although you couldn't come up with toilet paper to keep by the toilet, you remembered to stock the toilet bot so that you could call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I believe it requires you use your smartphone app in order to summon it. So, you know, some people would say, you know, it's not a good idea to use your smartphone while you're using.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But come on. That's where everybody uses their phone. Is it not?  What are you going to read? You're going to read the shampoo bottles like some kind of barbarian?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you're going to get in there, do your thing and get out. No need to spend any extra time there.  That's not a room that anyone needs to spend extra time in. Thank you though, roll bot. I appreciate your help.  Can we talk about the most important thing at CES?  All right. What do you think is the most important thing at CES? Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Fiesta Red Samsung Galaxy Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a pretty nice looking device, I have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It really is. It made me very, very happy. It doesn't have LTE, but that's okay. It has everything else.  It's I think a good processor, you tell me. And it's the i5, I think it's below there.  And it has a pen and it has a 4K screen, 19, 6, kind of unfortunately, but that's where the world is going.  And it looks like Google cooperated and this is the new Pixel rank Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pixelbook level. It starts at $999, so this is an expensive.  This is a premium side of Chromebooks. I think there's a gray color, there's gray, your standard gray.  There's boring gray and Fiesta Red.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It looks like a really nice machine. It's 2.3 pounds, which is really light, lighter than the Chromebook Pixel.  Very thin. The only complaint I heard from anybody is as a result of its thinness, the travel on the keyboard is not quite what it was.  I was going to say.  I've got to try it first, but I'm looking forward to it. My machine is wonderful. I love my Chromebook Pixel, but it's just I pound on it so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it wearing at this point? Is it starting to wear down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's wearing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is probably heresy, but if it's $1,000 or so, why wouldn't I just get a MacBook Air?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because Matthew, for what you just had to go through, you had to install a driver.  What is this thing you call a driver?  What is this thing you call install?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know what you mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The whole damn world of the web is there at my beck and call and that's all I need.  I don't edit video. If I edited video, it wouldn't be great.  But other than that, I've never had to hassle with with re-installing things.  This machine did slow down. I got a little bit pokey.  So I said, OK, what the hell? Rebuild it. It took literally two minutes.  Yeah, literally. Yeah.  It's just it's just it doesn't get in the way of life anymore. Right.  So it's like it's like when telephones went from having to say central central connect me to a telephone you picked up and dialed.  Right. It's easy.  Do you remember those days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, screw you. Pennsylvania, six, one thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm telling you, I've been on a Chromebook now for well more than three years and I wouldn't I wouldn't I wouldn't go back.  I love it. Love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, my Chromebook, the Pixelbook is what I use here on all my shows.  I use it for everything that I do here on a from a mobile sense.  When I'm sitting at my desk and I'm using a Mac, for what reason?  Probably just because in that environment I can spread everything out on a couple of screens and I like to be able to work like that.  I think you could do that with a Chromebook. Right.  Can you mirror to a couple of different screens and everything so I could split it out?  I don't I don't see in my in my everyday life what going one hundred percent Chromebook would really limit me because I don't do much of anything like you, Jeff, anymore.  On a computer that a Chromebook doesn't already do most of everything that I do is in the web, except for music production.  And that would be the one thing that was the other one had been programming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But now that you can you can run Linux on it. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So so then when I think of a thousand dollars for a Chromebook, like on one hand, I get it because I'm using one.  You know, the Pixelbook can be that expensive as well.  And I love the Pixelbook that I have right now.  So I understand the value.  But at the same time, it's also kind of a luxury item.  What is your phone cost?  What is your phone cost? Well, phones cost upwards of a thousand dollars to.  Yeah, and it's got a title screen compared, you know, and we use it constantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I get so tired of the tech sites because they did it again.  This is well, I don't know if you're not everybody can once a Chromebook because we've heard this spiel a million times already.  Yeah. Right. People are not idiots.  They get it. But it's been important for me.  The reason I'm happy is I want a premium Chromebook out there at this level of standard.  Yeah, me too. And when Google didn't come up with a new Chromebook Pixel, they come up with a go.  I got worried that they were going to abandon that high end of the market.  And I'm, of course, the high end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that is one of the things I like about the MacBook Air is the build quality and the, you know,  it's not just that I like Apple. I mean, I use Linux on the desktop.  I use Windows if I have to. But I like the MacBook partly because of the way it's built.  And I've been looking for a Pixelbook that had the same sort of level of, you know, the craftsmanship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would I would put the Pixelbook up against the Mac, especially when I hear Mac owners not complaining about keyboards and stuff.  If you get the if you get the low end Samsung Chromebook, absolutely not.  It's tinny. Absolutely. But the Pixelbook go is back level quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. OK. And I have still not seen the Pixelbook go in person to make that that determination.  I would say that about Pixelbook. I'm sorry. The Pixelbook.  OK. All right. Because I would say that would definitely say that about the Pixelbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the go. Kevin said the keyboard is just as good. OK.  The screen is better. I did. I did go to the Best Buy and I did touch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's very, very nice. Nicely built. It's not an aluminum body like an aluminum build.  So if that's something that you really like your laptops to have, it's not that it's going to be more of a plastic approach.  But yeah, people seem to really like it. I have yet to see it in person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So anyway, so that just made me happy out of CES. I didn't expect big book news out of CES.  I thought it was going to be another Samsung this and another ISIS that and ISIS that.  And there's some of that going on. There's some other nice machines coming out.  But this this looks like a high level machine. How was yours there, Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The this this Pixelbook. This is what? This is a couple of years old now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think you got to go to the boss and say you need a new one, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, that's the thing. Like when that's why I was asking you how yours has has fared.  This device still works great.  Like I couldn't think of a reason why I don't continue to use it.  Maybe I should be saying that out loud. It's very simple. It's consumerist disease. Yeah.  Yeah. Right. Yeah. I'm kind of proud of myself.  I'm satisfied with it. Hmm. What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you think you'd notice a difference with the speed? Like with a new processor or more RAM?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe all it really matters is how many tabs you're running.  Yeah. And I don't run many.  Really? The the the king of tabs is the head of Neiman Lab.  And he pridefully has. Like literally 200 tabs open all the time on his Chrome.  How do you do that? I know somebody who can beat him, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Mike Masnick from Tector is close to 500 is standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How do you navigate that? I don't even understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't even understand how you do that and how you're efficient.  Like with 500 tabs open, like you're not. That's just random noise.  And you're like I have to imagine in that regard.  And I would love to hear an explanation.  But I have to imagine in that regard, you're still only working with like the visible, like 10 tabs or whatever.  And everything else is just pushed off.  You can't bring yourself to close it because you don't want to lose it or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know. One tab starts playing music and then you can't figure out which one it is.  And you have 500. No, thank you. That's my nightmare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's it's like how how Gmail introduced search instead of sorting.  You don't you don't actually sort through all the tabs.  You just open a new one whenever you need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if your machine isn't slowing down with that management process, if you want to call it that,  then there's no real reason to close those tabs anyways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I can't understand. Like I asked him, how could it not slow down if you're using Chrome?  Each one of those tabs is a separate browser instance and it's using RAM.  How the hell he must have 800 gigabytes of RAM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, Matthew, they did do some change some time back where they kind of it recognizes an unused tab.  Oh, that throttles it down.  Yeah, that was that was a little while ago, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Still, still, that just seems like a data point that you're that you're bragging.  But it's like, yeah, it's absolutely nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's it's a meaningless one upspinship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Although I love you, Mike. I love your work.  He's been on Tech News Weekly a number of times.  Oh, yeah. He's great work a number of times and everything.  But he's insane. But oh, my goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just don't understand. Have you ever seen him do a PowerPoint?  No. So he used to come to a conference I did in Toronto and he's his PowerPoints are.  So in a standard 15, 20 minute talk, he will use 400 slides and they just they go by second.  They're literally only on there for a second.  So it's it's an image or or a word.  And it's it's amazing. It's like a musical performance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like Larry. Do you ever see a Larry Lessig?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what it reminded me of. Yeah. Yeah.  Which is also a performance. It really is.  We made an exception for Mike because our rule was no PowerPoints.  Like no one was allowed to play it like a virtuoso.  Yeah, it was the same. He's such a virtuoso.  You can pull it off. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. Now I got to see. I can't believe I'm saying this.  Now I've got to see his PowerPoint presentation.  Get him on to do a PowerPoint.  Come on and bring your PowerPoint next time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what else is big at CES?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let's see here. I mean, people.  This is a Google show.  So we could talk about the announcement that Google had their Google kind of focus their announcement almost entirely, if not entirely on assistant features.  So they announced a number of new features.  Hey, G, read this page is where you're on an article and you want to read it, but you don't want to read it.  You want to hear it be read to you.  Now there are a number of apps that do this that you can stick there for a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. So if I'm on my phone and I have a page and I say, hey, G, read this page, I get that.  But how do I get that on my assistant device?  Do you? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's actually a really good question.  This might be a mobile only feature because it doesn't make as much sense on like a and a sit like a Google home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That doesn't make I could go to sleep having it read, you know, read five Matthew columns.  I haven't read yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although that would be really cool.  Hey, G, read the latest column by Matthew Ingram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Lull me into a happiness of it.  Yes.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's nothing quite like falling asleep at night to a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your journalism news today have Matthew on calm.com yet.  I don't know, but they probably should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think so.  We can hashtag sponsor.  Yes, we can maybe see if we can make that happen.  Hey, G, turn on the lights at six p.m.  So schedule schedule a bowl actions, which you could do through the app before.  Now you can do it with your voice if you're thinking about it in that moment.  You could set up a schedule with your voice.  So that's kind of nice.  Do either of you have the smart displays of any kind?  I do right now.  You do? Well, you're going to get me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No. Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're going to get some new features to your smart display.  You're going to get a sticky note feature.  Hey, G, leave a note that says and then whatever your note says.  I just tried it. So it's not out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You just said, sorry, I can't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know if these are actually no.  These are all just announcements.  They're not realities yet.  So we're telling you about it now and then you will forget about them.  And then they will launch somewhere down the line and you won't know.  Right. Right. Right. Six months later.  Yes.  Was that an I.O.?  That's how this works.  You'll totally forget about it.  You can paste speed dial options to the lock screen.  So if you have particular numbers that you want to have easily accessible,  you can do that on your smart displays.  Oh, interpreter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's confusing to me here is some of this is smart.  That's what I was talking about before.  Some of it is mobile appropriate.  Some of it is smart display appropriate.  Right. Right.  Yeah.  And so it's one thing.  It's just.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Some of these will apply to one and not the other.  It sounds like interpreter mode,  which I think applies to the smart displays.  And actually there were a number of partners,  including American Airlines that are utilizing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Essentially what it allows for in their in their lounges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right. Right.  So you would have an American Airlines would have a nest hub in their lounge  and it would essentially be in an interpreter mode so that, you know,  providing better customer support essentially with no human translator available.  You could use the nest hub instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was at Bellevue Hospital, which if you understand Bellevue,  could be a straight line.  But I was there for the World Trade Center Health Organization.  And on every desk, they had these phones with two earpieces.  I find so why it was so they could reach translators.  Because when you're in the city hospital in New York,  you're dealing with God knows how many languages and they have translators there at the ready all the time.  Oh, wow.  To be able to deal with medical professional and the patient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fascinating to me.  Wow. So the nest hub, the Google Assistant could come in and change,  put some people out of work, unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was going to make a Bellevue crack.  I'm glad I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I got it there quickly.  I know. I know.  I know the reflex. Yeah, I got it.  I saved you there.  Everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you've ever fired off a hot word on one of your devices and didn't intend for it,  which I mean, I feel like happens to me every day and sometimes multiple times during a show,  as is the case in all that Android.  When that happens, you can then say, hey, gee, that wasn't meant for you.  And the history of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I invoke my right to be forgotten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, that's like interesting.  Right away it will erase that action or erase the recorded audio.  It'll be like, oh, I'm sorry.  And that feature is available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How is it?  It is available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. Yes, it is.  Now you can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's been available.  That's I'm surprised that they announced it because it's been available since I believe December.  Oh, OK.  I missed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We did it on the show a few weeks ago.  We all said those around.  We didn't know about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, OK.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So if you accidentally said, hey, gee, how do you dispose of a body?  And then you decided you didn't want to say that.  Right.  You could say that wasn't for you.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've got an undo.  Of course, we're trusting Google that the undo actually works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's what we're trusting Google about a lot, aren't we?  That's true.  I'm fine with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually welcomed my new master.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had a I had a discussion over the holidays actually with a family member about this very subject.  And they said so I asked them if they had a smart assistant made by any of the various companies.  And they said no.  And they said no, and that they had no intention of ever doing that because they didn't want companies listening to them.  And so then we moved on to a different topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, then I'll go over here now.  Yeah, I actually had this conversation on one of the shows at the tail end of last month leading up to Christmas because one of the presents, one of the gifts that I got my parents was a Google home packaged with a smart light.  My thought being, see, I just I just awoke my phone.  It's going to happen like two or three more times during the show.  My thought being, you know, my dad took a spill a couple of months ago and it happened at night.  My mom wasn't there and he basically just laid there until the morning until there was light to be able to call someone.  And so I was like, well, you know, Google Home with a smart light.  This could be a really great way for you to use the hot word, turn on a light in your home and then be able to find the phone.  Oh, I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But now you could also have a call, right?  That's true. You could also do that.  Absolutely.  You could call someone, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you could call someone through it.  But I didn't I didn't think about the fact that there are plenty of people who just have already decided like, heck, no, I don't want that in my home.  So this this particular gift is almost the kind of gift you have to know for certain someone how they feel about it before you buy it for them, because you could just be giving them something that they want nothing to do with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Reminds me of the great Seinfeld episode in which Jerry gave his parents the fruit of the month club.  Why would you do that?  Who needs this much fruit?  I've just done it.  There's more fruit coming.  I don't want more fruit.  Why do I want that many grapefruits?  Right.  It's the same kind of thing.  Why would you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These companies don't need my private information.  Same thing as fruit.  Yeah, basically the same thing.  So that's I think that's about it.  That and Google had a couple of has a couple of slides that go down into a ball pit at CES.  So if you're there, you can write.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have video of Ant and Leo going down the slides that I've seen.  I want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want that.  I hope that they have.  And if they if they do that, I hope that they shoot it.  I'll request it.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We do have a picture of Leo in the segue as as pod doing doing his best Wally in the what?  No Wally future.  It's the wheelchair.  Oh, the chair.  Oh, the chair thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Right.  Does that go upstairs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or so in the now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's this is.  Dean Kamen is no longer associated with the with the company.  So.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He did have an amazing wheelchair that went upstairs.  Yeah, that's how that's how he first that's how he first got got big.  And it stood up as well.  Yes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember seeing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it looks like a cradle for Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Looks like he's being kind of looks like the doctor evil chair.  But with with wheels, it does a little.  But no cup holders.  So when he does a show, he could just like wheel in here.  I like that idea.  Right into play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He could actually he could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This kind of reminds me of his chair that you're not allowed to sit in.  That's what I'm talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The doctor evil chair.  It's right over there.  I'm looking at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I see.  Oh, you really mean that.  Oh, they be doctor evil chair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe we need to take one of those doctor evil chairs and put a couple of wheels on it.  And we have our own.  It's almost the same thing.  Yeah.  It could be a little project, a project.  Take us three years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But do you how do you lean like to make it go and stop just leaning back forwards and back?  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know how it operates.  I don't know.  You think that's coming soon.  Top speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's meant for someone who is disabled in some motion sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  They might be able to lean.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, then how definitely needs turn indicators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This has not been thought through.  Oh, the S-Pod is controlled using a little joystick on the right side of the seat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, OK.  OK.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that makes more sense.  Interesting.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cool.  Twenty four miles an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is pretty fast for a chair.  That is pretty fast.  Totally.  Man.  Yeah.  That reminds me of the other Seinfeld episode when George was being chased in the middle  of the road.  George was being chased in the electrified scooters with the old people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you have a Seinfeld episode queued up for every story that we have at the Red Nose?  I should.  That was a great episode.  I'm impressed by your Seinfeld knowledge.  That was a great episode.  I enjoyed Seinfeld.  I don't remember these things off on the fly, though.  Yeah, I don't remember that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought I saw every episode.  You don't?  Oh, hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hold on.  Now, we can't play it.  We can't play it.  We can't play it?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What about a small portion?  I don't know.  What about a small portion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, we could, but yeah, we might get laid down if we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fair use.  Yeah.  Let's see if there's an image.  We're discussing it.  It's journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What would think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, yeah, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fair use only counts once you get to court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  True.  There's that.  Here's a GIF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is a GIF enough?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think a GIF is passable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe.  I've heard no directives around GIFs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is not settled law.  All right, hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm putting it into the rundown.  Under the grill, George.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know Chief Justice Kavanaugh pretty well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so there it is.  It's in the rundown next to George under CES.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see here.  It's just poor old GIFy.  Surely that's okay.  Yeah, that's got to be fine.  If YouTube starts taking down videos because of GIFy loops, then that's a big story in  and of itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we're not getting notices from GIFy yet, so we're fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, that's a great find, all these Seinfeld GIFs.  Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Okay, so this is your workspace for the episode.  Every story that we do, you've got to find a Seinfeld GIF that applies to it.  This is your toolbox.  Let's see here.  What else?  We talked about the really important things, the Charmin toilet paper robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you have the strange, very strange neon artificial human thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I still don't know that I understand this entirely.  I don't understand it at all.  I was hoping you'd explain it to me.  Okay, and Samsung unveiled this.  It's the neon artificial intelligent humanoid chat bot.  It's like human size, so when you go there, I guess, I've seen some tweets and everything,  where people walk up to it.  It's a huge screen, high-res screen, human-sized humanoid on the screen, basically looking  right at you.  It's not a smart assistant, so this is not like Bixby 2.0.  This is essentially meant to be like having a conversation with a real human.  They behave like them, different gestures and everything.  They control facial movements and all this kind of stuff to make it look very, very real.  They can develop memories and learn skills like a human, supposedly.  What they describe as the proprietary technology that's included here are two engines.  There's the core R3, which is the reality, real-time, and responsive engine.  It's what makes it respond in a lifelike way, so what it looks like as it is pretending to be human.  And then Spectra, which is its intelligence, learning, emotions, and memory, they say that's  still in the developmental stages, but that we're going to find more of a preview later this year  at Neon World 2020, something that we've never heard of before.  I don't know.  Is this supposed to be like a companion?  Like, I need a companion in my life, so I get a Neon chatbot in my home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not a Siri. It doesn't answer questions.  Because it says it's not for information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, it's not for information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's for creating a relationship with and getting to know, and it knows you, and teaching its skills.  Maybe making it a travel agent or, I don't know.  It's a big question mark for me.  I'm not entirely sure what the purpose is, but maybe this is the beginning of the future.  Where we're all having normal conversations with humans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it seems like a natural kind of thing to be an assistant.  Like, it seems as though if it's a chatbot, why couldn't you just ask it, what's the weather going to be like?  But they seem to specifically say it's not for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, like they want it to be, well, yeah.  They want it to be limited like a human is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But then what's the point of that?  Wouldn't it be better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's superhuman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We've got enough limited humans around already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's true.  So I'm looking at a CNET video that's on BGR.com.  Just to look at what it looks like.  And it looks like that Star Trek thing where you're caught in the, there's a human being in a two-dimensional space.  Let me out!

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you remember, Jeff, there used to be a virtual person who would greet you at the Newark airport.  There was like a hologram.  And it was only there for, well, it was just in the airport when you walked into the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Various airports have that one where it's kind of, yeah, yeah, it used to be there.  It's projected onto a small human-shaped screen, kind of.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  And it would go through a spiel, kind of.  But then they got rid of it, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hello, and welcome to the...  I'm sure somebody, being its jersey, somebody probably punched it in the face, virtual face.  Probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It didn't seem terribly helpful.  Yo, shut up!  That's for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ouch!  So there was the NEON project that is very confusing.  Samsung also announced an invisible AI-powered or driven keyboard for phones.  Did you see this?  Basically...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Selfie camera-powered keyboard, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, selfie type.  So imagine you've got a foldable phone.  I think this is one example.  And you fold it out so that it's, you know, sitting on the table, kind of propped up like that.  The selfie camera is projected out so it sees the table in front of you.  And you can put your hands down on the table and type like you normally would.  There's no keyboard that's, like, projected onto the table.  You're literally just putting your hands where the keys would be.  And so I guess this requires a certain level of, like, knowledge of, like, the proper way of typing, I would guess.  And you're, you know, basically the selfie camera watches as you type whatever you're going to type through muscle memory, I suppose.  And the AI is able to decipher what you're typing as you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not going to work for us two-finger typists, that's for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I'm saying. Yeah, right.  Like, you've got to have a certain level of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can barely find the keys when you can actually see them on the keyboard.  Yeah, this is peak CES.  I am a champion touch typist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm a very good touch typist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I bet I could go as fast as you with two fingers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I first learned to type after sixth grade because my parents said you're going to fail school if they try to read your handwriting, kid.  The thing I want is I want something where I can type anything with one hand, like when I'm walking or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they have keyboards that are basically a ball-shaped device.  And you have to train yourself, obviously, to use it.  But you can type almost everything with a single ball-shaped keyboard.  Wow.  I mean, you look like a weirdo.  Right.  But that's because it's not normal yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not widespread yet.  Someday that keyboard ball is going to be a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I remember this cyborg, the guy at U of T who had a webcam and all that stuff.  He had a keyboard strapped to his wrist and he would type away on that.  Right.  It was hard looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's also the tap strap, which is around each of your knuckles.  And you tap things.  I'm not sure how that works.  But that's what I want.  In a sense, is that where you tap?  Yeah, I think so.  Look up tap strap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tap wearable keyboard.  In fact, July 3rd, 2018, this company called Twit had a review of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  I think you guys did do it.  Never heard of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm trying to see who...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you see you can tap on your own knee with it.  Leo and Megan.  Was that?  Yep.  There you go.  Oh, there she's opening it up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  But it's a case where we can feel pretty confident that we're okay.  Twit won't do anything to us.  We're Twit.  It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're Twig.  Yeah, that's true.  We're Twig.  Yeah, that's right.  Oh, maybe they will do something to us then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Totally different.  That's weird looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The image shows you on the video, you can type on a table or type on your knee or anything  at all.  It's just showing...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just feeling where your hands are moving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.  Okay.  I'd like that.  I'm too clumsy though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll screw it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Wow.  And you could do other things like take out the garbage without taking it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you're typing things while you're taking out the garbage.  You come back in and you talk with the letter F just a number of times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Have you ever tried one of the ones that projects the keyboard onto the table top?  No, have you?  I have tried one and it's really weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, as you would expect.  There's no travel.  Yeah, there's no travel.  It's strange typing on a flat surface like that.  It's probably the kind of thing that you get used to it the more you do it and everything.  But when I tried that, even though it seemed like it should be obvious, it was really difficult.  Really difficult for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, people got used to virtual phone keyboards.  I remember having a debate with a friend.  In fact, she still has a BlackBerry because it has a physical keyboard.  She just never, she could never get used to a virtual keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I remember the early, you know, first couple of years of typing on the virtual keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't a BlackBerry just a matter of patriotism in Canada?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess a little bit.  For her, it was the keyboard.  I don't think she cares who owns it or where it's based.  It was literally the only one you could get with a physical keyboard.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I lost this for a while.  I was so happy.  Just yesterday I was going through drawers looking for something and I found my beloved.  Oh, trio.  I loved my trio.  Wow.  It was the greatest.  It really was.  Now it was more of a handspring guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You would be.  Now, now settle down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had a Newton.  Power up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know because I can't find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know which power thing to use for.  I got to find that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.  That was back in the days of totally proprietary charging.  Before USB.  Yeah.  Totally proprietary.  Everybody had their own.  Everybody had their own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had a bin full of those, which I threw out when we moved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  My office is a museum of good technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Me too.  I've got the original flip phone, the Motorola.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  I have my Osborne One.  It's my pride and joy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What do I have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Give away?  What do I have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to get in on this party.  That's not a good question to ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeez.  How could you think such a thing of me?  I'm Matthew.  Sorry.  I have the Nexus Q.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's all I have.  The Nexus Q, sad trompo.  Let's see.  I have the QCat.  Do you have the QCat, Matthew?  Oh, the QCat.  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got a QCat somewhere.  I know.  I forgot about the QCat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Brilliant.  Brilliant technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For you kids out there, the idea was that no one in the world was going to type in these  things they call URLs.  So you were going to sit tethered to your desktop machine in your den with a very long  cord and a scanner.  Publishers were going to get in the act here.  They were going to license this technology because it was so special.  They were going to put barcodes with every ad and every story.  So you would scan that so that your computer would then go to that URL.  You having to tire your little fingers typing it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it was helpfully shaped like a cat so you could remember what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was the dorkiest thing.  I remember the founder had this.  He was just such a slick, Willy.  I don't know how that even made it to the marketplace.  Huge gold rings and gold buttons and things.  It just all just said, it said, dispelled failure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it made it to the marketplace because it came out in 2000 and wasn't everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, because it was stupid publishers.  I guess.  It was a free with Wired magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was free with QCat with whatever issue that was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By 2001, it was done.  2001 and done.  Oh, boy.  Search engines were a thing then, though.  No one really needed to plug in a URL.  You just do a search.  Well, you had to go through Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's true.  And Yahoo had to remember when you had a list of the new sites of the day.  Yes.  That's when the web was that small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So footnote, I was working at the Globe and Mail in the financial reporting section,  and I put together a list of places you could get stock quotes online.  And there were only about nine or something like that.  And just for fun, I called it the high tech investor.  And that was website of the month in Worth magazine.  Yeah.  I had a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had a hot side of the day a couple of times.  The yuckiest site on the Internet was one of mine.  Nice.  Nice.  Wow.  That's a real feather in your cap there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sure is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's on my resume still.  Print out a screencap of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Frame it.  Put that on your wall.  All right.  Back to the future.  All right.  I love these mini tangents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We are so old.  One plus has they were they were setting everybody up to to be wowed at CES because they were  talking about this thing called concept one where they were going to show off the future  of one plus design at CES.  And so sure enough, they had their their announcement.  I don't know if you've seen it.  I've seen it.  I've seen it.  I've seen it.  I've seen it.  I don't know if it was an event.  I think it was just like an information announcement at CES concept one, which is essentially it's  a McLaren edition version of the one plus seven T. Pro.  Real leather.  Which one plus has done this in the past.  They have a relationship with McLaren the automaker.  And so in some of their previous phones, they've had like McLaren editions with kind of stylings  that are borrowed or inspired by McLaren and through a direct partnership with McLaren.  But this concept one kind of takes that one step further.  Yes, it kind of looks like cars, a car interior in the design.  But the glass panel that you see there on the back, that's where the cameras are, the  rear facing cameras of which I think there are three.  But you can't see them because on the concept one, that glass is electrochromic, similar  to the electrochromic glass that's in the McLaren seven 20 S supercar.  And what it allows for is it allows for the phone to make that glass dark so that the  cameras aren't visible or transparent or trans.  What is it?  Translucent transparent.  I don't know what the word is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hope transparent for the photo quality.  Transparent.  Transparent.  So that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there we go.  So that the cameras can be seen and used, right?  Because if that filter is on, the pictures would come out very, very dark.  Who wants to see a camera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So on one hand, I'm kind of like, okay, that's an interesting thing to hang your concept  on.  At the same time, I'm very intrigued by the idea of cameras now having the ability to  have an actual filter, like an actual, not a software filter, but a hardware filter for  the right conditions.  Let's say maybe this is an opportunity to kind of put a filter in between.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It says it can change the opacity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's like a dreamliner window.  Have you guys been on a dreamliner for that?  No.  The dreamliner windows are electric luminescent or whatever you call it.  Oh, I have been on one.  Yeah.  Right.  So you can manually turn them up and down and then the flight attendants can make every  window just dark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It kind of pisses me off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's not like the old ones where it's either open or shut.  There's a whole bunch of gradations in between.  Right.  Yeah.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I don't know when or if we see this coming to market because it is a concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't want to see concept.  I always thought the concept cars were dumb because you can't get them.  What's the point of showing them to us?  And so I don't want to see that concept thing come into our world.  We might do this, but then again, we might not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So in this case, it says the phone is basically the same like the phone itself is.  So the concept is just the camera and the filter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And everything else is very, very much the same as the 7T Pro.  I'm not mistaken.  So kind of neat.  That's different.  But man, they really were promoting this leading up to CES.  And everybody was like, oh, is this their foldable entry?  Are they going to show off foldable tech?  So I think some people were a little let down by this.  But the more I thought about it, the more I was like, all right, maybe it's not the most amazing announcement.  But it is an interesting feature.  I would actually love to have that in a phone to have like an actual hardware filter, like an ND filter of some sort that you could turn on or off.  I think that's pretty neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It would be really interesting if they could do it on the front facing camera.  If they could just hide it behind the screen and then just translucent tight, translucent eyes that portion of the screen just long enough to take a picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Translucent eyes.  Soon to be a Webster word of the day.  Soon to be a word.  No one has ever used that word before.  Karsten invented it.  When you hear that, you can say you were there when they're Arston invented translucent eyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was amazing afternoon that day on Twitter.  Yeah.  There were other things, but I don't I don't know.  I don't know if they were as important that TCL, the TV manufacturer has a number of phones that they're finally coming out with.  One of them that they showed off was a foldable phone concept.  Jeff is a concept phone to show you what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Didn't someone show off a TV that would rotate so that it was in the Webber girl story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a Samsung.  What's it called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ciro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, rotates.  And so I guess it could show the Nero or not.  What's the name of where they call their Neo?  No, neon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The neon.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because then it becomes a person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right.  Yeah.  Oh, forty three inch set designed for mirroring your phone and all those vertical YouTube and tick tock videos that you might be playing on it.  See, it says possibly the biggest phone accessory ever.  Truth to that.  Yeah.  And CES is still going, although is it is it wrapping up now?  Is tomorrow the last day or is it Friday?  I never know.  I think tomorrow is the last.  All right.  So CES is rounding out.  We've probably got all the news from CES that's that's most important.  We're going to get.  Yeah, that we're going to get.  OnePlus did also announce something called Optimize Charging.  This isn't limited to the concept that they showed off by any means.  This is I think they're going to roll this out to many of their current phones.  But essentially, the idea here is that when we plug our phones in at night and we charge them up, most of the time what's happening is our battery is charged up to 100 percent and keeps charging, keeps charging, keeps charging.  Which is bad.  Which is bad for battery, the life of the battery.  And so what this would do is it would hold it at 80 percent and over time it would understand when you normally take it off the charger, let's say in the morning, and it would only allow it to go up to 100 percent.  I think like 90 minutes before you are expected to take it off the charger to gain more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why don't they just come up with a charger that communicates with the phone and turns itself off when it's full?  Wouldn't that be easier?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but then when you take your phone off the charger, it would have depleted down to...  No, no, no.  No?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I see.  Well, but the phone's also...  It has to keep it topped up.  Yeah, tops it up.  And by the way, when was the last time you guys have had a battery just die on your phone such that you had to replace the battery?  Oh, well, that's a really great question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Long time ago.  Long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  So I don't know if this is a huge problem waiting to be solved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I did a bit of research into this because I was concerned about it.  Someone asked me about it or told me you shouldn't do that.  And so I looked into it a bit and there was a battery technologist who said that's technically true.  If you leave it at 100, it will decrease the lifespan of the battery, but it probably isn't going to decrease it.  Like it'll wear out faster, meaning it'll be done in like two years.  But most people replace their phone every couple of years anyway.  So he said you'd have to keep it for three or four years to really notice.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although, I mean, I give OnePlus props in this regard.  When you look at it from the perspective of we're putting a lot of crap into the world, into our landfills and stuff.  This is a technology improvement that actually encourages people to hold on to their devices longer.  It at least paves the way for it in one perspective.  So I give them props for that.  And I'm probably the wrong person to ask as far as how long I hold on to a device because I use so many of them for my job.  I go through them way more than a normal person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do feel like, I know we've talked about this before on the show, that people are maybe not updating their devices as frequently  because the new ones actually aren't dramatically better than for the things that most normal people use.  You know, if you want the leather one with the translucent or whatever saying, then great.  But if you just want a phone that works and has a half decent camera, you know, the probably one from a year or two ago is still pretty good.  Yep, absolutely. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Google News is getting rid of print publications.  No more digital versions of print publications, magazines, that sort of stuff in Google News.  Apparently, they're refunding people who have active subscriptions.  They started this back in 2012 and it's been through a number of different iterations over the years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I'll be curious to hear, Matthew, about this too.  My guess is when the web came out, I worked for Steve Newhouse at Advanced Publications and he said if we handed over this new thing, the web, the Internet to the newspaper publishers, all they would do is put up PDFs of their publications.  And indeed, that happened like crazy.  Indeed, to this day, you see that all the time.  Oh, you could get the PDF for the paper, Grandpa.  And the ego of the editor still says that's what people really want is my judgment and my design and my this and my that.  And the truth is nobody wants your old stinky print Gutenberg layout.  And so my guess is that this is something they did to suck up to publishers and their egos, which is a lot of what these both Facebook and Google do is to try to just keep them out of lobbying Brussels and Washington against them.  And nobody wanted it.  That's my guess.  Matthew, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I think you're definitely on the right track.  I do know a couple of people who, in fact, a friend who was just here over the holidays who who downloads the PDF version basically of the newspaper because she wants to read it in that way.  And while she's traveling, and I asked her why.  And she's old, you know, not ancient.  And she just likes it better.  So, but I would agree that.  Yes, especially when she's complaining about how long it takes to download the newspaper over our slow Internet.  And I keep saying, you know, you could just go to the website.  It's a lot faster.  But she wants to see it all laid out the way, you know, it would be in a newspaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an art to the presentation of a newspaper.  Yeah, she's just used to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She's just used to it.  And I think but and there are services that that do that.  And so I guess Google thought, you know, why are we competing in this business?  Why are we doing this?  There's other places people can go to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know, by the way, has been very friendly with subscriptions lately where they subscribe with Google and contribute with Google.  They're trying to be very friendly to publishers on that.  But this is kind of ridiculous.  Carson, were you trying to say?  What were you going to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I was just going to say Apple News is also Apple News Plus service.  They basically they bought texture and are trying to do a very similar thing.  And they're yeah, they're they're going nowhere on that as well.  This is actually started by the magazine industry.  Yeah, this is just something that no one really wants.  Yeah, it's a niche for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I remember when I mean, you would get digital versions of even Wired magazine.  Conde Nast was the worst.  And to download a single issue of the magazine would be hundreds of megabytes, which at the time, you know, when you didn't have 200 meg a second internet connections, it was because they basically just took a picture, a high res picture of every page and then put it into a PDF.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I told the advertisers this is this maintains your wonderful.  Matthew, Canadian question for you.  La Press spent a reported twenty five million dollars in Montreal to shift everybody to iPad.  Then recently they became a not for profit.  Is the iPad things strategy still there or do they get rid of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it is still there.  I'm not 100 percent clear on how things are going.  I know they were.  It's a bit of a unique market in a way, the Quebec market, partly because of language and culture, I think.  And so it did a little better there than it than it did say when the Toronto Star tried it.  The Toronto Star Star did try it.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't know that they sort of famously blew.  I think it was 35 million or might have been more than that.  They licensed the software and all the other stuff that that Quebec or had used for tablets.  And then basically nobody wanted it.  That may as well have set that money on fire in the backyard.  Like it produced nothing effectively business wise.  But I think it's still technically going.  I don't know how many people use it.  Yes, unfortunately, the post media, which is the other another big chain, disastrous tried something similar.  Yeah.  Blew a ton of money on a tablet strategy.  They were hoping that the tablet would be for leaning back on the couch, you know, at the end of the day.  And and and then it just didn't happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They weren't alone in thinking that.  No, no, they weren't.  Yeah.  What's happening with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, and they're the content on the tablet was exclusive.  So for both the star.  So you could only get stuff on the tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I forgot News Corp did this to Murdoch did this to for a while.  He had a whole huge staff.  That's right.  But your bigger question.  That was the daily.  Right.  Yeah, that's right.  I used to buy a magazine.  It was part of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was 60 million.  I think the daily 60.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.  I used to buy magazines by the pound.  I started a magazine.  I love magazines.  I buy them.  They were in my blood.  I haven't bought a magazine in years.  Mm hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You see, my mom still buys magazines by the pound and I tried to give her texture and she was she just had no use for it at all.  Really?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So locked into the physical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  A product.  It's what you get used to.  Yeah, it's what you get used to.  Lots of, you know, younger folks are happy to consume content on their phones, but I think if you're older, that's just foreign and flipping pages.  She has no problem with doing things on her phone either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just one.  Was it the metaphor?  The visual metaphor?  Yeah, the magazines are magazines and websites are websites and the UI for one does not work on the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and the sort of the flip board, you know, page flipping kind of UI thing.  I know a bunch of people who felt like it's supposed to make you feel more comfortable like it's a magazine, but it actually I think in some cases can do the opposite because you're thinking, well, why am I flipping like a virtual page?  That doesn't make any sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, like sometimes when I think about like the like earlier days of getting a magazine and like relaxing, you know, sit down on the couch flipping through a magazine, I don't get that same kind of relaxing feeling when I've got a display in front of me.  Now I maybe do, but back then I could totally see myself being resistant to it.  You're lying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You totally can just lie down on your bed.  Now I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Now I can't sit there and just swipe for hours.  I try not to is the thing.  And maybe that's the thing about magazines that's kind of appealing is like you're not going to be distracted in a million other different directions.  This is the thing.  We want to be distracted.  This magazine.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had this conversation with a friend about the Kindle and I said, you know, I can read books on my tablet.  And he said, yeah, but then you'll get pop ups and you'll go to some other application.  And he said, when I'm reading a book, I just want to read the book.  I don't want message notifications or, you know, yeah, which is a fair point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I completely agree with that.  Let's see here.  Well, this was this seemed like big news.  This was this late last week.  This medium post Ross, uh, la jeunesse.  Is that how you say it?  Yeah.  Once Google's top public policy executive employee since 2008, he left Google back in April.  He wrote on medium last week that he was actually pushed out.  He had been advocating for a formal human rights program in Google said every time he recommended the program, senior executives looked for reasons to say no.  Google ultimately chose not to double down on human rights.  Go away, Google.  It just woke up again.  Go away, Google.  It just woke up again.  Geez, I swear.  Not for you, Google.  Not for you, Google.  Not for you.  Yes, exactly.  Yeah.  So he's saying he was pushed out.  You know, so many changes happened right about the time that we started hearing about Dragonfly and all the internal machinations around that.  And he says Google's changed, you know, don't be evil.  Used to make used to actually mean something.  Now it's just an item at the bottom.  You know, I guess they've they've completely walked away from it at this point, but it doesn't mean anything.  They're chasing profits and stock prices and human rights doesn't mean anything to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do you think the motto now is only as evil as necessary?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  Right.  It's a little evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's disappointing that they downgraded that view.  I mean, as we said on the show many, many times, it was really meant as a license to employees to say, keep us from being evil because being evil is bad business.  Problem now, I think, for all of them is there's so many definitions of evil.  Yeah.  It's the same problem with Facebook.  I was in a huge discussion today on Twitter.  It was tiring because I've had it a million times.  You know, they should get rid of this fake stuff.  Well, who's going to define what's fake?  What's fake to one party is going to is going to be, you know, orthodoxy to another.  And then they're going to get mad at them and they're stuck in the middle.  And, you know, what are you going to do?  Or Jack Dorsey?  You really believe that he should pull down Trump's account and single handedly should go up against the firestorm that exists against him?  You know, I kind of I get it that they should have their standards, but they're in a position now where they've had known for so long believe in the platform belief that there's no expectations as to how they can do it.  Yeah.  I think it's a shame.  I think it's Matthew.  Sorry.  I must have been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought he I mean, I thought he made some good points.  I do think Google has maybe moved away from some of the sort of core principles or attitudes that it had.  It is a massive, massive corporation.  And, you know, it wants to do things like move into China, I suppose.  I guess I was a little so I I didn't realize so read the end to the end that he was running for office.  And then my perspective changed because I thought if he's running for something, this is a pretty good serving platform right to campaign on.  I think there's a lot of kind of market out there for the Google bashing or Facebook bashing tech bashing kind of platform.  So so that to me maybe made me think that he's making any of this up.  But but it but playing it up, I guess, makes for a good that's really important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Matthew. Yeah, I didn't get that.  That that should be like at the top.  Now, similar to this, did you all read the boss post?  Yeah.  Which I thought was actually in the room.  I don't know. I thought it was good.  I put it on there.  If you saw that in time right before you went up, Jason started if you saw it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, yes, yes.  I saw the bars.  Yes, the the memo that basically he posted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it was it was it was on his behind the scenes wall.  Right.  Right.  And he was he was just trying to think through.  And I think it was actually kind of well said.  And and and he believes that Facebook did get Trump elected, but not for the reasons that everyone says it's simply because they used the ad tools.  The ad tools better than anybody.  And it wasn't because of micro targeting and it wasn't because of disinformation was because of smart advertising.  And but he's also cautioning the company.  Don't change things to stop that because that's what that's what we are.  And if somebody was use it smartly, they should if they don't use it smartly.  Then that's that's kind of that.  It's like the United States Postal Service shouldn't said we're going to get rid of direct mail because Richard Nixon's using it.  You know, he also went.  I thought it was pretty rational.  I think it was very very much was also a good reference.  I'm glad to see two good person.  One is Cambridge Analytica is F.O.S. full of poop.  Never was all powerful and all knowing people I know in the data world have poo pooed it and made fun of it forever.  And it's being treated as this big evil behemoth that's changing people's minds.  And no, it's it's another lie from the folks who brought you by part.  The other thing he said in there is every time he said media gets his run media gets his wrong.  He says, well, you know, that's kind of on us because we don't tell him anything.  And and it's true.  And they've got to recognize that their secrecy is going to yield people filling in blanks with the wrong stuff.  And that's on us in media to get anything is wrong.  But people go to presumptions because they don't know things because the company doesn't say things, which is not good for the company in the end.  And maybe they can learn that.  But I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What did you think? That was a good point. I thought that was a good point, especially.  He also said along the same lines, he said, you know, we get a lot of criticism about things.  But he said that's we should we should get a lot of criticism.  Yeah, yeah. We're a huge company and we affect people's lives in really important ways.  And that's something that we that's a responsibility that we should feel inside.  And if people are continually yelling at us and holding us to account, even if some of what they say is not 100 percent true,  we should we deserve it. We should we should effectively be able to defend ourselves.  And I I thought there were I mean, his point about, you know, sure, I want Trump to lose.  And but please don't rig the algorithm to make that happen, because we shouldn't do that is a good I mean, obviously, that's that's the way Facebook should behave.  But but he he extended it to cover not fact checking political ads, which I don't think he actually said he would defend that policy, even if it meant that Trump was reelected.  And I I don't think I don't buy the argument that they shouldn't fact check political ads.  I mean, they fact check other things. If anything, political.  We have disagreed a long time. Why wouldn't they do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you and I have disagreed a long time. So we got to you know, I few things.  One is they say this all the time. This is their standard company line.  Do you really want Facebook to be the arbiter of truth?  If truth were easy to establish, then we would need lots of journalists to get to it.  Fact checking agencies are presumed by the right wing to all be left wing.  And they're not necessarily wrong about that.  And part of the other problem is that are things taking down disproportionately on the right wing?  Yes, because they tend to use these techniques more. Don't at me.  So, again, as well as in before, they're in a they're in a dicey position.  Point two, then is scale.  Well, see, I was saying you can't you can't have an Aaron.  Both ways. Go ahead. Well, but Aaron Pilofer says today, if you're NBC or CBS, you're not allowed to fact check ads.  You can't pull ads off. Politicians can say whatever the heck they want on broadcast.  He's everybody talks about how broadcast TV is regulated. Yeah, it is.  And part of the regulation is you can't. And so what is it we expect Facebook to do?  Our politicians lie. We all know they lie.  It's up to you, the voter, to decide whether you want them to lie or not.  You might like their lies. That's exactly why.  How Trump got in office. Suddenly, if we make him tell the truth, he's not going to.  Everybody's looking for an easy solution to the problem that we have, which is much more fundamental in society, which is that we're highly divided, partly because of media, because there's huge amounts of racism and fear in this society.  And that's where we are. And you live, Matthew, in the Iceland.  I want to retire to. They won't take me.  Somebody was telling me just the other day there was Michael Moore's gun show.  I was reminded of this that he went to. He said that what separates Canada from the US is that the US is all about fear and consumerism.  And he was on the US border. And it was it was wires and alarms and everything.  Everybody's home. And he went across to Canada and he just opened people's doors and walked in their house and said, Hi, I'm Michael Moore, because the door was open.  It's a lot ingrained in our society. And we're not going to fix that overnight by telling Facebook to get rid of politicians lies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I just I guess I mean, I I appreciate your point.  And I think I see where you're coming from.  But I wonder if they can fact check news articles using third party fact checkers.  Why can't they fact check political ads? I mean, if you're going to do one, if you're going to do one, why don't you do the other?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why? Because they're politicians, because they're politicians is what they are.  But their public figures is the argument.  There are those inside Facebook who agree with you and those obviously who disagree with you because that side is one so far from what I've heard.  I just think the other part of this is scale.  You know, if you play when I love to do this over once in a while and I go into the Facebook ad tool and I recommend calling it up.  If you search for Facebook ad database or something, it'll come up and you look on a word.  The volume of ads is phenomenal.  And they're not all from politicians. Very importantly, they're from Planned Parenthood.  They're from the NRA. They're from all kinds of organizations that have something to say.  There are from people who just want to put their money out because they because they know that they'll get seen because they put money into it.  Just like, you know, mobile oil used to put ads on the op-ed page of the New York Times when people still bought print.  So it's a forum for discussion, too.  And at Facebook, it's a tremendous scale.  And you know what's going to happen? They start tracking ads and they're going to take an ad down.  And then there's going to be a huge furor about how they're sensory and political discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there are no position.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As an example, how do you how do you fact check an ad that says the Democrats want to take away your guns?  Because that's in some cases true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's totally and that's totally fair.  But what if what if the ad says, you know, Obama invaded Iraq in in 1987?  Well, that clearly is factually inaccurate. So that's just a fact.  It's not an opinion. It's not a difference of context.  It's just factually untrue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the claims are like the one that Carson just said, rather than the one that you said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Agreed. And those agreed.  And I think, you know, the the other side of this coin is Twitter saying they're not going to carry like paid political ads at all.  Now they think it's a real problem.  They have to define what a political ad is.  So if it's an ad about nature and climate change, well, that's a political topic.  I agree. It's it's a complex issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ads for Chevron are now legal, but ads against Chevron.  Right. Right. Right. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been doing a lot of my Gutenberg research.  I've been doing a lot of a lot of a lot of reading about the early days of publishing in the news.  And and it's just simply true that every country and every regime that tried to control the printing press  and tried to tamp down speech lost and lost more than just that battle.  They were left behind. And and and you know, I quick to point out, I'm not a libertarian.  I'm about to sound like one. I'm a morning Kamala Harris Democrat.  But this research makes me more and more and more a free speech absolutist.  I just say that it's the public conversation and we all have the right to judge on our own.  And journalism's job is to help people judge if they trust us enough to care.  But trying to tamp down the speech just makes me more and more nervous as things go by.  I was at a meeting recently to try to with people who were called in to talk about what we do about Facebook  and political ads in 2020 and I looked around the room and I saw a room that was majority vast majority white men.  And I said, I'm uncomfortable sitting in a room where a bunch of white people are trying to decide what people can and cannot say  when you have a world where the people who were never allowed to speak in mainstream media now finally have a voice.  There was a great, great New York Times op ed week ago about Twitter.  Yeah, yeah, I thought it was really good.  It was a good piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're in a different we're in a different world.  I mean, I get your point about being a free speech absolutist, but the vast quantities of our speech are controlled by private corporations.  And that's and that's a place we have not been before.  That's like, you know, we all live inside a giant shopping mall.  And so we get to say the things that those companies allow us to say.  Facebook monetizes that speech and they pick specific things to monetize and things not to monetize.  And we don't know how they pick those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What you just described is our industry.  It's journalism and media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but our industry was not anywhere near the kind of scale we're talking about.  There has never been a newspaper or a media company, not even Fox News is is anything like the scale of Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But but it's not broadcast.  It's not mass media is not showing the same thing to everybody.  It is a platform.  And I don't understand the scale argument where I mean, the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, one paper or one news, maybe one one NBC News or one one San Francisco Chronicle didn't reach everybody.  But like the the national news reached had the same approximate reach as Facebook does in America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So no two people see the same Facebook.  Everybody who watched CBS saw the same CBS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree with you.  So CBS had a much bigger reach than Facebook.  A single company controls all.  Yes. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  CBS. So that had a bigger reach than an individual entity on Facebook.  Yes. Facebook does not have a lot.  We talk about Facebook.  It has this huge reach.  It's not presenting the same thing to everybody on the earth.  And instead, it's people having conversations.  It's not content.  It's not media.  It's conversation.  But the conversation is not what we're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're talking about advertising and advertising in particular.  In fact, micro targeting.  If you listen to Alex Stamos and others, micro targeting actually makes things worse.  If you can micro target specific disinformation to specific people, that's a potential Democratic nightmare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'm going to argue contrary again.  And I have a piece I've been wanting to write in defense of targeting because because what offends me is mass media that treats us all the same and expects we're all going to be melted pot into the same beast, which is going to look like white people who look like me.  And what targeting does micro targeting is kind of a scare word.  Let's just call it targeting.  A all media have died to do targeting better and better and better forever.  The Internet finally enables it.  B targeting makes advertising more relevant and efficient.  And if you are AOC or if you're a small school board campaign or if you're a movement of I'm wearing the Parkland t-shirt and you want to do guns, this allows you to go to people who are not as successful as you are.  At a very efficient level without targeting, you end up being having to be Michael Bloomberg buying a Super Bowl ad against fellow alleged billionaire Donald Trump by the Super Bowl ad.  That's what we're trying to get away from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you're but you're describing how Donald Trump won.  Donald Trump won because Brad R. Scali micro targeted specific voters and convinced them not to go to the polls.  And Hillary Clinton could have done the exact same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hillary Clinton could have done the exact go on to convince people not to go to the polls.  But Hillary Clinton could have used the exact same tools and didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  You're only arguing against targeting because the guy you don't like won.  I remember I remember all the praise that the that the the the liberal journalism establishment gave for the Obama in twenty eight.  Twenty twelve for his use of the way they use technology.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm looking through right now.  I'm at the at the Facebook ad library and I just searched on the word climate.  Tom Steyer is there another damn billionaire.  But otherwise it is organizations of a fairly wide range plus brute.  I don't know why they're there.  The climate list Yale climate connections climate reality alliance for climate education.  Now by the way some of these of course could be fronts for disinformation.  I don't know. I can't you know I haven't gone to detail on the ads.  But my point is that you can start to part of what the First Amendment in the United States protects is not just the right to speak but also the right to assemble.  And targeting enables assembly and assembly is what enables action and enables movements to start.  And if you have to depend upon money and gatekeepers still that's the world we were in and that's the world that I celebrate the hegemony that I celebrate being torn apart and targeting is part of it.  We have we have a gatekeeper.  We have a massive multi no they're not in the dollar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hundred billion.  No you spent ten minutes complaining about how they're not gatekeeping.  You just spent you spent a hundred billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're not gatekeeping.  You just spent you can't have it both ways either.  Matthew right.  You just spent time.  They are not keeping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're making decisions that we don't understand.  They saw criteria that they don't tell us about and they control the information that that billions of people get.  That's a good.  The ads they're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So sure they are.  Now you pay for you pay for targeting and you get it right.  And when and you and many like you have complained well they should be gatekeeping that and they're not.  So then now you turn around and say that well they are gatekeeping.  They are they're not.  Of course they are.  What are the criteria.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What are the criteria that they give you to target on.  Do you know how to fit into the algorithm the algorithm.  Do you know how they fit into how you see things in your news feed.  No.  How often you see an ad where you see an ad.  So sure you can pick categories.  I've seen the ad tool but you don't understand.  I don't understand.  No one understands except half a dozen people at Facebook.  How that affects where you see things.  Is it working too well or not well enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Matt.  Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  We don't know.  We don't know how it works.  And they're not telling anyone because that's part of my problem.  Here's another way to look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's Travis Smith for North Carolina Senate.  Right.  This is a young guy who's running for the Senate in North Carolina.  Tiny tiny constituency that he wants to reach in the past.  He'd have to pay for incredibly inefficient advertising in newspapers and television.  Couldn't afford it.  Couldn't do it.  Now we can reach people in those neighborhoods.  And if he wants to go after young people who care about the climate.  Why not.  Why can't he.  Those are the people who will likely to come out.  That's exactly what the campaigns do anyway.  And he can do it with incredible efficiency and expensive.  And that I think is going to help democracy in the long run.  He's going to have more people able to contribute and able to participate.  In ways that they were cut off from before because either editors or budgets kept them from doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Except in this case we have thousands of editors.  More if you include algorithms.  We just don't know who they are or what principles they operate on.  It's a giant black box.  So was every newspaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's so much less a black box than any other advertising method in the world.  I think that's an illusion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You see the outside of the box and there are little pictures of leavers on it.  And then you click the pictures.  But we have no idea what happens after that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have no idea what happens if I put an ad on TV.  That's for sure.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But everybody admits that they don't understand what happens after that.  Facebook.  How is that better?  Facebook.  So the way the TV broadcast is not controlled by an algorithm.  It's controlled by a bunch of idiots at some network TV headquarters.  My point is there is there is a sophisticated software intelligence that Facebook put together that is controlling those things that you just described.  And we don't know anything about it and how it operates.  We are just basically taking it on faith that when we click a picture of an option on the outside of the box that it will do what it says on the box.  So that concerns me.  So that concerns me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you think, Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've been staying out of the way of this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been ducking the ball, going back and forth, trying to bob and weave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where I stand is I'm just utterly confused when it comes to this topic because I identify on both sides.  On one hand, I completely agree with you, Jeff, that there is such a thing as having the ability to exercise free speech.  On the other hand, I agree with what Matthew is saying, that the scale and the control of a single company having access and such influence over such a wide range of communication throughout humanity,  throughout the technology infused humanity that we live in today.  I get confused by it.  Like, honestly, I get overwhelmed by it because I think we have less control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's that?  I understand that argument.  I hear that argument on time.  But there are far more voices that could ever before could get in.  So even though it's yes, it's going through a few companies now for now, I don't think that's going to last.  There's more voices than we could ever have.  So there's less control that we had in the days of Matthew's and my business in newspapers where you had one or two newspapers in a town.  And I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So there's more people inside the giant shopping mall that Facebook controls and they let you put up posters outside and crazy for you or whatever.  And you think that that constitutes freedom of communication?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's a lot better than what we had before.  Yes.  And I think that it's not forever.  And I think it's not forever.  So the other thing is I think that the Internet right now is at a stage.  I'm about to write a post.  I haven't written yet, but I'll give you a preview.  The Internet has been written so far is all about speaking, not about listening.  The Internet is about the freedom of speech that everybody can speak.  And the next phase we need in this net is one of judgment, selection, expertise, authority and so on.  And I don't remember the name Samir Aurora.  Do you remember that name, Matthew?  He was the CEO of Glam, which was a big blog network back then.  So Samir has a new company that he's talked about hardly at all.  What I'm going to write about soon called Sage, and it's not really up yet, but it's a an expert network.  What Samir found was that he could take a hundred experts and have them pick experts and he gets to a thousand experts.  And then the AI learns what they're doing and they can get to, you know, twenty five hundred experts.  The first topic he's tackling is just travel destinations, because that's a very finite thing.  He's not doing something complex like news, politics.  But in that area, then he can find out who has credibility and who does not and has a whole way to make that judgment so that you can come in and find an expert in sushi or find an expert in Quito in Tokyo and and start to understand that level of expertise around that.  So I think we're going to find ourselves in new structures.  What Twitter and Facebook and the Web have allowed is everyone to speak.  And as you can hear, I celebrate that.  But but it's messy and it's not as useful as we want it to be.  Right. It's not the Yahoo days of, hey, we have five new sites on the Web today.  Here they are. Right.  So it's gotten so huge that we can't deal with it.  And I think we're going to start to experiment more and more and more with systems of quality.  Now, the problem with that is that's going to be exclusionary again.  It's you know, what's the black box there?  There's going to be all kinds of problems there.  But but there's a there's a flight to quality we're dying for here.  And the way we're approaching that now is by trying to tamp down the crap.  What we should be trying to do is find and define and highlight quality.  But we'll see.  It's five. I'm fond of saying it's 1475 in Gutenberg years.  It's early days, folks, early days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's easy for me to get overwhelmed and confused through all of this because of all the changes that we've seen, even in the past couple of years, it's you know, I'm sure you would all agree it's it's dizzying how quickly things are moving right now and how chaotic it all feels.  I would hope to have some sort of assurance, even though I know that's impossible, some sort of assurance, Jeff, that if what you're saying is true, that five years down the line or however long it takes to get to this place where, hey, that was that was the painful part.  And now we're to this.  Sorry, bud.  You know what I mean?  Like, there are no assurances.  But I think that's what I think that's what holds people back to to kind of truly buying.  You know what was between the invention of printing and today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  30 years war.  Yeah, right.  Right.  And and much more and peasants wars and the Reformation and all kinds of stuff.  We're going to go through huge and painful disruption.  I think it's just inevitable that that will have that.  But we have choices now.  So we've got to try to inform those choices.  And and and my problem with regulation in Europe is that it presumes that the Internet is done.  And it ain't by a long shot.  So, no, I have no comfort for you at all, Jason.  They will hide in a doghouse somewhere because it's going to get worse.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right.  Well, that's optimistic.  Oh, I'm awake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm awake again.  I'm ready.  Let's do this.  It's time for the Google change log.  Thank you, Karsten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bravo.  Karsten there with the horns to wake us up and cheer us up a little bit.  That was a doozy right there.  All right.  So what things are happening in the world of Google that has nothing to do with what we're just talking about?  New travel features.  Aren't you excited to hear about this?  New travel search features are released today.  Apparently within search, something called when to visit a feature that shows peak traveling season in a location they might be searching for cost for travel in those seasons.  This is such a like a change of pace from where we were 60 seconds ago.  Also, where to stay feature shows best places to stay, what they're close to average cost of a hotel there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm the optimist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And personalized hotel recommendations.  Are you?  Yeah.  So there you go.  Travel features to look forward to.  Or maybe you're really interested in AI development with Google.  If so, you might be interested in some new features with the coral hardware kits for AI development.  Coral accelerator module.  Here's a bunch of things I don't quite understand because I'm not developing these things, but multi chip package with custom edge TPU and PCI and USB interfaces shipping Q1 and Q2 in 2020.  Also the coral dev board mini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is just tensor on a chip.  Yes.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's the first half.  And then we have the sensor processing units on a chip.  Small low power, low cost alternative to the coral dev board with MediaTek 8167S system on a chip.  And coral accelerator module.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the first half.  Do you understand what you just said?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Neither did I.  Aren't those specs sexy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank you for admitting it.  Yes, I appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to go down the specs and hope that the right person hears it and goes, oh, OK, I care about that.  Stacey will be back.  Yes, exactly.  If Stacey was here, she'd care.  She'd tell all of us what that all means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Put this on the hold so we can get Stacey to explain it next week, will you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you happen to order a Pixel Slate, this is totally more in my wheelhouse.  If you ordered a Pixel Slate on Black Friday, you may be wondering, why don't I have that Pixel Slate I ordered on Black Friday?  Well, apparently they've all been really delayed and you're not alone.  Many people have been affected by this.  The sale worked.  Yeah, so much so that Google says they sold too many compared to their stock.  So that's been the reason for the delay.  Now they say they should start shipping mid-January, so mid-month, probably not more than a week from now, hopefully.  And they will include a $50 appeasement.  By the way, I read that.  Isn't that a weird...  Appeasement.  ...phrase to give to consumers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, appeasement is a little strange.  Appeasement payment.  Appeasement payment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We want to appease you.  Here, I have $50 to spend in our store.  So look for that if you want the slate.  Climacel is apparently partnering with Google Cloud to launch new high-resolution forecasting models for weather data,  a model with forecasting over 48 hours, resolution of 2 kilometers, 15-minute timestamps,  and it will serve as the foundation for weather products from Climacel that actually do things like predict floods, air quality, all that kind of stuff.  And apparently they're making the data sets publicly available for anyone to use, so that could be handy to all five of you.  Google Play Movies and TV is going to gain support for HDR10+, in 2020, this according to Samsung at CES.  So Samsung apparently made this announcement.  I think it was in connection with some of their TVs that have this feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Samsung is behind the HDR10-plus standard.  Oh, well then that makes more sense even.  Basically, this is how to do HDR without paying Dolby a whole bunch of money.  Got it.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that makes a lot more sense why Samsung would be the ones to make this announcement.  I was like, why wouldn't that come from Google?  But there you go.  And finally, Google is testing the ability for searchers to add comments to query results that are related to TV shows.  So if you go online and you do a search for The Bachelor while The Bachelor is playing, you have the ability to drop comments in real time with other people who are doing the same.  So it's almost like Twitter, a Twitter conversation in real time during a live event.  Hmm.  So that's kind of-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Through search, which is what's weird.  Yeah, kind of weird.  I'm sure that will go well.  This is the 97th effort from Google to get social.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very disconnected.  I don't know.  I find that very strange for some reason they're doing that.  One that didn't make it in there, and thank you to ScooterX for putting this in the chat room, the January security patch for Pixel devices is rolling out.  If you haven't got it already, I think it started yesterday.  Factory images are posted.  The OTAs are live.  So if you like security and you like updates on your Pixel, then you'll love this update.  And that is the Google change log.  I heard the buttons.  You did?  Those buttons were loud.  I heard the buttons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It sounded like a guitarist and you hear the fingers moving on the fret.  Totally.  You hear what's going on behind the artistry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Speaking of Pixel, real quick here, there was a leak.  Well, a few little bits and pieces before we get into it because I know we need to move on.  But the Pixel 4A, apparently some case renders have leaked on this.  So if you're, and I mentioned this because Carson, I know how much of a fanboy you are of the Pixel 3A.  Me too.  Is that your phone right now, Jeff?  Oh yeah, I love it.  Okay, awesome.  Yeah, it is a fantastic phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Carson, is this something we agree about?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bought it for my whole family.  I'm going to throw mine out now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't, not yet at least.  Don't throw it out until at least Google I.O. because then you can replace it with the 4A probably.  There's not going to be an XL version according to rumors.  It's just going to be one size.  Oh, that's quite big.  Yeah, kind of a bummer.  You'd get the smaller size.  I like my XL because I'm a big guy.  Well, big guy.  Now take a look at this and you'll see.  Which one did you buy Carson for everybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you buy the XL or you bought the Dickey one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bought the XL, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  Take a look at the back and you'll notice that the Pixel 4 signature square camera module area is still there,  except that it only has one camera, which makes sense of the 3A only had one camera, of course.  The 4A will still have one camera if these renders are to be believed.  And the fingerprint sensor, not the damn face thing.  Yeah, yeah.  But I just feel like that square module just looks a little strange.  It looks a little empty.  And look there. Look.  And a headphone port.  It's so nice.  Yeah.  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Carson, I fear these are the Pixels for old farts.  You're now officially an old fart.  Oh, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely.  No doubt about that.  Look, the 3A was a great phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was probably my favorite phone of last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's the price of a 3A?  Well, 300. Is it 300 or 400?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  400. But you can get it cheaper than that.  You can get it in the 200s if you get it on sale.  I was seeing it pretty low for the holiday season.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it was 280 when I bought it for my wife and son.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I mean, so worth it.  I mean, worth it, arguably, at $400, but incredibly worth it at 280.  I'll be curious to see what they price the 4A.  Hopefully they keep it at that $400 range.  I think that would be important.  There will also be a Samsung Unpacked event that happens.  They've announced that February 11th, 11 a.m.  That's where they're going to unveil or expected to unveil the Samsung Galaxy S11.  Or supposedly the S11 is not going to be the name of it.  It's going to be the S20.  Some leakers have said that's going to happen.  Because it's 2020?  I guess so.  Yes, I am so in favor of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that allowed?  So you can just have the 20 Galaxy, the 21 Galaxy.  It's like the 20 Buick.  Yes, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure, I can get behind that.  They might also possibly show off the next fold.  And we will be doing coverage of that.  Leo and I, I know, are guaranteed to be on set for that.  Where is it being held?  In New York?  San Francisco, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, you are correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You are correct, sir.  Anything else?  Anything that we've missed?  Oh, yeah, infrared photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I could show this off.  That's pretty weird.  Wait, what?  So, well, there is an infrared camera on the Pixel 4.  That's how you do the face scanning.  So if you go, I don't know if you still have, if you have my overhead.  We didn't set it up prior to the show, but it's probably already set up for last night's  All About Android.  But there is an app called Hedge Camera.  There you go.  Let's see here.  Oh, oh, oh, hold on.  There we go.  That's a better shot.  Hedge Camera.  And there we go.  I've got my infrared shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, Jamerby, turn off all the lights in the studio.  Okay, so let's see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, he did.  Oh, he did.  Hi.  How's it going?  I'm in black and white.  A crisp and clear VGA quality video.  So, yeah, if you want to do that, now you can.  I don't know why you want to do that, but you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it now completely dark in the studio?  Yeah.  Oh, it's very twilight.  Yeah.  Oh, I like that.  Yeah, it's pretty dark.  Mystery, mystery host.  That's right.  Matthew, you and I stand out now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure do.  I could take an image.  Yeah, there we go.  I'll replace myself with my infrared shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See, that's perfect if you want to do a show about haunted houses or something creepy like  that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Or privacy.  Oh, let's do that.  I'm the host who doesn't want to be known.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we've got haunted house expert Karsten on the line.  He builds them every year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because you like to scare people, Karsten, is that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like to entertain.  I like to scare people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You like to scare people.  You have something else in common with Jeff Jarvis.  Hey.  Hey.  Jeff scares people accidentally.  Right.  All right.  I think we're good.  How's your cold hanging up there, fella?  Well, my voice is getting a little crackly, but that's okay.  You need a fisherman friend?  Yes, apparently I need one of those.  Everybody needs a fisherman friend.  I learned that I needed one of those before the show today.  I'd never heard of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fisherman's friends are very loyal.  Never heard of fisherman's friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Fishermen need them specifically though.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like, do they?  Anyway.  And I'm not really a fisherman, so I don't know if I'm allowed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there is one more California story.  Okay.  Well, I guess California and West Coast, not an East Coast story.  And I never fully understood the phenomenon of this.  I think it's because I wasn't there 20 years ago, but Fry's.  Fry's.  Big deal.  The question is, is Fry's in trouble?  They lost their Palo Alto lease.  People are saying that the shelves are empty.  Fry's is saying, no, no, no, no, it's just because we changed our whole model to a consignment model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because that works so well.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.  And Fry's was worshiped.  And I started going, you know, I was going to California, the Tech Days.  I just, I kind of understood it.  If you were going to go in and make a board and get some resistors and capacitors and things, you could do it there.  And I thought, I love this place.  But I could never get, once I was inside, I just kind of said, is there a there there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fry's was so wonderful.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, rhapsodize about Fry's for a minute.  Yes.  It's, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everyone's been to Radio Shack.  Everyone knows Radio Shack.  Imagine Radio Shack, but like the size of a Walmart.  And just rows of boards and capacitors and things that.  And amps.  Yeah, and amps and things you don't even understand.  And just being able to walk through and smell the electronics.  It's just such a nice thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's nothing quite like the smell of transistors in the morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Lyrical.  Was it a good place to buy a laptop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  No, it's not a place for buying finished products.  They sell.  Yeah, it's a place if you want to build a computer.  It was a place to buy the parts to build that computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And in the day in Silicon Valley, if you were really cool and hip, right,  that had some cred.  Now, does anybody really build boards anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, gamers build game PCs, but that's a pretty niche market.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not as much there.  I mean, with the maker movement now, there's a lot of board building and buying of products.  But not enough to support huge stores.  No, I mean, you get all that stuff from AliExpress now.  So there's no point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've never I've never set foot in a fries.  You haven't.  No, I've lived out here.  Yeah, it sounds like it.  Yeah, I mean, I've lived out here since 98, but I've never ever walked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, moving to a consignment model is not a good sign.  Let's put it that way.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the video I saw, it makes those shelves look pretty empty, pretty sparse.  So poor went out for the fries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they had an odd cowboy movement motif as well.  Oh, really?  No sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, there are here.  Let me find the one in Burbank.  This one.  Yes.  Oh, there is fries.  There are a bunch of fries that had weird art installation fronts.  This was an alien crashed into it and there was actually a UFO inside.  And there are a bunch of other ones that I see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  That's smart.  Yeah.  That's so geeky.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Love it.  I'm going to send money away for a rainy day.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, indeed.  All right.  Let's do some picks and numbers and stuffs and things and all that kind of stuff.  Starting with you, Jeff, what do you what you got for your number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's old news that Google is going to end the double Dutch Irish sandwich.  So I won't do that one.  Twitter has a new portal for academic researchers, which I'll just mention.  But the thing that kind of scared me as somebody who works at a university is that Americans  rank a Google internship over a Harvard degree.  Really?  60 percent would recommend the Google internship over 40 percent for a Harvard degree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The question I had about this story, is this the good Forbes or the bad Forbes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's exactly what I was going to ask.  Exactly.  It's a contributor at Forbes.  So who knows?  And it's a survey that he led at Kaplan.  Now Kaplan, you know, a sizable company.  Kaplan is pretty good.  Based on a survey of 2000 adults conducted in December by Quest.  So that sounds OK.  It depends on how you ask the question.  There are very few believers in the work readiness of college graduates.  Only 13 percent of adults and 11 percent of seed level executives and six percent of college  and university trustees strongly agree with the statements about the work readiness of graduates.  That's scary in a couple of ways.  One, just people won't go to college.  But two, the reason we're in this mess is because people aren't educated.  And the more cooties that education gets, the worse off it's going to be.  That's the downward spiral we're on, is we're losing the enlightenment.  So that's my cheery optimistic number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am un-cheered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I probably shouldn't say this, but it reminds me of how Ivanka Trump was on the stage at CES  and made the comment that college is overrated.  She did.  She mentioned that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I will say I have talked to lots of well-educated people with professional backgrounds  who voted for Trump and believe all sorts of ridiculous things.  I don't think education is a cure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, well, that's a point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What stuff you got, Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's see. What do I have?  I did notice Twitter announced something they're changing.  They say they're going to add some changes to the way you can sort of restrict participants in a conversation.  So when you create a tweet, you'll be able to select whether you want it to go to everyone,  whether you want everyone to be able to reply, whether you want only the people you mentioned in the tweet to be able to reply,  or whether you actually don't want anybody to reply, and it's just a statement that you're posting.  So that'll be interesting to see if they actually do do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you think of that?  My fear about that, Matthew, is that if I say something stupid that happens once in a decade,  and the decade is not over yet, and you want to correct me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I'm not there to call you out, right? What happens?  Yeah.  So that is a problem.  And I actually saw a comment from someone that said they're going to miss the ratio on tweets.  So if you see tweets that have way more replies than likes or retweets, that's getting ratioed.  And you know that that is a horrible tweet and that most people disagree.  It's like an instantaneous sort of market test of that idea.  And that is an interesting feature in a way, although I don't think Twitter did that deliberately.  So you won't get that.  Twitter didn't do anything deliberately.  No, they didn't do anything deliberately.  But I don't know. It's going to be interesting.  I think it will help people who routinely get trolled and attacked all the time in their mentions.  So that will, like most things, it's probably got lots of great features for people who need it.  And it's probably going to have downsides as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And unintended consequences too.  Yeah, global.  Is that up now, Matthew? Is that is that now current or they're still just starting?  No, they said they're it's coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And as a number of people pointed out, Twitter often says things are coming and then they don't come.  So it's still vaporware at this point, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They say they're running experiments right now, but that they will launch it later this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did want to mention one other thing, if I could.  We don't really have time to go into it, I don't think.  But I've been discussing on, CGR has a discussion platform called Galley that I'm involved with.  And where we do interviews with experts about various topics.  And this week, the topic is YouTube and disinformation and specifically radicalization.  So there's been a bunch of attention and the kind of rabbit hole effect where YouTube's recommendation algorithm pushes people towards more and more radical viewpoints or conspiracy theories or whatever.  And so we've had a series of interviews.  There was a there was a study that came out just before Christmas in which the researchers said they showed that this does not happen.  And in fact, YouTube actually has a D radicalizing effect.  There was a huge amount of criticism about this study and the way it was done.  And so I spoke to the researcher, one of the co-authors, and I also spoke to Kevin Roos of the New York Times.  And to Dipayan Ghosh, who's a fellow at the Harvard Shorenstein Center.  And in particular, the reason I spoke to Kevin was because this researcher specifically called out the New York Times for its story about how someone was radicalized by YouTube.  Huge amount of debate about that topic.  And so it's been fascinating to dig into it.  Anyway, the interviews are at galley.cjr.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nice. Interesting. Yeah, I read that the medium piece that I think you're talking about that's in the rundown today and kind of came out of it scratching my head.  I was like, OK, well, now I don't I don't know where what to believe anymore.  Yeah, you're just confused.  You know what, Jason? I got a cold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the cold. It's the cold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, thank you.  I mean, the bottom line is it's difficult to make any conclusive statements because we don't get enough data from YouTube to do the research that needs to be done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the Matthew.  You're absolutely right.  That's that's the first problem.  And YouTube is better.  Twitter is the best and they and they're trying to get better.  They have, as I mentioned, this new portal for researchers.  Facebook and YouTube are awful.  The other problem is tell me if I'm wrong here.  I know you will.  How we cover studies, academic studies in media, right?  We take everything as the final word when not understanding that it's a process that studies come after and they do a small slice and they try to go after one thing that's additive and something that people can test and they can argue with and they can recreate or not.  But but media comes along and says, wine will save you.  Wine will kill you every other day.  And we'll kill you every other day and and never understanding these additive process of research.  And I think that is a little bit of that in this case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There was, but there's also another interesting aspect.  If you look at the things that this co-author has written on Medium and and on Twitter, I think there's a push for if you think of academic research as media or content, there's a push to make your research more interesting or to get more attention for it.  Because by doing that, you you then get research grants or you get, you know, you get a higher profile in your industry or whatever.  And so I've noticed at least more and more research papers that are that are being much more controversial or taking a much more even the titles that that they use the papers are because they're they're basically trolling journalists to try and get them to write the stories that you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is why the conversation started.  You know, the site called the conversation universities subsidize it to get journalists to take academic research and then translate it into human speak so that that research gets more attention and more impact.  But what you just said, Matthew is interesting.  And of course, before, so I just hold on a second.  I'm back.  So I'm doing my good research and there's a survey, a series of books of like 70 books from the company Brill.  This book costs $185.  I got it from the New York Public Library.  Thank you very much.  New York Public Library.  And why?  Because because if 200 people buy it, that's fine.  That's a good business model.  The author has probably wrote it for free.  It's a bunch of academic papers.  That model starts to go away.  So what you're what you're raising the curtain on since now is your turn to be dystopian, Matthew is academic clickbait.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I think it's a real phenomenon.  It has I've at least noticed it in researchers that I've talked to have noticed it as well.  There are sites now that specialize in just that kind of research.  They're effectively content farms, but for clickbait academic papers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what do the you think there'd be some kind of reputational harm to the academics that participates in that?  Or are they just publish or perish institutions?  I mean, I think I would hope that eventually if you did enough of that, that there would be reputational harm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But they're just the focus that academia has on right on how many papers have you published and how many you've published.  And what journals have you been in and who have you been cited by?  I mean, there's there's definitely it's it's not that different from how many articles did you write today?  And did they get on tech meme?  And how many clicks did you get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you move from publish or perish to click or die.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And people do what you incentivize them to do, you know, effectively.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there'll be no place in the world for smart, educated people like Karsten who make up entirely new words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there are.  There's no place in the world for me.  Like translucent.  What was the word again?  Translucent ties.  Yes.  Ties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Translucent ties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mm hmm.  Oh, trying to translucent eight.  Maybe we can hone this a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a different thing.  Yeah.  You can't improve on Karsten.  It's true.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Trying to like make it a verb show title.  Yeah, it is.  Probably the show title.  My thing isn't a thing that you can do.  It's just a thing that I saw on Twitter that I thought was neat.  This is how I am doing today.  I'm just putting something in here that I think is neat.  Mkbhd on Twitter tweeted out from CES, a fully functional piano that is made entirely of  one plus seven T's.  Nice.  And it's so nerdy.  I love it.  It's like the combination of things that I love, technology and music and doing neat things.  I don't know if you have any audio on this, but you can hear it.  I mean, it sounds pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are the foes making the noise then or is it just being used as a keyboard into a movie?  Well, that's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know if each phone is outputting its own sound.  That's a really good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think that would work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that is so sweet looking.  I love it.  I would love to be able to make non-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In the middle of your minuet, one of the phones rings.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or accidentally backs out to the home screen right in the middle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's a what, like a $3,000 keyboard or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I guess the seven T's, how much are they?  They're like 600 a pop, I believe.  500, somewhere around there.  It couldn't count how many there were.  Yeah, I'm guessing there's probably like 12 phones-ish.  Well, let's do the math.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How many keys on a keyboard?  Two keys each or four?  Divided by three equals the phones, right?  Was it three or four?  88 keys.  88 keys, yeah.  Does that include the black keys?  The white keys?  88 keys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, wait, that does include the black keys.  Roughly, I'm counting 17 phones just by looking at the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It could be off.  It could be off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But-  That math doesn't work.  That's super cool.  I love it.  It is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it sounded good.  Like it sounds great.  But again, you run into that kind of disconnect of what we were talking about earlier of typing  on a flat surface.  It doesn't work.  It's the same thing with-  Haptic feedback.  Yeah, you need a little buzz when you hit it.  That would be nice.  All right, let's stop this madness now.  Jason, you're going to the store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What are you going to buy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  NyQuil, and I'm going to go to sleep.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  17, one plus T's.  Fisherman's friend.  Fisherman's friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're going to walk in and say, do you have a fisherman's friend?  They're like, huh?  Hey, sailor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've never heard of it before.  What can I say?  This was a lot of fun.  This is terrible.  And it was enjoyable being in the middle of the tennis match and in the middle of the  show.  So thank you for allowing me to be-  We haven't done that in a long time, right, Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We used to do that a lot more.  This is a nice gentleman, I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, I will pull back the curtain just a slight bit and let you know that during that  back and forth, I got a message from my wife that said, hey, I can't find the keys for  the sequoia.  I need to pick up the girls.  Where are they?  And I had that panic moment of like, oh no, did I bring the keys and she has no way to  go pick up our kids?  And so you guys were battling.  I was like messaging back and forth with her.  That's why I wasn't talking initially.  And then trying to enter back into the conversation, I was like, oh my God, this is just not going  to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you have trouble, Jason?  No, no, no.  I knew where they were.  No, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were in the little backpack.  You are just using the gym bag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Go for the sympathy.  In the gym bag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was a little worried there at first.  I was thinking, oh no, what's going to happen?  But then I-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the kind of thing I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  But then I realized I remembered where they were.  That's not usually how my brain works.  So I'm happy about that.  Matthew Ingram, Chief Digital Writer for the Columbia Journalism Review, CJR.org.  Matthew, I love doing shows with you.  Thank you so much for popping on.  Pleasure for having me.  This week on Google, this week.  It's great to see you again.  And of course, Jeff Jarvis, buzzmachine.com, at Jeff Jarvis on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pleasure to be with all of you, including and even Karsten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right.  Thank you.  Big thank you to Karsten.  Actually, especially because Karsten, you were jumping in there on that conversation  when I wasn't.  So I appreciate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got your back, family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you, Karsten, for everything that you do with Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you have a signal there of take the camera off for me?  Was that me?  Do you guys just have a little signal of when security now goes, Leo said when security  now goes, once he's going into a slow liquid.  Yeah.  Right.  Leo, he knows, Steve knows Leo can go to the bathroom.  Right.  Leo's doing the board in there, right?  Right.  On his own.  Yeah.  Do you have a big studio signal that says, get me off the camera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, I don't.  I just kind of sit here and wait.  And then once the camera goes off of me, I itch and go, oh, I can finally itch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was eating my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So if you started hacking or coughing or something.  Yeah.  If the camera's not on me, I do have the ability to mute my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I can at least do that.  But yeah, it would be weird if the camera was on the wide and I'm like, you know,  motioning the Karsten.  So I just wait until he takes one of your cameras.  All right.  So twit.tv slash T W I G twit.tv slash twig is where you can go to find all the information  about this show.  All of the episodes that have ever been recorded of this week in Google could be found there.  All of your subscribe links, audio, video details about when we record, which happens  to be every Wednesday, 4 p.m.  Eastern, 1 p.m.  Pacific, 2100 UTC.  I'm imagining next week and be back to the normal lineup.  That would be Jeff Stacey and Pruitt and of course, Leo Laporte sitting in his his chair,  whether it has wheels or not, remains to be seen.  We'll check in on that next week.  And of course, Karsten will be back next week as well.  I will not, but I always enjoy sitting in this chair for this week in Google.  So thank you for welcoming on the show once again and we'll see you next week.  Take care, everybody.
