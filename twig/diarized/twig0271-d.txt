This is a big day in Google land. Jeff Jarvis joins us from Seoul, Korea,  where it's five in the morning. Oh my God. Nice. Thank you, Jeff. You are above and beyond. That  is a commitment to the cause. Thank you. My pleasure. Really appreciate it. And of course,  because you're in Seoul, you have the best Skype connection you've had all year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know. Look at that. The internet's really good in Seoul. 94 up, 94 down, 92 up. Oh my God. I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so jealous. I'm so jealous. That's good stuff. Gina Trippani from New York, New York. Good to see you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good to see you too. I'm so excited. This is a huge, huge news day. Of course, I'm sad because  I did all about Android last night, but we can talk about everything that happened today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You put it to bed last night without knowing what the morning would bring, but we all kind of knew

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that today would be a big day. Oh yeah. We rocked the show saying we know for sure that all this  stuff is going to happen tomorrow. It's probably going to be lollipop we're going to hear about all  the new nexuses. And of course it's going to happen tomorrow because we do all about Android  on Tuesdays. So the big Android news seems to always break on Wednesdays. But we get to catch  it on Twig. So that's good. And then we'll talk about it, of course, next week as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And to be honest, nothing surprising, right? Or is there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No. No. I mean, we said last night we knew pretty well it was going to be lollipop, even though there  was quite a bit of misdirection going on. The statue guy was dropping a lot of hints about  licorice. You know, there was a lady finger eating a lady finger in one of Google's videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, they really do an audition. They had it like an audition video where they were auditioning  for the next dessert. So for those of you who don't watch the show regularly and have never  heard of something called Google, you Bing users maybe don't know that Google names its versions of  Android after desserts. First one was not a dessert, right? That was just alpha.  Cupcake. Yeah, because there was alpha and beta and then it was C was cupcake was the first  release version. Donut. Donut. Eclair. Eclair. Froyo. Froyo. Gingerbread.  Honeycomb. Honeycomb, which had a short-lived, it was the tablet version, short-lived.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Honeycomb was the redheaded stepchild for sure. Ice cream sandwich. Ice cream sandwich, yeah.  Jelly bean. Kit Kat. And now we are on L. That was very sad, you two. That we knew those?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All those brain cells devoted to that. It is weird, isn't it? Here's the casting. Google did it. I  think this is really great for L. It was cute. It was cute. Lava cake. Ladyfinger. Show me sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lululemon drop. Oh, that's perfect. This is... quiet please. Casting in session.  This is hysterical.  Oreo. There can be only one L. I like the ladyfinger eating a ladyfinger.  Recursion. Google has such a great sense of humor. I just love that. Totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now I'm going to make news out of it though because last time they did Kit Kat, and I was  a little miffed as a lot of people were, where's my Kit Kat bar, that they used a brand name.  They apparently made a deal in which no money was exchanged, ah-ah, with Hershey's or Nestle's,  depending on which country, for Kit Kat. Do you think they waited to do lollipop to the last moment,  hoping that they could make a deal with what, I don't know, Laffy Taffy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know what the delay was about. Yeah, I don't know. I think they just weren't ready.  I think they simply weren't ready. They didn't have the statue. They didn't have the promo video.  The statue wasn't made.  The statue wasn't built yet. I just think that they weren't ready. They wanted to do some sort of  new launch, although it was just a blog post. It wasn't like there was an event today or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody asked me yesterday, oh Mr. Apple Fan, I bet you're not going to cover the Google event  tomorrow. And I said, well I will if there were one, but it was a press release.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Will you cover it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are you an Apple fan or an Apple enemy? I can't keep it straight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the problem. It depends who you ask.  So here's the follow-up, by the way, to the L casting.  Lickrish, did you see the red Lickrish thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Notifications, notifications, sorry. Notifications down under, notify you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Show me sweet.  He's memorizing. Oh, this is the full length one, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, okay. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I went in there and I lagged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like that lava cake has a little berry in its hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And if you don't feel like you get it in one take, which I know you will,  you just demand another one. Don't say sorry. Don't say, excuse me. Don't say, please. You say,  I want to do it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know you. I know you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you know it's L this time, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait, who's that guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait.  What is the giant sponge with coconut on it? What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What is that thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Chat room, you've got to figure that out. It's an L dessert. What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or is it MNO talking? I don't know. It's the other one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  L'Oreal. What is that? It's weird looking. It's coconut. It's a lacqueroon. What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A lacqueroon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is it? Anyway, let's continue on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Focus. Focus. Your objective is to go in there and crush these people's dreams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, next year's M. Muffins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is probably exactly what it's like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Great. This is pretty great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lollipop is here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that woman was dressed as licorice.  Right. Yeah. Lemon bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry, Mr. Ladyfinger. Who is this guy?  LMP. Lemon meringue pie. Licorice. Lemon drop. Lava cake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But who is this guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, is this Lemon Drop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, we saw Lemon Drop. Who is this guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ladoo. What the hell is a Ladoo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then there they are.  This is me. These are what Ladoos are. They look like a cross between-  It must be an Indian dessert. It's an Indian dessert.  A deep fried thing or just a meatball. I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's got to be. It's one of them.  Indian.  You know, okay. And I don't mean this to sound disparaging in any way.  But every time I go to an Indian restaurant, I skip the dessert.  Because it's like that. Often it's in a kind of a sweet liquid.  Yeah. Not a fan.  It's an acquired thing, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love Indian food, but the dessert?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, no Ladoo. It's lollipop. Doesn't mean anything, right?  There's no prize. And they couldn't do a deal with a lifesaver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think they would have been overdoing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that they probably got the message when I and others in the tech press said,  I don't want to say a brand name every time I'm talking about your version of Android.  And in fact, we did and KitKat got a lot of free publicity because of it.  Just not appropriate for a code name, I don't think. Lollipop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is the first number jump since when? This is five up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Five. So 4-2 was jelly bean. 4-4 was KitKat. So I think since ice cream...  No, ice cream sandwich was four, right? So since honeycomb was four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This I should know off the top and I do not. So brain cells not being used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Since gingerbread. Gingerbread was...  Ice cream sandwich was four. Ice cream sandwich was 403 to 44.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But honeycomb was what? Four, right? No, honeycomb was three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's the biggest jump since honeycomb. Since honeycomb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How long ago was that? 80.  Ice cream sandwich. Yeah, in 2011.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So why five? Well, it's the new look, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Material design. I like material design.  It's beautiful. I'm very excited about material design.  It's flattish. It's flattish, yep.  It supposedly runs really well on low-powered devices.  So it's getting the next one billion online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because all those gradients are expensive in CPU terms.  And the gooey stuff and the lighting effects and all that. That's expensive.  So are they... Yeah, I guess they're kind of eliminating lighting effects.  This is all very flat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, definitely very flat for sure.  And the chrome tabs are sort of first-class citizens.  Like each web process is its own process. There's a lot to L.  I don't know though. There's... I mean, there definitely are transitions.  Like things don't transport. They slide and shift.  And L also focuses on big images.  And also as all of Android kind of has this responsive design.  Where it fits perfectly on whatever size screen that you've got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's an interesting... This is the slideshow describing material.  The interesting page seven.  Users initiate change.  Changes to the interface derive their energy from user actions.  Motion that cascades from touch respects and reinforces the user.  Prime mover. This is the kind of thinking that goes into this stuff.  There's a message being passed subliminally to the user.  Like in this case, you are the... You're the god. You're the power.  Animation is choreographed on a shared stage.  Motion provides meaning. Don't just have motion for motion's sake.  It's feedback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. When you move, when you touch, when you swipe, everything should move with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When I move, you move.  Color, surface, and iconography emphasize actions.  This is... Somebody put some thought into this.  Definitely.  As if they didn't put some thought into it before.  But I mean, I like it. I like it.  So one of the things we know... In fact, I was very pleased to hear this.  They're going to put a lollipop on going all the way back to the Nexus 4.  You'll get updates on the Nexus 4 and the Nexus 5.  It's great.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This will just take three years to roll out telephones, but that's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your carrier may lollipop block you, but if you've got a Nexus, you'll get it right away.  And then I'm very excited about the Nexus 6.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Expensive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What? What are you laughing at?  No, I said expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. That I'm not so excited about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Nexus line has traditionally been the low cost.  The new Nexus 6 and the Nexus 9 powered by lollipop will come out...  Well, the Nexus 9 will be available for pre-order October 17th and will hit stores on November 3rd.  9 is a tablet. It's the successor to the Nexus 7.  It's 8.9 inches. The 16 gigabyte version, $399.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the one that upsets me.  That's the one that upsets me. I think 7 was a great size.  It's $225.  But 9 is just too big. It bothers me.  So now I guess the joke is, is my 6, would I get rid of a tablet?  Is my 6 a tablet? But no, there's quite a difference here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know who I think should feel a little ripped off are people like me who bought the Moto X,  the 2014 Moto X. Because essentially this is a 6 inch Moto X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is this the death of the small phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. In fact, isn't Google keeping the 5 around?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think, yeah, I think they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they realize that people may want a smaller phone.  I don't think the small phone is dead. But I think we're now going to see a very clear  division between 4 and I think 4.7 is kind of the sweet spot. 4.7 and 5.5 and up.  5.5 to 6. Those are going to be the two sizes.  What's the battery life on the…  Well, that's why. So the thing, I like the Moto X in many respects,  but the battery life is too short for me. It's 12 hours.  What about the…  They're claiming significant. It's a bigger, much bigger battery and they're claiming 24 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because that is the main selling point of the OnePlus One as far as I'm concerned.  Yep. Me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we'll talk about the new update. I don't know if you guys got it, but it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I got it. Yeah, my lock screen is now different from my  watch Macallan screen. My screen saver makes me very happy. I finally have… hold on a second.  Here I have Lenin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And McCartney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Marks and Engels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Aren't you lucky? Actually, I've had different pictures for some time, but…  I couldn't get it to work.  The new one gives you… it's just different. You have to turn on a custom lock screen. This  is not it actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I did all that before and it didn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I know. I'm not using it and I never have, but let me turn on the new custom lock screen.  Wait a minute. We're getting distracted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We are getting distracted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stop. I'll save that for later.  It's so easy. There's so much to talk about, but let's not throw it all at once.  They also announced a Nexus TV device, which is kind of…

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this was the one surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we didn't know about this. The Nexus Player, they call it, with remote control.  $99. Optional controller, $40.  Are there pictures of the Nexus Player? I don't see them, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I've seen them. It's just this little round thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's running Android TV. It's kind of an Ouya competitor. It'll run games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why does the remote control cost $40? That's what I don't get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Almost half… Well, not quite, but almost half the cost of the device itself.  You can use your phone to control this thing, right? You don't need this controller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although the Nexus Player has voice search. It's a lot like the Android Fire TV, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was in AT&T again this week and I said, so is that Fire selling?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute. So you get the remote control with this.  You don't get the gaming controller. This is just like Fire TV.  So this is the gaming controller for $40 because this thing…

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I don't need it. I'm glad I don't have to pay for it.  So the difference between a Nexus TV and Apple TV is what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the same difference between the Nexus, the Apple, and everything else,  which is only the Apple TV supports iTunes.  Apple TV does not allow apps, so you can't have gaming on the Apple TV either.  So I don't think Apple TV is… unless you're really in the iTunes universe,  Apple TV is the right thing for most people. This competes directly against Roku and the Fire TV.  Let me go to the Google website here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the Chromecast? I mean, is this basically the…

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, no. Chromecast is so different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It feels like the Chromecast is like a light version of this, right?  Because this is all cast ready. This all works with the Chromecast stuff.  It seems like this is the device for people who want more than the Chromecast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They demoed this stuff at I.O. and I was confused then trying to figure out what the real difference is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So look at the apps. That's interesting because that's a set worthy of Roku.  Netflix, of course, iHeartRadio, Crackle, TuneIn, Hulu Plus, YouTube,  TED, Dailymotion, Pandora.  Where are you on it?  What's… yeah, well, Twit is an Android app, so I don't know. Maybe…  What's missing on here? Plex is there? That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's got to be… I mean, all you need is a podcast app.  Amazon's missing. Amazon's missing.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a big one. So now you have to get the Fire TV if you're an Amazon streaming customer.  The Apple TV if you're an iTunes customer. That's kind of unfortunate.  I don't see Google… oh, there it is. Google Movies.  And Google, yeah, if you're a Google Movies person, you'd want this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But now that I have a smart TV, it basically does all this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want all of them, yeah.  So it's an Intel Atom processor at 1.8 GHz quad core.  802.11ac, which is nice.  HDMI out. That's how you'll hook it up to your TV.  You get the remote with the player.  And…

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Severe shortage of HDMIs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. You got to get an AV receiver. That's the only solution.  I bit that bullet a long time ago.  But that's good because it really confuses spouses.  It's a spousal confusing device.  Why can't I just turn on the TV?  Oh, and the ex-spouses too, which is handy.  At least his husband came over. He couldn't figure out…  He would turn off the TV and then the AV receiver would turn it back on.  I'm sorry, I shouldn't laugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't tell you how many times I've been with friends who've gotten the call from their significant other.  Like, how do I turn on the TV? I just want to watch Netflix.  I want to watch Netflix or whatever.  It's so true. And it's like, oh, listen, all right, this is what you do.  I know.  Turn on the media player. Like, is the light on?  I know.  Make sure the video source is set. It's a universal experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, AV receiver just makes it worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Way too much… Deriving too much pleasure from that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He said it kept turning itself back on.  I don't see HBO go on here. I don't see Showtime anywhere on here.  That's too big omissions.  I really want to see HBO go on this, but I presume that Google could make those deals.  Or I'm not sure how this works, really.  Did you guys get this from Google I.O.? Did you get one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, we didn't get one. But Jason's snagged…  They had developer kits and Jason got one of those.  So, I mean, it's the black box.  Same as this, though.  He's been using it with an early preview.  So now, this is cast ready. So if HBO go, if I can already cast from that…  Oh, okay. You're good there.  I don't need an app for that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. I don't think Showtime anywhere does Chromecast, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And for Twitter, I mean, there's got to be a Twitter app.  There is. Twittercast.  Yeah.  Twittercast. Yeah, there you go.  So you're on this.  Thanks to Mark Lane.  You just want to promote it, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'll promote it.  Twittercast. Get it, everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can promote it on the actual device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right, but you want it on the home screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's frustrating because Showtime does not have Chromecast support.  That makes me mad.  And you still have to log into Xfinity. By the way, big story. HBO let out that they are going to  end that next year that you'll start to be able to buy a subscription to HBO  that will not be tied to a cable provider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is…  Every man for himself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's great. That's the crack in the wall.  If they go through with that, it's all over. It's the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's going to be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Couldn't happen to a nicer bunch of people, the cable companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's true. We didn't talk about last week. I think it was also that the Google Fiber said  that the reason that one of the reasons problems they have in rolling out is the negotiations with  cable companies. And they get… and this is the case where Google gets a much worse deal  because they're not in cartel.  Right.  It's a horrid, horrid…

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's good to be a cartel.  Handy.  So those are the big announcements. I'm excited about the Nexus 6 because  even though it doesn't have the Moto Maker support, you can't get leather.  There's only two colors, midnight blue and snowy pearly ice or something.  Black and white. Let's just say… call it spade is spade. Black and white.  But it is a six inch screen, which I think is good. I have been using a six inch screen  on the Nokia 1520 and I think it's good. I don't think you're going to hate it. It is big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, this has been a transition for me and I've gotten used to this and this feels normal.  But here in Korea… and by the way, let's just say in Korea, the world laughed at you, Korea,  for your fablets. You were right. Everybody thought all those silly Koreans all carrying  these gigantic phones and they were way ahead. But when I put this next to a Note 4,  it looks almost the same size. But when you see someone holding a Note, it just looks so much

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  bigger. That's a design thing, I think. The key is tapering the edges and so forth and bezel size.  What I'm really thrilled about… so I wanted to love the Moto X. I loved the Moto X last year.  I thought it was the phone of the year last year despite its 720p screen and its only weak camera.  And they fixed some of those things in the Moto X but the battery life was not great.  It was a little frustrating. And I was a little disappointed because even though it looked like  they had dual ported speakers on the front, only one of them was a music speaker. The other one was  the phone speaker. So Google is putting out a Nexus 6 which is essentially a Moto X with bigger  battery life, a bigger UHD screen by the way. It's not just 1080p. It's now whatever. What is the  new thing? Oh, I just turned my flashlight on by stroking my phone.  What happened? It's easy. You just go like that and the flashlight turns on and goes, I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, things just got weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they have front dual stereo speakers which is one of the things I loved on the HTC One.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why are you not carrying your Moto right now? Battery life!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a battery life. And we'll talk about this later but the new R38 update for Cyanogen.  By the way, I am now convinced that the best version of Android is Cyanogen mod. Do you not  agree all of you? It's pretty great. Far and away. Far and away. And one of the things it does is it  takes raw images now with the camera in addition to a JPEG. And that's huge. It's going to be a  better camera. It's going to be a better camera on the Shamu Nexus 6. If I want to get a new

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  7-inch tablet because I'm going to be resistant about this 9-inch stuff and I get a Samsung 7-inch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're going to have a 6-inch phone. Well, but Leo, this is quite a difference.  Well, that's 5.5. That's 5.5. It's not 6. It's got the Cyanogens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One, I'm on the plane watching movies on this, which is better. Number two, it fits in the pocket,  so it's smaller. Number three, I can type on this easier for big documents, which is better.  I don't think the half-inch is going to make that much of a difference as to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Given that these OnePlus 1s that we're all wielding are 350 bucks and the Nexus 6 is going to be 650  bucks. Yeah, that price. Yeah. It's actually 4 gig at 700 bucks. Yeah. Twice as much. Twice as

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  much. Yeah. But it says Nexus on the back, Leo. I can't go another half-inch, you guys. This 5.5,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't do it. This 5.5 is taking me a while. I mean, listen, I love the Nexus line and  yeah, I mean, I love the front-facing speakers. I really missed out on the HTC One. That was one  of the things I loved about it. But yeah, no, I just can't do another half-inch. I was on the  subway the other day trying to type out an email and there's just some places you can't be holding  on and typing at the same time. There's just some places my thumb doesn't go. Well, that's a special

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  need though. I don't ride the subway. For little people. No, and subway riders. Right, and one-handed.  This whole thing about one-handed, which Apple guys make a big deal about. I don't really  understand it because I haven't had a one-handed phone in years. Yeah, no, I agree. I think people

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  make a bigger deal about it than we can. But there are times when it's just like, and I feel slippery  and I feel like I'm going to, I just don't feel like I can get my grip on it the way that I would  like. So the 5.5 has definitely been a push for me. I don't think I could do 6. 6 is, it is a big

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  difference. When I handle the 1520, it's big. It feels big in your hand. Your hand, it's a little  stretch. It's actually a good- Yeah, you got to wrap it. I've been using it to stretch my hand  in preparation for the Nexus 6. Nexus 6 you'll be able to order not till October 29th and it'll come  in the second week of November. So they're really cutting it tight.  It will have wireless charging. It will have, it will come, which Moto X did not with the quick  charger. That was a 30 or 40 extra on the Moto X. It will come with a 3220 milliamp hour battery.  That's about 400 milliamps hours more than the Moto X. Dual front-facing speakers, 32 or 64  gigabytes. A Snapdragon 805, also better than the Moto X. 13 megapixel rear camera. I mean,  in every respect, it's a slap in the face to anybody who bought a Moto X because for the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  price had we waited a month. But it's the same specs as the OnePlus. What's the battery size of  the OnePlus? Actually, good question. I don't remember. I think you're right. I think it's very  close. And the 13 megapixel camera is the same. You don't have dual facing speakers. You don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  have Qi charging. It's similar. And I think frankly, if you have a plus and you're happy with it,  stay with the plus. 3100. All right. 3100 milliamp. This is 3220. It's more. But one difference is  the screen. This is the new screen is ultra, as I said, ultra HD or what they call it. How much of  a power hog is that? That could be a big difference. It could mean that the bigger battery gives you  less battery. You know, we have to wait and see. Supposedly, Lollipop is also an improvement in  battery. What is the resolution of the new screen? 1440 by 2560. So it's 1440 instead of 1080. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that's the PPI is 493. I thought it was over 500 pixels per. It's a lot. Well, that's what they say  on the website is that 5.96 inches. Oh, so it's not six. It's not perfectly six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How's that? Now? How do you feel? It's 0.04 inches away from being six inches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, Gina. It's okay. That's it. Just get longer for your nails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Quad HD. You know, that's really, I mean, anything more than 300 pixels per inch is probably invisible  at a normal unless you're really near sighted. Yeah. 493 pixels per inch is pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the six plus is 5.5 inches, right? This is a 0.4 inches bigger than the six plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The six plus. What's the six plus? The iPhone six plus. Oh, the iPhone. I forgot about that.  The iPhone screen is exactly is identical to the one plus screen. In fact, I think it's the same  part. So it's five and a half inches. You have an iPhone six plus screen in your hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Is that what makes it so difficult to get scale on the one plus because they can't get

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  supply? It is now my theory that that's exactly what's been happening. That Apple has been taking  every one of these screens. And so what all one plus can do is whenever they get a batch of  screens, they put out more invites. Interesting. That's my new theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We should try to get one of those one plus guys on the show. Yeah. Because you know what? All three

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of us have settled on the one plus one as the phone to have. Let's take a break. When we come  back, I want to talk about the update that we got on one plus one, which actually puts it over the  top now as the without question king of the Android phones, in my opinion. And there are,  there's some real rivals to this, the LG G3. I mean, there's some tough rivals and  we'll have to see when the Nexus six comes out. But for now, I think we can declare a king of the  hill. Hey, a brand new sponsor want to welcome Mandrill to this week in Google. And it's just a  coinkie thing, but it turns out that Gina uses it. I do. I do. My company ThinkUp uses Mandrill to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  send all of our email and we love it. I'm so thrilled that they're a sponsor. Mandrill is

Fast, you can integrate, deliver and track and analyze everything. Look at that. The API is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's great. So you okay. So let me understand it better. I'm glad you're here because so this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  is like a mail server. Yeah, it's a huge farm of mail servers in the sky. And you basically,  there's an awesome API. It's just a very simple REST API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  want. And it sends it. So you could use it for mailing lists, but you put it in your app as a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  way for the app to have email capability. Exactly. Exactly. So on ThinkUp, you can opt into a daily  email with your ThinkUp insights and Mandrill sends that. So in your app, you say, yes, I want email.  And then when our crawler runs, it says, does this user want email? Yes. And boom, it pings Mandrill

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and that email comes through them. You send them a template to Mandrill from your MailChimp account,  or you can code your own import it with they have an API REST API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that our open rate went very low, like went from quite high, around 40%, which is very high,  to like very low after we did a redesign of one of our emails. And we realized that the reason why  is because we found out through Mandrill. And then we found out the reason why is because the email  was getting shuttled into Gmail's promotions label. Which is, you know, I mean, we were using  some language that, you know, made it sound like a promotion. But you know, and that's what's great.  We know. We knew. Yeah. And we were able to, we actually just, we rolled with it. We added tags  that showed the little promotion at the top of your Gmail inbox. And because a lot of our customers  use Gmail, but we didn't, we wouldn't have known that because of Mandrill. Mandrill's awesome.

Thank you, Mandrill, for joining the TWIT family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I had no idea Gina used it. Yeah, that's so funny. I'm in Mandrill every day. So I was,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got excited. I've used Mailchimp for years and I know it and recommend it, but I, I, this was,  the Mandrill name was new to me. So here is a great website. Thank you to our chat room,  comparing screen sizes of all of the big phones. The Nexus 5 is on the left, then the Moto X,  new 2014 one. It's always felt a little squatty to me. Now I see why there's the LG G3 right next  to it. That's a UHD screen. Our OnePlus One is kind of the one in the middle, the one that says  never settle. Samsung Galaxy Note 4. My Note 4 is coming, should be here by next week. I'll have a  review of you, of that on before you buy next Tuesday. There's the iPhone 6 Plus. See, iPhone's  bigger because of the bezel. See, and I think that's a mistake Apple made, but they have a  physical home button and so does Samsung. I am now no longer a fan of the physical home button.  Remember how much I bitched? Oh, I was going to say, you love the physical home button. You made a total turn on that.  I was so wrong. You were right. Google said, no, we want you to do on screen buttons. Actually,  I like capacitive buttons. I never liked the physical button that much because I feel like  that's something that's going to break. Both the S5 and the 6 Plus have it because they use

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  fingerprint readers or the Note 5. Right. The only advantage to the physical buttons is that  you can tell which way your phone is turned by looking at it and touching it. I find that  on Android phones that are just these flat black slabs that I search on the sides for the power  button. That's part of the reason why I love the OnePlus One is you can just tap the screen to wake  it up and not have to search for the power button. But that's the only thing about the physical buttons  that I miss. Otherwise, I think it's a much nicer design and the software can be what the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  software is without a physical button. It feels primitive. You totally won me over.  I'm not looking forward to playing with a Note 4 because of that physical button.  It's a simple thing, but I'm trying to use my phone surreptitiously in bed.  I tell you way too much about my life, don't I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it surreptitious because you're working when you should be trying to sleep?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's 4am and I'm trying to sleep. But I click the button and you can hear it go click.  If it's dead silent, you can hear it. Obviously not normally, but I want to just silently go.  There at the far right is the Nexus 6. It is the biggest. It's Shamu. I wish they had a 1520 in here  because the 1520, which is the 6-inch Lumia, is just as big. It's a nice thin phone though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really like a gray icon. With this website, you could just kill one of the phones and then  add the 1520. Can I put a 1520 in? Yeah, hit the X above one of those. There's a weird pop-up above

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it. I don't need a Nexus 5 anymore. This is a cool site. I've never seen this site.  Where do I add it? Oh, here it is. Lumia 1. Here, I've added it. Oh, you're so good.  See, it's that big. It's that big, baby. Yeah, wow.  Some of this is hard to tell because you're not holding it. The thinness of the body has a lot to  do with how big you feel it's going to be. The Nexus 6 dwarfs the iPhone 6 Plus. There's so

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  much more screen going on there. It's only half an inch, right? Because of no bezels. No bezels,  baby. Yeah, the bezel is... I didn't realize how big the bezel was on the iPhone. Yeah.  Bezels is bad. But that thing's got to be a monster in person though. I can't wait.  I'm buying it right away. It's nice that the Nexus 6 is actually six inches versus the 6 Plus  being 5.5. The numbers line up. There's something about that that makes me very happy as a coder.  I'm a little person. It's the OCD nerd in you. Yeah. It causes a lot of cognitive dissonance that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the iPhone 6 Plus is 5.5 inches. Well, that's what they said. The joke is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  oh, the iPhone 6 must have been designed by a man. It's five and a half inches,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but they called it 6 Plus. That was Kara, wasn't it? I think that was Kara Swisher.  Probably Kara. Probably. I don't know Kara. I can forget her name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dr. Rosano. That's good. That's good. October 29th, we can pre-order that. Looking forward to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can we talk about the new Android ads real quick? We talked about the last one all about Android,  but let's play just one. I find that this whole tagline and the whole thrust of the marketing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  campaign is very interesting. I think they're smart because I think that they're playing up  the fact that there's choice in the Android. They're turning that into a feature instead of  a bug. Right. Yeah, you call it fragmentation. We call it choice. Right. Exactly. But they

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  communicate that very, very effectively this time around. This particular set of promotions,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think, has been really landed. Sorry. Chad has it. Yeah, I have one. There's a few different ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a few different ones. Play all three of them so I can go to the bathroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay. Sounds great. Let's start with the bus stop. Oh yeah, I like the bus stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the best one because this tells you something. Remember, this is before we saw the Nexus 6.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ken73

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Haven't seen that one

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I love the music

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, and great music together not the same. So that's um an interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What was that create your own androidify? What was that? Yeah, that's from androidify. All of the all of these are androidify

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  characters, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was the website where you create  Yeah an android

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Be together. So let's uh, oh, yeah, this one this one is the this is the the tear jar get over to your table

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where you didn't  If you did that was a cool move  That was an ant move  And moves and guns, but they can mean everything  Their hand moves to put wings on a bicycle  Now we fly  When enough people have an and view the world changes  forever

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a little bit because of it's their think different campaign. This is it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's great

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because it leads to something new something self-driving car. That's why we need this. That's the alis ice bucket challenge and them  robots

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Graduation you're watching this right now because everyone doing the same thing won't move us forward putting underpants on your head

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Together

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow  How much they're gonna spend on this campaign this is uh, hundreds of millions of dollars you're gonna see this on a supermall  Well, google spot ads before but it was been for search we were wondering this last night, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like i've seen chrome ads on tv  But are we gonna see android ads on tv?  Like I can't I can't think of any mobile operating system that's ever had its own ad that was that it wasn't focused on a phone  There's never been an ios ad there's never been a windows phone ad, right?  But we've seen windows phone on the htc m8 and we've seen the iphone ad right like  It's it's it's so I wonder I was wondering last night, you know, are these videos targeted toward developers?  This is google's way of saying this isn't fragmentation. This is choice

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Um, no, I think it also is is what kind of phone you have. I have an android phone you hear people say that  um  But google's never really branded it heavily and and and google made up the model that stuff again  You you couldn't have that separation before as if you had a blackberry operating system  You had a blackberry phone period full stop if you had a nokia operating system. You had a nokia phone full stop  It was it was open android that changed this new model and they never really branded it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I also should point out that while previous nexus phones are clearly developer phones  Google realized with the success of the nexus 5. Maybe there's a market this nexus 6 is priced like  uh, uh  Phone phone. This is a price to make money. This is a product  Google's definitely selling this not as a develop right? It's not developer platform anymore. This is a product

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean they're calling it their reference device  In the blog post they said, you know  We understand that you can't innovate in software if you don't do it hand in hand with hardware  And that's why we're continuing our nexus. They made a very strong state declaration  We're continuing our nexus line and we're doing so through the nexus 6 and the nexus 9  I don't know. I mean our consumers. I mean there's like there's a big benefit to buying the nexus 6 unlocked for that very high price  It's unlocked and you can use the carrier that you want and you get pure android. I just don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're selling it on all the carriers. It's on verizon. It's on at&t. It's on sprint. It's on t-mobile. They didn't do that before  This is a different this is a product for them that they want to make money on also a way to suck up to the phone companies

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're okay. We're gonna stop making you look bad  Uh, we're gonna go along with the game  We're gonna charge 700 for a phone so that you can have your factor ridiculous made-up business models

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they're gonna I think what they're doing is they're selling the nexus 5  Continuing to sell the nexus 5 because there's a low cost developer phone  If you're a developer, do you really want a six inch screen? Doesn't that really?  Limb, I mean  Really? I mean your developer, but I think more than that leo. I think I think the pricing  Shamed the phone companies and shamed both of them. I agree because it told people but so does one plus one

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But but now it's not google doing it one plus one shaming it is a different matter. You can't get them  Google shaming them is a big deal. So is this i'm just asking is this google caving in to the maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've given it to the carriers. They've given it to the carriers. So maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll be honest as a developer. I want to see what my app looks like on a six inch device  Yes, because well because there's a tablet layout and there's a phone layout and this is in between is right between them, right?  So first i'm curious to see  Has android has android gonna render, you know  And is it gonna be the tablet the tablet layout or the phone layout and I want to see what that looks that looks like  It could look like the phone layout to spread out or it could look like the tablet layout to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To actually it's not of course the screen size is the resolution that you care about  Is there a device with this yes, there are

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Many devices with this 1440 resolution, but they're tablets that they're tablets. Yeah, so this is the tablet layout  Yeah, this it's got to be the tablet layout, right?  Well, we're they they did they just drop the sdk or they're going to I mean there's going to be simulators  That will show you what this looks like. You don't have to buy every device that you can develop for  But I am certainly interested to see  What it what it looks like and you know, and I also probably should do some material design updating

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So as we all should we'll do this quickly because I know most people don't have a one plus one and it's still tricky to get  one, although  Invitations are becoming much are flowing much more freely now. Yeah than they used to  The cyanogen mod is you know, we've been saying for a long time. We prefer vanilla google, right? We want the google play experience  Yeah, so i'm curious gina because you were the biggest proponent of it  Yeah, what do you think I mean cyanogen mod is is an adjustment just as touch whiz and sensor

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is it is  I love it. I love it because it gives it gives it gives me extra functionality  but I will say that some of the extra functionality does  Border on a little extra geeky and a little bit bolted on  Yes, and like I i'm okay with that because I know kind of know what i'm doing  But I I there's part of me that also feels like maybe for like a regular person the pure pure android the google experience  I shouldn't say pure android the google experience android might might be just as good if better  I mean the things that cyanogen gives me  Are very fine grain controls that like nerds like me care about but probably not everyone cares about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to hear your argument perfect example here is the quick settings, right?  So before you see the system settings  The first thing you see when you slide down on the right is the quick settings on stock android  You can't modify these on cyanogen you can  And there's a much richer set of choices  Available for you  Yes  That's that is great. Uh and and makes perfect sense  And yet it's still very much the this it's just a small addition to what is essentially the google experience  Similarly when you go in and oh and this is also there this quick bar, which is not part of the google experience  Let me go back  When you go into settings, it'll be very familiar to anybody who's used  Uh a google play experience phone unlike a samsung experience, right?  You don't have four different tabs, but they have a few things for instance. This is nice  You can choose I can't actually maybe this is now in the google experience. I can't remember choosing the home  the launcher  Um, I like the ability to choose the launcher  There's themes which you don't have obviously in google play edition  Uh, and there's a theme store so you can  Change this dramatically if you don't want to use the holo theme, which is basically and i'm sure there'll be an l theme  Gestures you've saw me do the v to turn on the flashlight  Gina loves the fact that once you've locked the phone  Or turned off the phone. You just double tap it to wake up the screen. Yeah, that's really awesome  It's a little thing  Uh, and I bet you there's a third party app that'll give you that capability. It's little things like that, but it essentially  Feels pretty much  Oh, oh and i'll tell you here's the biggest difference is these capacitive buttons are weird. So it's home  I can't even see them. They're so dim and menu home and menu  I mean google doesn't want you to have a menu button. That might be the most controversial thing on the one plus  This is this would normally be back and recent  Uh and on the on the one plus it's  Menu home and back so that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, and i'm running the google now launcher  So I get you I can switch between I get wallpapers and widgets and settings when I tap that so it's different  You can customize it  Um, you can customize it a lot  And I love that and and customization is a huge part of android and one of the biggest selling category one of the biggest selling  Categories of apps, I think only behind games  Uh, which isn't the case for ios, I just don't I just don't know  I mean look google's google's gotta create the experience that that makes sense for most users  And I just don't know if most users care enough about their phone to rearrange, you know, the tiles here  You know what I mean? Like  I mean, listen, this is this is the line that you always have to walk and consider when you're making any kind of software  Right, like there's so many different levels of users

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sienna jimana has always been aimed at at the sophisticated user, right? Absolutely, which is why we like it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I completely agree that cyanogen is is is way better. I didn't want to have to deal  With doing it myself. I love that this phone shipped with cyanogen on it  Uh, and I was just like, okay, this is fresh clean. I know i'm getting updates straight with the manufacturer  I don't want to deal with any of that that bs. I don't have enough time in my life anymore unfortunately  But but so but I love that I can buy a phone with cyanogen on it  Um, and and I yeah, I love it. I do love it and now they've added the cyanogen camera shaves camera raw

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh now that's a 16 from this phone. It's a 16 megabyte file  So every time I take a picture I use up almost 20 megabytes and you can't read the camera raw  With anything you have to import it to lightroom to read it, but it's a dng format, which is a standard format  They've also added high res music capability, which I think is great  I can now play back flak files  Recorded at 192 kilohertz  Uh 24 bit sound that's the pono players doing that the new sony walkman does that we're moving in that direction  I think the htc might do that  Um where the ability to play high quality, uh, really high quality music back

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So when does lollipop come out uh for uh android and when is it when is it likely to come out on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cyanogen they didn't say did they?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When's it likely to come out on sand like when are we gonna get oh, it's much later, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they have to then they have to get the source code and they have to modify the source code

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they basically have to rebase their work on top of lollipop. Yeah. Yeah  It's it's gonna be  Probably a while  They're defined a while  Months I I think it's gonna be months. Yeah  Yeah, I would be surprised if it happened before january 1st  But so that's kind of when the source code drops and how long you know, those guys are there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  Probably wise that was a good choice  wise

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I couldn't figure out was the little green thing. I couldn't get it to go away  So it's just always there on top of whatever you're working and I hate that. That's annoying. Yeah, I don't know  That is annoying. I'm sure there's gotta be a setting somewhere to get rid of it, but I I didn't take the time to whoa

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you see that? Whoa drag it around look at that action, but it's always there, but you can put it anywhere you want  You know, it's like the chat heads. It's like facebook's chat heads. I hate that

Transcript:  You hate it I hate chat heads

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you kind of do want it to be persistent because I have to say even on the mac i'm always  You know like digging around for the hangouts window. It's got a bar on the top. You got a bar on the bottom use them  Well, but if you click the chrome extension for hangouts  On my mac because I have multiple screens and multiple works work  Areas spaces spaces. Uh, I don't know where it is. I have to search because it pops up. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it signs me into the wrong google account and then I have  Jarvisian rant comes on and all I want to do is send a text message you guys all I want to do is send a text message

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think they think they've fixed that problem, but they haven't because that now you can in fact on chrome os you can sign into both  accounts  And without having to sign into two completely different sessions so I can switch right forth  Well, that sounds okay, but that's not the point folks. The point is I want to go tab to tab and be using different accounts  I don't want to have to change my  entire view just because my  Google plus is different from my gmail  So it doesn't really help a b  My chrome was crashing as never before so I I stopped it and it hasn't crashed since not once so I think it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a point in software development and I know because i've gotten there many times where there's a giant bug that you've been  Wrestling with for you know months and maybe sometimes years and you convince yourself that it is fixed  For your own sanity and I think I think maybe google's gotten to that point like fixed enough  It works

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's you know, the thing is it works perfectly on android  I can go into any android application go back and forth smoothly between uh users  um  Perfectly be a little stretch, but it's a lot closer if you got it to android quality in chrome, you'd be okay  But yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because the real problem is if I click on the link to google plus from in my gmail  If that opens it in the wrong account and I can't get the link over that's that's that's just one fix that and then you're on  The right track but enough of jarvis's rant

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Continue on by the way, this is the compromised lollipop. It's a lemon meringue flavored lollipop

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, let me let's let me keep going with the change all  Okay, change log continuing chrome for ios now downloads and saves files and supported applications  So google's updated chrome for ios. It's got better support for the iphone 6 and 6 plus  And now thanks to the newness that ios has it's kind of similar to the oldness that android had. Ha ha ha  When you run into a downloadable file when you're browsing browsing you can download it and then send it over  To a supported application so you could download something on your phone  On ios and send it over to drop docs or google drive for example, which is which is a nice nice upgrade  chrome 39 beta for android is now rolling out with reader mode and a couple couple other little features  This is coming out to users on google play. You have to be opted into the chrome beta  Which which is available, but these do have some tolerance for some bugs, although I do use it as my primary browser  So I recommend that if you've got some some of that tolerance  It's got some performance improvements bug fixes other tweaks  Google doesn't usually announce new features in the in the beta version  But uh, there's users have noticed a couple of new things  There's a new reader mode that kind of strips away the ui elements of chrome to let the user focus  Only on the text of the web page  And also in this release, uh is this still experimental windowed mode accessible only on the android l preview  This is this when each web each tab in chrome actually looks like its own individual  App when you're flipping through your recent recent apps or switching between processes  So chrome itself is in a process, but each web page is so that's kind of nice chrome. That's the chrome 39 beta for android  Uh latest google glass updates does notification sync a lot like android wear does  Uh, so basically this means glass gets the same  Functionality as the android wear smart smartwatches meaning that any notification that you get on your phone  You'll be able to see on your on your glass  I think this makes a lot of sense that glass and android wear is kind of syncing on android wear  I'm going to run it basically be running the same software that'll be running on your wrist  Uh that update is due to hit glass this week and you'll have to be running the latest version  Of the my glass android app. That's version 3.3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, so the uh answer is in the chat room says this  amazon, but you have to understand why eric schmidt says  Google's biggest competition is amazon. He's speaking to europe  It's a speech he gave

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In berlin earlier today. I don't know why jeff wasn't there. It seems like I don't anybody is in berlin. Jeff should be welcoming them  Uh  He wanted to make very clear that google has competition because there's some you know, I think in in europe  They're filled that people feel like they're a monopoly and they're evil  um  He says that we have a lot of competition  All over the world now, you know a lot some people suggested by do the chinese search engine absolutely  Let me find the amazon  part  Says if you're looking to buy let's see if you want the google is not a monopoly people believe it is because  If you want the news you're likely to go straight to your favorite news service build  The most widely read newspaper in europe gets 70 of its traffic directly  A little over 10 of their traffic comes from search and just under 10 comes from social sites like facebook and twitter  If you're looking to buy something perhaps a tent for camping you might go to google or bing or yahoo or quant the new french  search engine  Nice little plug there eric, but more likely you'll go directly to zelando or amazon  Last year almost a third of people looking to buy something started on  Amazon that's more than twice the number who went to  google  So he's got a good point google search is not just going and searching nowadays  He says our biggest search competitor is amazon people don't think of amazon as search  But if you're looking for something to buy you're more often than not looking for it on amazon  And a google killer is almost inevitable somewhere  Someone in a garage is gunning for us says eric schmidt. I know  Because not long ago we were in that garage change comes from where you least expect it  The next google won't do what google does just as google didn't do what aol did  Inventions are always dynamic and the resulting upheavals should make us confident that the future won't be static a little self-serving  You know, it's clear who the the intended  But it's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've written an essay about the german problem. I'm trying to place in a certain german newspaper  They're taking forever to get back to me  We shall see I mean it's not wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no not at all  Uh ireland is finally considering closing the tax loophole that have made google and apple  Uh cash rich in europe

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Uh, they remember that's the job of government to do that not the job of the companies to take advantage of it and  And it's a fine thing that they do it. It's how they powered the irish miracle

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would guess is low corporate tax rates and you know, um  Companies took advantage of it. Well, the tax rate's gonna stay low

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the difference is that you could and i'm gonna get this messed up, but you could take certain assets and attribute them to  a  irish subsidiary  Than somewhere else that had no taxes. So thus bermuda. It's the so-called double irish. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  um  So we'll see I mean  It is true that uh google to take advantage of this created a dublin headquarters  It's uh, the biggest google office outside the u.s with more than 2500 people a dublin-based subsidiary for google  Generates revenue mostly from online advertising then pays that money in royalties  To a separate google unit that's registered in ireland, but is resident in bermuda  But adobe and yahoo and apple all do the same thing

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The truth is the irish miracle kind of is a bust, right? I mean it ireland did very well and grew very fast  but has now uh slumped a little bit I think  And of course, there's a lot of pressure from the u.s and elsewhere the european commission too  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  To change their tax. That's how this should happen should happen through lawmakers and diplomats

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Starbucks has it starbucks uses the netherlands

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The double dutch right the double dutch

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right  So i'm sure google's got its attorneys looking for a new loophole as does everybody else  Google has removed 490. Oh, this might be a number

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's not we kind of did the last week. Anyway, so yeah. All right 498 000 urls have been removed under european law

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually 498 000 urls were requested to be removed a little bit less than half 41.8 were removed  And now tokyo wants to do the same thing a japanese man spreads. That's the problem with this

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, this this spreads. So the right to be forgotten is now spread to japan and the  the  Blastung schutzrecht has spread to become the spanish link tax and these games are dangerous. You're gonna have to learn some japanese jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tokyo district court on thursday issued an injunction ordering google to remove  some internet search results about a japanese man that are considered to be  violating his privacy  He felt well, maybe this is legit he felt that his life was endangered  By the results that came up when his name was entered in a google search  So, you know, I they've been kind of closed mouth about what the actual circumstances were because to protect his privacy  So it's hard for us to judge that  google's chromecast is number one  At 35 bucks i'm not surprised the number one connected  Device according to a report from app. Annie, which is pretty reliable. We've trusted them before they analyze the top apps associated  with connected devices on itunes and google play  The chromecast app number one in downloads followed by fitbit direct tv hpe print kodak  Square register gopro atnt universe uverse dish anywhere and hp's all-in-one printer remote  Karner group says there will be 26 billion connected devices globally by 2020  So the fitbit comes behind the chromecast interesting chromecast number one then fitbit then direct tv by

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is quite an assortment of  Devices here. You've got the health tracker the streamer the square register  I'm surprised that there's more red square registers out there than go pros. Although the register is free

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The gopro app is free once you have a gopro about the dongles free. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  right, right  So the chromecast is 35 fitbit's 99. I think I guess that makes sense  This doesn't feel a little bit like apple star and just though

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you see the um, we talked about this on windows weekly and I know I made fun of it  But microsoft research has uh released an app  That will let you type on your moto  360 or other android wear watch. It's a little bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's so newton. It's so newton

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what the kids say. I mean it felt like the story was supposed to be that msr was  Collaborate not collaborating with google but developing on android  But the real story is why would anybody want this? Well, but it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, okay  and you know it actually is it's not easily installed and blah blah blah, but  I think it is kind of interesting that microsoft is even doing something for an android watch. That's kind of what

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is the new microsoft research, which is you know, it's a really cool part of microsoft that kind of does their own thing  Um, but it didn't feel like that was a story  But then it was like why what what is this and it feels like google could make that app, right?  I mean google's got that the handwriting recognition and translate already. It just it it seemed like just a very weird

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They maybe didn't know how to use the android wear or something and

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well it's another story though is that is that is that old people don't like talking to search  so

He said it's silly because you know the lidar has to be  You have to map the neighborhood before you can drive it and stuff so the uh tesla's starting to look into  The idea of actually  reading signs  So also, uh this I will never use  on the d  Using a system of 12 sensors around the car when you press this turn signal  It then looks at the traffic  Checks your blind spot and then actually changes lanes.

Transcript:  Many not most many cars ford has the bliss system will will warn you if there's somebody in your blind spot  That's good. That's good. My car blinks and  Uh, but the idea that the car you would just all you have to do is flip the is in signal your intent to change  Lanes and the car would actually do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do I do the good one  So this no no  So this actually got released a couple of weeks ago somehow it escaped the change log  Uh, but but I wanted to announce it for a special reason. I love this and I know why go ahead  Yeah, google google plus added the ability to add interactive polls to your posts  So you can ask your followers any question a multiple choice question and get them to vote  I use social media for this all the time and I love that. This is a structure  Something I loved about wave rest in peace  So i'm really excited to see this show up in google plus and the reason why I brought it up is because we  At all about android ron richards and jason howell and myself switched over to google plus g plus polls for the android arena  Which is the segment of our show where we each demo an app that we really like on android and then our listeners and watchers  Vote on which one is the best?  Uh, so if you go to my google plus it's plus.google.com  Plus jeanette rapani you can see that i've got the latest android arena  poll uh posted there and you can vote on it and you can see how polls work what's really nice about these polls is  That when you reshare them  The votes don't get forked. So like right now on google plus if you reshare somebody's post the comment threads get forked  You know like your share will have a separate  In the original post on on the polls the votes that the numbers all you know, they're all the same  Right, so if I reshare it I have the same numbers  Yeah, which is really really nice  And of course all the votes have names attached to them and google plus accounts attached to them which helps deal with you know  uh  Scripts that try to you know, dupe the stats or whatever. Uh, so yeah really really nicely done and uh, cool  Cool way to use polls. So we have some really good apps in the arena last night, too. So uh, I know and we didn't  Yeah, so  Well, we didn't attach names to what they are  Uh, but but mine is winning. Let's see. Yay, so i'm pretty i'm pretty happy about it  We've already gotten a huge response much bigger response to this poll than we do on our normal  Our regular straw poll app so pretty pretty happy with this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I like it a lot better and it's in of course in the in the social community, which is really and i've been using it  I used it  because I took pictures with my one plus my iphone and uh  I can't remember what the other phone was and asked people  To give me a uh a rating on which phone they thought was the best and I got  2242 votes, which I don't think I would have gotten anywhere else. Wow. Yeah, so that's really good. Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a tremendous response and an unusual response

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The moto x1 and then the one plus one and the iphone 6 the the laggard in the bunch which kind of surprises me

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ah, that's gonna bring the haters out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it is google plus I guess you know, that's uh  Maybe maybe part of the reason one plus was really winning for a while and then people people uh,  Voted chimed in for the moto x  Um and again lots of comments too on it was really this poll is great

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's nice is that yeah people can vote but then they can also discuss which is which is nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I really like that. I'm gonna use more of that more as well. Yeah  Polls now and now in google plus jeff jarvis your number of the week

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  well, um  combination year so google has announced it's going to bring the same day delivery now to  Uh boston dc in chicago with manhattan and la following and here's the interesting thing  There they have their own version of prime 95 dollars a year for same day delivery

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Speaking of competing with amazon. This is google. This is google shopping express. I thought it was in manhattan  I remember trying this out in manhattan. Um  What because they have like a  Trial period there for a while and it was great  It doesn't work in brooklyn and then they said brooklyn was to come but yeah, this is clearly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's really interesting  We don't have that in petaluma obviously it has to be a metro area, I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's neat the the the choices were a little bit  I should say a lot more limited than I mean it was basically like big prime anywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But same day means that you have to have a depot, you know, you have to have a place to drive  They don't bring it to your house. Do they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or do they I think I think if you live if you live in manhattan, they would bring it to your house. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The difference models here is I think that you know amazon has its own fulfillment  google fulfills out of existing right brands ebay  Wants to enable small stores to do the same thing eventually

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's really the shopping express rebranded but they're not delivering stuff from the google store play store  Because that would be kind of limited. This is from the third party partners. Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There are drivers going around and assembling or order a target and bringing it to you. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So by the way, the other number is it's it's seven o'clock. So it's dawn in korea. Look at that. Wow, that's beautiful

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is can you see kim jong-il from there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh  It'll be a trick to see eel yields under the ground. It is news here when he no one's seen kim jong-un either

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I might point out

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He was seeing yesterday and it makes news here lord knows yeah, where was he seen hobbling somewhere? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he's alive. Anyway, going to get some mac and cheese perhaps  So I owe an apology to one of our stalwart chatters who asked me about 80 times yesterday to install  A program called system panel and I said no, I don't like task managers. I don't think they're a good idea  But I finally gave in there are two versions. This is the free version system panel  Light and they also have a dollar 99  Uh pro version which might be uh, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Bright, sorry, go ahead. No, it's sort of the bright green. Sorry. Yeah, it is bright

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what it does is really  Actually kind of usual useful I don't recommend this is not a task killer  We know that that's not recommended anymore and you don't need one of those and a lot of times programs like this will  Chew up battery life. So this is really more a diagnostic tool for those times when you're wondering what's running in the background?  What's eating the cpu? What's eating my battery and you can get very granular information  Which you can get somewhat from the app manager, but in a much nicer format  From this system panel it's called and uh, this is a plot over and by the way it does history  So you can see what's been using the cpu over the last week or month or whatever  Very handy if something is eating your battery life  For instance, I mean one of the problems with the battery monitors is it'll you know, most of the time tell you well  It's android services. But what does that mean? Really? What is it?  That's really using the battery life so I can see which applications are active on my one plus  But which applications also are running in the background as services?  And I can see over time which is using how much memory how much cpu how much battery life?  It's really I wouldn't say something you want to have all the time running but as a diagnostic tool  Uh, very handy. I was surprised to see that for instance  Even though i've never even launched it once the amazon kindle app was running all the time in the background  On my phone, so I just uninstalled it actually uninstalled a half dozen apps that I don't use like glimpse  But that seemed to be using cpu and memory all the time on my phone. So  There's a free light version. The the pro version has some interesting  Things that you can for instance, uh pack up applications uninstall them and reinstall them  uh  In one lump  But some interesting additional features. It's called system panel  One word system panel app and the tax task manager from next app  And I don't remember the name of the chatter who was asking  Me about it, but thank you for pushing pushing through two dollars and 99 cents. Not one dollar two dollars and 99 cents  Uh, that's it for this week in google for this week  Thank you so much. Jeff Jarvis for taking the time to join us from korea  Are you done?
