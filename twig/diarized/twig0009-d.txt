On the line, on the line with us, Jeff Jarvis, the great man at BuzzMachine.com.  Hey, Jeff, how are you today?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Hey there, Leo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Good to see you.  Also here, the great Gina Trapani from SmarterWear.org.  Hi, Gina.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Hi, howdy.  How's it going?  Howdy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I guess you're Californian.  You could say howdy.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm trying out my cowgirl greeting today.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That was the funny thing when we first moved to California.  I was an Easterner like Jeff from, I grew up in Rhode Island and I was in 10th grade.  We moved to California in 1971.  People said, howdy.  And I thought, well, that's strange.  It was like a John Wayne movie, but they met it.  They met it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, howdy, everybody.  It's my way of never having to say somebody's name.  That's true.  Because you have that hi, dot, dot, dot.  Is that Leo, Larry?  No, you're right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're Larry.  And as I get older, I appreciate those tricks more and more.  So today we're talking about Google.  We're hoping that, oh boy, Siva will join us.  I practiced his last name over and over.  He did.  Yeah, I still don't have it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Just play the MP3 every time you have to say it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Siva Vaidyanathan will join us in a little bit.  He's an expert on the Google-ization of everything.  In fact, that's the name of his website, but also on the Google Book Deal.  And there is news with the Google Book Deal, which we'll hold off on until such time as  we get Siva on the line.  Meanwhile, there are plenty of other things to talk about.  Let's talk about SideWiki.  Because you and Gina Trapani and Jeff Jarvis both had pretty strong opinions about this.  But I tried it out immediately and observed, first of all, that it ain't a Wiki.  In fact, it feels very 2002.  The idea is you go to a website.  First, you have to install the Google toolbar for it to work, which I hesitated to do, but  I thought, well, I'll try it.  Then you go to a website and you get a little icon and you can click it.  A sidebar opens and now you can put a comment.  You can either select some text and comment on that text or comment on the page as a whole.  When you visit a page that has a SideWiki comment, you see that little icon, you can  open it up.  What was your initial reaction to this, Gina, when you first saw it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I thought it was odd, but I thought it was fine.  It isn't a Wiki.  I thought that that was a strange choice of name.  But I thought about every single attempt that Google's made to host content like Google  Null and even the Wiki-like features in search results.  And they were never very successful.  Blogger, I think, is the only thing that they own that's been successful at user generated  content.  That's because it was before they acquired it.  So I was just kind of like, meh about it.  I don't have the Google toolbar installed.  I hear the word toolbar and I want to run the other way, even though it's a Google product  and it's probably pretty good.  I just thought to myself, I don't really care about this.  Probably the people who are reading my website aren't going to care about it or have the  toolbar installed either.  So I didn't think it was that big a deal.  Jeff has a lot to say about this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So that's the funny thing.  You can't do it in Chrome.  I presume you're a Chrome user most of the time.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I use Chrome and I use Firefox.  You can't do it in Chrome, although it's going to be built into Chrome eventually, they said.  It will be built into Chrome though.  So that's interesting.  There are, and this is actually one of my tips for the week.  There is a bookmarklet that you can use to view comments on a page.  You can't enter comments, but you can view them.  So if I'm just curious about what people are saying about my site, I can do that.  I guess I feel like conversations happen about my website in so many different places on  Twitter and Facebook and FriendFeed that it didn't bug me too much.  The fact that it comes in on the side and shows on your site is a little aggressive  and strange.  I'll let Jeff explain what he thinks that they should do, which I actually agree with  wholeheartedly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So what did you think, Jeff?  You wrote a whole post on it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Danger, danger, Will Robinson.  I saw Google's intent, I think, was not bad.  It was to find a way for people to annotate sites and to go on a given site and say, this  is a scam or this is a good company or whatever.  And that sounds good, but they didn't think it through, I believe.  And they didn't ask themselves whether it was evil and holding to their mission.  A few problems.  First, for those of us who do have comments, it bifurcates the comments and thus the community.  It separates people.  You should do the opposite.  So I have comments on my blog and people can now have comments along the side on this Google  thing.  Second, it allows people to come in and leave spam.  Granted, Google will probably have algorithms to deal with that, but also trolls and hate  speech and grudges and unfair competition and all kinds of things people can now associate  with sites.  And no algorithm is going to be able to figure all that out.  But we, the site owner, has no control over it.  So those of us who say that we care about our conversations and communities, we can't  do anything.  Now, people gave me some crap properly because I said, oh, Jarvis says newspapers should  give up control and here he wants control.  Well, it's not about control then.  It's about responsibility.  And I can't exercise responsibility over those comments that are at the side of my blog.  Third, if they're not putting ads on them, if they ever did, they'll be in deep doo-doo.  There was a case of something called Gator about eight years ago that put up ads on top  of people's websites and the publishers sued and won.  And so this idea of being able to hijack the knowledge of what's on my site and add something  to it is a problem.  So those were all the problems I presented one day.  The next day I came back and suggested that the problem in the end was Google thought  too small.  It wanted to create another conversation space.  Well, we got plenty of conversation spaces.  The internet is the conversation space.  And if Google thought like Google, if dare I say this, if they'd asked what would Google  do, they would, I think, have said, can we find a way to better organize that conversation  space?  And as they want to organize the world's knowledge.  And I think that would be by not creating a means to put content on Google in a centralized  world.  They should be, what they were doing was hurting the edge and centralizing.  They were going away from the cloud and back down to the ground.  And that's not very Google.  If instead they turned out strictly an API that said, here's a means of gathering comments,  not only on your blog, but elsewhere about you and put them together with some sense  in that process, I'd suggest they probably should buy Techarati and put them out of their  misery and organize the conversation on the web.  And that'd be useful.  But what they've done instead is they've tried to centralize the conversation on the web.  And that's dangerous.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, almost in a way, decentralize it because it's attached to each page.  I'm thinking if they had something like Techarati or FriendFeed where the discussion was, you  could go, but this is going to be a problem anyway, because I look at my comments, they're  spread out everywhere.  They're on Twitter.  They're on FriendFeed.  They're spread out anyway.  I use, and a lot of people are using Disqus or I use JSKits Echo to kind of re-aggregate  those back into the website.  Because Google did put an API on SideWiki, there's no reason those tools couldn't be  enhanced to include SideWiki stuff as well.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But all you get is SideWiki then, and you don't get all that other stuff that you want.  Somebody said in reaction to what I was saying, well Jarvis, a conversation is already fractured.  And I said, well, I think it's a bad choice of words because that implies that it's broken.  No, the conversation is distributed.  That's the way it's meant to be.  Google should be looking on top of that in a meta way and figuring out how to add value  to that.  Instead, very old media, they tried to extract pieces of that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So it sounds like, I mean, it sounds like the fear is that Google is hosting these comments  and because they're so ubiquitous and they have such control over rank and, you know,  your comments show up on your Google profile, for example.  So comments you make in SideWiki show up on your Google profile.  Like that this is the part that, this is the part that scares me a little bit.  I was like, why is Google hosting content, you know, when other startups come up like  Facebook and Twitter where people are talking about my site, I don't have as much of a  problem with it.  But it's like when Google pushes this commenting system into their toolbar, which apparently  has millions of users, this is the part that gets a little scary.  It feels like now they're trying to host conversations or take host conversations away from my site  when typically their strategy has always been to give you access to other web pages.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, you raise a really good point, Jeff, as well.  I mean, what if people put crap in there?  How do I control that?  I can't really, right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I mean, no one's going to know the troll who's after you.  You know, you could have someone who's stalking you.  I do.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I have plenty of people who look for wherever I am and put, you know, say Leo's a jerk or  the equivalent.  All that happens all the time and I have no control over that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So if you're I'm sorry, go ahead, Jeff.  Oh, go ahead.  I was going to say, I mean, there are some there are some things, right?  So if you claim ownership of your site through Google Webmaster Tools, if you make a comment  on your site, you will be recognized as the site owner.  So that's one thing.  And you can report or vote down comments.  You can report abuse.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I do like the karma stuff.  I think that that's kind of cool.  So in fact, it's weird because people you get a page of comments and then it says if  you want to see the less interesting comments, press this arrow and you get voted down comments.  Right.  I don't it feels like a parasite, to be honest with you.  It feels like, you know, a limpid stuck on the side of my website.  So if I register with Google for these Webmaster Tools, I can then delete comments I don't like,

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Gina.  No, you can't delete comments.  You can.  You are merely like I think somehow they notate that you are the owner of the site in the  con in the comments.  I believe that it's highlighted.  I think Danny Sullivan wrote this up.  I haven't actually I haven't actually tried it yet.  I feel bad actually commenting on this.  I don't even really care about Sidewiki very much because I'm probably I don't care.  I don't want it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But at the same time, I'm stuck with it.  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So.  Well, right.  Right.  And I believe that most I think you claim your site in order to set up Google Analytics.  This is something that most most website owners probably have already done anyway.  So so so you know, you can't delete comments, but I think you can vote them down and I think  you can report abuse of what you think is a troll.  But you know, like Jeff says, you know, only you really have the history and know the trolls,  the people that are that are harassing you and just, you know, giving you a hard time  for no good reason.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What's funny is right now it seems to be down because I put when I when they I tried it  out, I put a comment on my blog.  Actually was kind of fun.  It was a meta comment on my blog about the history of my blog.  You know, here's what you're going to get.  So it's kind of a fun little meta comment.  But now it's not even showing.  Right.  I'm not getting it either.  I think he's down.  So thank you, Google.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's the Gmail.  Maybe they reconsidered already.  Oh, there it is.  No, it's not.  Oh, there it is.  No, it's working now.  Is it?  I think one of the best comments, the two best comments I saw one was from a blog called  Stuntbox that said that this showed a failure of empathy.  They just didn't sit down and put themselves in the shoes of others and say, how are they  going to how is this going to affect them?  And that's and I think Google forgets how big they are.  My response to that, that gracious metaphor was the less gracious one.  I said that Google probably thinks of itself as snuffle up against.  Oh, I'm just big.  And they don't realize when they want to kill a fly, they can put their fist through the  wall.  And and they've got to realize that now.  And it's a problem of size to just not the company operates.  The other comment, though, I like the gaming comfort was yours, Gina.  Your tweet on it said.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That I thought Sidewiki would go the way of Google, which means that you'll never hear  about it again.  I think it's probably true.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're the ones who are talking about it.  You know, and that that's in Google's defense.  They have the labs and they have a lot of things in the labs.  And I think that's the whole idea is that, well, you know, we can try out all sorts of  things and we're not invested in any of them.  And but this does this does change the ecology of it.  And you're right. It's not they're not snuffle up.  I guess they have they carry a lot of weight.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, it's interesting. I defend the Google beta culture, the throw it up against the  wall to see what's there.  And I think that's exactly right.  But I think they've got to find the way to do caveats and the way to put something like  this out, I think, is to ask us, is this a good idea?  What are the dangers here? What are the benefits here?  And to enable that conversation.  And that's kind of not what happened.  They just said, oh, look, it's wonderful.  You're welcome.  And a lot of us look like a gift horse in the mouth.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think we broke it.  It's not working. I can't get it to load.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Jeff, if if Google had launches as an API only with a WordPress plug in demonstration  that you could have tried on your site in line on your site first, would you have felt  differently if they hadn't gotten the toolbar involved?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yes, I think so.  I think that association with when somebody a new user comes in, uses Chrome, has no  idea that this is some separate thing.  They think it's part of the site I'm looking at.  That's a danger. One.  Two, the fact that Google is trying to host these things.  It's the same problem we discussed last show, Gina, when you asked about why people are  concerned about Google Book Search and my answer, right or wrong, I wish we had Siva  here to talk with, but was that that part of the problem here is Google wasn't just  pointing to the content, they were hosting the content.  They were drawing the content away from elsewhere in this case.  And I think that's a danger, too.  So, yes, a pure API that went beyond just what's in these comments, but also drew in  other comments from elsewhere, I think would be viable.  And something's, by the way, going on at Tech Narate.  Bob Wyman from Google sent me an email this morning and I just looked at their blog.  Their API is going to go out out down for six to eight weeks in October.  Whoa. On purpose.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What on purpose?  What's the point?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They're doing the next new version.  Now, why you have to take it down for eight weeks?  Who knows? And I think some folks are guessing maybe there's yet another strategy  coming for Tech Narate. I have no idea.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So interesting.  Somebody in our FriendFeed conversation pointed out, I guess, Le Lapin, that it's  like something called Dego.  There are many, many services that do something similar, allow you to annotate a page.  Yeah. But it's not because it's not Google.  They it's not it doesn't have the same import.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like because Google has so much control over what happens with your site.  Right. You know, because because they are the point of entry for such a large percentage  of your site's visitors, it's like the idea of them hosting content, meta content about  the site that anybody can add to is a little freaky.  You know, a small startup, you know, a separate third party is not as scary as Google  hosting this kind of content. And, you know, and are these comments ever going to affect  search result ranking at some point and that kind of thing?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That they will. Yeah, because any data that Google can get about a site, especially again,  not a blog with comments, if it's if it's trying to understand, is this site a spam site  or a good site for working at home money?  You know, there's a scam going on right now that makes it look as if you're going to work  for Google when you work from home.  Right. You have to do is type a lot.  And so that's out there.  So if people of goodwill came along and warned their neighbors that this is a spam, a  scam and spam, then I think that's the good side of what Google's doing.  But and then they would use that in their search results.  That's the good side. But there's a huge bad side here and people can affect each other.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, here's a good thing that Google did this week.  They announced that Internet Explorer would have a new Google frame that you could  actually put Chrome inside IE.  Let me ask the developer. What does this mean, Gina?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, my God. I just love this story.  I love the story. So, you know, it's so funny, Adam and I, Adam, Pash and I from Lifehacker,  we were sitting next to one another at the Twitter commons this week.  And he says, oh, look, you know, there's Chrome frame and IE.  And I said, I don't understand why.  Why would you do this? Well, you know, Google Wave, a big batch of invitations to Google  Wave is going out this week on Wednesday or Thursday.  I believe it's October 1st.  And, you know, the impetus behind Google Chrome frame, which embeds Chrome's technology  inside of Internet Explorer is basically the Google Wave team said, we're done.  We're done trying to get Wave to work in Internet Explorer.  We can't do it. We've spent hours and hours and hours.  We can't do it. It doesn't have HTML5.  It can't handle the JavaScript.  We you know, there are only so many of us and Google Wave has lots of issues to work out.  So these engineers need to be working out bugs in modern browsers.  And they basically said Internet Explorer just isn't good enough.  If you want to use Wave and Internet Explorer, you're going to have to install this Chrome frame.  And so Internet Explorer users who want to use Wave will go to Wave and they'll get a  little pop up that says either install Chrome frame or switch to Firefox, Chrome or Safari,  a browser that can handle Wave.  Essentially, they're basically saying our web app is just too good for your browser,  which I got to tell you, I feel so bad for the IE folks.  I mean, being one of the IE developers, that's just a slap in the face.  You don't want to hear something like that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, don't you think they kind of know?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, they've got to know.  Even IE8 doesn't have.  I mean, these are emerging web technologies, HTML5 and the rest.  They can make a good case.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They could say, look, we're not going to support HTML5 yet.  We're the big guy. We're the mainstream.  We got to.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They could. They could.  But you know what I kind of love is that Google made the code, which pops up this little  dialogue that says you have to install Google Chrome Frame.  This is open.  So there's kind of all these web developers that were like, yay, we don't have to support IE anymore.  We can just pop this thing up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So when you come to a page, the page can say, use Chrome to display this, please.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, right. The page can say, please.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is that seamless for the user?  The user doesn't know that happened?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, no, no.  This is it adds a whole other step.  You get this pop up that says, please install Chrome Frame and you have to click it and you have to install it.  Now, this is a browser add on.  So somebody that's like an IT lockdown, you know, someone who's on a corporate computer,  then they can install stuff.  They're kind of screwed.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So, yeah, nobody's going to know no website.  Lifehacker wouldn't do this.  SmarterWear wouldn't do this.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, a website that wants to hit the audience without without adding that extra step.  I mean, this is the thing that I think is just so bold.  I mean, they're adding a major extra step to a huge percentage of Internet users for people to use.  Wave, it's kind of it's kind of amazing.  People are saying this is the way that Google is going to, you know, be the IE killer, that this is this is going to be the impetus for people to install Chrome.  You know, I don't know if that's true.  Yeah. It'd be interesting to see.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Waves are going to be small for a long time, isn't it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm sorry?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Waves going to be small for a long time, isn't it, before it itself gets enough critical mass to force mortals?  If if if, you know, people like Anil Dash and Adrian Halabadi say waves too much for them,  then I think the Obama becomes a force to get Chrome to grow.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think that's absolutely true.  The time that it takes for regular people to adopt wave, regular people who use Internet Explorer,  is probably just enough time for Microsoft to be able to support it natively.  But, you know, in the beginning, it's going to be a small group of users, many of whom are probably using Firefox or Chrome already.  So I don't think it's going to be that big a deal.  But I still thought it was quite a public slap in the face for the wave team.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  My vision of this is that you see a little tiny Sergey head popping out of Steve Ballmer's belly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Like alien.  I don't know if I like this.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, the vision of Steve Ballmer's belly is enough right there.  You don't need Sergey's head for it to be scary.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Gina and I waved at each other because I finally got from a friendly Googler.  I got a wave. I got my own wave.  Hey, how did you do that?  Never mind. No, somebody who listens to this show very kindly.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I figure all my complaining about Sidewiki this week just doomed me to get a wave invite.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's it, Jeff. You're out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So Gina, so I tried to chat with Gina.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm logging on right now.  We have to be on at the same time. Is that the key?  Yeah, I mean, you can.  It can be like email. It can be asynchronous.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But if you want to have sync.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, but here we are.  So I responded to you two earlier in the day.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  She said the trick is we have to both be on the same time to chat.  I was at the Twitter conference.  So things were busy. We should wave during Twig and screencast it.  All right. There's wave.  There's me and Gina. It's our little wave.  And I know nobody.  This is part of the problem.  If you don't know anybody in wave, there's nobody to really talk to.  There's some fun things in here. Oh, look, she's typing.  We can even see your type in real time.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Stay on Facebook before old folks could get in.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Exactly.  I said, oh, here I am.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And nobody knew me.  Now, how do you like it now that you're playing with it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I like it. It's still very unstable.  It's especially in Firefox, which is my primary browser.  I actually this got me to install Chrome on my Mac, which I haven't done up until now.  But I do. I do like it.  It's got lots of potential,  but still not quite stable enough for me to be logged in all the time.  I'm logging in a little more now because I know Leo and I know a couple of other people.  So it's going to be a matter of stability and knowing enough context,  you know, context for it to matter.  Oh, look at it. So Leo is editing. Nice.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, once once I get on, can we use wave to do the show run down and publish from there?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I think we could.  I think I'd like to try it.  I mean, it's, you know, my it's my hope to run a wave server, third party server,  because then you can you can invite people into it.  You can have with one show, you could have multiple, multiple messages around it.  And it would be kind of fun to try it.  I have to say, though, I'm with I'm with Anil.  I I don't know really what to do with it.  It's there. It's working.  You can make polls.  You can have, you know, there's all sorts of bots and stuff you can add to it.  And it's it's cool.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  One cool feature is that if I drop a if I type an address into a wavelet,  I can add a Google map, you know, just highlight it and add a map.  And then if you and I are looking at the wave at the same time  and I start panning and zooming on that map, you see the panning and zooming as it happens.  So that's kind of cool.  Let's try that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Sixteen hundred. Let's see here.  I'm going to type in sixteen hundred.  Pennsylvania.  Avenue, Washington.  I think it's allowed that I know I think it'll be blacked out, won't it?  Let's see. Let's see.  Let's see what we get.  So does it automatically do it or do I have to put a plug in?  Oh, see, it didn't do anything.  Maybe I have to put a plug in or something to have it do that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, I can't find the map.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Say it's a map address.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  There are little bots and stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  There's a there's a map point thing somewhere.  G plus. No.  Well, where did it go?  Oh, I just got that.  I just got the error message.  All the error messages are from the Joss Whedon show Firefly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, yes, they are.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So the error message is everything's shiny, Captain, not to fret.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I love that.  I love that.  It just shows they're total geeks, you know?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now, I don't know who else is in here.  I also there are some rendering issues on Firefox and and so forth, but.  I just I don't know what else is going on, so it's it's interesting.  It doesn't it doesn't crash a lot.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  If you if you stay, I just crashed me again.  Yeah, see, I crash a lot.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Just frequently.  And and the the map is the right brothers.  We're three feet off the ground.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It really is kind of like that.  And the map button is like nowhere to be found.  Also, they're obviously they're actively working on this.  So things move and change.  Oh, wave map. Here we go.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, it's wave map. All right.  Let me go back to our ways to this wave.  This is our wave.  No, that's a different wave.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Where's my side? Yeah.  So I just added you to a wave.  A new wave. Yeah, a new wave.  Sorry about that, which I'm looking at a map of Australia,  which is what it defaults to because the Google Wave team is based in Australia.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now, OK.  Do you see in your inbox?  It's my inbox.  At the bottom, presumably, is the newest thing.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Should show up at the top or at the top.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Welcome to the wave.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's just I think the title is ASDF.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There it is. I see it now.  All right. And there's the plug in.  It's loading and there's the map.  That's neat. Oh, that's cool.  And so when you when you do something to the map, I see it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes. Actually trying to.  Load it here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, if you know if you know exactly what you're doing  and you constrain it, the demo is quite entertaining.  However, if you're just messing around, it's kind of it doesn't.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not a smooth.  It's not a smooth user experience.  I mean, they they they launched this for developers to build bots  to have things ready for it.  But but really, this is not a user preview.  Now, I don't know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A hundred thousand people are going to be waving in about three or four days.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  So I don't know.  Hopefully, I don't know if there'll be a new bill that they're going to release,  if it's going to be a new server,  because this is this is the developer sandbox that we're on right now.  But it'll be interesting to see. It's going to be exciting day Wednesday.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right. We're going to talk more about Google.  Gina Tripani is here from SmarterWear.org.  Her tip of the week coming up.  Jeff's number of the week in just a bit, my tool of the week.  And I regret to report Siva will not be joining us.  He had an emergency and cannot make it today, but that's fine.  We'll get him on another time.  There is news of the Google Book deal and we'll get that in for you.  But I want to briefly mention our friends at audible.com.  We know Jeff loves Audible because they've got his book in there.  And my books came out before there were audio books.  In fact, I think my books came out before there was paper.  Stone tablets. Stone tablets. Yeah.  So there is no there are no audiobooks of my stuff.  Audible podcast dot com slash twig is the place to go, though.

These are this is better than your mommy reading to you.  This is this is professional actors who are just brilliant.  Or they're Jeff Jarvis.  If you if you listen to what would Google do?  Sometimes they use the author and a lot of times the author has an insight into it that really,  really brings it to life.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So I had to put two producers on me because I speak too damn fast.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's all they were saying to me when I read.  I read a short story and they kept saying slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down.  Audible podcast dot com slash twig.  Try it right now.  Your first book is free.  Great way to keep up.  If you're in the car, if you're at the gym, wherever you can't hold a book,  you can read a book.  Thanks to audible.  We really love them and we hope you'll enjoy them.  Audible podcast dot com slash twig.  Google had another outage Gmail out again and oh Malik took this opportunity to say,  this shows you you'll never this these online things will never work.  The cloud is dead.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I feel like this is deja vu.  Yeah, we just had this conversation.  Yeah, we're going to have this conversation a lot.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, the cloud will never be perfect.  But how often does your corporate email go down?  I mean, email goes down.  That's websites go down.  Servers go down.  I think you responded, didn't you, Jeff, to to oh Malik?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, I didn't.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Somebody I thought you did.  Maybe it was a shrugged.  You shrugged.  What are you going to say?  I love work.  I love them, but that's a, you know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I remember Gina saying last time that it worked on IMAP.  So I was on my iPhone and my IMAP worked and so I was happy.  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Awesome.  Hey, there's that big Cyanogen story.  I would love to.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And we were going to get the developer on and we'll keep working on getting him on.  This is this is your was your tip last week for hacking your iPhone or your Google phone.  I should say.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, last week I I felt I featured the Cyanogen mod, which is a custom Android build  that you can flash onto your Android phone.  I'm using a G1 and add some new features from the donut tree, which is the upcoming update.  And also gives you a little more access to the to the root file system.  So it gives you root access so you can install other applications that require root access,  like a tethering app.  I've been running the Cyanogen mod since, you know, for two weeks now, and I absolutely love it.  And something really sad and upsetting happened this week.  Google sent Cyanogen, who's the developer, a cease and desist letter  and asked him to stop distributing the the mod.  And the reason is they said that even though Android, this is how I understand it,  even though Android, the operating system is open source,  there are several closed source applications that come with it, like the Gmail client,  like the market client, like Google Maps.  So they're basically saying and to Google's credit, they did a post  in the Android developers blog about this.  So at first I was upset that they sent them a C&D, like just, you know,  before you get the lawyers involved, you know, it often just helps to do a little outreach,  you know, but but they did a post on the Android developers blog explaining the  situation and saying that I'm not sure exactly how this works, but they basically have business  deals that involve distributing these kinds of special apps, you know, on a per provider basis.  So it's so you can't redistribute a custom Android build with these closed apps.  And Cyanogen's point is, you know, the mod is the ROM is basically dead at this point  because it's useless without, for example, the market app because then you can't install  applications or, you know, the Gmail client or the Maps client.  No one would want to install it at that point.  So it's a bummer. I'm really bummed out about it.  I see Google's point. I mean, I wasn't aware of the nuance that there's a difference between the,  I didn't realize that those client apps were closed source.  Cyanogen said that it will, you know, it's a chilling effect.  The C&D is a chilling effect on sort of whole ROM development community.  He's not trying to compete, you know, with Google or screw up any of their business deals.  It's just kind of a bummer. I mean, you know, as a developer, I can tell you,  you only develop on platforms that you love.  I mean, it's the ultimate way to pay homage to something that you love.  And that's what he's doing.  And this is such a small percentage of Android users are actually going to install a custom build.  It's just a bummer that it has to stop.  So I tried to get Cyanogen on to do an interview today.  And, you know, he doesn't want to screw up his relationship with Google.  He doesn't want to say anything he regrets.  And I think the last thing that he said on Twitter was, I'm still just so disgusted.  And he said, you know, I'm just I'm not sure if I'm ready to do an interview yet.  I'm disgusted. I put so much work into this.  I'm really upset about how this turned out.  There is a discussion going on in the Android developers,  Google group about the possibility of making open source alternatives to the closed source apps  in order to make distributing custom ROMs kosher in the future.  But that's that's going to take some work.  And right now, you know, this guy put a lot of work into this and it's just a bummer.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, I understand Google's point of view,  and I think that they didn't probably have any choice.  They may not have handled it properly.  It'd be nice to have called him.  But I can see why they said, look, we can't open source Gmail, you know?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. Well, yeah. Well, it's the Gmail, the Gmail client.  It's the native Gmail client, which which really is the best part of Android as far as I'm concerned.  It's one of the main reasons why I switched over from the iPhone.  It's it's it's push and it's it's just a fantastic email client,  especially with with the G1.  But, you know, maps in the market, you know, you just don't have no conduit.  You have no way to get applications if you don't have the market app.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. So so he couldn't then strip out those contested things and still put out a ROM  because nobody would want it. There'd be no use for it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, there would be no way to to install, you know, other applications without the market app.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And you'd have to write his own market app.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. Right. He'd have to write his own market app.  They'd have to have to rewrite essentially these closed source apps.  In order for for people to get on it and download it.  And for reasons I don't quite understand, someone asked the developer, well, hey,  I bought the G1 from T-Mobile. You know, I have that means I have a license to these closed source  apps. If I install your ROM, can I just move them over from, you know, my original installer or  download them again? Don't have the right to do that.  And he said he said no. And I'm not and I'm not really sure.  I'm not really sure why that is. So it's so yeah, it sucks.  It sucks. I mean, the good news is that Google is being communicative about this.  And there are developers on the team that feel that feel bad about it.  I mean, they want they're riding on the backs of they want developers to love  Android and develop for it. They don't want to stop this.  But it's just kind of the state in the state right now.  So I'm I'm wondering, I mean, it's such a small use case.  I don't know if these closed source apps are going to get open source alternatives that are just as  good. I'm not sure how this is going to shake out.  But I hope it turns out well, because this ROM is really cool.  I love it. And I just hate to see it die this way.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. In fact, if you if you already have the ROM, could you still install it?  I mean, do you he can't offer it for download.  But I know that I know some people who still have the.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, right. Right. Yeah. So he's not supposed to distribute it.  But others could do so. Others could probably do so.  Yeah. I mean, this could get it gets sticky. But yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I believe Google create. And I'm ignorant as hell about this.  Google basically create a version of what he did to get the same benefit that keeps them in control  over over what they need to be. Why would Google want to do that?  To get the developers developing. So I don't understand.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You can be a developer for Android, can't you? Without the cyanogen ROMs or no.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. This cyanogen mod is just is a particular custom Android build  that he threw in a couple of extra features, some things from Donut, a couple of apps,  that require root access, which is cyanogen mod gives you like.  So, you know, the root access issue is probably not something that Google is going to distribute.  And, you know, to everyone lets you do things that, you know, I'm not even sure  if if tethering, you know, using root access, for example.  So there's a tethering app that you have to have root access.  I'm not even really sure if that's kosher, you know, if that's even OK.  So so it's so the idea.  The issue is, is that somebody can't it's not a fork. I don't believe it's a proper fork of  the Android project, but it's just it's just a custom build. This this kind of makes the whole  community around custom builds. And there is a whole community. There are tons of different ROMs.  Cyanogen is one of the most popular and most well known. So and I believe he's the first one to get  the C&D. It just stops that that whole that whole thing. It sounds like more it's a it's a question

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  of brokenhearted developers who thought that Android really was an open source project.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And in fact, it's it's not. This is the thing. This is why I'm  heartbroken about this. It feels like such an Apple move. Like I was just like,  I love my Android phone for all these philosophical reasons. It's open source.  And people can do what they want. But it's but it's not. It's not totally. It's not totally open.  Not that not the client, not the client apps, not all the apps that run on Android  are open and can be freely redistributed. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Which is the bummer. Can you could still hack Android?  You just can't make a mashup ROM.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. You can't redistribute a full build. But you could you could send out,  for instance, root access patch. Yes, I'm not sure if that's true. I'm not sure. I think that  you might have to change the entire ROM to make that possible.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is the thing. I think this is why this this ROM exists, right? Because I don't I don't believe

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  that you could just send an update to the existing, you know, build that you would get on your phone  and get root access. Right. And why do we want root access? If we have root access,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  we can do more different stuff. Yeah, you get you get a little more control.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  One of the biggest things that you can do is you can you can tether, for example. Now, there's a  there's an app that lets you tether called PDA net through your USB cable. You don't need a custom  ROM to use that. And that does work. But you have to install this like Windows utility on your on  your PC and the phone has to be connected. This other tether app that you that you need  root access for. You literally just tap the phone and then suddenly you get a little bit of a  connection to your phone and then suddenly you have a Wi-Fi point wherever you are. It's kind of  like a MiFi. It turns into a MiFi. Then you know, you're you can get online. So part of it feels

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  a little bad about. Not much use to me because I'm on T-Mobile and there's no reason why I would want  T-Mobile high speed access. High speed access. Right. High speed. Right. Exactly. Well, it's  a it's a shame, but I think in some ways it's a coming of age. It's a it's a realization that

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  it's not a fully open source project. Right. Not all the components of it are open source. Only  only the operating system. And just just to say tethering is the only thing you can do with root  access. You also just have you just have you have a terminal. You have access to the file system.  It's an operating system. It becomes like full on operating system without with with less protection.  I mean, you can obviously also really screw up your phone if you don't know what you're doing  and you have root access. But but for more advanced users, the people who are more likely to install  this this this ROM and these are the people that are the most that love Android the most are the  most loyal and the people who are out there saying, hey, there's an alternative to iPhone.  You know, this is this is why they're kind of shooting themselves in the foot. And this is why  I really hope that they can come to a compromise that that that allows custom the custom ROM  community to do what they do without without this this kind of issue. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So Jeff's book, What Would Google Do? Now Jeff has to do a rewrite. What would Google buy? That was  his subtitle to the news that Google's back on the market, baby. Eric Schmidt says we're the  acquisitions are back on. How long have they gone without buying anything?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, I don't know. And I think they bought little stuff. But I think the interesting question

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  to me is what should they buy? Right. So Schmidt was at an event in Pittsburgh. He says we got 19  billion dollars in cash and short term investments. We're going to try to buy some small company  every month. And they have because we know about on to we know about recapture.  Mike, I guess my question would be is how is Google's track record on these acquisitions? I  mean, I think of acquisitions like dodgeball and Jaiku, which really didn't go anywhere. I mean,  I don't know if Google feels like they got their money's worth. Clearly they didn't with dodgeball.  The teams left and gone on to create something actually of some real value. But then there's,

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  you know, YouTube, they say will be profitable shortly. Blogger, I think, taught them. Yeah,  I know. Any day. The second Tuesday of next week, as they say in Wimpy. Blogger taught them a lot.  I just saw the other day that the successor to Jotspot or the Google sites has finally added an API.  You know, a lot of times they are hiring the staff on a feed burner. I think they lost some  of the best people there. Costello was great. Right. So the problem with all these big companies  when they buy. But then again, they also know the limits of their own development. And it's a way  to get in new functions and new, you know, then again, wave comes from a purchase of smart people  in Australia. And a lot of the great map things have come from buying companies to hire talent.  The Rasmussens. Yeah. Right. So it's the argument of it's an acquire. You're doing it to hire,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  not to acquire. So what should Google buy? More cloud stuff? Small web 2.0 companies?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  My suggestion this week was after the side wiki mess was Techarati. Yeah, maybe.  That would be interesting, huh? It's about organizing content. Right. Wouldn't be insane.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They need a strategy. I wonder if somebody, I'd love to do for, to see somebody do a rundown of  acquisitions versus 20% projects. Right. So like Gmail, Google reader, maybe docs were 20% projects.  Like what, what are the, what are Google's most successful projects? You know, how many of them

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  are acquisitions versus the 20% time? Yeah. I was going to, if I'd had time, I would have loved to  have done this list, all the acquisitions, list, all the projects and list success and failures and  just kind of get a sense. I'm sure internally they know, but a sense of how well they do with  third party stuff in incorporating it compared to stuff that's already generated at Google.  Whether these acquisitions have paid out. I mean, DoubleClick, that was, I would say DoubleClick was  a big acquisition that, that presumably meant money for them. It wasn't Google Analytics

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  an acquisition? Say again? Google Analytics. Wasn't that an acquisition? It was. That's right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It was. Yeah. I think they've done a lot better than AOL and Yahoo did.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's not necessarily saying much. They did well. It's just better than,  it's a hard thing to do. And yet for growth, they probably can't do it all internally. They need to

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  acquire to continue to grow. I think if they, if they concentrate on the talent,  that's where they've succeeded best. You know, you're right. DoubleClick is a little different  DoubleClick is really about a business strategy and they just announced, we talked about it last  week, they're going into display ads and can bring new value to that. And that's important  for the entire media industry. But that was a mature bought company. There was, there's a great  graphic. I can't find it on the spur of the moment that shows all the Google acquisitions as a metro  map, as a subway map, all the stops and all the lines and where they've done it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Speaking of Yahoo, they're getting a little heat because they've started a brand Flickr as a Yahoo.  I don't know why this would bug people, but for some people are very, Yahoo is, you know,  they're very adamant about Yahoo and about Flickr, I should say. Flickr is cool. Yahoo is not. In  fact, Carol Bart said a great quote saying, what was it? Why do you guys all think Google is so  cool and Yahoo is not? Would you please, you're getting on my nerves here. I can't, I have to  find the exact quote, but it's very funny. People are unhappy about the fact that they've put  Flickr by Yahoo. Here's the quote. This is Carol Bart's Yahoo CEO. When you get outside New York  at Silicon Valley, everyone loves Yahoo. I just want to transplant all you guys out of your  cynicism. What's wrong with you guys? Go be cynical about fricking Google. You get me pissed off.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And that's a, that's a CEO I can like. I have a post from two years ago complaining about Yahoo  mail killing my account if I didn't use it. And to this day, I get new comments every week.  I don't think they love Yahoo out there. And the fact that Yahoo, this is just, just, just,  we're going to, we're going to hear that damned Yahoo again. Oh God. Cause they're spending a  hundred million dollars on advertising. What does that tell you? People don't love Yahoo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, you're right. If they did, they wouldn't have to.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's like a community. There I said, Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Here's a map from a tech crunch. Thanks to our chat room for sending this along.  It's based on the New York subway map and it shows all the Google acquisitions and holy cow.  The colors are technology, web services, mapping, imaging, search, social video,  advertising, VoIP and news. And really there's quite a bit of a stuff here. Urchin became  a web, became analytics keyhole, which led into their mapping.  Oh yeah. So you can't forget YouTube and double click. Of course, very big acquisitions,  but there are a lot of little ones on here along the way. It's a grand central was an acquisition.  Oh yes. Google voice. Jot spot. Postini. Very interesting.  Somehow I don't know how this happened. It looks like AOL is on this map. I don't think  did Google buy AOL and I missed that. Google invested a lot in AOL.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They bought into. Okay. Okay. But you know, a word about Flickr,  the Flickr community is particularly possessive of that place. Yeah. I mean, I developed Firefox  add-ons. I did one for Gmail, one for Google calendar. I've done one for YouTube, one for  Flickr. It was the Flickr one that people reacted the most strongly to. I got  a lot of upset email about. Yeah. Yeah. It was interesting. I think that there's just a sense  of ownership there. It's a great community. Flickr is one of the social websites that I have been  loyal to for years now. It's really great. I get to watch all my friends, kids grow up.  I love Flickr. Yeah. Yeah. It's a great site. But I think Yahoo's losing a lot of money on Flickr.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think it's like YouTube, a big bandwidth hog, and they haven't really figured out a way to  monetize it. There's no ads on it. In fact, really the only way they're making money on it  is you can buy prints. Does anybody buy prints on Flickr? I don't think so. When's the last time

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  you bought a calendar on Flickr? I have a pro account and I actually have ordered prints and  stuff, but I think, like I said, I love the product. I think they may be running small ads. I think  they have some sponsorships from camera makers. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, actually I think  that Yahoo's done a fine job with Flickr. I don't think that it's changed or degraded since the  acquisition. You don't hear as much about it. It's not quite as hip and cool as it used to be.  It used to feel like this thing that no one knew about and it feels like everyone knows about it  now, but I still use it. It's such a great UI. Well, it's also the biggest photo community

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  after Facebook. I mean, it's really... Yeah. Yeah. There's the Flickr from Yahoo. I could see  why that would bug people a little bit. I can see Yahoo saying, don't forget, Flickr from Yahoo.  And the new branding, Jeff, the Yahoo branding is Y!OU. Get it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I know. That's just so dorky. How much money... The money they spent on the ad agency alone

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  is ridiculous. That exclamation point was just the bane of my existence at Lifehackers. Like,  we'd have these editorial, you know, these copy style guide meetings like,  did we put the exclamation point? No, it makes it read so funny, but this is their name.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's like you're doing an ad for them. It's like you're always, Yahoo! Yahoo!

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, you know, and the peanut butter memo guy got hired by AOL last week.  No. I'm forgetting his name. The guy who said we're spreading ourselves too thin like peanut  butter and a piece of bread, he left. My favorite resignation letter ever, if you can find it,  is Stuart Butterfield's resignation from Yahoo about how he was tired of the tin business.  Oh yeah. I love that. It was brilliant. And I think it said a lot and Yahoo! just can't change.  It's still the same. It's still a company that's going to go off and spend hundreds of millions  of dollars to tell us to love us. Stuart founded Flickr with Katarina Fake.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And yeah, here it is. Dear Brad, as you know, tin is in my blood. For generations, my family has  worked with this most useful of metals. This is so bizarre. When I read this, I thought, what?  When I joined Yahoo! back in 21, it was a sheet tin concern of great momentum,  growth and innovation. I knew this was the place for me.  He talks about the company grew and expanded into dyes and punches, copper, corrugated steel,  synthesized rubber, piping, milling equipment, engines, instruments, weaponry, and so on.  Then electronics, grain processing, lighting, and salty snacks. Since the late 80s, as the  general manufacturing, oil explanation, and refining, logistics, and hotel and casino  divisions rose to prominence, I have felt somewhat sidelined. By the time of the internet  revolution and our expansion into websites, I have been cast adrift. Nary, a sheet of tin has  rolled off our own production lines in over 30 years. Please accept my resignation and I don't  need no fancy parties or gold watches. I'll be spending more time with my family tending to my  small but growing alpaca herd. And of course, getting back to working with tin, my first love.  That's actually pretty clever now that I read it.  It is the greatest ever.  In hindsight.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that is classic. That'll go down in the annals.  Can we talk about geolocation real quick?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes, because I know you're all excited about this.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I am. I am kind of excited about this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is Twitter though, right? Not to Google.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, this is Twitter.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But it'll tie back to Google in a second. Keep going, Gina. We'll tie it back.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, okay. Okay. Good. Good. Good. So I was at the Twitter conference this week in Los Angeles,  which was weird, but good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Why weird? Because Tony Robbins was there?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, you know, actually, I got totally sucked into the Tony Robbins tractor beam. I mean,  that guy, he can own them.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Ooh, your hypnotized.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, I've seen it happen so many times. He's very charismatic. He's a brilliant speaker.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  He's a passionate storyteller. I mean, it was amazing. I used to make fun of him,  but now that I've seen him talk, I feel, I don't know, I feel like I've been brainwashed somehow.  The conference was a little weird for me because I normally go to tech conferences  that are developer heavy and tech heavy, and this was very kind of celebrity heavy.  Like Twitter, it was a little disappointingly celebrity heavy. So it wasn't necessarily the  group that I'm used to, but there was a developer track that was very lightly attended. So it was  fantastic for me because I got to ask Alex Payne and Ryan Sarver as many questions as I wanted,  because there are about maybe 10 to 15 people in the room. And it was kind of a big deal.  They were going to launch geolocation API features for the conference. And I guess it just had made  it through the final stages of testing yet. So the launch didn't happen, but they explained a

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  lot about how it's going to work. So this is along with Retweet. These are two new additions to the

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  API. Yes. Yes. Project Retweet is an addition to the API. And actually it's interesting. They're  launching these new features via the API first so that application developers will get a head start  on how they will display the interface and how it will work. And Google, I guess, could have learned  a little something from Sidewiki. It's pretty interesting. Twitter is basically giving  application developers the chance to make this stuff work on the front end before they do,  on their website. So yes, Project Retweet is a separate thing, although I got some details on  that as well. The Retweet project is basically just like public bookmarking. You can't comment  on Retweets. You'll just be able to say, here, I've retweeted this. And you can't make any comments.  And other people see it. The people who follow you see it. So it works a lot like bookmarks,  like that you can't edit the person's original tweet or add a comment to it. That was a little  disappointing. And Jeff, I loved your response to my tweet about that. You retweeted it with a  comment, which I thought was great. It wasn't lost on me. I love meta. Yeah. But the geolocation  features are pretty interesting. So basically this is how it's going to work. For user profile and  for each tweet, you will be able to include latitude and longitude coordinates. And it's  totally opt-in. So it's off by default. You have to go to a page on Twitter site in your settings  to say, yes, you can save and publish my location details. This is the interesting thing. Twitter  is going to delete location data, latitude and longitude data for tweets after 14 days,  after a 14-day period, to avoid subpoenas. Yeah. So now Google Latitude-

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, I can understand that because you wouldn't want to use it because if law enforcement said,  well, where were you on the night of October 22nd, 2003?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right. But there too, I want to opt in. If I give a restaurant review,  I want it to live on and not die off in 14 days.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Unless you murder the chef, but that's a special occasion.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  With a butcher knife in the library.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In the library. Yeah. And we know it was the library because it said so in your tweet.  No, I think that that's a reasonable response to privacy concerns, but you think, Gina,  that it kind of makes it less useful? Well, no, I mean, well, I was surprised

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  about it because I just, I thought that there was like precedence for this stuff. I mean,  I just didn't know- Latitude keeps it forever?  I'm not sure. I think that latitude deletes it when you update again. I'm not sure how it works.  So it doesn't keep history. I expected that it would anonymize it in a way or fuzz it. I  thought there'd be a way to say, you know, I was in this sort of 10 to 15 mile area,  but I guess I really honestly haven't thought about it very much. I don't do geolocation  stuff because I really don't want people to see where I am. Anybody be able to see where I am at  any given point, but it really kind of made me think about it. They're not going to do this  indefinitely. They're going to figure out a safe quote unquote. This is what they said,  a safe way to store this data historically. But the risk comes in that application developers  are going to get this data and they're encouraging application developers to also delete this data  and not to store historical data because app developers could become the, it could get subpoenaed.  But I don't know, but I'm not sure how they're going to enforce this or check it. You know, so  it'll be interesting to see how that works. If you're Twitter.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's interesting. The Guardian, Gina, the Guardian had put its API for all of its content  and one of the requirements under British libel law is that you must refresh the content every  24 hours so that in case there's been a correction or a deletion, you get that in the pool. It sounds  like you need to do something like that where you have to refresh or else your key expires.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. But if you're writing an application like my application, Twitterlytic, which stores a history  of yours and your friends' tweets over time, basically you have to go back into your own  database and say, okay, the latitude and longitude coordinates that are older than 14 days, scrub  them or change them or get rid of them. How do they enforce that?  Well, this is the thing. How are they going to enforce it that remains to be seen? I don't

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  know how they will. It's not like you can have this geolocation information will self-destruct  in two weeks. Right, right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Cynically, it just means that they don't have to have the lawyers.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They're not responsible. Gina gets the subpoena. Well, right, right, right. And they're saying,  be careful what you do with this data and don't keep historical data so that you don't have to  deal with subpoenas because they're a big deal. By the way, that's the new title of the show,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Gina Rhymes with Subpoena. So send them to her. No, that's what it is. You're exactly right,

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Jeff. They're just washing their hands of it. I mean, a little cynical, but they want the feature  so much. This was probably their answer to the lawyers to say, F you, we're going to do it anyway.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  See, I use, believe it or not, I'm crazy, but I like, I've used bright kite, I've used latitude,  and right now I'm a big fan of Foursquare. The reason I think Foursquare is the winner in this  is because it's a game and it's fun and you like to be the mayor. And they have very clear  monetization potential because the way Foursquare works, when you go to a place three times,  you become the mayor of that place and you maintain your mayorship as long as no one gets  there more than you do. And what you're starting to see is bars say free drinks to the mayor,  which encourages people to come and compete, see who can go there more.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And so it's good for the bar. And what I believe will happen, Foursquare is not doing this yet,  but what I believe, by the way, these are the guys who started dodgeball. They've  moved out of Google and created a basically another dodgeball. The way they monetize this,  they have business services, you know, we'll work with your business to encourage traffic.  They give you badges. It's fun.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This gets us back then. This gets us back to Google is that the other thing Google did this  week was release place pages, which I think is really important. And Twitter fits right into that.  In the bigger meta view, I think we end up with an annotated world that every place on earth is  going to have comment about it. Such an interesting idea. Where does this information come from? This  place pages information? Well, right now, I mean, because Google right now, of course, in Maps has  Yelp and has other things and Yelp is very good. This is actually a bit of a side wiki problem for  Google, because Google, even though it's created an aggregated page of place wiki, it is encouraging  people to make comments there. And it now competes with Yelp and outside dot in and other collectors  of the annotations around places. But I understand why Google wants to do it. And you have Eric  Schmidt saying that mobile is going to be more profitable for us than the web. They recognize  that every time they get new data, Rissa Meyer has bragged about all the geo points of data they  have. At some point, you're going to want to say, who said what about this restaurant or about this  monument or about this photo in the gallery, whatever. And or this bar or God knows, help  us this date, then you add in Yelp, Twitter with geo if it has life and legs and other sources like  that blog posts organized through outside dot in, it becomes incredibly rich now around a geo

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  annotation layer of information. Well, you know, as a as a local business, I went to the Google  Local Business Center and inputted data about my business, its location, you can put in pictures  and videos. And that's important because when you do a Google Local search, the first thing at the  top of a Google Local search result is a map of, you know, related businesses, and you want to be  on that list. And that's free. So that's one way they get of people putting in this information,  they already have business every every business in the world, presumably wanting to do that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Just like our profiles and everything else, like the more data we get, right, it's a profile of  businesses. And now if you add SideWiki onto that, if people are commenting on the website for that

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  place, oh, it all comes together. Well, and this is where the real value is. That's why Robert  Scoble's always said that Facebook has the best play in all of this, because they have all this  metadata. They have all you have your social graph, and they have the metadata. Google's missing the  social graph piece, but they're I think they're they probably could find a way to make that work  with Google social. Now when you go to a place, you could say here's what your friends are saying

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  about that place. That's hugely valuable to Google. Yeah, I think for the geo stuff, being able to  check in at businesses and comment on businesses and public places like that is really is really  useful. But you know, speaking of Scoble, he did a great post about Foursquare. And he said that  he checks in, there's a Ritz hotel near his home. So when he's home, he checks in at the Ritz and  not the exact location of his home. So he's the mayor of the Ritz-Carlton Half Moon Bay. Yeah,  yes, exactly. So he's the mayor of the Ritz-Carlton. And I believe that Foursquare allows you to do  this. Foursquare, and I'm not sure because I don't use it, but they allow you to choose. You can  check in anywhere you want. Right, you can check in wherever you want. Right, you're not you're not  forced to use the GPRS coordinates on your on your device. Furthermore, you can check in after you

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  leave or as you're leaving. So if you're worried about stalkers, this is kind of what I do is I  check in as I leave as opposed to as I arrive. See, that's smart. That's smart. And I hope that

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Twitter developers, Twitter client developers will keep this in mind when they make their UI for  sending lat-long coordinates to Twitter, because Twitter doesn't, you know, doesn't have any way to  verify whether or not the coordinates you're sending are true. And it would be really nice  if I could say if I could check in at the coffee shop down the street when I'm really at the office,  you know, and say, hey, I'm here. So it's a way for me to control the impression that I put out  on social social media networks. Right. That's why the only photos you'll see of me online are ones  of me looking up or whatever. Right. Because this is the kind of control that we want without sort  of revealing our true location. Because I guess there's another service, GoWalla, I want to say,  that actually forces you to use your devices coordinates and you can't change them. And that  Scoble called that the anti-feature and I absolutely agree with him.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think I'm with him on that. BrightKite allows you to say anywhere nearby  as well. Now, latitude is automatic, isn't it? Latitude just puts a pin where you are.  I've never even installed it.  I've used latitude and basically the Android phone is constantly sending out a signal as  to where you are. It's like a little dot on the map that follows you around.  It's automatic. That's really scary.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What's that becomes interesting too, I'm advancing to my number of the week.  But one of the cool features I saw on that is, is map my run and the features that enable you to  take rather than a static place, a route and whether it's a perspective route of where you're  going to go, a route of where you've been and what all is along the way becomes really interesting  too. And it goes against a time there. And then you go to things like traffic and, and recommendations  and who's there at the same time and how far away are you from things? And it gets extremely rich,  becomes a, you know, a 3D chess game in geography. I love that. Now, Ken Shepperton's asking in our

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  FriendFeed chat, a legitimate question, which is why the annotations on a business site  don't bother you when SideWiki does? What is the difference there, Jeff?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, that bothers me as well, because I think what can happen is that Uncle Luigi's Pizzeria  can be slammed by, by dominoes. Right. And so, no, I've got the exact same problem there.  And what you want, you also saw this, this happened with, and I haven't followed this very much, but  with Squidoo, Seth Godin's company, we did something with businesses this week and there was  controversy around that and whether people can opt in or opt out or have control and have  responsibility. You know, again, if you allow, I understand the conundrum here, if you allow people  opt out of SideWiki, then every spammer will opt out. And then maybe at some point that becomes  a sign of disrespect right there. I don't know, but you've got to recognize that some people are  going to take responsibility and some people are going to have to deal with these demons who come

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  along. It's kind of like the Google Book search deal. There's some real benefits, public,  potential public benefits, but there are also trouble in some areas and you kind of have to

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  work it out. It's a problem of Google size now. And when you go to something like Places,  they're going to compete with other companies and they're going to compete with their own channel.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We don't have time to talk about this and Siva can't join us, so maybe we'll postpone it for  next week. But it looks like the Google Book settlement is now back on the table. Google's  saying, all right, if the DOJ doesn't like it, we better go back and renegotiate. So this year old  deal looks like it's fallen apart again and it's back on the table, back negotiating with the  Google Book search. We'll talk about that in just a bit, but let's get right now and let's get to

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Gina's tip of the week. Gina? Yes. Yes. This is an exciting one. This week Google launched Google  sync for iPhone users and for Windows mobile users and for Nokia S60 users. And this is really cool.  So right now the best way to get your Gmail on your iPhone is via IMAP, which isn't quite push.  It's pretty good. It depends on how often your client checks the IMAP server for new messages,  but it is polling. Well, Google sync gives you access to your Gmail account via Microsoft exchange  active sync. So if you set up your iPhone to get your Gmail or your iPhone or your Windows mobile  phone or Nokia phone via Microsoft active sync and you get a live push Gmail alerts, calendars  and contacts. Now there are some limitations and we'll link to those in the show notes.  And there are some things that you should be aware of. Like if you delete a message on the iPhone,  it actually gets archived, that kind of thing. So check that out. But if you're currently using  IMAP on your iPhone or your Windows mobile phone, definitely consider switching over to Google sync,  which is not a separate ad on a product or app. It is just Microsoft exchange active sync access

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  to your Gmail. I've been using the Google sync on my calendars and address book and I just now go in  there and I see, oh, they've added mail as an entry there. So I just turn that on and now I'm  going to have push mail as well. That's nice. That's really nice. Yeah. Well done Google. And  now Jeff's number of the week. My number is 87. Ad week was in New York. No, I think you shouldn't

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  explain it. Just say it. 87. Thank you. 87. That's it. It's like the prisoner and Gina's bike. Number

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  six. And we could leave it for the audience to determine. Go find it and you get a prize.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We won't start that yet. What is 87? Google's creative labs presented at Adweek and some of  its stuff we know, but it's really a nice presentation of neat crap that's made on the  web using tools. So it includes a worldwide real life monopoly, a karaoke tube, watching what  people are buying real live on Zappos, map my run, a YouTube symphony and all those kinds of things.  So it's a really nice little presentation to give you hope for the web and creativity.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's hope for the web, ladies and gentlemen. My tool was going to be Sidewiki, but I guess  there's nothing more to be said about it. We killed it. Well, that's good. We're done anyway.  My initial reaction to Sidewiki as it is with anything new on the web is, oh, let me try this.  And I tried it and I liked it. But boy, after I read you and Gina's comments on this thing,  I thought, well, I guess I should be aware of it anyway. And I guess what people should do is sign  up to use those webmaster tools so you at least can assert some ownership of this. I wish they had,  and I hope and I presume that they will have some anti-spam tools and things like that because I  could just see what a mess this is going to be. There's also a bookmarklet for people who don't

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  want to install a toolbar and just want to see comments on their own site or comments on other  sites. There is a bookmarklet and we'll include the link in the show notes. It's in our friend

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  feed room. Yes. And that's a good point. You can actually, if you could figure out what the  URL is for the Sidewiki, you can give out, and I've seen people do this, a URL that seems to  work in any browser that gives you the Sidewiki as well as the page, right? So you don't have to  have the toolbar. You can actually figure out what that URL is. And I guess the bookmark might help

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  with that. Yeah. And you just can't post comments that way. You need the toolbar in order to post  comments. Yeah. Right. I mean, the API exists and I know, and without a doubt there will be plug-in,  like WordPress plugins and other products that come out that let you comment and view. But for  now there's a bookmarklet and I'm sure in the next couple of weeks, if this does catch on,  there'll be other ways to access the comments. Designme.com slash Sidewinder. I'm sorry,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Design Meme, not me. Designme.com slash Sidewinder. And there you can find the bookmarklet  right there. Just drag it to your toolbar and you don't have to have anything fancier on your  system. I'm using Safari and it still works. Gina Trapani is at smarterware.org. That's the  place to go to find all sorts of great stuff. She's writing posts like crazy. And of course,  you see her on Lifehacker. She's a contributor there, the Harvard Business Review and many other  sites. But the best place to go is Sideware. Smartware.org. Jeff Jarvis is Mr. Buzz Machine.  We always love talking to Jeff. Glad you're back after your surgery and it sounds like in fine  fettle. Buzz Machine. Ordinary again. He's back to his cantankerous old self. We thank you for  joining us. I have a lot of voicemails, but in the interest of time, I won't play them. We'll play  them for next week. But if you do want to give us listener feedback, our listener feedback line is  9795 TWIGVM. That's 979-589-4486. It's a Google voice number and you can just leave a message  there for us and we'll just play a whole bunch of them. Next week, you guys don't have to show up.  I'll just play hundreds of, because there's literally, there's hundreds of voicemail

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  messages. Yeah. On Slow News Weeks, definitely. Yeah, this was not on Slow News Week. No, it was

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  not. 9795 TWIGVM. We do appreciate your listening. Don't forget you can watch live. We do this show  at 515 Eastern, 215 Pacific every Saturday afternoon at live.twit.tv. But we love it if  you listen to and subscribe at the iTunes store, the Zoom store, anywhere you get your podcasts.  Just look for TWIG. Thank you, Gina. Thank you, Jeff. We'll see you next time.
