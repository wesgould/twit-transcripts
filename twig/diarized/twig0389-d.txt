Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I meant we're the we're the rose the blue is off the rose from your point of view you finally sent through  What you thought was it you know a distinguished panel of experts talking about the weeks?  You realize no  That's not what this shows about it all I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Got a lot. I gotta say the actions is but I kind of like how given the  Marshall's weekend the head sets have a certain Princess Leia look they're good

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's the key these are my these are my old Princess Leia headsets. Yeah, they're great. Yeah, it's a nice-looking actually they are

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're lovely. I loved that you could see pictures of Princess Leia throughout the march I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Loved that too. I kind of sad like I would love one of those posters. What was she doing?  well  Something for a saber. Yeah, was that like I guess I'm saying help me Obi-Wan Kenobi

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Most of them said a woman's place is in the resistance. That's what it was. I like that's what it was the resistance. Yeah, of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just don't forget what happened to the freedom fighters in the resistance  We suffered extreme losses to get us those Death Star plans. So two words  We'll start the show with Ajit Pai the new chairman of the F  C C  He is okay. I'm gonna say there's many good things about Ajit Pai for one thing  Unlike a number of other appointees by our new president. He has some experience in the FCC  In fact, he is a commissioner and has been appointed by Barack Obama in 2012  he is elevated to chairman for one thing because  He's a Republican member of the FCC Commission, but he's also  Doesn't have to be approved at least until later this year when his term would normally run out  So somebody can jump right in now. I think maybe somewhat unfairly he's been painted as a  virulent net neutrality hater

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why do you think that's unfair? He's actively stated in sudden? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I would yes, I think that that's not fair I think  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Beast hates net neutrality. Yeah, well, that's the daily saying that okay. We'll stop this right here

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I I've covered the net neutrality debates since before he was a commissioner  So but once he became a commissioner in 2012, I read his opinions on all of the net neutrality hearings  He is very much against net neutrality. He's very much against any regulation

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's a does this make him he's against something that many people including John Perry Barlow and members of the  Board of the EFF are against which is too much government intervention in the Internet  Okay, but that that I would say he's against is against the title to the chiefs of title two of the telecommunications  Act to enforce net neutrality. I wouldn't say he's against that neutrality in general

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He is very much in free marketeer  He's a former Verizon telecom lawyer and I know that coming after everyone was like Tom Wheeler was a former cable lobbyist and  Wireless lobbyist but in his opinions  He makes no secret of the fact that he doesn't think that the government should mess with any sort of discrimination on pipes  At all, like if you read his opinions, that is straight up what he said

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm gonna tell you a few things that I think are very good about him  But let me read this quote to him from 2014 before he was being considered as  The chairman obviously this is when he was a commissioner and this is when the debate began on net neutrality  We should not let that debate obscure some important common ground namely a bipartisan consensus in favor of a free and  open internet  The freedom to access lawful content the freedom to use applications the freedom to attach personal devices the network the freedom to obtain service plan  information  Respect for these for Internet freedoms has aided the Internet's tremendous growth over the years  It's shielded online competitors from anti competitive practices. He said many times  I don't think it's okay for an Internet service provider to slow anybody down. He's dead set against that  I don't he's you know, I think that it's it's this is by the way  I should point out from a Forbes article saying why is the media smearing new FCC chair?  I jet-pie is the enemy of net neutrality and Forbes has a particular angle on this  I do think it's safe to say he's he's against  government regulation of the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean so he wants to take a lead Leo Leo. He said he said it's a solution  That won't work to a problem that doesn't exist. I don't see how he's not alone in thinking that there are a lot of people who say

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That I think he's particularly talking about title to that the decision to regulate

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait here we go though, let's let's because if this is your like little glitch here title to the FCC  Actually originally when they were doing this they didn't want to go title to the very first

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they had no legal justification for not in fact, the judge said you can't do that  The FCC can only do what Congress mandates

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, so there's there's two things here way back in the day when Jenikowski was doing his  2010 I think it was 2010, but it might have been 2011 net neutrality plan the original net neutrality plan  That got kicked back because they didn't have that  Justification congressional justification, but that judge did say it kind of opened the door to doing title the judge gave them away

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He said well if you were to use title we had this you're this is your new to this  We've had this long conversation about this many many times  The judge was very clear that you could eat the FCC did not have a legal mandate to do it the way that  Jenikowski wanted to do it right, but if they were to choose title two of the telecommunications act  What you have to understand is the FCC can't do anything without a direct congressional mandate  So they need to find in the in the code right they need to had direct justification for them regulating it  many people  Many people said title two is a very bad choice because it turns telecommunications providers into  Regulated utilities and it means that the FCC could even do things like set prices it would  Overarching the FCC said we would never do that right they have though. Can I point out that they have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are we going to talk about information and privacy they have well there's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have also attempted to set prices on the internet and I and I think that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Reasonable people can argue over  Look the the general idea. I'm gonna shut up because I'm over doing this but the general idea of net neutrality  We can all agree bits is bits the internet should be a level playing field  I of all people should agree that because if suddenly Netflix and  Every technology streaming service is favored over twit. I lose  So and and and and if twit is favored over the next guy coming down the line he loses  So if you want innovation you need a free and open internet we all agree on that  Where there were reasonable people can disagree is how much the government should get involved in that  because  As soon as you turn on title to a  Government can then start to do things  That we definitely don't want it to do so I agree we need to take a weed wacker to FCC regulations  We wouldn't be in this position. We would have true competition if the FCC hadn't created duopolis  Okay, so the FCC did

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's saying there's no problem  That's the part of that quote that I think is important where he says well  He said show me where show me where there's been damage done, right? He's saying there is no problem  So whether it's title two or anything else he doesn't believe there's a problem that needs solving

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that was an issue all the way back in 2008 that that's been a talking point for people who are against net neutrality  for a while, which is  There's no problem show it to me, but you can't really prove it  But going back to your point and I'll stop after this Leo  But I do want to say that they chose title two  Because they had no other option unless we were gonna do a rewrite of the telecommunications act and that wasn't going to happen  And they decided like any government they have to compromise to go the route of title two and then to forbear on a lot of these issues  I haven't seen them do price setting so I'm not sure they're  But what I will say is going forward  I think the real question we should be asking because I do think he's going to dismantle some of this is how he's going to  do it and that's that's actually I'm surprised that no one is focused on this yet because  The way that net neutrality was written and given the court case  I don't really know if he can just rip up the title two aspects of it  I think what's gonna happen is a more selective case by case  Or a decision to not take on cases and complaints about things like zero rating and data caps, etc  So I don't actually think that net neutrality in title two might be in as much danger as we're kind of all going ah  So okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Matt

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I agree with Stacy. Okay  And I think that Forbes article was deliberately trying to to make pies views look less  Critical than they are. I think he's made it clear a number of times that he's not in favor of  the fundamentals of net neutrality or title two and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't we know that Trump is against a neutrality he's been clear about that and  Aged pie said the only reason that the Democrats voted for net neutrality was because Obama made them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My opinion is that?  Title two is the wrong approach to neutrality. I understand that was the only approach available  But I think it was I think the thing that we really have to understand is the FCC can only do a Congress  specifically mandates it to do and the and  I think people  Don't understand the FCC is is a kind of an unusual beast  It doesn't it is it is really an enforcement arm for a telecommunications policy as Congress specifies it  I think bending the telecommunications act of 1986 and title two of it to give to say well  And okay, we're gonna use this but we're not gonna use that part of it  We're not gonna use that part of it is clearly not desirable  So if I mean it's it was all they had I would much prefer to see Congress weigh in on this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There have actually been debates should we rewrite the telecommunications act in its 1996  You don't even need to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could actually Congress could simply say among the FCC's powers is the power to make sure that net neutrality is enforced  You don't need to rewrite the telecommunications act

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you can't because my god remember net neutrality. We've then we've got to argue. What is net neutrality? What does discrimination mean?  What does it constitute? Oh my god  That's not that's not gonna happen and have you ever met Congress and have them say oh, yeah  We're just gonna do a tiny little addendum. I would point out that if our

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  elected representatives  Don't wish to enact that then the last thing we would want is  For an overreaching  federal regulatory agency to  Freelance, I don't think so the climate where the Congress doesn't vote for this  We can yell and scream all we want  But that's but they've spoken. I don't want to see any agency  You're it's a double-edged sword the minute you start saying well, they should freelance or they should take this  Ability written into an act that wasn't intended for that use to for this use  You are really opening the door to some very nasty stuff and I think at this time  It'd probably be a bad idea to do that. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Think we're already there  I think the FCC did what it could and I'm I do think the president picked Tom Wheeler

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Based on how he knew that he would the president of form and if you mean Obama President Obama picked edgy pie

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay  President Obama's is Tom Wheeler to be the chair of the FCC and by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  understanding where what we don't know is  Because remember how we felt about Tom Wheeler. I know  He changed his mind  So I would submit that you should we should baby be a little slow to condemn a jitpie  Until he actually has a much better history of public service than Tom Wheeler ever had he only worked for Verizon  briefly in his earliest years as for two years as a  an early lawyer I  Think a jitpies point is well taken which is the best way to solve this is not with government regulation  But with true competition and he has some really good points one of the things he wants to do  He says whenever utility we go up in the utility lines  We want to make it a requirement that the utilities put in conduit up there for internet access  I think he believes that the best thing to do is to open up competition and I think that I don't I think everybody agrees  That's the best way to do this  Well, yeah, do you think we could here's a guy who says that's where he wants to go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Wheeler has actually talked about to putting you know, giving people right away on  Power lines and placing conduit that is not a new idea. The challenge there is  we  Can't ignore the fact that the market has been  Tampered with I don't know how to say it not it's not tampered but the market has evolved in an unjust way or an oligopoly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We do not have free choice. There is no free market internet access in the United States

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So absent absent competition that is what the FCC has been trying to address in to protect

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What if instead of regulating agitpike and the FCC moved to create competition?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have tried that it tried that that's how we got here in the first place  the effort to create  Facilities based competition is what led us all the way back in 1996 to cable companies and DSL providers  Being our only options in most places  That was a decision by the US government not to put fiber and to say hey these two guys  They'll be totally fine competing in each other and all our policy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See that said to phone companies you have to open your physical plants to multiple internet service providers and  Said at the same time to cable companies you do not it would be a simple enough  In fact, I think a much more effective way to to create net neutrality for them to go to cable companies and say alright  Time to open your physical plants to competition  Then you'd have two fat pipes into your house and many ways many different internet service providers to choose from I  Would prefer that to that interfering with the market

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They own they invested they

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, but that's do you think what if he did that would you then say okay?  You're right. We shouldn't have net title two was a bad idea. Let's have competition

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's hard to see that when he poses regulation and opposes your we're guessing we're guessing. I mean we are we are

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He says he's committed to free and open internet T model the BT model

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would be beneficial. Here's the pipe and and and same as my power line now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can buy power from anybody that a lot of people who are staunch defenders of the internet  We're very nervous about any government regulation at all  There was a massive debate within the board of the EFF about whether title two should be invoked that was not a clear  Decision John Perry Barlow himself told me we've had big fights over this  We do we do not like calling on the federal government to regulate the internet in any form and I would submit  We should have learned our lesson  Because many of the things that we were happy when Obama said oh, let's extend the power of the executive  We were happy when it was Obama and now we're going. Oh, maybe that wasn't such a good idea. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Agree with Stacey. It's this is this is this is being done in lieu of competition

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you know what but we don't know we we will see and that is the beauty of it I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Will keep watching this I I think there's look let me put it this way. There's plenty of things that are actually happening  That you can complain about and when these things actually happened  I think the internet will stand up just as we have in the past with the internet blackouts and other things which we participated in  and we will be send a very clear message just as you know on Saturday a  Million and a half women and and and men supporting them did more than a million and a half  Yeah, in Washington in Washington. It was what how many three million not that we want about numbers here  That's right. Well, that's NC. That's kind of my point is that we got to be careful about what we what battles we choose to fight

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what I do right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you fight I  Mean I hate zero rating it is antinet neutrality. Good luck in explaining that to a normal person  You're gonna have a mark about zero rating

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right not gonna happen  So right your member of progress high was very like when it came to things like zero rating  When we were talking like his opinions on the original net neutrality  For wireless plans if you go back and read them and I should have them right here. I could find  He was not a fan like he and  O'Reilly were some of the reasons that that got dropped that wasn't that wasn't gonna fly in the FCC. So  You know if you're really worried about those things you may want to keep an eye on pie  He's probably just not gonna litigate it. That's that's my guess not litigate  file complaints in censure companies

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So anyway, so they got to do whatever they want. Well, I think the first thing he'll do but we don't know  This is again speculation is  Retract whatever order it was that said we're gonna use title to  You can't retract that that's been in the federal register. It's done. It's published in the Federal Register

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's been sued on it  would have to they would have to  Yeah, a notice of proposed rulemaking blah blah blah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Warning when you know this stuff happens and in meanwhile, there's a lot of stuff  I don't think he seems I guess what I'm saying is he's not on the fringe  He is well within the the universe of responses that even strong defenders of the Internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Yes. He is and he's technically savvy. This is not like Rick Perry knows what he's doing comes from this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're right. He does have a good track record

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think he's one of the one of the Trump nominees that really has some experience in this matter

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He is he is very smart he's very erudite when it comes to things like spectrum, you know, like in many ways  This is this is a true just policy disagreement as opposed to like a what is happening in this world kind of  Commentary so in in many ways, it's kind of refreshing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  His opinion was that the FCC didn't even have that authority that you know title to was really not quite legal  So and I don't disagree with that point of view  I think that was a risky thing to do although I supported it at the time  It did seem like the only reasonable way to get net neutrality and for so then the question is if he's in favor of competition

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How is he going to encourage that's right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right. And I'm and that's what I think we should do is encourage that because that would be the best solution. Would it not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, right. But he's not he's not gonna be the guy who he is. Let me put it this way  He is likely not gonna be the guy who complains that FC or complains that AT&T is using its direct TV  You know, it's it's not counting direct TV data against their customers. We thought Tom Wheeler wouldn't be the guy either

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let's let's wait. The other thing that's happened is that is that in this period  Verizon stopped building Google stopped building. Where's the competition? Where's the investment gonna come from? Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he would argue the reason they stopped building is because they were told that they couldn't compete  But with the FCC was gonna regulate them. They said if that's exactly what AT&T said they said  Well, he was gonna say a bad word if you're well, but that was AT&T's justification whether you believe it or not  It is AT&T. Come on  Google didn't make that okay. So really okay. So let me just explain then what's really coming down to is your  your attitude towards how corporate America  Thinks about this kind of stuff as opposed to any factual situation because he hasn't done he hasn't done anything  So I just expecting the worst

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He has voted for a lot of things and voted against a lot of things  I'm not just expecting it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am basing it on a history of reading his opinions a four-year history of reading his opinions. That's not  nothing Leo  But you're right he hasn't done anything and you know, we'll see I will say on the positive side  He is aware of the need for spectrum and the millimeter wave bands  He's actually trying to allocate advocate for more or he had been in his previous opinions  So for things like 5g gigabit wireless services, we could actually see some more movement there from a FCC  It's it's complicated I'll give you an example that on the surface you would say oh he's on the wrong side of this story the FCC vote

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That prevent prohibited prohibited  Or I said internet service providers have to get permission from you to share your data and he voted against that  He said no. No, they shouldn't. However, his argument was  That these new rules did not in fact stop companies from harvesting and monetizing your data and  And he wanted stronger rules  So if you look at the top line, you'll say oh, yeah, he voted against your privacy  But I think it's more nuanced than that and everything's more nuanced than a new story, right?  So exactly. So I think we're in a very difficult situation  And I think that's the problem with the new rules is that they're not going to be able to do that  Right. So exactly. So I think we're in a nuanced situation  I think this would be a good time to write your member of Congress and say let's please give the SEC tools they need to promote competition  Among internet service providers and I I I think that that's something everybody can get behind  Republicans are all about free market, right?  Where's that going to come from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whereas yes, I could say that everyone I talk to say competition is good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My friend Dane Jasper who's running sonic.net who has lots of ideas for how he can compete and is competing successfully in some markets  Against Comcast and your phone company and he's putting in fiber in a lot of markets  One of the things Danes really Dane really really wants is the right to when when those when they go up and put those utility lines up  The right to access the utility lines, you know who supports that strongest that more AT&T and agit pie  It's it's this is one of his points  In his plan for the future is this should be a legal requirement that utilities allow access to competing internet service providers to those lines

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Danes Danes challenge there isn't actually the federal government. It's the city government

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why he wants a federal law which agit pie supports which is really against Republican values

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If we think about it, I don't know what the hell a Republican values now, I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll be honest with you. I think I think it's not a Republican administration  It's a it's a very different kind of almost a populist administration and I'm not sure what the rules are  And I that's why I think all we can do at this point is wait and see and prepare your ink and paper and get ready to write lots of letters  And and but I think it's a good thing to say what what we would like and what I think I would say people who favor a free and open market  What we would prefer is more competition. Is that is that wrong?  It's not wrong but you when we call or when we write our letters, we can't just say I like competition

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have to give them a path forward to that because there are multiple paths forward  Right. Well, one would be a federal law requiring that access to polls

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's going to come up again in the courts because that that's going to be a federal law

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's going to come up again in the courts because that a lot of those are owned by utilities or there's also the local regulations

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But let's move on to a I don't disagree that there'll be a fight but anything you want to do is going to be a fight  Well, true. I mean, that's how that's how it works  And and really I would also I would really point out the Congress is the people is who tells the FCC what to do  It doesn't really matter what Ajit Pai wants  Ultimately, he has to do what Congress tells it to do  And that was where the that's why the court threw it back because they said you don't have a mandate  You need a congressional mandate to do this. The closest thing you've got is title to  Make take a break. We'll come back. There's lots more to talk about including  Some new IOT connections new friends, as you say for Google Home  Five XPRIZE finalists and Google Voice is back, baby  Our show Wow, I got a cool off here  You know what, you know, all I'm trying to do is say instead of just doing the knee jerk, which I do too  And say, oh, this guy's terrible is is is what is the what is the way forward that we want as advocates of a free and open Internet?  We can all agree on this. What is the way forward? What is the right way?  What is the right way and that's fair and I don't think I don't think screaming at the choice of Ajit Pai to run the FCC which is  Done is the way to do it. And now we need to kind of encourage  Something that every Republican can support free and open competition  That seems fair  Matt you're the peacemaker. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's my sense Rogers does any competitive things like throttle Skype?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because they want to use their voided solution and and many of those battles were lost years ago  There's just been so much consolidation  It's effectively a market duopoly right most cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's true. But I think if you look at Canada, for example, if you lose or you give up  You know this little battle and then you give up the next little battle because you're waiting for the big one  eventually  You've given up so much that that you know, you've effectively lost

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is cute for a musical it doesn't have any catchy numbers. Can you know catching numbers? So and it was kind of boring

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm still mad because I got sucked into going to see into the woods. Nobody told me it was a musical  Oh, you don't if you remember the  Great musical I know there was no singing or dancing in any of the commercials

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, you know, it's so funny. They decided not to mark it as a musical and I was watching the ads and I'm saying  This is a Stephen Sondheim musical. There's no singing in the ad exactly  So I thought we know why they tricked me. They tricked me  For my money back I saw I saw that I actually noted that because I knew the show kids were laughing hysterically like halfway

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is there singing and dancing through this whole thing like yes dad it's a musical

Transcript:  Anyway, Manchester by the sea now, I don't know if Amazon really deserves credit for this because it's my understanding  They didn't produce it from the beginning. They bought it at Sundance

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so well, they funded it right the same way they funded transparent. They didn't really find it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They just they funded it. They funded the distribution of it, right? Right? It was already made

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody was telling me that that's the new thing now all the streaming companies Netflix on Amazon  Go to Sundance now trying to find the next big. Yeah, and it paid off the next midnight

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there was a bidding war I think for Manchester by the sea

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and it makes sense because they don't need to I mean these companies don't have the same agenda  Really as a paramount and you know, you know lions right they don't have to have a blockbuster  Exactly because they can monetize it later in other ways

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think in particular Amazon they have you know this massive massive business that has nothing to do with movies  Yeah, all they need the movie for is to get you to sign up for prime. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

I think that's there's a creator spotlight section vines grouped by genre  That's one way to one way to save  I can't think of another case of that happening of a  App or a service dying and being preserved in this way. This is nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  thing is  You can still use vine in a way you can still it's called vine camera now  Yeah, and you stream it straight through Twitter, but it doesn't go it doesn't go up on the vine, right?

I really think they did not take advantage of it properly which  Like who would have guessed that Twitter would have a great idea but not sort of execute it properly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think they they did they build it or did they buy it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They bought it. They bought it. Yeah, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's it's like how how Yahoo and AOL ruined everything they bought

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they wanted YouTube bucks for making vines

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, right and so unfortunately a lot of them fled for YouTube and and Vimeo and there was a much some of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some of them should not have like gone beyond the 60 seconds. That's it. That's the other thing like people didn't appreciate like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can I just say I hope that when Twitter goes belly up in the next year or so it will also do the same and yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think they're selling it off piece by piece  So I just I sold fabric to Google right fabric, which is their mobile development platform. Yeah  Which if you remember was gonna be sort of the that was the future growth plan  Was that it was gonna basically integrate with your with all these mobile apps and it was gonna build a platform  The Twitter would be at the center of and so on which is a great idea except now it'll be Google instead of Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google I Oh  in an unprecedented break with tradition Google has announced  Google I Oh will be May 17th 18th and 19th once again at the Shoreline  Amphitheater, did you go Jeff? Yes, I did

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they've actually created they're gonna do this here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you said that I think last show

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the only way to explain how Google's fragmented messaging strategy makes any sense at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't I don't think that makes any sense. I'm sorry  So you shoot yourself in the foot or  Cut off one of your limbs or you know, I don't it doesn't it just makes no sense. I don't understand it  It's  Frustrating as heck though like try and explain that to a normal person if you want them to use one of those apps  But I thought I was using hangouts. Oh, yeah, forget about that. You have to use this other thing now  But I mean, this is just there's no rhyme or reason to well, that's why it's interesting that Google is now adding features

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To voice and Google Hangouts  Two products we thought were gone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So voice is interesting and there's some speculation that by adding  They added MMS after all this time you can now use do MMS with and groups you can do great  After all this time, it's still not supporting SMS exactly  I don't know and so but the thinking is maybe this is the beginning of  kind of the transition to for Hangouts completely to be an enterprise solution and  Then Google voice be the messaging platform. That doesn't make any sense  I don't understand all I get through Hangouts is spam  How about Google I oh will they announce?  More Google home stuff probably right assist. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know, maybe they'll maybe they'll bring so they keep talking about bringing things like  The ability to control some of the things that you can do via Google home like your smart home stuff via  Assistant so maybe they'll announce that  That'd be cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very nice much less rigid. Well, that's that's AI. That's machine learning, right? Yeah, it's a little more sophisticated

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And is it is a Google home or echo where you can say computer now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's echo. I forgot echo has computer now. Yeah, I see Amazon echo. Yeah, and that's totally for Star Trek fans, right?  There's no practical reason you should say computers computer. You are talking to a computer

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  True you are yeah, and you know if your kid's name was anything related to the echoes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  interviewed on Monday a good friend named Alex and  I noticed that he used Amazon as a keyword for his echo and he said well  Yeah, when you're named Alex, you can't use the other one, right?  Because people all the time coming over to me saying hey Alex. I'm sorry. What did you want?  All right, will they talk about Google Wi-Fi? What is the status of is Wi-Fi going the way of the of the on hub?  Google Wi-Fi, you know, that's what is the message. What does that question mean?  Well on hub kind of fizzled right? I don't see a lot. Okay, so here's here's an important thing to say to people

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you have a Google on hub  It works with Google's Wi-Fi. So those two things work together as mesh network

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Spend a few hundred dollars more to make it more useful

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot of people feel like they're like well now this sucks  I've got the on hub and it's no longer useful. It could be one of your Wi-Fi

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they sell Google Wi-Fi and anything less than a three pack  One I think you can buy a one. So you could have two. Yeah, you can if you have on hub

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could add that too. Okay, and I think someone did a teardown  Of the on hub and there's Zigbee inside a Zigbee radio, which makes sense  Okay, 11 or dot 14  Is it in the why I think it's in the Wi-Fi too that it's in there  The Zigbee chips to the 804 and that makes sense because thread is based on the same radio

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think if we if we look at at the New York Times story about AI  Uh and translate and you hear hold on a second. I'm gonna mention that but let me just a quick note

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you do use your on hub with Google Wi-Fi, you should not trust the usage statistics  Because apparently there's an arithmetic bug

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Math is so hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Especially for computers. Yeah, so it looks like that this our conference. This is uploaded 74 gigabytes the drop cam  1.25 terabytes  Anyway, um, it's a known issue and they're working on a fix and i'm sure that's just a firmware fix

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're gonna pour it on I think pour it on that's right. Yeah, I mean amazon's looking at echoes in cars everywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all over the place. I think they need to they're gonna they need to talk more about the api  They need to have more libraries. They need to do something to encourage more developers to create

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They also need to work on their data sharing policies and work there because one of the challenges is a lot of companies are like  I don't want to work with google because right they're gonna take my data, right?  Yeah, and amazon's like if I take your data, it's only because I want to sell people more stuff  I'm not going to go build cars or anything and get into your business

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not getting in your business, but but see they don't know right now  Right, it can't be you can't be sure  Uh, they are they have some things that they mentioned at a previous google ios. They're finally  Uh incorporating we're starting to see the first betas of what is that thing where it loads part of the app?  If you don't have the app, yeah  That's starting to show it now for a handful I was excited about that  I was excited about when they showed it at i.o last year. Yeah, and then I was like and nothing nothing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh instant tethering for that is pretty amazing. Yes, because the idea is you don't have to have the app for those of you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who don't remember right? You don't have to have the app  You can ask for assistant to do something if it doesn't have let's say, um open table installed  It can load a stub a little mini version of open table and still execute

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, now pwa has disappeared. The washington post had a pwa a progressive web app and I think it's now  Sends to the regular washington post page. That's too bad. So I don't know what's going on with that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google like a lot of companies nowadays, uh announces many things  But doesn't always deliver and then sometimes it does and then it decides not to continue and  You can't count on google  How important this is here's a here's a meta discussion  How important to a company is it that you count on that you can count on them that when they announce a product that they support it  They continue with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's a habit in the tech space  I think it's actually a habit that's going to get them into more trouble as tech becomes more mainstream and integrated into more products fail fast  Yeah, but not even fail fast just the idea that you know  I'm gonna like you see this with  Smart home stuff people we're gonna do this this and this and this and someone buys it and then it doesn't do those things  And they're like what just happened, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  I think it does become a problem when you you pump something up people devote time and resources to it  Not just startups or developers but actual users and they get used to it because you told them  That that's how things were going to work  And then you change it and I mean google's messaging is is a perfect example people have all this, you know  kind of emotional  Energy they've invested in your product and then you either sunset it and say sorry move on or  You have to change to this completely other thing  I think the more times you do that you kind of you're using up social capital in a way with users

We're going to get a new iteration  And I actually thought that was both  Great for like very transparent of him and forward looking for him  But it's also a crappy news thing for his customers in a lot of ways  So, you know you're like and this was something we thought when we bought the tesla we were like  I know but I know in like two years it's going to be awesome and my car is going to suck  You know not suck, but it won't be as cool and that's that's a really hard thing for a lot of people to swallow

Transcript:  Or dummy. I think hey dummy. Um, okay, graig duffy who is a champion. Oh the guy who sells beepers  Yeah, yeah  Okay  Not that guy now  He is now at apple that is that is I was going to that was my news for you guys because we were talking about apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was he was a drop cam co-founder and he was also the guy  Who notoriously called tony fidel a tyrant bureaucrat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's kind of fun that he's going to apple where tony fidel probably honed his tyrant bureaucrat ways

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is he gonna do at apple?  Nobody knows

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good question, because apple doesn't make cameras

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, not yet  Well, they're doing the phones they they used to make a camera, uh, what was it the eye  Well, it's right. I see eye cam. I  I'm just I've forgotten it now  Um, so that'll be interesting. Yeah  I think a lot of times though  These people are just good engineers or maybe good managers of engineering teams and they don't necessarily end up doing the same thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He may not want to do a camera. Well, so the other thing is if he's not doing a camera what  He did do a drop cam. That's worth noting is he helped do the computer vision. So all of drop cams  Not all if I don't know if it was people opting in or if it was  Because you can't anonymize  Camera data, but they took the camera data to do some computer vision and image recognition stuff. So  He's managed people doing that. I don't think he's like an ai

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he's he's he's yeah, in fact, uh, this story was broken  We should give credit by read albergati from the information jessica lessens information  And oh fabulous and they say uh brings an experienced consumer electronics entrepreneur into the company  So they don't really say particularly his camera expertise could be interesting though. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he I mean he found a drop cam because he wanted to find out what what animal was pooping like in his dad's neighbor  Or his dad's yard. Oh, and he actually founded it based on he was like  Building taking off the shelf kind of stuff to build a camera for him and then that turned into drop cam  So it's it's a very cool story. He was not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  According to correction from the information a manager or rather an executive at drop cam. He was a manager for camera engineering at nest  So maybe he is more engineering an engineering manager or a manager of teams like that  Anyway, very interesting  Thank you for that news

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

So you're gonna i'm telling you I think this is the maybe even the future of computing  Uh, all of them usbc more of those weird adapters. Yes, big big news today, which was adobe is bringing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  full power  Apps to the chrome os through android. That's huge

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is adobe's plan on ios, I uh, they said lightroom we talked to russell brown he said lightroom  Uh for the tablet is going to be at some point where  Our total intention is to make it a full-fledged equal to lightroom on the desktop  And that is for a photographer a very natural workflow is to to edit photos just to touch them to I mean, it's just very natural

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is huge I think and it will put that in the comments right now. There's the adobe

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so photoshop makes if I can travel with a combination of chrome and and android  And a pen and be able to watch my movies on the plane and then we'll work on something to write it's ideal

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, so these are the creative cloud apps that will be optimized for chrome os photoshop mix lightroom mobile illustrator draw photoshop sketch  Adobe comp cc. I'm not sure what that is. It sounds like a compositing program creative cloud mobile  And that's what works for education too because these you know  These adobe would love to get you when you're in school using these programs so that you'll use them when you get out of school  How limited is photoshop mix?  pretty limited, uh, it's really intended for  the one thing which a lot of people do which is to  Take a picture like cut your head off and put oprah's body on it or right vice versa  That you know that kind of uh editing so internet memes you mean internet meme machine  But lightroom mobile is a much more complete and and as I said  I think adobe's long-term goal is to really make photoshop mix be photoshop and lightroom mobile be lightroom  That would be very exciting and it's one of the things that keeps you off of a chromebook, by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good video editing good photo editing. Yes, that's pretty much it and skype  But so I haven't tried calling into the show  from  When I get the new machine we'll try skype through android into the show good. I haven't done that. I'd love to try that  Yeah  We did it we did it as a small test that first week but

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other thing is interesting this acer chromebook spin. Is that the one you're interested in?  This is this is the education one  No, it's it's it's a different one. It's the aces. I think the uh stylus on this which kind of looks like a samsung stylus  It's a flat stylus that goes into the body of it is wacom and they it's using the wacom emr standard  Uh, which is what artists want?  This is really I have to say this is compelling and these things are a few hundred bucks  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the the the samsung will get you up. I think 600. I spent almost 500 for this chromebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Plus that's the first one that'll be available early february  And i'll tell you what since you're going for the pro which is not out yet and it's gonna be out later  Right, uh, the pro is intel the plus is arm. That's the chief distinction  I'll have the plus and i'll show you and you can and you know, yeah, i'm i'm excited  There's they say the spin has military grade durability, which is what you want for a school. It's milspec  810 g  Uh, I don't know why yeah, I don't know and it incorporates what that means, but we want to say wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A drainage system. Yeah, it incorporates your water a unique drainage system. What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's awesome, which can endure up to 330 milliliters of spilled water and channels liquid away from important components  That would help at starbucks for sure that that would help at my desk

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My husband's like are you drinking water at your desk again? I'm like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So prevents students  Uh from removing swapping or otherwise interfering with the keys. Oh, what are students doing the keys? Okay, so when uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Swallow them sometimes when the obama transition happened in 2008  No, i'm, sorry when the clinton transition happened in 2001  The clinton staffers removed all the w keys from the keyboard  So that w george w bush would his staff would have a hard time  Typing they that that was a mean prank  I thought that was a problem would be i don't think it's apocryphal

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What would be even better is just to remap the keyboard leave the keys where they are but make them make different letters, right?  I think that's also hard to do on chrome os

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh  I i'm I just more and more I think google has the right strategy with chrome os  Because once you add these apps from the android store and if these apps get more and more desktop like which is I think the trend  This is going to be a nice platform

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm excited. So do you see  chrome and  And android continuing or do you see that one of them winning?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a real that's a question we've asked again and again and again, right? I don't know  I think android for phones makes a lot of sense. I think chrome os for tablets makes a lot of sense  um  I think that's fine. Do you need I mean they're both linux based

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess one doesn't have to win

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and the play stores on both which is the real virtue. This is what microsoft's  Desperately trying to do is create this universal windows platform so that a developer will develop for all of microsoft windows  Mobile tablet and desktop and it's it's been rough going google's kind of  They said well, we don't have to you just do keep doing your android apps. We'll make sure they run on chrome

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and having android apps on a chromebook would be super useful for sure a touch chromebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  Speaking of android hugo barra is out at xiaomi. So remember hugo barra the great google executive. He was the king of demos  Was always on stage at google i.o. Then he went to xiaomi where he did much the same thing  And he says i'm tired of living in china. I want to be back in the states with my family and friends  He doesn't say what he'll be doing when he comes back, but he says quote. He'll be embarking on a new adventure back in silicon valley

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, wait, can we talk about this is elon musk really building a tunnel did you guys see his tweet? Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because that that happened. He's already broken ground  Yeah, he needs a few approvals doesn't he well, I imagine so so his plan is this all came from a tweet  Where he was bemoaning la traffic. He said I just want a tunnel underneath  And then the story today is that they've already broken ground in a tunnel. He's going to buy these tunnel boring machines  And he says look, it's the same thing as flying cars  You you go up or you go down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But aren't there structural things that are  Involved in

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everyone independently builds their own tunnel that feels like  Yeah, this okay. Thank you because I saw his tweet and amidst all the other  Unbelievable trees, it's just gonna be elon's tunnel or

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the question. How does this help traffic if you let everybody in the tunnel? It's worse. So obviously  The key is maybe it's a private toll tunnel  So it's a tuesday employees a tesla tunnel. Well, he's building one under the gig of the spacex factory, right? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He should just buy a helicopter. My god. That's what that's what other rich executives who hate traffic do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And in fact, there's been progress in that regard  I mean  It was clear that flying cars were a bad idea if you if you let people drive them  But autonomous flying car is not such a bad idea  And people are already talking about doing that  Here's elon's tweet from early from 1 a.m  Yes  Exciting progress on the tunnel front plan to start digging in a month or so. Oh, I thought he'd already broken ground

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, he's he's trolling us

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he did put tunnels as part of his twitter bio  He's trolling us  The problem is he spent he splits his time between spacex and tesla hq  So the tunnel would have to go all the way up to freemont

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a lot he would have to buy mineral rights all kinds of things. I think it's didn't he say to lax

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that what the lax was the airport? Oh, okay. Okay, so his desk to the airport and he does travel a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To his helicopter perhaps why not just get a helicopter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like isn't that what rich people I just said that yeah, no, but he said no, here's the advantage of tunnel  You don't have to worry about the weather  It's always it's always sunny underground  Uh, he says you don't have to worry about cave-ins. I don't know how what he's got  But what he needs is a machine is like a thing that just does it like, you know  He's like a comic book villain  Oh, it was in the incredible  Incredibly a few hundred million. Hey if mark zuckerberg can build a wall around his island

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, google fiber actually has some incredible boring technology and they're getting out of that business. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The problem you have to get a really small car

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just like how it's boring technology

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I love it. That's the name of the company by the way, the boring. Yeah, the boring company. That's a that's a joke, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I can't tell what's real anymore. Jesus when you live

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Neither can he on that's his point. We were living in a simulation. So do what the hell you want because  It doesn't matter. Oh lord

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, all right, sorry, I I just wanted joel's opinion

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's real. I don't think he's making that up. But who knows you're right. You can't tell  Um, let's see, I want to do a few more and then we're gonna take a break because I want to get you out of here in  15 minutes  Samsung says it's going to stick with the note brand. It did release this week  The study that said there were two problems two different manufacturers problem one with the original  Galaxy note 7 was as we everybody suspected and was leaked the batteries didn't fit the case properly  And that caused leaks and explosions and then they rushed to get replacements out and the replacement batteries  Had another leaking issue and that's why so two separate issues  They announced an eight-point plan to prevent this from happening things that are kind of unprecedented like x-raying  Every battery before they put it in the phone to make sure it's manufactured properly  And they said as a result we are going to be able to stick with the note brand. We think the next note will be  Safe and I imagine it will  Although I won't be the first one to  Go to bed with one  They also say they're going to delay the galaxy s8  Which is you know, usually the essay comes out in the spring the note comes out in the fall  The essay will come out after mobile world congress this year  And I think there's a reason they're delaying it till april because they've quartered the market on the snapdragon 835  And no one can make a phone with the snapdragon 835  And no one can make a phone with the snapdragon 835  Until samsung's comes out. So the longer they wait the better it is for them  Incidentally quarterly results out for both samsung and lg samsung actually had a great quarter  They survived the note. Wow, asco they had written it off in the previous quarter  and made a lot of money not so good for lg, which is  frankly lagging in its sales of its most recent phone and  It's it increasingly feels like samsung is dominating the android space just as apple dominates the ios space  Uh anything else what else can we talk about I can do till 6 30 if you want to keep going

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  uh  Okay  Okay, I just have to be I have to test my my japan connection at 6 40  Oh, so you're gonna skype in  Yeah, yeah, they're they I have to do a talk  In an hour and then I have to another one about two in the morning

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Eff by the way, we're talking about net neutrality in the eff eff has a 100 day plan which they announced  Uh a few days before the inauguration  For how they want to deal with a trump era  um  They say hey, we sued clinton. We sued bush. We sued obama  I think you can I think you can see where we're going  With this uh the four the big four surveillance net neutrality press freedom  Uh, we will continue to defend digital rights in court the eff. I think  People may not know that the electronic frontier foundation  Seizes its mandate going to court  That's what they do  Uh different organizations do different things but the eff was founded to pursue  Uh policy changes through court cases. So suing is what they do  Uh, we will test and leverage the freedom of information act and today they filed their first foyer request  for trump documents  So we'll see uh, that's one of many uh court fronts that the president is fighting on but uh,  That foyer request is an interesting angle

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  um, it's interesting that did you see the um  The group one of the groups that was behind the the panama papers  Said that they would very much like to do the same thing. Yes for trump. So if anyone has any documents  Feel free to send them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, everybody's looking for leaks and oh, yeah intercept pro publica every the media is thirsty for leaks. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and the little servants will be fascinated with when you have the the the park service folks  Yeah, look at them and look at the are now subtweeting. Yeah, isn't that weird?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they so so trump trump banned the park service from tweeting  And as a result, they created a unofficial account. They said you can't stop us from doing it on a free time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, even so at the at the official one at the death valley one  Uh, they did as soon as trump started talking about uh, uh keeping immigrants out. They started talking about manzanar  Wow, brilliant subtweeting  brilliant

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't the department of defense are they also subtweeting him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was the most stupid  Let's see. Hold on

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So here's the interesting thing all that the national park service  not the the  Tweets about the crowds but the all that the badlands  Park the badlands one is the account the only one the only thing it was doing was tweeting actual facts

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right about climate change. Well, and then and they weren't so i'm not sure whether they were blocked and came back but they are back now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, yeah, no, they were they were ordered to remove the tweets

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well spice came back that came from the white house, right? But the tweets are back. Yeah, I believe so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can check. Okay, because they said that someone got access to the account who wasn't supposed to or there were multiple stories  We were out shoveling snow. I think was one of them  um  But it was interesting to me that all they were really doing was posting facts  And in this facts allowed posting an actual fact  Yeah is seen as somehow subversive

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe they are well it is I thought I'd seen that they were back. Yeah, it's just frightening that that is subversive

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  posting facts  Is actually subversive

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the department of defense it's it's an open question because on january 23rd  They did something they tweeted social media posting sometimes provide an important window into a person's mental health know what to look for  Well, that is a little snarky  And then but that's the thing you don't know you don't know  They did a story about from refugee to marine this particular corporal  I i ali j muhammad takes the fight to the doorsteps of those who cast his family out  And this is 10 hours ago soon after trump announced his nobody can come in one of the things that seems most reprehensible to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  trump  reversed a order to  Prevent companies from dumping toxics upstream of water treatment plants  Which seems on the face of it a bad idea  But this was an epa regulation which has been reversed. I think was reversed yesterday  Uh, and then instructed the epa not to say any, you know gag order. You can't say anything about it, right?  So he kills the clean water rule  And then says oh no, by the way epa you're not to say a word one way or the other  Now I I think this is I believe on trump's part a misinterpretation of the role of the president  Some have called it the not authoritarian but personification  Where the person of the president trumps to use  a pun  Uh all other agencies and it's not that way normally normally  uh the president  Is an employee of the u.s people he puts directors in charge of agencies, but the agencies still have some autonomy  They're not he doesn't have total control over everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But we know I mean that's not a surprise, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, well, it's not a surprise that he's attempting it. It'll be very interesting to see how this plays out  He can't already it seems and I mean  The the washington post has these inside the white house leaks  That kind of imply that uh, the president can't even control  his aides staff and household members

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so much is that he can't control himself  I mean the one thing that comes out of that article is as soon as he sees something on tv  That makes him mad he tweets or he sees a tweet

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he maggie maggie haberman who's a great new york times correspondent had it  Had a tweet stream just this afternoon  About this how he gets over tired and and watch this tv  Me too, but you're not running the free world with the most of twitter is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then people who should be eating and sleeping more

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Then he orders the ariana to delete their tweets, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or then he says, uh, we're gonna send the military into chicago  Uh, you know someone so he technically that was just the feds

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Someone went through a bunch of his tweets and pegged them to whatever was on fox news at the time  So if he happens to be watching fox news

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well, and this was that was one of the leaks by the way that I think the washington post got that  trump was watching a  Network news report about murders in chicago  And then tweeted he's sitting there and tweeted immediately. We're gonna send the feds in  Uh, interestingly we had reported earlier as had the new york times that the president's  And beloved android phone was taken away from him  And he replaced with a secure phone. He turns out now that it was not or he got it back  And that's what he has at night when he's in the residence  And he's watching tv. He has his old samsung phone and edward snowden tweeted earlier today  I wonder  What we we think it's a galaxy samsung galaxy, but we don't know what vintage he said  This could be a massive security well  This could be a massive security problem if it's not running the latest android, which many galaxy phones are not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But security do what if you except find out where he is, what could it do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, uh, this is another thing is that the is he taking the emails?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean are his emails coming into that phone the new

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is another hacker pointed out that both the potus account  And real donald trump are tied to not government  Mail servers personal servers, but to gmail

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh lord and and all of the top people have republican mail accounts on republican servers

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And easily guessed email addresses for instance a hacker pointed out that  Pence's twitter account points back to an email because you can ask and it will show you with asterisks. That's v asteris asteris  resident  at gmail.com  Oh, no  as it in 2017 at gmail.com  And so and the and the hacker said, you know as soon as you know what that email address is for the twitter reset  They're not using two factor. He said as soon as you know  As soon as you there's very insecure as soon as you know what that email address is  Then you have a target and you can go after their gmail address now  I should point out I presume and I would hope that at potus at least  Has higher protections  Both from twitter and from the secret service  You would hope one would hope you would hope

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although technically isn't mike pence the one doing most of the policy making because trump is not really he's busy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's spannon

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Trump is making policy on twitter at three o'clock in the morning. Well, it's interesting because okay, so trump tweeted at real donald trump  Uh, you know the the i will send in the feds but then at potus retweeted it

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So at potus is being used  I don't know how this works. Is that bannon or uh conway or somebody?  I don't know retweeting the uh real donald trump in any event  um all of this seems like a bad idea and I think one of the reasons you're seeing the leaks to the washington post is  Some of the some of his aides seem to be a little frustrated hoping that they they said  We're trying to get him to watch less tv  Me because he gets excited

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If if someone I mean think about think I think about how people feel after they watch fox news  I want to tweet right right. And so if that's your policy engine that is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is a real issue. I mean, that's that's what you see on twitter. It's just that maybe this isn't so  This is what the park service is doing alt  Us nat park service the unofficial resistance team of the u.s. National park service not taxpayer subsidized  Come for rugged scenery fossil beds 89 acres of a million acres of landscape and they've tweeted  a pretty insulting cartoon  Uh donald trump saying I decide what is the truth I alone control what you could say or hear listen only to me obey me  Love me the national park service tweeting  Nope

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So according to this independent story  POTUS is actually run by dan scavino

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who's trump's director of social media, but he's retweeting real donald trump. So it doesn't matter. Yeah  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Also scavino is a fan of info wars  conspiracy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Theories apparently it's just an interesting time we live in I I that's one word for it. Uh, yeah  Yeah  um  Uh, we we don't even have to talk about the face of neocolonialism in in hawaii mark zuckerberg

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That really sounded actually yeah, like just trying to get the landowners to come out of the woodwork  Everything I read about that doesn't look like he's evil. It's like  Yeah, I just want to know who owns this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the more I read about it the more it seemed to me like  That's a common strategy that you have to use to find out who the heck has access rights to your land  Because of the way hawaii works it didn't it didn't sound to me like it was just mark zuckerberg being in tech

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He wasn't trying to get them not to walk across his land

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's no he's trying to find out who they were. They are he doesn't know  Yeah, he doesn't know who has the rights to own that land  This is kind of the equivalent of your state running those you may have unclaimed property ads  Except he has to sue to get the information

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It goes by family and so there could be family members who have right rights to act rights of access  But they may not even know it. Makala

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kaomoana the executive director of an environmental group in  Hanalei kawaii said the lawsuits would help identify and inform descendants of links to the land. They may not know about  Which is a good thing  The optics aren't good

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, but I mean as soon as mark zuckerberg does anything the optics instantly become bad, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Another hawaiian state representative  Kaneela ing of maui said zuckerberg is saying he wants to respect the local culture  I was always taught if there was a dispute with somebody you go and knock on their door  you sit down and you kuka kuka and you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hooponono, they are but he doesn't know he can't knock on their door. That's kind of the point

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sweetie, sweetie, sweetie, darling. Call me sweetie. Would I mind? No  This is the eve  Home kit compatible light switch and i'm showing it to you because i'm going to install it and I won't be able to  I won't be able to show it to you once it's on my wall  So here's the back. Ta-da. Those are the wires i'm going to attach  This is only good for one-way lights. It's not good for three-way lights. It works via bluetooth  And this is a capacitive touch panel so you can actually do more than just go on off  You can go around  You could go clockwise or counterclockwise  I actually don't know if those are supportive motion yet, but i'll let you know next week  So but there are motions that's kind of cool. You you can I think it's a touch like long touch multi tap

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow, I don't know how many I need a manual to turn on the bloody light and bad touch

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh  Of course there is leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stop touching me  The reason I bring this up is because  The only other option for you  with home kit has been and the lighting for the switches not for light bulbs because hue works with home kit is  Lutron, so but you have to buy the lutron bridge which right now  I think is like 80 bucks and then you have to buy a 65 dollar lutron compatible switch  So this is at 50 a little bit cheaper and you don't have a bridge  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's that's all i'm showing this to you the only negative and dr  Morbius brings this up is of that flat thing is you can't really tell if it's off or on there's no kind of physical indicator

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The light is off or on well, I know you say that  Why do people say this all the time? Okay, i'll tell you why i'll tell you why

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have this situation in my kitchen. I have many many many lights in my kitchen  All controlled by switches and I can look up at the lights and some are on some are off  But I can't be sure which set is on properly, but when I look at the switch, I know  Oh, yeah, I need to still turn that one off. So with something like this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's where the multi touch blah blah blah comes in handy  You can actually in the fact that it's programmable. You can actually just be like  all of my kitchen lights  Work on this button  and when I do  this motion  only  The ones over the sink turn on or however you want to do that. I mean  Interesting you guys are still in this analog stateful mindset really need to get into this digital

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gosh this on off switch is so primitive  And by the way, you can talk to it too, right? It has an evap siri. What via siri? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, it's home kit compatible. This is the home kit. So that's the feature of home kit, right? Of course

Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah

But yeah that live streaming is it in fact  I saw an interesting article that's saying a lot of uh, uh conservative and even all right  Uh publishers are are turning to live streaming on facebook as kind of their own tv channel

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the new fox news

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  uh during the the uh  Protests in washington i'm not talking about the women's march, but there were some violent protests independent of the women's march in washington dc  uh a number of uh alt-right  There was they talk about one alt-right guy who was streaming live the whole time covering it like cnn, but using facebook to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you remember trump doing that during the campaign?  From the trump tower. Yeah right before the debate he had like a panel of uh of uh, mistresses

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Clinton's mistress's panel that wasn't a that wasn't at all inflammatory  No  I didn't watch that. Did you have has anybody seen that?  What was that like? Well, I can't even imagine what that would have been like  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I watched one of the uh sort of trump tv broadcasts where they had a couple of hosts behind a desk  At trump tower they interviewed a trump surrogate of some kind. Yeah  Since it was like cable access, you know in the same. Yeah, it's kind of cheesy, but it's between two ferns or something. It's direct

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  uh and for  And it's pretty clear trump is very much playing to his core and a lot of the things he does and what but  But he hasn't been doing this since the inauguration will will they go back to doing that kind of thing?  I wonder what remember he did some youtube

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did quite a few youtube speeches and definitely facebook. I think I think bannon, uh  Is a big believer in that and I think if it's not  Bright bard or something like that, then they'd be happy to do their own direct stuff  Right. That's what trump has said he likes about twitter is it allows them to do an end run around every president

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's uh, you know reagan did his radio, uh, every  Fdr started it with faris. I just twitter  Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twitter's better suited about as long as his extension span and he can make his pronouncements and they get quoted all over  It's not easier to quote twitter than his video drive the news

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fact is you do something long on video. No, it's not going to drive any news

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's everybody can see and respond to immediately in fact in an interview sean spicer the press secretary said  He basically checks twitter first thing in the morning to know what the boss trump tweeted so that he will know  What is going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow  Well, I asked I asked a large pr company head in davos. I said do you have a staff that's up at three in the morning?  To watch his tweets and he said yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you have to uh every company in america probably has somebody designated to keep an eye on what's going on in the middle of night  Has has the president been tweeting though in the middle of the night?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think as early as as

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Early six o'clock. Yeah, not in the middle. That's what so like three o'clock. So he used to get up pretty early  I saw one story that said he now gets up around 6 a.m  Watches tv in the residence and then comes down has breakfast off the oval office. There's a dining room tv's on there  And then at 9 a.m  Comes into the oval office office to start taking meetings  Um, so so now you can start 3 a.m west coast 6 a.m eastern exactly. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, he watches morning joe apparently for an hour and then switches to fox and friends

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, our good friend tlayton morris is soon to be a good buddy of the president his media consumption habits

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh a close friend said that he believes the new york post is the paper of record

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He won't read the daily news though, oh no  Uh anyway, I started this by talking about the fact that now twitter  Facebook and instagram are all going to have live streaming video and then uh, there's there's still I guess periscope and  Meerkat went away, but uh, there's I mean  It's funny because I read these stories and go. Oh, I should do that and they go. Oh never mind  I don't  The last thing I want to do is stream live video when I go home

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What I thought was interesting was that um  digital content next did an analysis of what uh  Publishers are getting from facebook and  uh google and  twitter and I think snapchat  Uh in terms of revenue and because a lot of them have been pouring a lot of resources into facebook live and  And building snapchat teams and and doing google amp and so on and actually the returns have been fairly meager so far  Um, it's it was surprising to me how little they're actually getting out of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're actually getting out of that. Yeah, but it's it's it's it's a small set of 19  You don't know who's in that set. Yeah  And a lot of these companies are not going all in they're just they're just testing things. So it's interesting  Yes, I agree, but I don't think it's terribly indicative of the of the potential

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  interesting move by mark zuckerberg's, uh, uh charitable foundation the chan zuckerberg  Uh initiative they acquired this this is actually I think is really great  A science search engine called meta  Scientific journals are an interesting thing that most cases the research is public research paid for with public dollars or university money  But it's often behind a paywall often a very expensive paywall where other scientists and researchers don't have easy access to it  In fact, this was what got jonathan schwarz in so much trouble. He wrote a little tool to suck one of the  paid uh journal, um  Repositories, I can't remember which one was it lexus nexus one of them dry at mit and they got that's what got them arrested  And eventually led to is a trial on suicide  Meta is an interesting one. They're gonna they're gonna they bought it and they're gonna make it available as a free  tool  It's a search engine. It uses artificial intelligence  optimized for scientific research  so, uh the goal they say of uh,  Chan zuckerberg's initiatives goal is to break down some of the barriers that preclude the sharing of information  thereby encouraging scientific  I wish they had funded. Uh, psi hub. Have you heard of that? No, is that another one or is that the is that the open one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Psi hub is the basically the pirate bay of academic journals  Um, it's got 48 million journal articles that have been liberated liberated quote-unquote from uh,  It's from kazakhstan. Wow. Yeah  um, it's quite the venture if you believe in academic freedom or  Freedom of information. It's bad for society. It seems criminal that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These companies are monetizing research that was paid for by uh taxpayers

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And in some cases, I think government agencies have made it a condition that if grant money funds research  It has to be made public

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, let me just real quickly look at the erin schwarz, uh story i'm trying to remember  J store was the one he had a guest account on j store at mit and he used it to  Attempt he hooked his laptop up to image it. Yeah  To you know free it  Free the journals  Anything else you guys want to talk about before we get to tips and numbers and tools? No, I think we did

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh  I thought it was I thought it was interesting that facebook has made some changes to trending topics  Oh, yeah, they can they continue to try and tweak  Kind of how that functions to uh, so now you will no longer get personalized trending topics, which I thought was interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So does that mean they're no longer algorithmic? Does it just no they'll be i'm sure they're algorithmic to some extent

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, i mean it'll be all how they

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Calculate by which I mean the the algorithm  Kind of non-algorithm would just be what are the most re-shared articles algorithmic or on some on some formulas

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I still think it's a crappy feature

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they also what they did something that I think was designed to make the quality better  Which was they're not just going to make a trend  If it's the most shared they're going to look at the most shared articles from a range  of sort of  Professional sources  so, oh, that's interesting hopefully I think they're hoping that will get rid of some of the  News articles from the website that the machedonian teens put together, right?

But you know what struck me when I was watching it  I remember when that story came out that he had found his village on google earth  And you know google earth was relatively new at the time  And I remember thinking to myself  I remember thinking this even when google earth first came out and everyone in my office was  looking at their street or  whatever, I just remember thinking that it was  One of the most one of those moments when you stop and you think that you're living in the future that it it was so  um  Yeah, I don't know. It just seemed so  Sci-fi it just seemed so futuristic that I didn't think it could possibly be happening let alone be free  For you to zoom in on anywhere on the globe and now we're so used to it  You know, I was watching the movie and I was thinking man.

Transcript:  Whoa? Wow  And 1300 for so-called tabloid cloaking which is their odd phrase for fake news  And that they admit is going to go up this year. It's a tiny number actually. These are just ads mind you  um  But it's a lot of publishers too, didn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was the I think that was more effective where they said to the macedonian kids you can't use ad sense anymore  Yeah, they blocked something 200 publishers. Yeah  Because those that's really how that stuff works is that you know, if you can't monetize it they go to other places

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Transcript:  Well good for google. Um, yep, so that's my number. Yep a good number. I have another number  Uh, it's kind of self-serving one of our advertisers but ring  The ring video doorbell just raised a third round of funding  Valuing them at 200 million dollars. What was the size of the front round? I think it was 100 million dollar  round of venture funding  So good for good on ring. They're really knocking it out of the park. I did not know this they did a deal  with a  Neighborhood in los angeles with the police department there to put ring doorbells on one in ten houses in the area  to cut crime  With apparently good effect. That's pretty cool. I think that's really neat. Yeah bravo  they raised we had mentioned we mentioned I think I'd mentioned in the ads that uh,  28 million dollars from um  Uh, richard branson was their first round but then I've been since then they had a second round of funding  Uh from goldman sax and qualcomm ventures and and now they're on a series d round  109 million dollar additional  Investments, so that's what i was going to mention. Yeah, have you heard of a 60 db? No, what's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I wrote about them  Just recently at fortune  It's a audio startup  and uh the thing the news hook for the  piece I wrote about was that they  have integrated with um  the echo  and basically they  Bring in not just all the podcasts you might want from like npr and all the usual sources, but a whole range of audio  so they actually take the audio from  video clips like if you like, um  Seth meyers, you know  Segment on his show you can get just the audio of that and you can basically control that through the echo  So you can walk around your house and say, you know  Give me the news from the top kind of sources  That 60 db has and it's on my screen here  Yeah, it's uh, I thought it was really it's always like it's uh, it's clips from shows  Yeah  And and regular podcasts and pretty much anything audio they're trying to get and you can do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can do it on the internet, but they also have an ios app  Yeah, signing in on the internet now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the app and the echo  It's a coordinate obviously. So if you leave your house, you can seamlessly move it from the echo to your phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So i'm going to pick these subjects  And oh this is great. So it's basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's two the two of the co-founders were early employees of netflix  Including one of the guys who came up with their recommendation engine and so they're hoping to do  Something similar for audio

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's an echo skill that I could say, okay listen to 60 db or something like that. Yeah. Yeah  Yeah, i'm signing up right now that sounds great.
