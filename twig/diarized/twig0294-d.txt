Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you. I'm not really a pro, but I play one on TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, increasingly, I think it's a small and shrinking group. So I think you can now say you're the guy on Google Plus. That's Jeff Jarvis left and he's also a Google Pro.  I hate April 1st.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I do too. This is the one day I don't want to do a show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hate it. Make it go away.  Jeff is the professor of journalism at the CUNY City University of New York school. He's also J school.  He's also a blogger at Buzz Machine and a book author. His latest experience gifts, but he also wrote public parts.  And what would Google do? Also with us, Kevin Marks, former Googler and Appler and BBC and BT and Salesforce.  He's been everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am now. I'm nicely at home in my garden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's in the garden. It's very good. It's a good place to be. Great to have you at once again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it is April Fool's. Should we just run through quickly?  There's com.google, which explains why Google was so hot to get the GTL D's in particular Google. It's backwards Google.  It even works. And somebody tells me transform in a browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, it's easy to make things backwards. Hey, we fixed it.  Try cast. Try anything. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Were you going to make Leo backwards? I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, make Leo backwards. Yeah. Now I fit my back. Now this is normal.  That's really weird. There's something wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's something very wrong. Yeah. And when you click a link, it doesn't like they have the Google Plus link, but it doesn't make it backwards.  They could do that. I don't know why they don't.  But somebody told me if you look at the code, there's Yahoo backwards in there somewhere.  So a little in joke. That's one. Then, of course, the big one I thought was really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Pac Man. Yeah, you guys talked about that last night, I'm sure. Yep. And showed it off on the phone as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can play Pac Man if you just go to your maps.google.com. You can play Pac Man in your hometown.  I'm playing it in Petaluma. Oh, quickly before Blinky gets to me. Run for the river, Pac Man. Oh, I just went. I don't know where I am.  Oh, yeah. You go off the edge. That's right. It is kind of brilliant. Isn't it? And listen to the sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've got the sound up. I don't know why. Oh, I heard that. That's not the sound you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why aren't I not sound is returned to good. Huh. Oh, here it is. That little thing. There we go. Now. Let it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now. Now, how do you feel? Do you have to license that sound? Yeah, sure they did. Yeah. I mean, it's a Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's exactly the sound Namco licensed it. Oh, it's like an AY 38910 chip. This is one of the four things it can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. You know what? That's probably a good point. It probably is built into the chip, isn't it? All right, Blinky.  Come here, baby. I'm going to eat you alive. I was really bad at this game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So can we play this on a map of London? That'd be much harder. Yeah, just much harder. Sure. Sure. Let's let's go back to Google Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you can go anywhere. I believe so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, what would be really hard is one of these like suburban mazes where where there's no actual. Yeah, there's no out. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dead end. Yeah, it works anywhere. So play play play Pac-Man. I think this is nicely done. Yeah. I mean, it's probably not that.  In fact, they probably reuse the code because didn't they have a Google Doodle that was a Pac-Man? I believe they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look, there's dead ends. Oh, oh, man. This is hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They even brought Google even brought Pac-Man into the ingress experience. They did. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So so if you're playing ingress, you have Pac-Man. Yeah, this is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this is the point about this is it's not a stupid make fun of people thing. I know.  Disrupt people's expectations with something playable. That's the April Fool's joke tradition that's actually good.  It's one of the things that Google's April Fool's jokes are a mixture of 50 percent cool shit like this and 50 percent painful.  We just wrote something not very funny at all. I like what Amazon's doing on their front page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is their old 1999 page. But then Amazon did something yesterday that I was sure was an April Fool's joke.  And it turned out not to be. What is it called? It's called the call dash buttons.  Dash button. So if you go to Amazon dot com slash dash button, if you're an Amazon Prime member, you get a free button that you press and orders stuff for you.  This is this is the most ridiculous thing. And it comes with I guess overlays for the products you can buy.  So you stick it to your dish, your clothes washer and you push it for tide or bounty paper towels or Huggies.  What do you put that in your baby's butt? Jollet fusion. But now can you only get one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The toddlers. The problem here is toddlers. Toddlers press buttons. Oh crap.  Oh crap. It's true. Toddler is going to walk around and press this button, make a nice little noise and then a week later you're going to know it goes to your phone first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it's not it doesn't just like the Amazon. You have the Amazon Echo. Same thing.  You talk. Actually, you don't have it. I don't anymore. But you talk to the Amazon Echo and when you say buy diapers, it doesn't automatically buy them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to in this case, I think it goes to the app. Well, I think that it can. What happens is, yeah, I think I think that can be a direct.  What happens is that if you order it and then order it again, it will send something to your phone.  And the other thing is that this is for prime members only and it's kind of an invitation only thing.  If they notice you make your buying Huggies all the time and you're a prime member, they'll contact you and say, hey, you know, do you want to you want this?  I said you so great, but I totally thought it was an April Fool's joke and it isn't. It's I mean, imagine right now they have 18, but they're probably going to have hundreds.  And of course, the companies, the brands behind this are going to really. So so when you order it, you order it for a particular brand.  Yes, you get it. It's not an overlay. They send you there's a glad button and they send it to you.  And I'm not putting the Laura Bar button in our snack cupboard because that would get the only place where I think this would be great is in the bathroom next to the toilet paper.  Yeah, because you're sitting there. It's not going to come in time.  Well, with drone delivery, you have one hour delivery now with drone delivery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You just have to sit there for an hour. You have a few things to read. That's OK. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you have to like go and answer the door. Right. Oh, I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it sends an order alert to your phone, but it does make the order. Yeah.  Unless you elect otherwise, it responds only to your first press until the order is delivered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have this problem where I see a new book is coming out and I preorder it and then three months later I see the same thing and I preorder it.  And then when the book actually comes out, I get to a stack of them. Yeah.  And, you know, that's a kind of but if I actually want a physical books, it should know better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I do have several copies of a few books. You're exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So if they've actually done, you know, debouncing of orders over time, they should do that for books.  You bounce everything. But you already bought that.  You want to try to tell you where it is in your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So these are the brands. You know, Kraft, macaroni and cheese. It's crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's not. I mean, of course, this is like mass market brand stuff.  Yeah, it's big mass market brand stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But of course, there are things that you order frequently, all of them. Right.  So it's mostly consumables like paper towels and razor blades, toilet paper.  I think I'm not sure if there's any food beyond the Kraft mac and cheese.  Actually, you know, I want this for salt for the water softener.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want to press a button. Yeah, I do, too. That's that's that would be useful.  That would actually be handy. There's not a profit in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is funny because they have a patent on the one click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wonder if this counts, if this is protected under the one click patent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that still extant? That was it seems like it was 20 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It feels like it. Anyway, this is not an April Fool's joke.  And I immediately requested it, but I haven't I haven't gotten the email yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe I don't. I buy a lot and subscribe and save.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ben Word started writing an April Fool's joke about this for an indie web version of this  and then then realized halfway through it was a good idea, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not a joke. There is a long mashable post with all the April Fool's jokes.  But I think people have finally gotten the message that there's some cruelty involved in really pranking people.  And we haven't had to fight a lot of. There's the Project McFly hovering mouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Geek usually does some good April Fool's stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do they have anything? Wasn't Unicorn Meat was a good one.  Oh, I like this. This is giving me hope for the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're learning the steam powered gaming cabinet.  I'd buy that. It's integrated steam engine power generated by burning coal or any other solid fuel.  You see a little light. And it works with Steam OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a little flame in the window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Only $399.99 by Watt and Newell.  Now you're playing with steam.  I think Geek always has some fun with these.  They got a bunch of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's where the Ton Ton sleeping bag came from.  Originally it was a joke. And then people said, no, we really want it.  So they actually made it.  It looks like a unicorn horn, but actually I think this is real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My favorite one is they have this gigantic selfie stick that puts GoPro cameras in 360 degrees around your head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That may or may not be a joke.  Did you see the selfie shoe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This was actually good. This was from I think a shoe company.  It's a shoe company. My wife buys shoes from that company.  Ms. Mooze.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the selfie shoe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's no more important than ever. Selfie sticks have helped get a better shot, but at the inconvenience of carrying it.  At Ms. Mooze, we understand the importance of looking great without giving up comfort.  The selfie stick is a great solution to a problem, but in turn it has created a new problem.  This was the opportunity for Ms. Mooze to create an even greater solution.  Introducing the selfie shoes.  No matter where you go, you'll always be camera ready.  Just insert the end of the fork, raise it to the perfect angle, and click the internal button with the tap of your toe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have to be able to kick like a rockette to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  To get the best range of angles, we have also added a docking port on each shoe.  So you can get a photo from either your right or your left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The great thing about the selfie shoes is that they look like a big clown shoe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So now both hands are free to be in the photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Finally.  We're all super pumped about the selfie shoes. With wearable devices on the horizon, the possibilities are endless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like his cardboard moose head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As well as making it look like a selfie shoe.  Yeah, that I'd buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So really...  I love the selfie shoe.  Love that!

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sign up to be one of the first to get a pair at MsMoose.com slash selfie shoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Alright, there's your plug, Ms. Moose. Why is my bell ringing?  I hate iOS 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We asked whether you can use my current location. I know it's time for the show.  I've got Do Not Disturb turned on.  But it's disturbing me.  Alright. Are we done with April Fools? Can we move on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Alright, we'll probably find some more before the show's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that me?  Yeah, that's you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who the hell is making that noise? Maybe it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you know, it's the chat room. Every time they say my name.  Every time they say my name. And they figured that out too.  Go ahead, chat room. Go ahead, chat room.  Now everybody's going to do it.  No, I just closed it. They figured it out.  You know what? I rebuilt this machine and so some of the things that I had turned off...  Yeah, see, look at the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Neil, Neil, Neil, Neil, Neil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google says, this shocks me.  Five percent of its site have ad injectors.  So the reason that this is of interest is of course, we talked about  Lenovo putting the Komodo or Komodia certificates in with Trufish.  And that's an ad injector.  The idea being that as you surf around with Trufish installed,  Lenovo has stopped doing this,  it would inject new ads onto pages you're visiting, ads that aren't there.  According to a study Google conducted with UC Berkeley,  five percent, one in twenty, have at least one ad injector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's malware that somebody got on their machine, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's the funny thing.  I call it malware. You call it malware.  It's not really malware exactly.  Lenovo said this is as a convenience to our customers.  So there are 192 of these and they're killing them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're basically pulling the plug on...  Thank you, Google.  Yeah, you'll now have a warning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Back way, way, way back in the day when I worked with Connie Nast,  worked for them, I think we were part of a big suit over this  because there were browsers that would pull up ads on others' sites.  And it was seen as a copyright violation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is the framing issue.  You remember site framing.  That's one of these things that people do over and over again.  So originally it would frame other sites but ads at the top.  And then there were other things.  The dig bar, remember the dig bar?  Yeah.  When Dig went and did that.  And this week's one is Nuzle, which does that on their Android client,  which is really annoying.  So they say, look, all your friends are reading this page  and click on the page and it's not in your browser,  it's in their app and you can't actually get the page underneath it.  And if you try and share it, it shares their link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot of people get bit by this.  If you download software from many of the download sites,  I don't know if download.com does an ad injector,  but they do a lot of other stuff.  I wouldn't be surprised if they did an ad injector.  A lot of sites...  The reason we can't call it, or I can call it malware,  but the reason it's not called malware is because usually there is a checkbox  hidden somewhere that you checked and said, yeah, yeah, I want that.  This is on the way to doing what you actually want.  And they have an uninstall entry in the programs and features control panel on Windows.  So if you do that, then it's hard...  Then antivirus vendors and others are hard pressed to call it malware.  Does Google even call it malware?  No, they just say harmful programs.  Harmware, fine.  Harmware. It's malware. Of course it's malware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this study is going to come out in detail on May 1st,  so we might want to revisit this because there might be some interesting details to be discovered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It bites basically normal users who aren't really kind of vigilant about what's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even on the Chromebook, I got stuck with some kind of extension that did...  What?  Yeah, some extension that I had installed that did this kind of crap and finally I looked up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, that shouldn't happen because a Chromebook has to be signed, right?  Isn't that right, Kevin?  In order to install something on Chrome OS, it has to be signed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, but there are legitimate, you know, modified the thing I'm reading plugins as well.  Right, and those are signed.  You can't tell, I've been a show, whether rewriting the page that you're on is a good thing or a bad thing.  The Pinterest plugin will rewrite the page to give you a pinless button, for example.  So the challenge is working out which ones are ones you actually want, which ones you forgot about.  I mean, there's a useful tip actually is to go and check which Chrome extensions you have installed  because the problem is they do load in every tab, which means you are potentially loading a lot of extra stuff.  Oh, that's interesting. They load in every tab.  So one of the reasons that Chrome may slow down is that you've got some extension plugged in that wasn't written very well  and that's why that's one of the reasons that Chrome is slow down is like as well as every page you're loading is loading that extension too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So go to the hamburger on the right of your toolbar in Chrome and go to more tools and select extensions.  You'll see a list. You can disable them or trash them.  And then there's often, by the way, more information and sometimes even options there that you might not have seen.  I have quite a few of them. And this is what happens when you use a Chromebook, right, Jeff?  Is that you start putting extensions in because these are your apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and I go through occasionally and just turn off a whole bunch of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Also, I'm not sure, but I think it will it will sync installed extensions across.  It does.  So if you install one on your Mac, it'll put it on the Chromebook and vice versa, which may not be what you thought was going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had a case this week where I'm going to New Delhi for 24 hours. How's that for insane?  And I had to apply for a visa, which, thank goodness, you can now do online.  Used to be you had to go through the whole McGill.  So they wanted my passport page at only three hundred in size and it come out as a as a Meg every time.  And so I didn't know how to do it. So how did I make a P.D.? I had to make a PDF and make it smaller.  So I'm going through trying to find extensions, extensions, extensions, extensions.  I end up installing five things for PDFs that I get about, of course, and they're there.  And I'll go through eventually. I don't know that many. I'll kill them off.  But but that's how you that's how you do get a little did you find a solution to that?  I made it a gift and then reduce the cancel this trip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was the easiest way I was about to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's little things like that with the bite you with the Chromebook that you just get used to doing on a normal computer.  And all of a sudden, it's like, well, oh, I don't have that.  Although and I'll show you later in my tool, it's getting there.  The few things that I said, oh, I can't I have to have a real computer for are the numbers dwindling rapidly, including I got Skype now.  Yeah, I'm really I'm really liking the pixel. The new pixel is fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Problem is, you can't you know, and we'll talk about the other Chrome Chrome announcements this week, too.  And so I obviously love it. It's not like you could have a show on this week in Chrome because what do you say?  Right. Yep. There it is.  This is the show. This is it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That and all about Android between the two of them.  I think we're covering it. But good tip, Kevin, to go through your extensions and remove stuff that you're not using because that takes each of them takes up memory and resources.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's kind of says I'm not sure that Chrome, you know, Chrome has that is like who's using my around view, but I'm not sure it breaks out extensions.  That would be nice if it did, wouldn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good question. There is a task manager in the Chromebook, which surprised me in Chrome OS.  You can see who's using CPUs. You can even do top a topic command in the shell, which is kind of nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a well, there's in any Chrome. There's a task manager. What's it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Ingress is coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, you know, you know, Leo, I gotta give you points. You do exhibit intellectual honesty.  You're going to make me eat crow again.  No, I'm saying the opposite. I'm saying the opposite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of backhandedly.  I'm saying this with respect and love.  Yes, because I was I was very dismissive of Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I take my hat off to you. No, I'm so serious.  Many others would still just hang on and say, yeah, but yeah, but a lot of people do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Microsoft made a lot of hay with their pawn stars ads.  Yeah, but you can't use it offline. And of course you can use it offline.  You can do more and more. They've really they've not only do they have extensions, but they also have apps now, which are kind of really just browsers in a separate window.  But it really feels like an operating system more and more.  And then there's very little I can't do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the task manager does include plugins. That's useful.  So we see which ones are chewing up RAM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, good. Good.  Should we talk about the new the new Chrome stuff this week?  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apparently, one GPU process is eating five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How do you see the task manager in Chrome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Click on the. Oh, more tools.  Task manager. There it is. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's funny is you really have Chrome OS on your system.  And when you even if you're on a Mac, because Chrome is Chrome OS, pretty much.  Yeah. Yeah. Background page, Google Drive, secure shell.  These are all running. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you can see who's got RAM. So yeah, my Google Drive page in the background is chewing up stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, stats for nerds. Did you click on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have stats for nerds. That gives you pages on the OS. Oh, Lord above.  About memory measuring. Oh, this is this is memory use.  Page in, page out. What is that? OK, explain. OK.  Finally, we get somebody here could explain what the hell that means.  Because all task managers will show the page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry. Go ahead. Sorry.  So the point is that with with units like OS is like Mac OS and Chrome OS,  you are allocating memory, but not all of the memory is actually in memory.  Some of it is elsewhere. So you're saying I want this much memory.  And the operating system is deciding how much is actually on RAM and how much is is paged out to disk.  So page in means actually using it in the in the memory of your machine.  And page out means it's on the disk and bring it back as needed.  And you often the tricky bit is that because of the way page mapping works is there's  each process will have a bunch of shared pages, which are operating system pages and things  so that they will all be mapped into the same process memory space.  But they will actually all map to the same piece of the operating system.  So the page in page out, it can look like you're using more memory than in your physical machine in the in the page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They even say that in a footnote on the memory redirect page.  Due to memory sharing between processes, summing memory usage does not give total memory use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is interesting. Yeah. And there's a link to their own bug in it, which is wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know. They say this page will show memory for all running browsers, not just Chrome. That's interesting.  Bug. We seriously over count our own memory usage.  They have to say that, though, because, you know, if you look at it and it says you're using 49.  What are you using? Forty nine megabytes of actually that's all that's been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But where's that? So the virtual list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the virtual list is they've all got every piece has got three gigs in it because they've all got the same stuff paged in.  But what I was you know, you don't the point about this is you only really want this if you're debugging your own pages and plugins.  But the other one is useful to say what are these things that are lurking around here on my machine?  Let's go and clean them up. Yeah. And it's a I realize I haven't done this for a while, so I should go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's always interesting. Google is putting Chrome in more places.  The Chrome OS, the Chrome bit dongle will be coming soon from Google.  I also thought this was an April Fool's joke at first. I did.  But this is cool. I love this. So Intel at CES announced a PC on a stick that would do much the same thing.  Android's been available on a stick for some time.  In fact, you know, Google TV and Roku and there's a lot of fire TV.  They're all look like USB keys, but they really don't have a USB connector.  They have an HDMI connector and you can plug them into your TV and then a computer run.  So this is Chrome OS. Asus, I guess, is going to make it for about one hundred dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, now this the the the next web story says that but the price has not been announced.  What they did say is that it's going to be under one hundred dollars.  And that seems to me to be anywhere near one hundred dollars. Sounds really high to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it should be seventy fifty thirty. Well, the Chromecast is thirty five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, but but the Chromebook now you can get Chromebook for one hundred and forty nine dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now two Chromebooks for one hundred fifty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A thumb drive should be more than fifty dollars cheaper than an entire laptop. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what's the use case for this? Because it is on your TV. Go to a hotel.  Go to a hotel. You have to bring a wireless Bluetooth keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's why. I've got an idea for you, Google. I'm telling you, this is a good idea.  You should your Android phone should be should be able to operate as a as a Bluetooth keyboard.  Because you're not going to be using heavy duty stuff on this.  Let me pull up that page. Let me show you the presentation. Let me do this. Let me do that.  Right. Then then you don't need to plug it. You plug in power. Right.  USB power. And then you just use your your phone as as as as mouse and keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  At that point, you might as well just use the Chromecast. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody you're trying. Well, no, the Chromecast has the problem of the Wi-Fi stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the Chrome is due this summer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The idea for this is really it's for at mass at volume.  And this thing, it does get cheaper, does get like, you know, thirty raspberry pie ish.  Then the idea is this is for poorer schools and such who have have TVs, don't have computers and they can now have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Anybody who's got an old HDMI monitor lying around suddenly has a Chrome box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Exactly. You've got to buy a Bluetooth keyboard mouse, which.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. That's why I'm saying it's exactly why I'm saying then then use your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. What do I know? The challenge is what this is for me is this is the Chrome box shrunken.  So the Chrome box is exactly this device. Yeah.  And, you know, we we got one I know a couple of years ago, my son used it as as his desktop computer for over a year  with precisely this setup is like, oh, we have your cheap. Yeah.  Yeah. No, no, because he had his main computer was that was that was the Chromebook and he was taking the pixels to school.  But his desktop computer then became a Chromebox. I think it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the use case here for a lot of people is the fact that if you're using a Chromebook, if that's your computing system,  whatever, then you can pretty much use any you can you can do it anywhere.  Yeah. And so this is something you can carry in your pocket, you know, assuming you can figure out the keyboard part of it.  And, you know, you basically have a Chromebox at home and then you go when you're wandering around, you just plug it in any TV or monitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love carrying this in my pocket. Yeah. So this is a April Fool's joke, obviously, the self crowd self browsing Chromebook.  Rethink how you browse the web with a self browsing Chromebook with one click.  You're off surfing the web, no input needed. So you don't need the keyboard in the mouse.  You just lean back and we'll take you there quickly, simply and secure what you want.  It's the ultimate Google. Right.  So, unfortunately, it's not compatible with my system, but but it says it runs on Chrome OS.  So maybe you ought to download it right now and see how it works.  Jeff, I'm unfortunately using a Mac. Why?  Because well, it's really a simple thing. First of all, I don't want to waste my Chromebook here.  But also, also the issue is there's a weird we tried this with the first Chromebook.  I should try it with a new one, but I can't I can't do this.  What we're doing right now, which is get it to the screen video out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm going to regret this. OK, it's installed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Introducing Chrome Selfie. If you here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hold the camera. Oh, my God. What's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it is. It's actually doing it. It's like stumble upon.  Oh, Solve for X. OK, so brought to you to solve for X.  That's a great Google site, kind of their Ted talks.  And now it's bringing you to a plus page. Now research at Google.  It is literally self driving. And you know what? Google stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Germans are going to use this to prove that Google is just promoting its own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Because it is all Google sites so far.  It's stumble upon for Google.  It's fast, by the way, you barely have time to read anything.  Wait a minute. That's not that's not Google.  Is it all blogger sites to? Oh, maybe it's blogger sites.  Holy cow. Now it's a Google Maps of some place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like in the middle of nowhere. Look like it was Burning Man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Burning Man. Oh, wow. It even showed Google in Spanish, right?  Google Spain and wait, that's Wikipedia.  So it is more than Google sites. Yeah. So it's just all over.  Fantastic for what you're getting. I see what happened.  So it's just following a random link on a page.  That's why that's probably what it's doing. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's finding a link on the page and then clicking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're lucky you didn't get stuck in Wikipedia. Oh, you're back.  So now you're going to be in Wikipedia for a while because a lot of Wikipedia links go back to Wikipedia.  Huh. All right. I'll put that on my my pixel.  It has to do something overnight. Well, that's not a bad screen saver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just leave it. Leave it. It is. Maybe that's what this is for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. All right.  It's funny because I clicked the link on Fast Company.  I'm sorry. On the next Web. And it brought me that instead.  This is this is where we wanted to go. More Chromebooks.  This is the cheap Chromebooks. Here's this is a ASUS Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The flip this one. This one. I mean, it's going to be ridiculous.  I'm going to end up with five Chromebooks. I know this is only two hundred fifty bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This one I'm very good all the way around. So it turns kind of into a tablet tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fifteen millimeters thick. It's going to be running Amazon things.  I mean, I want to say Android things. Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it is. It's Android. And within within within six weeks or so, everything, all the Chromebooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll run Android apps. Yes. That's going to be a very nice first.  That's going to be a very nice thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To me, this higher Chromebook 11 and the Hisense Chromebook cost one hundred and forty nine dollars.  That's a that's an astonishingly low price. Yeah. At Walmart and Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Eleven point six inch screen. Hisense is the Chinese company that wants to get into the TV business.  They took over Microsoft's booth at CES.  Yes. Hires been around for a long time selling very inexpensive refrigerators and drugstore appliances basically.  Wow. One hundred fifty bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ironic. The cheapest. And it's and it's like eight hours battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah, because it's got the slowest processor in the world, probably. Yeah. Eight and a half hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I tell you, increasingly, I've been recommending these to people who say, you know, I ask them, what do you want to do?  Almost everybody says the same thing. I want to surf the Web and do email.  And it's just crazy to buy something so complex and expensive as a Windows PC or or a Mac when you when a Chromebook will do it all and do it securely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The one thing I still want is I want to I've said this before. I want a message to you, Michael Dell.  I want you to do a fully customizable Chromebook.  There's not that many choices. Right. But how much memory, LTE, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You want what we've all been saying, the mid range Chromebook.  Let me custom make it and add my own stuff to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's my own fault that it costs six hundred bucks. I'd be happy.  So, Mike, tell us about this story. This is from Business Insider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Android is going to be on Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they talked about this at Google I.O. last year.  And basically what's going to happen is that they're, you know, they're increasing.  It's all under Sundar Pichai now. He's got, you know, he used to be just Chrome Chrome Chrome OS.  Now Android is under him.  And there's increasing integration, not only the ability to run actual Android apps on Chrome,  and there's going to be a handful of apps on these devices.  And then within a within a few month, month and a half, two months,  it's going to be able to run on all Chrome OS's, everything that is capable of doing so.  And it's going to be, you know, it's going to be an app by app thing.  But eventually, I think that all all Android apps are going to run easily on Chromebooks and on Chrome.  And in addition to that, Chrome is actually Chrome OS is actually starting to evolve from an interface perspective  to be more like Android typefaces, little things like that.  So there seems to be a desire to unify these.  And it'll get to the point very quickly where you'll wonder why you have both.  I mean, if you look at this flip thing that turns into a tablet, so now you have this Chrome tablet.  Right. So why would you have a Chrome tablet instead of an Android tablet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm already taking calls on my Chromebook because I use Hangouts and I give out a Google Voice number.  So when my phone rings, it rings my actually rings my everything.  And you're like, and I can answer that call on an iPad, as a matter of fact, or anything, whatever I happen to have nearby.  Sure, the house wakes up like crazy because everything's ringing and everything has its own ring tone.  It's a little crazy. But but the other thing that's but just just to make make a point about that, though,  Apple's doing the same thing with continuity and handoff. But you have to have an iPhone and a Mac.  And so it's really kind of it's a very it's a closed ecosystem, whereas Google has made voice work on everything.  So I literally can take a Google Voice call on an Apple device, on an Android device.  Don't think I can do it on a Windows phone device yet or ever.  But that's pretty cool. Yeah. The openness is really nice. It is. Yeah.  Not that Google's open everywhere. Android Wear doesn't obviously work with an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much effort does it take to port an app to Android for Chrome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That I don't know. Right now, the way you do it is you you don't recompile the app.  You run it through a little doohickey and then the APK will just work on a Chromebook.  Isn't it? Oh, wait a minute. You have to have a stub of something.  And I can't remember. I haven't. What did you do to get Skype working?  You had I installed you have. So you have an extension that's running that is an Android emulator, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. His name. I'm suddenly forgetting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No reason why my Google couldn't put it make an emulator be part of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, surely they're going to make it easier than that because I don't really run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and they already did this with Evernote, right?  The reason Evernote has an app as well as an extension, as well as a website, is because Google's already done this privately with Evernote.  So that they're so the Evernote app is actually the Android app. Yeah.  I'm just I I just like how it's coming along here. Yeah, you too.  It really it's you know, talk about the O.L.P.C., the hundred dollar one laptop per child.  We're really one hundred fifty bucks. Yeah. Yeah.  We're getting there. Quality machine. And they're decent qualities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Real keyboard. Well, well, these are these are a little bit better.  I mean, compared to an O.L.P.C. machine. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the beauty of it is that the kids can go home, leave this, leave the machine at school.  They can go home and log into their their accounts.  And, you know, whatever it is, they were working on that's really awesome.  Yeah. And this is the big problem with, you know, with Apple trying to sell iPads to schools.  You know, this is you can't do that.  So you have to send them home with an iPad. Now the kids at Target for theft because, of course, somebody's going to mug these kids for this expensive piece of consumer electronics.  And so that doesn't work. And it's just it's just a fantastic thing.  Now, to me, one of the most exciting developments in the Chrome OS world is the fact that the new Chrome launcher 2.0 is going to be Google now centric.  So in the future, you see cards. Yeah.  In the near future, you're going to turn on your Chrome, you know, get open your pixel and it's going to be Google now.  That's what you want to see. But we already see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, Jeff, because there is a notification in the on the system bar in the right that is a number that's the number of now cards that are available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, which I go back to my usual apps problem because my main account is apps.  I get hardly anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So is this the tool you used? Arc welder, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm trying to find it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this this this will you run.  So you need the arc, which is the Android runtime for Chrome.  And then you run the APK. You have to get the APK of Skype or whatever.  And you run it through arc welder and that somehow processes it and makes it possible.  So here's another extension to install.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What I have to do is I have to go to the my extensions and get it there.  If you go to last week's rundown, it has what I used.  OK, I thank you at the bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't remember. Let me see. Where was it? Oh, yeah, because you talk about.  Yeah, that's right. Hold on here.  It's a pretty big extension. It's 103 megabytes so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hold on. How long before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, if it is getting wild and open right now, it's more like an operating system.  How soon before it becomes a problem?  Or did they design Chrome OS so well that it never will be a problem?  What do you think, Kevin? Is he there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry, I missed some contacts because I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're just talking about running Android apps on Chrome.  That's imminent. Right.  And I'm just wondering as one of the reasons Chrome OS works so well is because it was so restricted.  But we've got now a big store growing fast and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, to some extent, I mean, you know, the point is, it's the design is clear.  It's designed to run a web browser and web apps really well.  So if you're going to start running Android apps for a different kind of thing, you may need to optimize it for that.  Right. So that's a there is a difference in thinking about which which one you're going to run.  But as Moore's law keeps doing its thing, so you probably be able to run and running an emulator on your on your Mac is worked for running Android apps for a while.  But it doesn't work that great because it's it's it's got a lot of wrapper on top of it.  The question is, how much of that wrapper can you get away and how much can you make it go direct to GPU?  And given that they control the OS, they probably got ways to do the shortcuts for that.  And maybe that is that what the art world thing is to happen to that before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the thing that worries me about Arc welder is you get it.  You side you have to kind of sideload an APK somewhere.  So the thing I use is twerk, but I think it's basically the same twerk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Arc welder is new. Yeah.  So I have to go to launch Skype. This is not ready for mortals.  I have to go to the extensions, find it, open the package that was created, then Skype launches.  And I still I still want to do a test with with you, Jason, just to see how it works.  I don't know. It's Kevin's point.  I don't know if it's if the fact that it's going through that wrapper is that affecting the performance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. It's funny because you can you can simplify that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The chairman was saying twerk, Leo, twerk.  But I thought they actually wanted me to twerk.  But no, they were telling me no, no, Leo. No one wants you to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was okay. No offense. I was hopeful. No, I it's aspirational.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Someday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The other thing here is that what you kind of would want is a bit like the emulator experience where you want the Android app running in a small window, not taking over the whole screen.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. But but in some cases, I think just the opportunity that I've already written an app for Android and now I can just run on Chrome, however, auto run on a browser, that's free.  Right. That's that's like that's like responsive.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. But the challenge is, you know, Android will have a go at laying it out.  But there aren't any Android tablets that have that many pixels.  Well, maybe there's you know, there's a few, but not not many in the market.  So most of the apps wouldn't have been tuned for that.  And also if they have the biggest sort of design challenge these days is the difference between portrait and landscape things.  And this is a battle that's ongoing.  And we've had this, you know, we've had this for a while in that the Macs keep getting narrower and narrower that way.  So you end up with this very wide screen thing and the phones the other way around.  And so the design challenges, am I putting a tall thing or a wide thing?  And the irony recently has been happening with video web periscope wants you to use portrait mode video.  And everyone in video is like, no, you're losing a third of the screen.  Except that if you're watching on a portrait mode screen, you're losing a third of the screen when you watch landscape.  So it is it's an ongoing, you know, ongoing problem we have, which is which way around is this thing.  Does it make sense to be wide or tall?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I apologize. Arc welder is for testing.  You still would use torque to convert it.  So Arc welder is more for developers to see if their app will work as as compiled.  And we should mention that you can if you want to try the Google Now cards on Chrome OS, all you have to be is in the beta channel.  So if you if you go to about Chrome in your Chrome on your Chromebook and select the beta channel, you should get this new launcher,  which I have and I hadn't played with now features.  So if you see this launcher, you got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Restart to update someone update my Chromebook.  Yeah, we've done it in a few seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I know. That's nice, too.  Boy, that pixel boots in about three seconds.  Yeah, I've never seen anything boot faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you get the new pixel?  No, the old one was fast and this one's this one is instant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's amazing.  I don't know. You're right.  Now, now, Jeff, I've gone too far on the other side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was my entire idea.  You succeeded.  No time.  You hypnotize me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microsoft is finally adding reverse scrolling to Windows 10.  We were talking about this on Windows Weekly.  You know, on the Chromebook, it's funny because it's in a setting they call it Australian scrolling.  But I want everything to scroll like my Mac does because I use the Mac and I just if so, finally, Windows 10 will do it.  Chrome OS does it.  But Google is going to improve scrolling on Chrome.  Using a Microsoft invention, according to this story, Tom Warren writing for the Verge, it's going to support pointer events, a standard that was introduced in Internet Explorer.  Touch events is available right now in Safari.  Microsoft, Mozilla and Opera have adopted pointer events.  And while they were using touch events, they are now going to pointer events.  Don't know what any of this means at all.  Touch handlers will be replaced with pointer event handlers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is one of those like long running web standardization problems, which is that to touch events were pushed by Apple for Safari and then adopted by others.  But it's very much focused on I'm operating this thing with my finger.  Whereas Microsoft, because they were building the tablets that had both touch screens and mice, wanted this more nuanced thing that will pointer events.  And clearly that's a better fit with Chrome because Chrome has both modes as well.  Whereas Apple doesn't have touch screens on their laptops yet.  So they don't see this as important.  So it's one of those like, why would I care about that type of things from Apple?  So it just makes building websites a little bit more annoying at the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is the functionality difference?  I mean, from the point of view of the end user, I mean, even on a touch device, you would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the big difference is that on one of the things that people get frustrated with is that if you got a touch device, you don't have it.  You have like a long press gesture, which means that when you click the screen, it has to decide whether you're making a press or a long press.  So there was a lot of 300 milliseconds when you click things, because it was waiting to see what kind of press you were making.  And so that was slowing down the websites.  Whereas the pointer event, because you've got alternative gestures, because you can right click or because you can control click or whatever, you can short circuit that thing.  So the bit that's slightly weird is that the gesture staff doesn't integrate with that one.  We've had this problem forever, which is that if you do a two-finger...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if I use pointer events, then how do I do a long press? Can I do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you can. It maps. I think it maps a right click to a long press or it maps a long press to a right click or something.  So the problem is there's a set of gestures that you use that are different between these devices.  And it's trying to unify them and what makes sense to the app on the other side of it so that you get the right ones by default.  But you can reinterpret them if you want to.  And the classic one of these is the mouse wheel event, which you scroll the mouse wheel with your finger and that gets mapped to different things.  And the problem is Google Maps maps it to zoom, which makes sense if it is an actual mouse wheel.  But it means if you try and two-finger scroll the map, it zooms in instead, which has been a bug for something like five years and still drives me mad.  I try and try and pan the Google Map the way I would pan anything else on the Mac.  So there's this sort of mismatch of affordances between which of these gestures are you trying to do and how does that map to what the app on the other side is trying to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But there's no perfect solution. You sacrifice in either direction, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the point is you've got to try and come up with a set that makes sense. So that's what the standardization discussions going on are.  So pointer events was an attempt to come up with a more inclusive thing that included both.  But Apple wasn't interested in it because they think they were thinking those two separate things.  And the question is whether they'll adopt that too or is everyone who is writing code for this going to have to adapt to having one set of events from the Mac and iOS things and another set from the others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the kind of thing that the engineers and standard setters fight for decades over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And then the lawyers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the challenge with this web standardization stuff is we've.  Well, you want this long version.  The long version of this is standardization is basically a process of documentation.  People implement things and then we try and document how they behave so other people can make them do the same things.  So if you think about standardization like that, then it makes sense for it to have a lag.  The problem is, is that once you've done that for a little bit, then people go to the spec place and look at the spec to implement and implement it.  And so in their head, the standards body is not a documentation body.  It's a legislation body is telling you what you should do.  And once people have that mindset, then they go to the standards bodies with the mindset of legislators lobbying for their organization or for their obsession or whatever.  And the standards bodies get full of these people whose entire focus in life is one particular little thing.  Or the focus is, no, I'm not going to accept that.  I'm do everything to filibuster that out of the standard cause.  We don't think it's interesting.  And that's when the standards bodies turn into depressing political places.  And that's normally what happens then is a new standard body is forked off and we start again with the documentation process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we don't invite those other guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But this is what happens because the people who are trying to get agreement are frustrated by the people who are trying to make their point in their direction.  And this goes back and forth a lot.  So the classic web version of this was the what WG, which was the W3C had become this very legislative mindset place and has a bit of that anyway because it's got a membership body and so on.  So there's sort of the classic standards bodies like ISO are these legislative processes where you're trying to pass a law that will say how everything works in that way.  W3C had got captured by that mentality.  And so they were focusing on standards that they thought everyone should implement.  Whereas the browser people were like, no, we're trying to do these things.  What's going on?  So WG was effectively a coalition of the people, both the people building websites and the people building browsers to say, how can we make this less annoying for our use cases because W3C doesn't care about our issues at the moment.  And that was the iteration that became HTML5 and W3C realized that they'd gone off beam and said, OK, right, we'll take that back into our process and absorb that.  But there's still this sort of two headed process going on.  What WG is doing HTML, the open standard, the living standard, and W3C is now working on HTML5 plus or HTML6, whatever they're calling it this week, and trying to hit sort of unitary version.  So there's it comes from a different process, but it also comes to this different sort of mental model.  And a lot of things I've seen with the standards work that I've done over the years has been the progress is often made by these ad hoc groups that say, OK, we're all trying to do the same thing.  Can we get this done and then document it, iterate, have that and then try and take it to the standards body for ratification, if you like.  So you would say, OK, we're at the point now where we think this makes sense.  Let's take this to the ITF or W3C.  And the problem is it can then get bogged down in process again.  Another example of that would be OAuth. OAuth was an ad hoc group of people saying we need a way for one website to authenticate to another website.  We came up with something and there were some problems and coalitions, but it was mostly done by small groups in Silicon Valley, which can be a problem too.  And then it went to the ITF for OAuth 2 and is now this standard that is so complicated that it's very hard to make it interoperate because everyone wanted to add their own little use case to the SPAC.  So you hit this problem quite a lot.  So pointer events and touch events is an example of one of these things.  Touch events was Apple needed a new way for you to be able to respond to the things that you could do on iOS that you couldn't do with a desktop browser.  So that was touch events.  And pointer events was an iteration that was trying to work with a concept that I have both a touch screen and a keyboard and a mouse and that they're different.  And they started in those different camps.  One started in the Windows camp because they were their tablets and the touch events are in the Apple camp.  And what's going on now is people trying to make them fit together and correlate.  So it's one of these like I think it's mostly a good faith effort, but they start from different premises.

Transcript:  If you want to have fun, if you want to add enough of this discussion, the bug tracker on the Chromium site is issue 162757,  which was started in November 2012 and continues.  They actually closed it two days ago because there were so there were one hundred forty eight comments and they reopened it as issue 471824.  The debate rages on, but it's really fun to actually watch the Google engineers slowly change their tune and and adopt.  Yeah. And then everybody else is pissed.  So you can't you can't win.  It's one of those. And it's a lot of fun.  All right. We're going to take a break.  We'll come back. Lots more to talk about, including Meerkat.  We haven't mentioned it in like three days.  So it's dead already. You don't need. Oh, it's dead.  Thank God. What's the new thing?  Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks.  This is something that stuck around.  I started using it 10 years ago.  If you are in a business for yourself, if you're a freelancer and you send out invoices, biggest P I T A ever.  End of the month comes.  The last things I want to do is fire up Excel or Word, get all my expenses together and create an invoice.  But if you don't do it, here's what I learned as a freelancer.  You don't get paid. So fresh.  I was it was really suffering.  Amber MacArthur told me about FreshBooks back when I was going up to Toronto every every month because I had invoice Rogers not only with with, you know, for my my day rate, but also for all the travel and stuff.  And I was literally waiting like six months at a time. I would do.  It's not good. FreshBooks was the first Web 2.0 site ever used.  Now it's kind of silly even to say that it's still great.  It is it is a cloud based accounting that will help you save time with your billing, get paid faster.  In fact, on average, FreshBooks customers get paid five days faster.  They also seem to double their revenue in the first 24 months. I'm not sure what that's all about.  I guess if you're smart enough to use FreshBooks or maybe maybe because you save so much time not doing invoices that you could you can do more work, more of the important stuff, the money making work.  I'm not sure what it is. FreshBooks has award winning mobile apps on Android and iOS, which makes it easy not only keep track of time and hours, but you can actually snap pictures of receipts, get them right into the invoice, works with multiple currencies.  That was important for me because I was, you know, invoicing in Canadian dollars as well as US dollars.  You can bill in any currency and most importantly, it's really easy for your clients to pay you.  There's a pay button on the invoice and they work with Stripe and PayPal, Fundbox, Zen Payroll, a lot of different services and apps.  So it's really easy for your clients to pay you. And I think that's why you get paid faster.  Should you have a slow pay? FreshBooks takes care of that too with automated payment reminders.  It is just the greatest. And when it's time for taxes, I know we're thinking about that now.  Your accountant, whoever does your taxes, maybe you, you'll love it because the reports are so great.  I want you to try FreshBooks. It's free, no obligation. Start your 30 day free trial at freshbooks.com slash twig.  And if they ask you, how did you hear about us? Don't forget, tell them this week in Google, freshbooks.com slash twig.  I am so glad these guys are still around after 10 years. They do great stuff and they just saved my life.  FreshBooks.com slash twig. Let's see. We did. Oh, is this an April Fool's Joke Smart Box?  OK, we're not going to do it. See, I got bit. The Smart Box by inbox. Is this something?  Is this something? Yeah, the mailbox of tomorrow. Gosh darn it.  I got to say it looks pretty neat though.  Now, here's a question. And I saw this a couple of like a few days ago and I thought this can't be right.  Globrunner, which is a big SEO agency, claims they hired Matt Cutts to be their directors of search. Is that true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is not. Thank God. I emailed Matt about it. I said, is this true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He should be a little miffed because it doesn't look like it's a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What did he say? Such an inside joke. I know that that would be a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he said, ah, the new career is just some search engine optimizers playing an April Fool's prank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but they did it early. They did it like four days early. I saw it. I thought this cannot be unless they offered Matt so much money that he decided to go to the outside.  Matt Cutts, of course, good friend of the show. He's a bit of a regular. He's on next week. He's on next week. So I'm glad to have him back.  He is I don't know. Part of this is he's free floating right now for years. One of the first Google employees.  He was in charge of fighting spam and search results kind of. And he did Webmaster Tools and he talked about good SEO versus bad SEO.  But he's been on leave for a while and we thought maybe, I don't know, maybe he's so he's Matt's own joke is there next on the on the rundown.  Oh, is it? Yes. All right. He says he's going to go to work for a new project. It's at his blog so I can trust this one.  My next project, auto SEO. Oh, SEO ninja.  How much would you pay never to have to worry about keyboard density, H1 headers or meta descriptions again?  How about free? That's right. Auto SEO is free for individual students.  Again, you have to know this is an inside joke. Yeah. Well, then go to it. It's nicely designed. Go to SEO. Ninja.  Did you go to the bottom? Yeah, at the bottom. Copyright April what? FAQ? Reduce your stress. Get back your time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What? I think the joke is it doesn't do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, because that's what Matt's always said. You don't need to do SEO. Just do good content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everything else is a snake oil. FAQ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Invite. Request an invite. Yeah, that's kind of nice. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Free for students, individuals and self-installed.  That's hysterical. I love it. So Matt, come back. Well, we'll see him next week. We'll find out what he's up to.  He's still doing his 30 day challenges. I know that.  But now that Gina is only every month, we don't really do the change log per se, but a couple of things new in Google.  Your photos and files together and drive up to now. Photos have been stored in a separate thing called photos.  But now they'll actually just be visible when you look at your your Google Drive. I doubt they're going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like there'll be an extra copy or anything. It's just you'll be able to see them. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mine showed up. It's rolling out over the next few weeks. Mine showed up yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So if you go to drive. Yeah, let me see. Does that go the other way around as well?  Did the photos you uploaded to drive previously end up in your photos up on Android? Yeah, I got it. Look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No. Well, no. Mine are coming soon. These are Google Plus photos.  And what's cool also is that it will. So, for example, there's no point in you're showing me, but you could plug this in if you really wanted to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what do I do? Where do I go for this? Just go to drive. Drive.Google.com. It's in the other side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'll see a Google Photos. If you have it. Well, even if you don't have it, because I don't, you're going to have an entry under my drive and shared with me Google Photos.  But when you click it, if you have it, you'll see photos. I don't even have the entry. So you're really behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go to this. Go to the screen. There you go. That's now Mike. Mike is seeing his photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So basically what this is, these are a bunch of. Well, he's the pro. He's the Google Plus pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I also have terabytes of I'm exaggerating, but tons of pictures on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you know, my course is guess what? I'm looking at my apps account. Oh, you won't see it at all there. You'll never get Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't see it on Google Apps. But anyway, what's interesting to me is that it will put your auto awesome.  So, you know, Google Plus will create an auto awesome and then the auto awesome show up in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, come on, this is just a link. It's not. I mean, you're in photos right now. It just appears to be in drive. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep.  And do you have photos in yours? Well, I have to mine say stay tuned. Your photos are coming soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, my Google photos to my drive make it easier. Add full. Yes, I guess I will add folder create folder. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is his face thrown out. This reminds me that it was one year ago that the auto hoffsums were being done.  Oh, that's right. This is the April Fool's joke where they'd add our Hasselhoff. Yes, they'd have David Hasselhoff to your. That was awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was hilarious. Yeah. And I think I think they're still in there. Right. If you have a hoff. I do have lots of hoffsums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was well done. I have quite a few hoffsums. In fact, I remember that because I was using a time hop and it showed me everything from last year.  Time hoff. Time hoff. I love time hop. Time hop. Now I have photos so long. I actually got a time hop from seven years ago. Wow. That's amazing.  So time hops an app, Android and iOS that will go through you add all your accounts will go through your tweets.  I still haven't been able to export my tweets to add it, but you export your tweets and you can add them.  But it also looks at Facebook and Google Plus and your photos. And then it says one year ago today, two years ago, three years.  But this is the first time I've ever gone that far back seven years ago. Yeah, that's incredible. Yeah. I was.  What was I doing seven years ago? I think I was sitting in the same chair doing the same job.  I was a young man in search of a dream of a dream. I was I was on travel. I was traveling somewhere. It was kind of amazing.  That's not wow. Yeah, there were black and white photos to gara types.  Anyway, that's that's a nice feature. And then also they've updated Gmail for Android.  I've been using inbox, so I don't really care. But if you still use the Gmail app on Android, you now have a unified inbox view.  You get a conversation view for non Gmail accounts and they say search is smarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And and you also have email from Yahoo and Outlook, right? All in the same in the in there in the same inbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Again, I don't use those. I don't want those. I mean, I have accounts, but I don't want my Yahoo or Outlook mail in my good mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You imagine what's in the web is that are in there. Oh, yeah. It's all spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And notifications from Yahoo and Microsoft that something cool has happened. Yes.  Yeah, you know, I I have a Google Google for Work account because we use it here at Twitter, but I just stay away from it for all of the pain points that you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff, I've got a song, but it's too late. I'm committed. I think I'm committed on both sides. You can't go back. No, I mean, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you're you're you're your example has cautioned me. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I get every Googler has this problem. Yeah. Yeah, because they have an apps account for work and then they have their their personal Gmail accounts and solve this.  Yeah, it's not that hard, guys. It's really your friggin geniuses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Google is here. Give me the dongle.  You get my dongle.  Google is going to take Ingress to the small screen as we used to call TV, although actually really your biggest screen in your house is your TV.  Your small screen is your phone, your computer. Yeah. So I should reverse that now to the big screen Ingress, which is kind of this wild program, which people who love love it.  Yeah, Chad Johnson plays it and lost like pounds. Right. You play it.  F&D who plays it here? Who else plays it here? Father Robert. Father Robert plays it. Chris plays it. You guys don't have a life.  I believe Brian Burnett. Robert actually lost a lot of weight, didn't he?  He's like he like walks all over Petaluma trying to find places to take over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I tried it for a bit, but it's a it was fairly opaque to try and also where I live, it's everything that's taken over because it's full of Google employees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the problem. And when I first used it, Petaluma was too small. There were only like three or four points.  Yeah. The post office. Now it's busy. Yeah. But at the time. And so I thought, oh, this is for people who live in New York or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's brilliant about this coming to TV and they're basically talking about doing a TV series is that the TV series and the game will interact with each other.  The TV series will have it'll dramatize, but there'll be clues that can be then used in the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's like your cap, your Captain America decoder ring. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they're talking about all kinds of content, you know, comic books and things like this, and they'll all be intertwined and there'll be all this mythology behind it that'll boost the game and so on.  One more reason I'll feel left out. Yeah. Geek conversation. This news was broken by the information. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, our Friday had the story and you know, he's very trustworthy. So I think it's I'm sure it's true. Yeah. But they haven't made a deal yet. They've just been talking about it.

At least not in Australia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the Aussies would be a little more open minded about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought nudity was like big in Australia.  Aren't people in Australia naked under their clothes? An Australian housewife who rose to internet fame by exposing her boobies to a Google Street View car has been interrogated by the police and now faces a court hearing. Oh, come on.  Yeah, it's ridiculous.  Come on.  It's legal in New York. You could do that in New York. It's not even illegal.  It's illegal in San Francisco.  You know why it's illegal? We had to make it illegal.  Because people were wandering around the Castro naked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought it was still legal.  Is it still legal?  In some places in San Francisco, it's required actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You go down to the Castro and just everybody's letting their freak flag fly.  So this is Port Pury in southern Australia. Maybe they're a little more conservative there.  That's right. The South.  Yeah, it's the South.  South, mate. She was extremely bemused when the police questioned her and took a DNA sample. What?  Let's compare that with the picture.  She said it was her bucket list to flash Google Street View.  She said there was no child harmed in the making. My children don't have to go to therapy because of it.  I didn't give any old man a heart attack that I'm aware of. I spoke to my 19 year old son before. He thinks it's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that is an embarrassing mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, honey, I'm going to go out and according to this story, flash my sizable breasts.  That's what the story says. I'm not making this up.  They were uncensored because normally they blew.  Is this the Daily Mail?  It feels like it. It's no, it's a well, maybe it is.  This is even worse.  This could be made up. Oh, ABC is legit. The Australian broadcast.  And there is the picture there, but RT has had the decency to block, although Google later blurred her.  Aren't you supposed to blur people anyway?  Faces or boobies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So she drew a smiley face underneath it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, she has been flooded with friend requests on her Facebook page.  She, her next plan to skydive topless for her 40th birthday.  The FAA is going to get her unless she's in jail.  Google's response. You saw this, their public policy blog to the Wall Street Journal's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I was going to say finally Google's getting a voice.  Rachel Butstone, who's in charge of public policy and stuff, finally has given it to Rupert the way they should be doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She titles the blog post, Really Rupert, Really? And then it has a laughing baby GIF.  She does actually make some really good points.  The smoking gun, as the Wall Street Journal said, saying the reason that the FTC dropped the investigation of Google two years ago was because Google lobbied the White House so assiduously claiming 230 visits from Google to the Obama White House.  But then she explains, yeah, but five visits were Google engineer on leave helping fix technical issues.  33 were people.  You know, Obamacare, right? Well, so let's go into that.  Yeah, yeah, right. And we know that at least 30 of those were our own Alex Lindsay from the Pixelcore who was going to the White House for Google Hangouts.  Pixelcore is contracted by Google to do those Hangouts, the one after the State of the Union and others.  And of course, they show up as Google contractors.  Several visits were advertising industry meetings attended by Microsoft, Yahoo, AOL and others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  33 of them were people who work at Google now, but didn't when they went to the White House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the number is a little. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's ridiculous. And today another story up on the rundown is that a former Republican FTC commissioner said this is ridiculous, that the only test for antitrust is, is there consumer harm?  And there was no consumer harm. And no, the lawyers didn't push for an antitrust case.  And we said this unanimously because it was true. And I'm in the GOP and it wasn't political pressure.  And this, I mean, you know, I'm sorry. I respect the journalists of The Wall Street Journal.  But damn it. I mean, that's why Richard Winston of Google was right to go after Rupert.  Right. Because this is his vendetta against Google.  And he's using his paper as a bully pulpit.  He's always done that. And somebody at the journal ought to be revealing it or quitting or something, because the story just stinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It just does. Rachel Whetstone is Google's senior vice president for communications and policy and very adept with the animated GIF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, she is. She has two of them. This is kind of a Google thing right now, because a week ago, Google sent a reporter an animated GIF.  Here as well to the Daily Thought Reporter. So they've got a little animated GIF thing going on right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe that's a they must have it on the servers there, the Internet. A little little.  Do they do they click to Google Plus? That's a good one. I haven't seen any of these.  All right. Time Magazine says Google tricks us.  I agree with this one. Google tricks us into thinking we're smarter than we are.  Research facts. Yeah, I know. I'm a lot smarter ever since Google.  A study in the Journal of Experimental Psychology General published last Monday.  Even when participants couldn't find answers on the Internet, they still felt an increased self-assessment of how much knowledge they had when when they tried to use Google.  Matthew Fisher, the lead researcher at Yale, says it became it becomes easier to confuse your own knowledge with this external source.  If people don't have a browser, they don't have Google. If they're truly on their own, they may be wildly inaccurate about how much they know and how dependent they are on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love that final sentence.  The study adds to existing research that suggests searching the Internet for information creates an increase in, quote, cognitive self-esteem, unquote, though not necessarily an increase in intelligence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have high cognitive self-esteem. Yes. Very proud of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Truthfully, when I first started doing the radio show and people would ask me tech questions, it was with Dvorak in the early 90s.  There was no Internet search. I had to know this stuff off the top of my head.  But I was a younger guy and there was less to know then. Yeah, I don't think I could do the radio show without Google anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you go under under numbers, there's a related one. I'm not gonna steal you.  Okay, I'm giving you a license. Okay.  Telegraph says and I think this is a really troubling idea here that they're trying to argue this, but that men are better at Googling than women.  What? I know it's a what?  No, is that self-reported?  No, it's some ridiculous study of boys. I couldn't quite figure it out. I put it up right before the show started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, studies are BS. We know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do believe that older people are better at searching Google because we use Boolean searches. We remember when you had to do that.  You don't have to do it anymore.  Now people just go and say like, oh, selfie stick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't get the problem when the headline says scientific and anecdotal evidence suggests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, lump those two together. That's brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So everybody, Apple, Google, and Facebook, all designing new corporate headquarters as they've cashed in on the Internet.  Facebook was smart. They they've opened their new headquarters and they invited a bunch of top Instagram photographers to document it,  which means we have no idea what it actually looks like.  Yeah, right.  Unfortunately, because they picked all the most interesting, colorful places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook's was the wackiest because they deliberately, Frank Gehry deliberately designed it to look unfinished.  And so there's paints dripping everywhere. The edges of the walls and things are rough. There's like cement floors.  It looks like it's under construction still, which is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gehry did the Experience Music Project in Seattle.  He did the, what is it, the operas or whatever in Spain?  Spain, in Barcelona or Madrid.  The Conde Nast Cafeteria.  Bill Bow museum.  Bill Bow, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think he does the Mickey Mouse, whatever it's called.  Right, the Disney.  The Disney theater in LA, the Disney auditorium.  And all this stuff looks weird.  This one has a giant, it's all one room, right?  It's 430,000 square feet. It is LEED certified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the weirdest thing is that picture you have on the screen there, that is a park that's on the roof.  It's on the roof.  So the roof is actually a park.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, and the garage is underneath.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What happened to the headquarters they've been in, which has the kind of Disneyland courtyard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's old. No, it's still there. This is an additional-  They're using it to house all the data they-  Is this the real HQ now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Zuckleby.  Nine acres of grass on that roof, 400 trees and a half mile walking loop on the roof.  But that offsets, you know, that's a carbon offset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they're on the water there too, so there's a water view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they own significant acreage next door.  So we haven't seen the end of it.  I want better pictures. This is from Fast Company.  Yeah, there were some other pictures.  I want some other pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remember when we did the story about Google's proposed new headquarters,  they're really trying to enclose the outside.  So now when they go walking, you know, nobody's going to snoop on them.  They can go up to the roof and get nature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it's like a bio. It's like the biosphere.  You're inside this natural environment that's indoors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The one place on earth where you actually don't need that at all.  I know, you're in California.  Google's headquarters has like the perfect climate. It never gets too hot or too cold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just down the road from Kevin. He knows.  Every Kevin appearance is a climatological humblebrag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have my own little mini biosphere here.  I've got a canopy that sits out over the gardens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the Apple Spaceship Campus is actually the donut part of it is now being constructed.  And there's a new 4K video that's been posted on YouTube.  Is there? Another drone video?  But you can see that it's, you know, they've got the first sort of wedge of it  sort of built up all the way to the ceiling with just the, you know, the frame.  It's the cyber Pentagon.  It's going to be something to see that.  But I'm really excited about this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you for quadcopters. I'm just saying this is great.  We get these incredible views.  Is this illegal?  No, it's public airspace, man.  If you're doing it for non-commercial, if you're doing it for commercial, then the FAA has rules.  Now you're flying right over it. That may not.  This is probably illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the other thing is that there's a case, a story that's hit recently  that the FAA contacted somebody and said that because he posted a drone video on YouTube,  he also did it on his website, but because ads are sold, it therefore was a commercial use of a drone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll see how that works out.  The thing to remember is the FAA actually has no enforcement arms.  So they're just spit falling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a bit of a First Amendment issue, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  But there it is. You see that's the chunk.  There's a public safety issue with these drones, though, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  I mean, I think it's appropriate for the FAA to have an opinion on this  because these things are flying through the air.  Some of them are very heavy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Profit versus not-for-profit is not the delineation.  That's not the delineation. There's a public safety and a privacy issue.  Companies need to be more careful because they have liability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, I don't know why. I guess probably because of the First Amendment they can't.  Communists.  Commies. They're all commies in D.C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have here a list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Elon Musk, has he announced what he's going to do tomorrow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody said it had to be a watch, and his April Fool's joke is that it is a watch.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, he's going to say he tweeted on March 30th, two days ago,  major new Tesla product line, not a car, will be unveiled at our Hawthorne Design Studio Thursday, 8 p.m. April 30th. So it's a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the speculation is it's a home battery.  Because he's building a battery factory, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah.  But just the tweet, given that Musk has 1.86 million followers, increased the value of Tesla's stock by more than a billion dollars.  It's good work if you can get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So now you can imagine the SEC and lawyers are rubbing hands wondering whether just executives tweeting is going to be seen as stock manipulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You remember them going after Reed Hastings because the Netflix founder and CEO tweeted a couple of years ago.  And he was cleared because the regulators decided that as long as it's OK to use social media to disseminate material information,  as long as it's the expectation of investors and you let them know you will be doing that,  as long as investors have been alerted about which social media will be used to disseminate such information, the SEC says it's legal.  So Elon Musk obviously paying attention to this. A battery, a watch, it's not a car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you'll see the watch on the next link I just put up.  Oh, let me look. April Fools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Violating my rule.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So he he he basically announced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's Big Ben on your wrist.  I'm sorry that as I was told many times when I was in London, that is the Elizabeth Tower on your wrist.  The bell inside is Big Ben. Am I right, Kevin Marks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is correct. It's been renamed Elizabeth Tower. Yes.  All right. It was just it used to be called Big Ben.  No, it didn't. The tower itself didn't have a name.  Ben is the bell. It's just part of parliament.  But they named it Elizabeth Tower for the Golden Jubilee.  Right. And the key is the bell is the image.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is good. It's a new watch, the Model W.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wouldn't I'd wear that. It could be used as a weapon.  Yeah, you would. I would.  It's like there's little rodents running up and down inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Model W.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is in no way a competitive response to what some other company is doing.  No longer will you need to rudely examine your phone to read text messages.  Now you can politely stare at the tiny screen on your wrist without anyone noticing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. I think Tesla is confused.  I don't really know what's going on here. Is it a watch?  Is it Big Ben?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Back first, just a second to Elon Musk and his tweet.  Zeynep Tufeski, who's a wonderful sociologist on Twitter and an academic who's from Turkey.  When the far left terrorists, you'd have to call them, took a prosecutor hostage in Turkey two days ago.  Yeah, of course they were tweeting it.  And then they then they went to Facebook to yell at Twitter for having killed their account.  And it has to be a first in history that you have you have terrorist kidnappers complaining about a social network on a social network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, they're terrorist trolls.  Yeah, yeah.  I loved speaking of trolls. This is definitely a trollish article.  The Boy Genius report.  Meerkat is dying and it's taking U.S. tech journalism with it, taking us and others to task for being so excited about Meerkat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jay Rosen at NYU went after this piece on Twitter with the author for not naming any of the of the of the outlets that he was accusing of doing bad tech journalism.  And then the author came back and said, well, I fear Vendetta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, OK, I will I will say we were one of them.  So we talked a lot about it. But I but we don't.  So what his point or her point is that if anybody would just take a look at the top charts on iTunes or read app Annie, you would know that that Meerkat is not a success.  That's not why we talk about a program.  We don't we're not saying I mean, we were genuinely excited and I still am about Meerkat.  And we think it's good. Mike, you've used it a lot.  But that has nothing to do with the download numbers.  We're not we don't write. We don't vet our news stories based on download numbers.  That's a misunderstanding of what what the job of a journalist is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, yeah, this is a ridiculous story.  I think I think I think I think the bigger story, it's a delicious irony, I think.  But a lot of the tech press slammed Google Glass as an invasion of privacy.  Right.  And many of the same journalists carrying around their Meerkat.  Yeah. The many of the same journalists who were slamming it now are the ones who are into literally doing what nobody was doing on Google Glass.  And so it turns out that it turns out to the real crime of Google Glass is that cameras not pointed at you.  And so anyway, that's a big mirror with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's not the cameras on your face. If it's in your hand, it's OK.  But if it's on your face, it's not.  But I mean, literally, people are streaming for hours recording strangers who don't have permission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's true. If you walk around the studio a little bit, there's there's no Meerkat signs in places.  That's individual employees who put up signs in their in their offices saying, don't come in here with that Meerkat.  And we've actually had to caution employees.  Please don't Meerkat in certain areas because there's you know, there's you finally said no more of the office.  No, I didn't say that people can still Meerkat here.  I told one individual no more, but that's good.  Yeah, but to all the time.  But I don't know if people get Meerkat here.  I'm Meerkat, but we don't want them going by the accountant screen and people seeing, you know, private information and things like that.  And that's the real it is the issue with a little bit with Meerkat is that, you know, you just walking around, but there's stuff, you know, all over the place.  Maybe, you know, you don't have the right to show on your Meerkat.  I think Meerkat's cool, though.  Periscope to me is a little bit less interesting.  It probably will win because it's Twitter's right.  And they can just hang in there forever.  We had a great interview with Ben Rubin, who's the founder of Meerkat, one of the founders of Meerkat on on the triangulation airing this week.  And I highly recommend it because he's a smart guy.  He was actually really thoughtful and intelligent.  And we talked about what makes something go viral.  What you know, why Meerkat was a hit and so forth.  Although the point well taken from the boy genius report Meerkat's download numbers have dropped dramatically.  It peaked at 130 on the US 130 on the US iPhone download chart and is now has dropped.  Oh, no, he's talking. That's a secret. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But again, you know, if people already have it, the question is, are they using it?  And that's that is a question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Ben told me half a million users, which I think is a significant number.  Yeah, that's not a bad number.  No, I think you'd have more if you do an Android version.  He's working on it. So is Periscope.  I think it's an interesting category, this idea of instant live streaming.  He makes a point that he has he's in a very specific vertical, the ephemeral instant live streaming, the stuff that doesn't get saved.  Periscope we thought was going to be said was only safe for a day.  Yeah. So even that is ephemera.  Right. And that makes it a little easier to do if you know nobody's going to see it.  Right.  Unless they watch live.  Looking at the rest of this, I think I think we could take a break and wrap this up with our picks.  Y'all agree? Anything else you want to talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I was going to give you my little perspective on real time streaming if you want.  You know, here's the king of real time streaming, one of the authors of QuickTime.  Yeah.  So. So yeah, but the background here is that Christ 15 years ago, 17 years ago when I was at Apple, the first thing that I got assigned was building QuickTime broadcasting, which was awesome.  Which was, which was, you know, which was trying to build this stuff in the OS level and into QuickTime itself.  The QuickTime streaming part had been built, but it was two weeks to WWDC and they only had stored streaming.  And Steve Jobs said, no, we need to demonstrate live streaming because that's the point.  And so as the new guy who hadn't been assigned yet, I got dropped on the can you build that live streaming for us?  Three days.  Which was, you know, it was just gluing together bits of QuickTime was already there.  We already had this nice thing about QuickTime.  We already had video caption, audio capture and the sequence grabber and that stuff.  And they already had the stuff to do the hard bits of sequencing and playing it over the thing.  So it was just like, call this piece of code, throw it to this other piece of code, write it, do that in the loop and so on.  So it sounds like I did something really cool.  Mostly I was gluing up the code together, which I suppose is a lot of programming these days.  But it was so that was my first experience at Apple was here's this thing, build on this and then two weeks data, Steve Jobs and Peter Holley would demonstrate on stage at Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And incidentally, if it doesn't go well, he'll have your head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Peter was shooting me from that aspect of it.  But yeah, that was that.  But that was so that was kind of fun.  But the point of it, the thing that we then went on to build what was called QuickTime TV, which was a live streaming thing for doing what we're doing now on Twig.  But with broadcasts and things like that.  So that was we had trying to run like 24 seven streams of the BBC and things like that.  So that was fun in that I then had to write code that would maintain timing between audio and video across weeks, which is harder than it looks.  But we got we got that we got that stuff working.  But what we what I realized, having spent a couple of years on this, is that the actual use case of live broadcasting is not very useful.  And in fact, this generalizes to TV as well.  Because most of the time, the people aren't ready to watch it.  It's a historic artifact of television that was based on the fact that we couldn't buffer anything.  That's all we could do.  So television was so all we could do was live broadcasting radio to there wasn't any way to record anything initially with radio and TV recording tapes came later and was was very hard to do.  Video tape only came in into widespread use in the 70s.  And so the the the model was built around this live broadcast model, but everyone watching the same thing at the same time.  And then we were replicating that in the computer.  And actually, it's not that useful most of the time.  One of the advantages of the computer is that it does store things and make it easier to store things and keep multiple versions.  So the actual valuable thing is Netflix and YouTube, not so much the live broadcasting part.  And we struggled for a while trying to find uses for this.  And what I realized was that the valuable thing is that when you have a live broadcast and the people watching it can respond to you.  So you have a chat room like we have here.  Then it's actually useful.  Then you're able to have this back and forth.  And it's useful for us as as broadcasters because we're getting directly back what we're saying and suggestions thing as useful for you as an audience, because you can have that back and forth with the people watching.  It isn't just a one way stream.  And without that piece, it doesn't make sense.  So the reason these things are more interesting than what we built then is that they built that piece into it.  They're using they were using Twitter to bootstrap that back and forth conversation.  And they built that.  The challenge is still that mostly live broadcasting is very dull because most of the time there isn't anything interesting happening.  And if anything interesting does happen, you want it recorded so that you can replay it later.  And if you see this with TV, whenever TV is like, and we're live from the political summit and we're standing outside waiting for the president to come out and say something, it's very, very dull.  In fact, TV has moved away from doing that these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but even more to the point, as we learned with the Brooklyn fire at the fire in New York City, people who are using Meerkat and Periscope aren't doing even that.  They're not explaining what's happening.  Sometimes people go to a live event and it's a view on Meerkat.  They don't know what's going on.  Nobody knew what was going on with that.  And there was no expert commentary.  So it's even worse than than than TV in that sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  That's not saying that it's worse than television.  Exactly.  So the challenge with all these things is it's also very exciting for you to be high.  Here I am live.  We're doing it here now.  And there is a seductive part of that.  And that's been part of the problem with TV.  People understanding the Internet in over the last 15 years has been that is their mental model of it.  And that's what they cared about.  So a lot of the things that were built for TV over the Internet were that here I am live to the nation worldview, which matters a lot to the person doing it matters less to the people watching it.  And it took a while for the people watching it to get the upper hand in terms of being able to watch what they wanted when they wanted rather than being stuck in their loop because that was the TV's mentality as well.  And to some extent, we're still stuck in that model with watching video over the net in that we have this very elaborate setup that's designed to not buffer things.  So if you're actually using a lot of these streaming services to watch video, you will still look at you will get like quality dropouts and buffer glitches and stuff like that because the way they were designed by the cable companies and the TV people and the phone companies.  They all had this like real time presumption meant that they're not buffering enough.  So they don't have there's not enough stored locally to get you over the glitches in the network.  And that that's still that's that's something that's been gradually addressed but mostly addressed by getting more massive the network than it has been by buffering things locally better.  So it's one of these ongoing problems with the design of things.  But it was interesting to me to see this sort of sudden spike in this thing because I literally went through this 15 years ago where it did really feel like deja vu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not just 15 years ago, but from five years ago and from three years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, well, quick quick is key.  Key was the other side of the did this when Twitter was young and did it very well and impressively on a bunch of very crappy phones compared to what we have now.  And of course, Justin TV was the can we make a network out of this version of this before and that didn't do that well.  And the ongoing challenge is to do what you do here, Leo, which is have a space where there's something there to watch.  But also you can have the back channel going back and forth and seem to pay attention to that.  We have it's a great insight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's something you do well that the thing people that the reason Meerkat and Periscope are so exciting to people is because it is exciting for the broadcaster.  Yes, not for the audience, but it's fun for the broadcaster because the person doing it sees the hearts on Periscope, sees Jack coming up on both, sees all these bubbles coming of people watching.  And that's very, very seductive.  Yeah, it is, by the way, the reason we do live.  There's two reasons we do do live.  One is because performers and you know, or hosts or whatever you want to call people are energized by that.  So you get better quality programming because if you're going to do it and you don't have two takes the minute you have take two, the energy it takes a professional because the energy just goes zero because there's no it's not high stakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So for me, take through take two always guarantees to take three.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, so doing it live raises the stakes for the performers.  So that's one of the reasons we do it.  The other reason is actually I think a very, very valuable reason you can't rehab really truly interactive programming unless you're doing it live.  People can't interact with you an hour later.  So I think I think we've we've cut we've sliced the baby.  Well, which is that we know that our business, our business started on demand.  Our business did not start live.  We added live for those two reasons.  But the main business is still the download business.  And and of course, because that's what viewers want.  Viewers want to watch when they want to watch.  But I'm of the opinion viewers like to watch something that is, you know, look at Jimmy look at the Tonight Show like Jimmy Fallon, Letterman.  Those are all live to tape because there's an energy that you get from that that you just don't get otherwise.  And you get audience interaction.  You get a live there's no reason if you've ever seen live to tape like the sound of music and Peter Pan without an audience.  Right.  It's horrible.  Yeah. Yes.  It's just it's flat.  If they had put an audience in there, it would have been great.  So to me, that's why we do live.  But I completely agree with you, Kevin, that live isn't what the audience is looking for.  And our audience proves that 95 percent of our audience is on download.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But for the people who do want it, it's there and it's exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we offer a little value add because they see behind the scenes.  You know, they get it's more of you get more of a relationship with the broadcaster if you're watching live and you can chat and so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the other interesting part of that is Twitter in general as the back channel for live TV is also the piece that I wasn't right.  Sort of signaling mechanism.  But actually bringing this to live TV.  So the point is, I've I had stopped watching any live TV at all.  But there are certain things that are more fun to watch with Twitter heckling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly. The Academy Awards with Twitter running in the background is awesome.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly. And the one for me that made me realize this was the the Royal Wedding, where I stayed up late at night to watch the Royal Wedding precisely because I follow enough British people on Twitter that I knew that I would have a hill area side channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. It's why I watch Eurovision.  Oh, yes. Eurovision is right.  Because I surprise all my European friends get surprised.  What's what's what's what's an American doing here?  Geez. But that's the fun of it. Exactly that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, that's Eurovision is sort of this mass cultural bonding of like how how ridiculous are we all?  It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the Super Bowl live sporting events, you know, after the fact, they're not as interesting.  So and Meerkat thinks it was one of the reason people point a lot to the news reporting issue of Meerkat.  There is that immediacy that you get on a live streaming app.  Are you periscoping?  I'm periscoping. Periscoping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you like better, Periscope or Meerkat?  I like Periscope better.  See, I like Meerkat better.  It just feels more solid.  Periscope. Yeah, that's why I don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Meerkat feels like you're really on the edge.  Right. Anything could happen.  Anything could happen.  And also it just feels more rough.  If you guys feel a little more rough and rough and ready, Periscope feels very corporate.  You get you see that in the when you first launched the app in the streams that are recommended.  Meerkat recommends streams of people you follow, people you care about.  Periscope is Twitter's agenda.  Yeah. So it recommends stuff that Twitter wants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And on Meerkat, you get bigger audiences, much bigger, several times bigger.  Well, but that's a timing thing.  But it takes time.  Right.  For some reason, Periscope, you get your audience and then it dwindles.  With Meerkat, it grows and grows and grows and grows over time.  Interesting.  So if you're going to do long sessions, Meerkat is better.  If you're going to do short ones, Periscope is better.  Ah, that's interesting.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, since the, my thing is I want a buffer.  I want to save it.  Yeah.  And because I feel like if I'm going to put the effort into doing a broadcast, I want,  so really your heritage really shows in how you feel about all this stuff.  But so then I started looking at, well, and what really bugs me,  why can't Android do YouTube live?  So I played with some devices that do that, like the HTC RE.  But shouldn't your phone be able to start a YouTube, what do they call it?  Hang out on air.  Hang out on air. Exactly.  Shouldn't I be able to do that from an Android device?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should have been able to do that three years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google missed the boat here.  Meerkat and Periscope's.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  But I'd be very interested if I could do a hang out on air here as I travel.  Like I'm thinking about for our Europe trip, I would love to do a daily little thing.  Yeah.  Rick Steves does such a good job.  His Facebook feed has all, little short videos.  They're just clearly shot like this.  Yeah.  And they're great.  If I could do that and it would be saved to YouTube, I'd be very interested.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Come on, Google.  You can do it.  It's not too late.  It seems like an obvious thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you read about ... This is so funny.  Laszlo Bock, who is a Googler, just wrote a book.  He's head of people operations, in other words, human resources at Google.  He's got a new book.  But there's a ... Christopher Mims reviewed it in the Wall Street Journal.  But today, Christopher did cull a little anecdote from it that I think is so funny.  This goes back a few years.  In 2008, a Google employee sent Larry Page the following email.  Oof.  This is from the menu today.  If there is no good answer or action from the company, I will quit in protest.  The employee was referring to food being served in the cafeteria called the Free Tibet Goji  Chocolate Cream Pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I remember that.  That was a huge thing.  Was it Google at the time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently, Google called it a kilo thread.  There were so many responses.  The fastest thread in Google's history to exceed 100 responses.  The longest email chain debate in Google's history at the time.  It bounced back and forth across the globe between Google's many international offices.  Some in China, where of course free Tibet is not a good phrase.  Some engineers were incensed that Google would imply that Tibet should be free,  even in the name of a menu item.  Others took the opposite stance, yet others worried that this was an issue of free speech.  If the chef can't name a pie as he pleases, what kind of talk would be regulated at Google Next?  The chef was suspended immediately.  And Bach, as the head of human resources, says that he saw, among other things,  to make the point, some suggested Westerners would be equally offended if some chef in London had offered free Whales pie  or free Northern Ireland cookie.  Others went so far as to suggest Texas polygamy steaks and War of Northern Aggression hotcakes.  I like that one.  I would eat those.  I would eat that.  I would eat that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The thing with the Texas polygamy steaks is you get several of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bach later reversed the chef's suspension as far as we know.  He's still making free Tibet goji pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which you have after you have your freedom fries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That cafe has since closed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Has it? Oh, all right.  So you were there. You were there for that event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they should reincarnate the free Tibet goji pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to make some free Tibet goji pie tonight.  They should.  Is there a recipe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know.  It should be a recipe.  I think the thing.  So that was the there was a very sort of hippie vegan cafe that was on the main circle at Google building 41.  I think it was which was which had that free Tibet thing.  And what they didn't take into account was how many Chinese engineers worked at Google.  Right.  And this this set off all their buttons for them.  And it is one of those one of those things.  Now, also, it was it's also this sort of default assumption problem that Google has, which is that everyone is like us.  Like us. Right.  And that that is that that is an issue that Google has and has has bitten them on more than one occasion because their mental model of the world is built around that.  And they haven't been that good at having having the empathy that's needed to think of people who aren't like them.  And that's part of the difficulty of building a sort of a campus like that, like both they and they did it.  And I think the other thing is you're saying is that you end up building this complete like separated from the world enclave that is very hard to move out of the mindset of the book is called Work Rules Insights from Inside Google and does not include because I just searched a recipe for free Tibet goji chocolate cream pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You missed a bet.  Because I'm craving it now.  I want some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Freedom fries. It is like freedom fries, isn't it?  All right, we're going to take a break.  And if you would pick tips, ideas, thoughts, and Jeff will give us a number of the week as we wrap this up.  The back of the book, I call it coming up next.  Our show today brought to you by zip recruiter.  Am I right?  Ziprecruiter.com. Yes.  Love Zip Recruiter.  What a great idea.  In fact, we've used Zip Recruiter.  If you are Laszlo Bach or somebody responsible for hiring, maybe you have a small business and you're the you're the chief cook and bottle washer.  You know that job boards have made this much easier.  But which job site is the right one for the employee you're looking for?  And it's kind of a pain if you go to more than one unless you lose you zip recruiter.  Zip recruiter lets you post to 50 plus job sites and social networks like Twitter and Facebook with one click of the mouse.  And I love this because the worst thing, of course, about having an opening is the emails and the phone calls.  Right. Not with Zip Recruiter.  All the applicants go into Zip Recruiter's easy to use interface so you can quickly screen them, rate them and hire the right person fast without all those annoying phone calls.  If you want to find the perfect hire, you've got to post your job on all the top job sites.  And with Zip Recruiter, you can.  You can post to 50 plus sites, including the social networks with a single click by candidates in any industry nationwide.  You post once and you watch your qualified candidates roll into Zip Recruiter's easy to use interface.  And since you don't mind when you get a lot of applicants because you don't have to handle those phone calls, you might as well try their premium traffic boost.  That gives you up to three times the candidates in any application.  It's so great. Zip Recruiter.  No wonder it's been used by more than a quarter million businesses, including Twitter.  Try it free right now. ZipRecruiter.com and you'll get 30 percent off your first traffic boost.  ZipRecruiter.com slash twig.  And by the way, if you use TWIG or this week in Google when they ask you how you heard about it, I should be ever eternally grateful to you.  ZipRecruiter.com slash twig.  Now, my friends, ladies and gentlemen, it is time for tips, tools, picks and numbers.  I like Kevin Marks because he's kind of our guest today. I'll let him start things off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the tool that I wanted to mention this week is called Huffduff Video.  Huffduff.  Now, I'm pretty sure like this is like a tool on top of a tool really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Huffduff in the ham world is high directions, high, high frequency direction finding.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That may be the geekiest thing I've ever heard you say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Huffduff.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was high direction.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was Huffduff was named after that.  Oh.  So Huffduff.com.  That was not the geekiest thing I've ever heard you say, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  High frequency direction finding. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this is a site that Jeremy made a few years ago.  And the point of this is it gives you a little bookmarklet.  And when you find an mp3 on the web, you click the bookmarklet and it stashes it in a podcast feed.  And then you subscribe to that podcast feed and then you get that when you're out walking.  So that's been around for years.  Like, yeah, 2008 this is about. So that's a seven year old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's kind of like instapaper for mp3s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. Except I think it predates instapaper.  But it was 2008 that Jeremy built this.  So Huffduff is great.  Recommend that.  Sign up for that. Subscribe to your own podcast.  Subscribe to mine if you like.  I throw things in here every now and then.  Huffduff.com.  Kevin Marks.  But the tool that I was talking about this week is one that's been built.  That will take a video file and turn it into an mp3 and post it to Huffduff.  Oh, neat.  The value for this is unlike Twig, which sends both versions so you can get both.  If you if you see something that's in video and you think that's actually a tool that I'd like to hear.  Yeah. And there's a little button you can click and it sends it to Huffduffer.  It mugs the video into audio and does that.  So the great example this week for me was Neil Gaiman talking about Terry Pratchett.  Terry Pratchett died.  Neil Gaiman had a pre-existing speaking event in San Francisco.  And so there's a video of that, which is Michael Chabon interviewing Neil Gaiman and talking about Terry Pratchett.  But I also munged that into an audio file with Huffduffer.  So Huffduff video of having Huffduffer.  So when I was walking the dogs the other night, I got to walk around and listen to Gaiman reminiscing about Pratchett, which is great.  I recommend that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot of times you don't need this is a good show is a good example, but that would be also the audio is all you need.  Right. Talking heads, you don't need to see the faces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And, you know, I have I have listened to things on YouTube while walking the dog, but it's a bit silly because I've got video streaming to a screen I'm not watching.  I don't think YouTube is smart enough to just send me the audio.  So it's a little bit wasteful.  Whereas this is this is a this is a useful way to do that transformation if you want it.  So if you've got it and it's not just YouTube, it works on Vimeo and a bunch of others as well.  It basically looks for the video file, pulls it out and turns it into an audio file.  So it's it's there's a certain use case for this that I think is powerful.  But part of it is this this idea of transforming and timeshifting that was talking about before with the live streaming stuff, making that that on demand experience more easy.  And the value of podcasting is very much that you want to be able to do this.  Listen to this at another time in the future.  So the combination those two tools is great.  But it sort of plugs into the infrastructure of podcasting that's already there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And can people subscribe to Kevin Marks Huffduff feed?  Yeah, there's a feed.  There's a should be a subscribe.  Yeah, there's the RSS right there.  Look at that.  You can even subscribe in iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's the point.  The point.  The idea is that you make this and then you subscribe to it yourself and say you got this feed of things yourself.  But others could subscribe to your feed, right?  Yeah.  So it's like a curated list of things that I'm bouncing one place to another.  Neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know why I'm getting an iTunes quick tour.  I really don't want that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, this is this is the slide.  Thank you, Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There we go.  Look at that.  Here's your feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Look at that.  A pet peeve of mine is people only doing iTunes links for podcasts.  NPR is is is churus for this where they say, and here's the iTunes link for our podcast.  You're like, no, that is not helpful to me because I don't use iTunes.  Don't use iTunes.  There is another tool that will turn an iTunes link into a thing you can give to Android.  I should find that one.  So you will like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, I should hire you as a consultant as we do our website design.  I'll tell you what.  Once we launch the beta, the private beta, I'll invite you, Kevin.  But we debate this considerably because we're going to have a subscribe button, obviously, on our shows.  Currently, we do a lot of you know, we it's a very long drop down because, of course, we don't just do iTunes.  We do everything.  But what I've been saying and I told the design team we're going to do this is would you just please give me a text of the RSS feed and just put that text right next to every show so that somebody can copy it and paste it?  Because I feel like the very least we should tell people here's the actual RSS feed.  And if you have your own way of getting RSS, yes, you can use this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Well, I have, you know, there's another site of mine, which is unmung.com.  Unmung.com.  Do I share that before?  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is translates iTunes into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, this translates feeds into web pages.  So if you've got if you've got a feed, it'll turn it into an indie web marked up H feed.  And if it's got podcasts, then it'll give you little players in line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've just brought it to its knees, of course, because you never anticipated more than a thousand people.  I should have. Yeah, it's on that thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it should have spun up.  It'll take it'll take a minute to spin it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unmung.com.  I say RSS to HTML.  So Safari used to do that, by the way, and they took it out.  Yes. Yeah.  Such a nice feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the point of this one is that it does it to the indie web marked up H feed and H entry and all that stuff.  So it works with the indie web readers as well.  And that was that was my iteration.  But actually, I've actually found it quite useful as I have a podcast and I want to see that the permalink and play that episode because many of those sites, they're hard to find.  So it's a way of working that thing.  So, yeah, the challenge the challenge is subscribing because there isn't a coherent prefix for saying this is a podcast feed.  So the Android apps try and claim this, but it doesn't always work.  You often need to copy and paste.  And that's that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the link will probably be hot.  And say podcast colon slash slash, because if you've registered a podcatcher on your machine, some machines will handle that properly, etc.  Or is it PCAST?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the problem.  There isn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or is it or is it so we try to we try to do the right thing, which is make it as easy as possible for you to subscribe, because obviously that's what we want.  But it's non-trivial.  And the problem and I have enough history and context, having done this for 10 years now, that everybody looks at me like what you want to have an XML file link.  Well, that is the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The problem.  This is the problem with our system in general is that you click the link and you see a page full of gibberish and you back away again.  So that's the problem with direct RSS links in themselves.  And so, you know, the thinking with with among was was like, well, this is the same information presented in HTML, which is probably more useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe I should cross link to unwind.  I won't do that.  I promise.  I don't do that yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, if you're going to do that, I'm happy to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe we could figure out a way to do that.  Actually be kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would need to add some caching because the moment it fetches the thing every time and it would make if I could do that.  But I'd have to add some caching to that if the same people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think what we decided is not to make it a link click because of for that very reason.  But anybody who's smart enough to look at it and see the RSS dot XML would say, oh, yeah, I can cut and paste that.  I think that's what we decided to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I mean, this is a structural problem with podcasts.  Absolutely.  You know, the reason that NPR says go to iTunes and search for whatever is that, A, you can't put links in audio, but B, even when they do it on the page, it's hard.  We don't have a good link format for this.  Right.  That sounds like something for us to.  Yes, we need to solve that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would any web get to work on that right away?  I just asked them to think about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the challenge is there's a lot of infrastructure out there you have to change.  That's the problem.  You see how long that drop down is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's crazy.  Yeah.  And there's a lot of decisions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like HD or less than HD.  But we still want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the challenge is to give people choice without overwhelming them with choice.  And I don't I think we just assume our audience is intelligent and we leave it at that and give you the choices and let you figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean to ask you, does this in any of those formats, does serving it cost you or is that where Cashfly comes in and cash?  That serves it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We pay for the website, but Cashfly pays for the you know, we have a deal with Cashfly.  I mean, it's not free, but we Cashfly does the so if I go to here's the Docker episode, today's Docker episode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He finally got the Docker guys on.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if you if you click subscribe to audio, we do iTunes, Feedly, MyYahoo.  We probably take that off Pocket Cast Stitcher, Zune.  What?  Other podcast clients.  That's the PCAST and then the RSS.  And the news site will do this a little bit differently, obviously.  But look at video.  It's crazy.  So this is the issue.  And we've got to kind of simplify that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've spending a lot of time thinking about exactly what to do there because we do want you to subscribe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ultimately, that's for us the best thing is if you subscribe to it.  I think my my my thinking has changed a lot about how important the web is and so forth to this.  I believe that and this isn't necessarily a good thing.  And I know as an indie web promoter, you think it's probably terrible.  But really, apps are going to be the solution for a lot of our users.  And if we can get them to put a tweet app or use their own podcast app on their mobile device, that's going to be the most likely way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The challenge with the challenge with the Twitter app, you know, the Twitter app would work because you have enough focus in the same way that an NPR works.  The challenge is solved for individuals doesn't actually solve the distributed problem.  The value of half the effort is that I can turn arbitrary thing on the web and thing that feeds into the app I've already used to consume it.  And you.  The value of a note for this stuff is that you can have multiple publishers, multiple consumers, and that's that's that's what makes it work.  The challenge is that the infrastructure for this was designed, you know, 2003 ish.  And so the methods we did to build it were built on what was available then.  And things that have happened since have been a bit kludgy.  And the at the point where Apple sort of stepped up to the plate and said, yes, we're going to support this in in iTunes and and later in IOS that that was extremely useful because it gave a place for people to do it.  But the way they did it didn't move the state of the art forward in an enormously helpful way.  The challenge of it is is that Apple added a whole bunch of random stuff to the feed you have to add just for them.  The overrides is in the feed that everyone else can read.  So there's still some craftiness there.  And but the problem is that there is there is a very diverse ecosystem of things that we podcasts and they don't all quite do the same thing.  So it would be nice if we could add things we talked about page that you could link to and you could put that in the in the post of the thing.  But the number of podcasts players that actually display that post as a human let you click on it is fairly small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Podcasts are antiquated.  We've got to solve this.  Yes, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, somebody somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One more question if I can.  They were quick there for the sake of one of my students.  My couple of my students have podcast businesses, which is cool.  And what do they consist of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What is the business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, what is the business?  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there's there's more than one business there.  It's interesting to see what they're actually doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One is I don't want to give away too much.  One immersive audio of people's experiences.  I know it sounds really vague, but I don't want to give away too much of a business.  And the other one is a and right now there's two big media companies fighting over her, which I love, is a better guide to podcasts.  I think it's a big opportunity there.  So one of the questions was, how do you deal with promotions?  Like audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, audio.  There you go.  That's it.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the time wasn't there.  Maybe the time is now.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whatever happened to Evan Williams?  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He just has flop after flop.  You know, so Leo in a stream in Facebook now with the autoplay and video, what we're talking about in class the other day was obviously somebody's not going to autoplay an hour and a half of this and stop their Facebook.  Yeah, we're not real good on YouTube or Facebook.  So so but you started doing the little snippets, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we have twit bits on YouTube.  How is that?  Oh, it doesn't.  I mean, it's promotional because I know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But is it helping to promote?  Are you are you are you are you don't have any metrics for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But, you know, are yeah, I don't know.  I don't know how this stuff works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do you get somebody to how do you promote a little bit of video to get somebody to subscribe promotion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, here's the problem with promoting twit.  It's really an acquired taste.  And it's only for some people.  I don't really want to promote it to a mass audience because 90% of them will hate it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So right.  My mark.  I don't know how you market something.  It's like mustard or something.  It's like horseradish mustard.  And you just I think you have to hope that the people like Marmite.  Yeah, Marmite.  You're not going to run a big ad for Marmite or Vegemite because people would try it and go, that's the worst thing ever.  And all you do is create huge amounts of conversation about how bad Marmite is.  So what you really want is to be under the radar and have people discover you who might be interested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's but yes, but that's the question is, is some better tools of discovery?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but it ain't Facebook.  I don't you know, I used to do live with Regis and Kelly.  I've done that a dozen times in the last 15 years.  And I realized finally, even though four million people watch it, none of them are interested in Twitter.  Yeah.  So so it's the wrong it's just the wrong group.  So, I mean, I'm not going to buy ads in the computer world either.  I don't know.  Really. I think the best thing to do is hope that people will stumble upon us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, I promote tech news today in two ways.  The first way is that we have a lot of brilliant tech journalists on the show every day.  So you're cross promoting and bringing their audience to I mentioned them on social media.  And then people who are interested in them might want to watch our show because we have them on the show.  The other way is that I do regular blog posts on Google Plus, you know, stories like this happened in the news.  I throw some of the controversy, some of the conversation we had on the show, and then I link to that segment in YouTube so that people can go directly to that segment.  And I my hope is that people will after repeatedly going and saying, well, that's interesting.  Well, that's interesting. Why don't I just subscribe?  Yeah. And I'm not sure if that's the solution.  Probably isn't. But but it's but I see it as a is a link to that you put in a blog post for people who are interested in these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, we do that. We do a lot of tweeting and, you know, the most the thing that was the most successful ever for TNT was Stitcher featuring it.  Whenever Stitcher features your show, we get our audience doubles.  So I don't I have no idea how this stuff works.  Sometimes you and I will sit down, Jeff.  But I have this counter counterintuitive idea that it's not a good idea.  Mark it to the wrong people.  Yeah, no, I agree with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's the but that's the you know, the challenge is with with podcasting.  What you're saying is like it's like saying radio is like or I hate the word podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hate it. It's a one.  I gave the second keynote podcast exposes.  I said, stop calling it a podcast.  And everybody thought I was nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, we used to call it audio blogging.  So you podcast worse.  But podcast was was that was an improvement anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's you know, it's an Internet broadcasting.  It's the same.  How is this any different from Meet the Press or whatever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have this argument all the time with people who do who do video online.  And I call it television.  They get all mad. And I said, no, no, take over the word.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's our word. Yeah, we are broadcasters, not them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So to say do we call it radio?  So we just say this is radio. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why not? It's way better than radio.  And you should basically get in your car and get your podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's true. It's a parody with radio.  It's customizable radio and customizable television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I am amazed people all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was sorry not being a broadcaster.  I bang my mic. I do it too.  So it's everybody. Yeah.  I was I was in Madrid a few weeks ago, as you know, and I talked to Prisa,  the gigantic publisher of El País and owner of huge radio stations.  And I do this all the time.  I dine out on you all the time, Leo.  I tell them the story of of of Twitter and Twig and what amazing thinking is  and just the idea that we make TV and radio at the same time.  Yeah. And every time I mentioned that baffles them.  Oh, well, they get it.  But it's easy. Why didn't I think that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Yeah.  I mean, my my only thinking is make it available and make it as easy as possible  for somebody to watch it, make it as available as many different formats,  as many different ways, whatever anybody, however anybody wants it.  That's how we'll offer it, including live, including the Burger King of media.  Yeah. However you want it, because our goal is eyeballs.  We don't, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, here's what I want. Chat room.  You have this amazing public out there who God knows why you watch us this whole time.  But I love you for doing it.  And and if they would go to hit time codes of their top three favorite moments  in the show, funny moment, you know, one minute here, minute 30 there,  that you could just embed a YouTube video at that in and out.  It would make it easier for us to to get people who would be interested to sample things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have a pro. We have, you know, obviously the problem with podcasts,  especially long form, is sharing.  And YouTube does have a way to share directly to a spot, but nobody knows about it.  It's obscure. It's hidden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's easier now, actually, when you if you if you if you click share while you're playing,  it says share at this time now. So it has got a checkbox.  But the trouble is you have to scroll back because you think that was really funny.  It's like, no, it's too much work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we've we've thought long and hard about maybe making our player have a share button  that you could say share here. Yep. There's got to be a way.  In fact, I think that's the solution is that if somebody's watching it on some form of player  that they could press a button that tweets that minute.  Maybe minus 30 seconds. But it's fine.  You know what? I'm not. So you don't have to get big.  We just have to get better. So serious suggestion here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, and this is something that podcasts used to have chapter lists  because they inherited that much work and it's iTunes only.  Yeah. And they've stopped playing anymore.  So it's been broken. But the idea is strong.  The idea of a chapter list is actually what you want for these things.  And it would make sense to construct chapter lists for these shows.  And then you could YouTube has chapter lists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a terrible idea. I want somebody to listen to the whole show.  I don't want them to jump to a part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but you put that's that. That is the challenge.  Yeah, because the challenge is then you have a I have three ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want them to hear every single damn one of them.  Exactly. This is what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But as the audience, what I want is a chapter list because, you know,  if I'm like if I go to the Indie Web guys,  I've got a great discussion about this Indie Web thing.  Hang on. I've got to go and try and guess where in the thing it is.  I would never mind.  So the question is, would sharing the snippets lead people to subscribe to the whole thing?  And that's the trade off you got to do. Right.  Or you've got to pre-roll ads on the chapters or something, which, which, you know,  the problem is then you get the some of the TV shows do this.  So like the cooking channel, they have a web player for the shows in the cooking channel,  which I thought was great until I tried to pause one and come back.  And when I tried playing for the middle, it played all the ads I would have seen up to that point  before it would let me play the next one, even though I'm not doing that either.  That's even though I've already seen them. I didn't want to hurt people with a bloody same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know. That just irritates. I don't want to make the pig sing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, but, you know, but the value here is my flag is gone.  But the value of the chapter markup is potentially that you could do people could do that individually.  So I used to do this for Apple Keynotes.  When Quicktime supported chapter list, I would watch the two hour long Apple Keynote  and put my own chapters in to say this bit was interesting, a bunch of waffle here, blah, blah, blah.  Which meant that people could skip through it and see the pieces, pieces they wanted.  I'm not sure anybody else particularly cared about. But there is value to that.  And it maps to the thing you were saying about the chat room.  The other thing that you could do is as the chat room does have timestamps in it,  though I think, you know, the back end, if it's IRC, they are, you know, second timestamps or fraction of second timestamps.  You could tie that to the recording and give people in the chat room a command to say, you know,  I like that bit so that it would then know where, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We actually have some egg drops.  So another concept that I pioneered but never implemented on the Tesla of podcasting is something I called the River.  We do audio and video streams. I wanted to do a textual stream.  Yes, that would include hosts would have access to it, include links, would include comments curated from the chat room.  And we actually have a number of scripts that were written years ago for chat mods to go that one, that one.  And it would be very easy for them to extend that to that time code, that time code.  Unfortunately, there is latency. So the chat room is off by some number of seconds, as much as 30 or 40.  There's all sorts of. You know what?  I've decided having thought about this nonstop for 10 years, screw it.  If people like it, they'll tell their friends and they'll tell people it's appropriate.  And I don't we don't need to grow hugely. We're doing just fine.  I'm happy with the situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Right. And it's the loyalty that you again, the most amazing moments I have.  It happened before last week's show when somebody stops me in the street of New York or Munich or Sydney and says, you Jeff Jarvis twig.  We love Leo. That's that's what makes this a special company.  That's all I need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then and then if I have all the effort I put into is not into marketing, but to making it a better experience for end users.  That's what that's what we're trying to do with the website.  That's what we're trying to. We're just trying to make it a better user experience.  And if I do that, then that's that's enough.  That's good enough. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's part of my grumpy old man act from from QuickTime is that we have lost a lot of this stuff.  So when I mentioned QuickTime, QuickTime, you had more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could you could click on regions.  You had QuickTime was amazing.  And you and they and Apple slowly stripped all the best stuff out of it.  Remember that you could like I remember Alex Lindsay getting excited that brands could make videos and you could click on the tent.  If you said that's a neat tent and it would then go to a web page or you I mean, there was some neat stuff in there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. But but so but the key thing that was neat about it was that it had the concept of edit points built into it.  So the somebody said QuickTime was the worst media player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not at all. It's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, there were places where it didn't play well.  It had some grief on Windows for a while, but that that did get better over time.  But the thing was that what it did have was a good understanding of combining and editing media together to sample accuracy.  So you could create a QuickTime movie that pointed into multiple different files and then flatten it out.  You could share with other people or you could share it with the pointers intact.  Right.  And it also supported more than just audio and video with support.  Text tracks came in fairly early on.  So I could make these and chapter tracks were special case of text track.  So you can have a text track that was running along underneath the video that was was just you know, could be subtitles could be links could be a chat room.  But the loss.  Yeah.  And that was all there.  And the loss was I firstly the loss was moving to streaming because streaming was seen as the big thing.  But the second piece was that all the media subsequent media players had this I'm going to play it from end to end in one go model and not the idea of editing.  Right.  So VLC is a wonderful media player, but it's a terrible editor.  Right.  And the and the editing process and the audio editing things come so a editing process now does involve rewriting files all the time.  It no longer has this ability to point into different bits and pull it together.  And we get away with that because we have so much more storage.  But we've lost that dynamic editability piece that was there.  And that that for the digital, you know, my digital media past, that's the saddest thing in that there was a lot of power there.  Yes.  Now, Apple screwed this up in lots of ways, one of which was like trying to infer in enforced patents on the file format, which was completely toxic.  Completely wrong idea.  Yeah.  But and not not being quick enough to, you know, open source bits of it, which was the other adopted it.  Activity sabotaging use of the file format was possibly the stupidest thing they did.  But the but what it means is that the actual audio video file formats we have now do not have this concept of editing.  And so they they're doing this stuff is now quite hard.  And we had a toolkit, digital toolkit that made this very, very viable and easy from, you know, the whenever they first ship QuickTime early 90s through to mid 2000s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and that's Kevin Mark's pick for the week.  Now we go.  If you can remember it, there's three chapters just in that big huffer duffer.  Ladies and gentlemen, our video at it's at huffer huff duffer dot com.  And now it's time for our number of the week from Mr. Jeff Jarvis.  I just put a link into the far right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got the rundown.  The rundown to be a favorite.  Go to that. So and a tweet I just ran by by Mohammed Al-Sikaf looked at mentions of computer phobia and books last year.  Right. Yeah, that was first step.  Is it is it is it starts in starts in like eight?  Yeah, yeah.  And it's about what?  Eighty six.  Six.  Yeah.  So now to be a favor, add comma techno phobia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ah, computer phobia techno phobia comes down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. But guess what?  Search lots of books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But look at techno phobia.  So the blue line is computer phobia, the red line, which as soon as techno phobia starts to computer phobia starts to go down, starts to skyrocket.  And so we were afraid of computers and computers became everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We weren't afraid of computers anymore.  We still need to be afraid.  So now we're afraid of technology.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So so Jeff, I vampires in what happens.  I told you this by email, but I'm not sure if you saw the email.  I actually bought techno panic dot com because I thought somebody would do that.  And so if you wanted, it's yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I might well be right in the ball.  Oh, you bought techno panic dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was a stun that it was available.  So I grabbed it.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How long ago did you get it, Mike?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, six months ago, something like that.  Oh, that's beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't see the email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's that's that's I'm going to tweet this.  So the blue line in the bottom is computer phobia.  The red line is techno phobia.  Zombies is the orange line and vampires is the top line.  All right.  OK, I'm just pointing out here as afraid of technologies, people are.  It's still, you know, zombies and mostly vampires.  Should I put Justin Bieber in here?  Bieber phobia.  Yeah.  Is there a Bieber phobia?  Probably.  Yeah, I suffer from.  No, look, Bieber's flat line.  Nobody cares about Bieber.  Jeff, I mean, Mike, I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have four things that I have some oldish news, new news, really new news, all stream streaming related.  The first is that some time ago, somebody came out with a site called meerkat streams dot com, which shows all meerkat streams.  This is the so-called God mode.  Yes.  In fact, there was a hack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you if you held your finger on the meerkat head for five seconds, exactly, the meerkat would look the other way and you'd get God mode.  But they turned that off.  I was so mad.  Too bad.  Yeah, too bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But now you can do it on the Web.  So here's a here's a really cool look at this.  Here's what you do when you actually open the stream.  It's a it's a chrome plug in called Meerkat Plus.  And what it does is it puts the comments, including the ability for you to comment on the Web version of Meerkat.  What?  So what?  Exactly.  So here we are.  This is the Meerkat we're doing right now.  Yeah.  And this is this is the Meerkat site.  So it superimposes it on the actual official Meerkat site.  And what?  And then you just comment and you see all the comments.  Does Meerkat have an APR?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're just they're just they're just hacking into it.  I don't know.  OK, so there's that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, how does Mr. Rubin feels about the same people who made Meerkat streams created a Periscope version, which came out today.  I believe it's called on Periscope dot com is a Web site.  It's just called Periscope streams.  And again, you just can refresh it.  And this is really fascinating because it shows you a different it's much more global, isn't it?  Yeah, you're seeing people driving around Saudi Arabia and stuff like that.  It's like really very, very rich.  Has the most nudity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  I thought this these would rapidly become porn havens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this was this was what was the the anonymous chat video chat with chat.  Chat roulette chat roulette.  There is Meerkat roulette.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, the thing is, though, that this have small audiences.  So the people probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're you're meerkatting right now.  We can watch it.  And you could use this extension.  Yes.  To to to chat into this meerkat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You just write there on the Web, which I think is what everybody wants to do.  OK, so here's the new, new, new, new news.  I think broke after we started the show.  OK, no, no, it didn't.  A little before.  But Facebook has a new app called Riff.  And basically it's a collaborative video creation tool where basically you create  a video and then your friends take your video and they add their video and then  another friend has another video.  So it's a it's a way to have this sort of serial additions to a video.  And it tells you what to do.  So you tell your friends, OK, make a funny face, do this, do that, the other thing.  And so you sort of it's a fun way to create not live streaming, but a video that goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. But you do have to give it a hashtag hashtag.  Yes. Of some kind.  And then your friends can view it and choose to add their own clips on that topic.  And that's how Facebook figures out that you're riffing.  Oh, you already have a riff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. This is your riff.  We have been slow down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the desktop. This is the app.  Yeah. Facebook Riff.  So this is what are you doing right now?  So this is like meerkat in a way, too, right?  Because it's instant.  And then somebody that is this somebody you know?  American and Paris backstage.  Oh, this is somebody else's riff.  Balancing Act.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Watch that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So somebody else. Well, let me see. Is anybody riffed on you?  What is your hashtag on this?  It's me and my Facebook account.  Oh, so you have to go to you have to be a Facebook friend with F and done.  So so maybe somebody's two thousand people have seen it.  Surely somebody.  Ah, there's a there's a even better juggling job.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  One out of six next to the icon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ah, so this is oh, this is actually the one they have on the on the page, actually.  OK, so this is actually exactly the same as on the website.  They're just kind of demonstrating what you would do.  Oh, I'm going to get riffing. Yeah, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So those are my I guess those would be pics of the week.  But I have some breaking news, which is that Nixon's mansion in San Clemente is now for sale for seventy five million dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Seventy five million.  And they bought it for one point four million.  That's even more than Jay-Z paid for title.  I know you should have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, back to riff for one more second.  Yeah, I know we're long.  I just want did they get rid of the horizontal versus vertical problem by making the video square?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That solves it.  That's all the fast.  That's what they should have done in America.  They made it square because they learned that from Instagram.  Does it have a filter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, a filter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. I'm installing riff right now on my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's free from Facebook and inevitably the people who use riff will be called Raff.  Right.  The riff raff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you use riff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now you're the Raff.  So I told you, Jeff Jarvis, that I'm slowly coming around on Chromebook.  The new Pixel really sold me.  I know it's nine ninety nine.  Hypnotized.  I know it's nine ninety nine.  But you know, one of the things that I realize is part of the reason people have a bad experience with Chromebooks is because they're crappy.  Yeah, exactly.  But when you get a and I understand now why Google did the Pixel three years later, because if you have an experience on good hardware, it actually is amazing.  So the Pixel, the new Pixel has an amazing screen.  It's touch.  It's got a great. Everything's great. Great keyboard.  The experience is phenomenal. Great battery life.  But then I'm starting to use it more and more because I like using it.  It's a little heavy and clunky.  I mean, industrial design is a little square.  It's not elegant, but that's it's Google.  It's an engineer's notebook.  But then you start adding extensions.  But there's two things I do.  And I've even said this to you that I can't do on a Chromebook that are part of something I like to do.  They're both hobbies.  One is photography.  So Adobe is already announced they're going to do a new version of Photoshop, a streaming version for Chrome OS.  If you're a subscriber to the creative cloud, they're already betaing this.  The work is done on their service, kind of like on live.  It's like streaming gaming.  Work is done on their computers.  But displayed on yours.  It's not exactly a VPN.  It's or it's or VNC.  It's something a little different.  I haven't tried it, so I don't know.  But then the other one is I like to write software just for fun.  I don't write anything good just for fun.  And I tried a couple of things.  I tried code anywhere is one.  And then I found this one.  Somebody tweeted at me, coding.com KODING.com.  Kevin, are you familiar with this?  I haven't seen this one.  You would like it.  So it's a new startup.  It's out of San Francisco.  Let me make it full screen.  And the thing is they have a free tier.  So you can it spins up instances on Amazon that will host a variety of things.  Basically, it's a it's a it's a Ubuntu instance with a very nice ID on top of it, which is kind of amazing that runs automatically.  And you can do coding in a variety of languages.  It's web focused because, in fact, you even have a web-focused web.  And you can do coding in a variety of languages.  It's web focused because, in fact, you even get a website as part of it.  It has full SSH and terminal commands.  It's very Chromebook friendly.  I'm going to log into it in just a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just a browser window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's an it's an H.  It works great on a Chromebook.  You could do Go, Python, Node, Ruby, Angular, PHP.  You could play with Docker, Wordpress.  You could set up a Django, Ruby on Rails, Laravel instance.  You can create apps.  You could write iPhone apps or iOS apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you're Gina looking at this and Gina can totally use this because she's doing she's doing web programming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What would she miss?  I don't know.  Local storage, I guess.  You can't you can't compile an EXE.  So here's the interesting thing.  For free, you can get an instance.  So it's one core giga RAM, three gigs of space.  By the way, that's plenty.  I think I created this.  I think I created this.  They're only they're smart.  The one thing it does is the VM turns itself off if not used after an hour.  So it's not persistent enough to use for a website.  So but for ten bucks a month if you buy this what I ended up buying is a hobbyist so that the VM stays spun up.  So in fact, I put Giggle on there.  So remember we were talking and I didn't want to do Giggle on before this because they giga went offline.  So we made a little web.  This is somebody sent me some CSS.  It's a very simple site.  But this is running on coding.  I'm not sure everybody should go there.  But let me log in to my coding account and show you what it looks like because I have to say for free this is truly amazing.  And let me see.  Don't look at this.  Don't look while I log in.  Actually, it doesn't really matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can spin down the VM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can spin it up.  You can do all sorts of things with it.  It's got a let me last pass.  It's got a bash terminal.  And you see I've got a web root.  So I can I put in the web root.  That's the there's the giga stuff and I can do see the index.  I can even you know this IDE is of course completely functional.  I even have it set up so that I can let's go let's go to my terminal.  I can even run Emacs.  I put on Emacs on there.  So you really if you want a box a Linux box that you can code on this is amazing.  I've set it up for go but you could use Python.  You have workspaces.  So this is my go code workspace.  So it just jumps right there.  It roots it at the top.  And now I can just work in my go code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're installing a darn thing in life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's all installing on this Amazon instance on this EC EC instance.  K.O.D.I.N.G. .com.  The thing is it's free.  I end up paying 100.  They get you because I ended up saying oh you know I like that.  I want to do more of this.  So you know and but they've I think they've done an amazing job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You store your stuff on GitHub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah it supports GitHub.  Log in with GitHub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.  Supports GitHub supports SSH.  So you see I have some authorized keys in SSH which allows me to go from any terminal and SSH into this.  I'm really impressed.  I.  Oh.  Now the other this is the other objection was I want to be able to code and now I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would say the one reason left that you wouldn't you wouldn't get a Chromebook is video editing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And there are video editing things but I do not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to leave that to the professionals.  Well by journalism students I can't I can't have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  But boy if you're a regular student like a K through 12.  Yeah.  Well this you'd be crazy if you're at a school doing a one to one program to do anything but a Chromebook.  You know crazy.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At this point.  Well I can't wait to get the new Asus Chromebook because on some trips just take along this thing that's both a tablet and a Chromebook.  I know.  At the same time.  Lighter.  Geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's pretty impressive.  So you know you're winning me over Jeff.  Inch by inch.  It gets better and better and better and it's really.  Follow the light children.  At this point I would rather use the pixel than use my Mac.  Which is crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah well just just when I had to go in to you know find things on the Mac that I'm using right now.  And then the Mac is so much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well but the beauty of this is I am on my Mac and coding and everything that I do on my pixel is here.  So it's not like you know it's everywhere I use a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The thing that I think is is the least appreciated fact about Chromebooks is the mental state that they put you in.  They give you peace of mind.  Right.  Because you know it's always it's always safe.  It's not going to be you know you don't have malware running.  It just it's just relaxing to have one and to use it as your main device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm working on a chat bot.  For a chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's it going to do.  Jeopardy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you know about.  Did I tell you about J for service.  You must know about this Kevin.  Somebody has written.  This is hysterical a full API to every Jeopardy question ever.  There's half a million.  No I'm sorry.  One hundred fifty five thousand on here.  They don't say Jeopardy anywhere except that looks suspiciously like somebody we know.  And you can call this through the API.  So I want to have the.  So if you're on Slack there's a there's a you could put it on Slack.  It's Trebek bot.  And often you say Jeopardy me.  And he'll ask you a question.  They keep track of your dollars and huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You get double Jeopardy.  That's cool.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's my that's just you know you always need a little something.  A little project on the side.  I have something on the side.  Kevin Marks great to have you.  What do you want to plug anything going on in your life.  Are you just enjoying the weather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a small group but the the the.  I said that the conversation about standardization is one of these like well we decided to go off and do our own thing type groups and we've started to get somewhere with it which is good.
