Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Horsewoman number two.  Horsewoman number two.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's your new title.  Greetings, fellow horse people.  That's just straight out of the Game of Thrones or something.  The Khaleesi is here from smarterware.org at Gina Trapani.  Also here.  Oh, a cheesy transition guy is in the house.  Flash Gordon.  Yeah, I don't know why, how that happened.  I could do, you want cheesy transitions.  I can do cheesy transitions.  Jeff Jarvis is at buzzmachine.com.  Whoa.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  For those of you listening at home, you're not missing a thing.  No.  And we are about to talk about the Googleverse.  So that was what Eric Schmidt called Facebook, Google, Apple.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And Amazon.  And Amazon.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The Four Horsemen.  I think that's accurate.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think so.  He left out Microsoft.  I think that's right.  No Microsoft.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And he left out Twitter.  Twitter is too small a service to be worth.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But it was companies creating a platform, right?  Companies who were doing a really good job exploiting the web as a platform.  So I think that Twitter isn't necessarily that yet.  But Amazon certainly is, right?  Oh, yeah.  Facebook.  Facebook, Apple, and Google.  So I think that was a pretty...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is Apple, does Apple belong in there?  They're a great hardware manufacturer.  But are they, I guess with iCloud is...

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  iOS is the platform, right?  Yeah, iOS, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay.  I mean, there's, yeah, there's...  We're going to spend like three quarters of the show dissecting what Eric Schmidt said  yesterday at the D9 conference.  The top 10 things, according to Danny Sullivan, that Eric Schmidt revealed at D9.  You know what?  Just before we go into these, Jeff, Gina, you think Eric did himself a solid on the  stage at D9?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I think so.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, I watched the video that they put up, which was edited, and I thought it was  a really good interview.  I think he was good.  I thought that he was good.  He was frank.  I thought that his observations were astute.  But it was interesting.  You know, TechCrunch, I guess Sarah Lacey at TechCrunch said that, you know, he came off,  you know, he put himself down and he's got filled with regret for his time at Google.  I didn't get that at all.  It's called honesty.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's honesty and humility, both of which I think our CEOs should show.  Yes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Absolutely.  As we talk this through, you know, he didn't get the commerce job that supposedly he was  up for in the White House.  But the discussion after Paris was that, you know, this is the political Eric and Eric has  a political ambition and people are starting to say, is he the first geek president?  You know, you put this kind of honesty you hear from him now against a politician's voice  and I'd welcome that.  I mean, yeah, he puts his foot in his mouth, but he's being direct and he's being smart.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I did notice a number of people on Twitter.  I was watching the live Twitter feed as he's speaking, which is always interesting.  A number of people on Twitter said how political, how smooth and savvy he was appearing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Which is not what he's usually accused of.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Creepy, foot in mouth.  Okay, so gang of four and platforms.  He says they have huge platforms, dominance in their spaces, difficult for others to challenge,  Amazon rules in shopping, Apple for beautiful, quote, beautiful products, Google for information,  Facebook in friends and identity.  Microsoft not on the list.  He says he didn't see them driving the evolution of consumer products and services.  He said big in the enterprise space, that's for sure.  And they have products that I thought this was actually a pretty astute analysis are  a quote flywheel that will power Microsoft for decades, much like IBM went on and on  and on after it lost dominance in the fifties.  It went on and on and on and still goes on.  Number two, Google did a deal with Apple to stay on the iOS platform with Google Maps  and Google search.  He says we have a very, very good search partnership and map relationship with Apple.  Deals have been renewed, no other details.  I really thought Apple was, one of the reasons this whole Apple privacy kerfuffle happened  is that Apple was gathering data to supplant Google.  And it was, in fact, I think Apple even said that they were going to do a traffic application,  which implied a map application to me.  Number three, these are Danny's top 10, Google will get social data in alternative ways.  They tried to do a deal with Facebook, the deal that Bing ended up doing to include social  search.  I got the impression that they weren't able to make that deal.  He says from Google's perspective, it would be useful to have the information.  It would make our products better.  Yeah.  Social search is the next big thing.  Later when I was...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You get Eli Perez going after him, don't personalize.  I still think it's wrong, but that's the new media story.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's the filter bubble.  Yeah.  Thing, which we've talked about.  We talked about it last week.  I think threw it out.  Out of hand, right?  We dismissed it.  Yeah.  When asked if Google might need to buy something like Twitter, he said, our social strategy  does not acquire the acquisition.  I think he means require the acquisition of any company because we can't get people to  give us that information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's talking about plus one.  Because we can get.  We can.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We can license it.  I see.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  He's saying he can license it from other companies, but also Google can get people to give them,  give it personal information in other ways, through profiles, through plus one, through  lights.  I think this is how I interpreted it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think you're right.  Yeah, I think you're right too.  I misinterpreted it.  I was thinking we could license that data like we tried to do with Facebook.  No, you're right.  In other words, we don't need Facebook because we have means.  They know everything about us.  Are you kidding?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean Gmail really is the crux of that.  Really, Google does know a lot about you.  He knows your contacts.  I mean, your email is a pretty personal thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They have to be careful though.  That's right.  You hit the nail on the head.  That's a personal thing.  Facebook, I'm willingly giving them information.  I don't want Google mining my Gmail.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Agreed.  I mean, most people don't.  That's definitely true.  But your contacts is very, that's a social graph that Google has that they take advantage  of.  Can they use that?  With Buzz as we know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But you know, plus one is another, which we'll talk about later on in the show.  But that's another way that that's their like button.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But both are so limited.  I mean, part of what Zuckerberg said to me when I interviewed him for the book was that  the difference is that Google and companies like that scrape what goes on.  On Facebook, you choose to say it.  The example he always gives is that you choose to say that you're a Green Day fan and there  comes the ad for Green Day versus saying in your email, Green Day, Green Day, Green Day.  And suddenly the ads there and that people find creepy.  That there's an explicit choice that's truer about Facebook than Google.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Definitely.  But the Green Day ads, we're seeing those already inside Gmail and that's private.  What Google has to do is distinguish very strictly between what's private, which is  Gmail, you know, email and what you explicitly publish.  But Google's got plenty of publishing tools, right?  I mean, Blogger, Buzz was a try, Profiles.  I mean, there's a lot of little places where you can enter information about yourself.  Google reader subscriptions and your likes and your comments on those.  I mean, it's not Facebook, but it's kind of it seems like Schmidt was referring to all  these little ways here and there that you can add signals and publish and share.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, there I think the best signal generator is the phone.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Where you are, what you're looking for, what you're doing.  Who you're calling? No.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But that is the issue is how do we how do we how do we use this data without creeping  people out?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. You respect the stuff that's private.  That's meant to be private.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Did he didn't he take some blame for Buzz, the Buzz fiasco yesterday?  Didn't he mention that? I can't remember.  He took blame for a lot of things.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  He you know, I watched the edited version, so I didn't see the entire interview.  I don't think he mentioned Buzz specifically, but apparently he did say that I'm not good

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  at we're not good at social.  We screwed up social.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. And that's his big regret, right?  Is that he didn't add that into this.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So so so they're saying this group social.  Now they're saying that they're going to get you know, we have our ways to get social  data isn't quite convincing to me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, that's what I mean.  I mean, a there's the issue of how they don't know how to do it.  But B, there's a creepy issue we're talking about, too.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think they like a strategy still.  Yeah, but no, there's no apparent strategy.  We keep we keep on because they're Google and they're brilliant.  They're amazing. We keep on giving them credit.  Right. We give them a lot of credit.  Something in the lab. It's coming out soon.  Right. We keep on guessing what it is.  I think it's quite possible that they don't have any frigging strategy for our.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Aren't we close to the one year mark of the Google me rumor?  Yeah. And still nothing.  Yeah, that's correct. There is no me there.  He says it was his fault that Google's social networking problem.  So does that imply that Larry Page might do a better job?  Is he maybe saying it's well, Larry is going to fix this?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, I think he's doing the opposite.  I think it's more of a fault by omission, a sin of omission,  that he wrote the memos, but he didn't follow through.  He didn't execute. He didn't make it happen.  And so he's saying buck stops here. I screwed up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, good. That's very presidential.  Keep up the good work. Yeah. Yeah.  Schmidt says he's dealing with external issues almost exclusively now,  since Larry took over as CEO in April.  I think but that by that he means Washington, right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's mainly that.  Yeah. Not Washington, just Washington, but London, Paris, Bonn.  You know, pick your capital.  He was at EG8.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Did he have a high profile there?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. You know, he was on early panel.  He listened to Sarkozy.  He went with Sarkozy to Deauville  and the G8 along with Mark.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He is very much getting into government, isn't he?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, he really is. Yeah.  And I think that that it's it's it's necessary for Google.  It's hurt Google, especially in Europe and the EU.  And so they need the highest powered spokesman they can have.  And that's him.  And I think personally, he's he's into this now.  He kind of complied, though, that he would stay at Google  till death did them part.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, he did. That was interesting.  He said that his biggest worry about the web is a balkanization of the web

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  that every country will have its own Internet.  I thought was good. I liked that.  I was. Yeah, I thought I thought Jeff is head is exploding right now.  That's been yours.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, that's been that's been yours.  That's been your so right. Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, I'm writing a post I haven't finished yet.  But but thinking about, you know, last week in Paris,  the the fight now is over the sovereignty,  sovereignty of both the net and governments.  Right. We say that government has no sovereignty,  so quote John Perry Barlow on the net and the government's  kind of claiming that they should.  But what makes the net the net is that no one can have sovereignty over it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. That's what that's what scares governments to things like WikiLeaks.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There's government is it can and so and so that's what it is.  And so what you really see, I think, is government trying to,  you know, try to reserve a place at the table of the future.  And there may not be a place for them in quite the way that it was.  And that's that's profoundly frightening.  And it it leaves a vacuum is clay sure he would say  we don't know what's going to fill the vacuum.  But I think that's what's going on here.  And so so Eric last week, you know, said to them pretty clearly,  he says this in various contexts around the government is slow.  Technology is a lot faster.  Government shouldn't be holding things back the way.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's why we I mean, I think that the government is slow on purpose.  I think the founders wanted a government.  We're afraid of a government that was too efficient and effective.  I know I am. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So so but the problem is when they do use the power to regulate,  when they do define what the Internet is before it's even done yet,  you know, that's a danger.  And then, you know, when I when I asked this question at Aspen  two years ago, almost he did a little soliloquy about about how,  you know, I wish the change happened faster, like you say, Jarvis.  But it's not.  And the reason is not because all the resources go to the incumbents.  You know, the big old companies and government are in a cabal together  to prevent the change.  And so that's really kind of his view is that is that  it's change agents against change resistors.  I think now the next, you know, immediately you start  going on Google with its devil's deal with Verizon and is Google going,  is it jumping the shark in terms of being a big company?  That's a different discussion.  But but Eric's take has been that government is slow and it's a problem. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, now I'm scared about Eric getting the president.  I will speed things up.  The trains will run on time.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, or or he would do the opposite or he would,  you know, eliminate his own job. Not quite.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  When you see things like Bitcoin, which is an extra governmental currency  fueled by the Internet, WikiLeaks, which is an extra national  in Jay Rosen's terms, journal, you know, news, news entity.  And I expect we'll see more and more of this.  It is kind of it is kind of it feels very futuristic.  It does. You know, what's  it's very, very cyber.  Go ahead, Gina. Neuromancer. Go ahead, Gina.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, I was going to say it feels like the future.  It feels like, oh, right.  This is this is what this is what it was meant to be for the people  to organize on a level that goes beyond beyond local government.  I mean, it has a lot of big, scary implications,  which is probably more qualified to do.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, one of the things, you know, science fiction talks a lot about is  extra governmental corporations, you know, the multinationals. Right.  And that's a little scary.  And most most science fiction says, well, it's these multinationals  that will end up, you know, the world government by de facto.  But interesting, maybe the Internet will be a  a player appear.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, if the Internet stays architected the way it is,  then there is an entry point for anyone.  We've got to get Timothy Wu on.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, we do. Yeah.  Because his book, The Master Switch, that's what he talks about.  He says, you know, in the past, what's happened.  And he uses the long distance system as an example, is these systems  were created, they were open, they thrive, they innovated, as all open systems do.  But it only it was only for a while.  And then corporations came along and said, OK, thanks, kids.  We'll take it from here.  And he feels we protect.  Yeah. And he fears that's well, he doesn't fear.  He says it's going to happen on the Internet.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And it's going to be taken over by Internet companies.  So Facebook and Google and Amazon are going to horsemen, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, it's hard to feel like Apple is going to be.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't think Apple's one of the four horsemen.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, but here's the thing.  If if I'll go this far, if Sarkozy has a dream of how the Internet should operate,  it would be Steve Jobs's dream.  Yes. It'd be controlled.  You bet. And gatekeep gate.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Steve says there's no porn on iOS.  Right. Right. We protect you.  Good point. That's our job.  So I don't I mean, I'm not sure I want Facebook to be in charge either.  But let's promote a healthy competition between Amazon, Google and Facebook.  You don't want anybody to become

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  a part of this argument, too.  And every time Schmidt is argued is Google too big.  And of course, the responses show me too big and shouldn't be regulated more.  And so Schmidt says, well, who do you who would you prefer to run this?  You know, Google or the government? Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, Google, Google, we're here to help.  Although, I mean, I think people who believe in  government as a reflection of the social contract would say government,  that government reflects us and our desires.  Do it's just it's just such an imperfect.  Right. But the problem becomes when you have slow and slow.  And it doesn't really reflect us and our desires.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It just so Sarkozy said that that only governments are the legitimate  representatives of the people.  And, you know, response to that is to rear square in Egypt.  The issue now is that there's so much of what we do is not tied down to a nation.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But isn't but isn't really I mean, that is what a government is supposed to be.  Anyway, the ideal government is a reflection of the will of the people.  It's us self governing.  Now, obviously, Egypt is not self governance.  But but but let's use the United States, a republic.  Isn't that the principle behind it is self governance?  We elect representatives, but the idea is we're self governing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right. But Leo, what do you do about the financial structure  that cuts across even America can't do at all?  What do you do about ecological issues and pollution and radioactivity?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I would say this is what Tim O'Reilly kind of dreams of when he talks about  government 2.0 is that notion of a maybe not extra national,  although maybe it should be transnational, but open, transparent government  that does reflect the will of people.  Maybe the Internet will become and or somehow foster.  Is this what you think?  Foster a transnational government that reflects the will of its people.  Well, government is a platform versus.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes. As a tool. Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And that's what you're doing.  That's what think up is all about.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's what that's what that's what that's what that's what that's all about.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So that's the one side of it.  That's good government.  But on the other side of that, watch out.  I'm going to quote Habermas.  Is that what I have a new Godwin's law.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Every conversation, it's no longer that we Google ourselves.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's Habermas. I got to read this cat.  All covers. Oh, you know, oh, God, no, you don't.  It's like raw sausage, man.  It's not digestible.  It was torture. But but.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We have a Habermas drinking game, however, I'm glad to say.  The chat room is already sloshed.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So he argued that the public sphere emerged in the 18th century  when in salons and coffee houses, the discussion,  the rational critical debate of the people became for the first time  a counterweight to the power of government.  And then he argues that it got corrupted by mass media,  where we just got talked to again.  Well, I think what I argue in a certain book  from out in September is that what the Internet is.  Habermas was wrong because the coffee houses only had the two rich people  and only men and only landed people, and it was not the people.  But the Internet does have the power to be the people.  And so the Internet is a constant counterweight to government.  And so when government tries to regulate its disruptor,  that's that's a conflict necessarily.  The Internet is our public sphere.  Oh, damn, I should say that in the book. That's good.  Revisions, revisions.  Oh, it is. I got one chance left.  Right in the paragraph now.  But the Internet is the public sphere.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The Internet is that.  It is. It's the embodiment of the public sphere with all its unruliness.  And it's, you know, heterogeneity.  I was good. It's all messed up.  It's a bunch of mixed up stuff.  Write that down. Are you writing it down, Jeff?  Write it down. Write it down.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The Internet is the public.  It's called a pen. I still use it.  And a little.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a lot faster than a tablet, I could tell you that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, I put my Post-it notes on to the the pads here for the laptop, you see here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, so so there you go.  Right. Yeah.  So that's why they have such a big wrist rest.  Exactly. The Post-it note holder.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So I put notes there to remind myself they stay there for six months.  I never read them. But that doesn't matter.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So we got to fight to keep the Internet to be a true public sphere,  a true, you know, speaker's corner, a true Hyde Park, open, free.  And I think I think Internet as a platform or a government,  you know, a government as a platform is a great way to think of it as well.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. That's the way that that's what that's what the people have to do is  is to demand that the government is a platform for listening to what they have  to say and for implementing the things to represent, like representation  via the Internet, just not not just through voting,  but a constant kind of interchange and people participating all the time  and using the Internet very much.  But yeah, the government as a platform, that's the whole Gov 2.0  kind of vision.  And we have to make it happen.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Tweet from Tadolio.  Habermas at a Chipotle watching Glee.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Forget Twigs.  Twig, we have to get a new acronym.  It's the Glee Chipotle Habermas show.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, carry that further, carry your idea for that.  I think you're right.  But in this future, then a quality company is also a platform.  Right. When Google is at its best, yes, Facebook is at its best.  Zappos is a platform is a platform for what we want to get done.  And that's the best relationship with it.  That's when they can succeed.  When they fail is when they try not to be that rising.  Right. Rising Google.  And, you know, this is the argument that Siva  but nothing says that that companies must be evil because they must  I'm simplifying.  They must return money to their shareholders.  And I, you know, Umair Haik and I come back and argue, well, yes,  but the cost of doing evil is higher now.  And so you may succeed better by being a true platform.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes. And Google has mostly done that.  Mostly, exactly. Yes, yes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And so you take Schmidt's attitude about that.  Right. Could Schmidt be the person Schmidt for president,  Schmidt for president?  Um, we'll hear all those dumb quotes all the time.  It'll be so much fun to cover them.  Um, it would be fun.  I have to say so much fun.  Oh, gotta be so much fun.  How tall is he? Is he tall?  Cause you got to be tall.  Uh, yeah, he's tall.  He's tall. Okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I can't believe that we've gotten to Schmidt for president.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Schmidt for president.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm going to write that down.  I think we need to sell bumper stickers.  Schmidt for president.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So, but, but here's, here's the question.  Is he, can it, is it really a, a public sphere when all of the  conversation occurs within these private platforms like Facebook  or Twitter or Google?  Doesn't, does that, does that, does that, does that make sense?  I mean, it's, I mean, it has to be federated in the way that the web is.  That's what we want.  That's what we want.  And that's what APIs are kind of the beginning of providing.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Um, and, and, you know, the kind of data sharing, the partnerships that we see,  that's a good thing.  But, but yeah, we definitely, this is why I've been kind of obsessed with  federated platforms and systems for, for so long as like, if we create  platforms where people can set up a node and connect with the others and  everyone, and the data ownership is distributed, that's, those are the  things that we want to do.  And so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so,  that's the kind of platforms that I want to see.  100% agree.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, that's why I was always uncomfortable with Twitter.  Yep.  Uh, and preferred, uh, status net.  I was always uncomfortable with Facebook.  Uh, maybe diaspora is a solution there.  Um,  yeah, I know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Ethical, uh, you know, treatment or having the solution is competition  purely, I think the problem we have an access, the problem we have with net  neutrality is that we are imprisoned to duopolis at best.  Right.  Country.  Right.  And that allows them to do this to us.  Right.  At some point, the fact that Google has 60 some percent market share in the  U S being as a healthy thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But there are a lot of stakeholders.  So now you have the stakeholder, which is the carrier, the internet service  provider, you have the platform, which is Facebook or Google.  These all have, these all have commercial interests.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But so does an economy.  So does a society.  That's not, that's not.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes.  But does our society, um, Trump.  I mean, do we, I mean, this is what Tim Wu is talking about is that  ultimately these commercial interests win and they Trump our interest are, are  as a society.  You see it, you know, I mean, that's, that's where we're sitting right now  with, with, uh, the whole intellectual property debate, you know, the whole,  uh, the whole debate over music and movies is, you know, the societal, the  needs of a society versus the, the interests of, uh, content creators.  That's what I think that's what Larry Lessig would say.  This is a great conversation.  I'm going to interrupt it briefly.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And then commercial purposes for capitalism.  Yeah.  It's okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, because we have had a good conversation here and I did not in  any way let the fact that carbonite.com is a sponsor impact this conversation.  I am going to show the best damn ad.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The value of it.  We're going to, we're going to, that's where we're going to, our memories of it  will be secure.  Right, Leo?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes.  Precisely.  I am going to show you the best damn ad I've ever seen in just a bit, uh, from  Intel.  Yes.  Yes.  And I think it's fascinating.  It reflects kind of a, a new way of advertising because it's an ad instead of  an ad that's targeted at me, which is the newest thing that Google did.  This is an ad that features me.  It's the museum of me.  We'll talk about that in just a little bit.  There's lots more to talk about.  We still haven't got through all 10 points.  We've got to talk about facial recognition.  Then we got to get to Twitter and its platform.  Speaking of which, speaking of Twitter, I got a lot to do.  So let me quickly talk a little bit about carbonite.com.  This is your right.  Uh, this is where you save all your stuff.  And very important that you do so.  If you go to carbonite.com right now and use the offer code twig, you could try it  right now for two weeks free.  You don't even need a credit card.  Here's the carbonite's backup, right?  So it's cloud, but it's cloud based.  It's internet backup.  And that's really the strength of carbonite, uh, is that even if the worst happens,  your data is safe.  Hard drives die.  Laptops get stolen.  Backups disappear.  But when you have been backing up to carbonite, you always have access to your data.  Even before a disaster happens, you log into your carbonite account on a Mac or a PC or  on an Android phone, an iPhone on a Blackberry, and there's your stuff.  So it's cloud storage.  Uh, restoring is as easy as clicking a button.  I'm just a huge fan, uh, and I encourage you to give it a try free for two weeks.  Carbonite.com offer code twig.  If you decide to buy, now, by the way, this is very affordable.  It's $59 a year.  And that isn't for like a gig or two gigs or a hundred gigs or whatever is for like  that whatever is for whatever amount of data you have in your internal drive.  You can't just start plugging in a bunch of drives, but whatever's on your internal drive,  the contents of your laptop, for instance, that's less than a $5 a month.  That's a good deal.  Carbonite.com 16 cents a day.  Try it free right now.  Carbonite.com.  If you use the offer code twig when you buy, you'll get two free months.  So it's 14 months for the price of 12.  Back it up to get it back.  So do it right.  With carbonite.  So real quickly, uh, Eric Schmidt said we knew this.  We knew this that, uh, things like Google goggles had face recognition capabilities.  He said, uh, face recognition is the only product Google has withheld.  And I think they probably did the right thing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But can you hold the genie in the bottle?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I wish they, I want it because I have a terrible memory.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, the larger comment that he said is that he realized that the, like the, the,  the same platform for doing good is the one that you'd use to do evil.  Right.  So the terrorists use the same tools that the people do.  And the facial recognition thing was one of the, was, was one of the only things that they held back.  Cause I felt like people could use this to create a biometric database and, and, and, and watch people.  I mean, I know, I don't think you can keep that genie in the bottle.  Someone else is going to do it then.  I mean, this is right.  Um, interesting that Google decided to hold that one back.  But I think that that was really good insight and something that made me feel good about Schmidt.  Really, this is going to be kind of turn, turn.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I agree, but I'll do the devil's advocate here.  Okay.  Uh, which is that it's a cynical PR move.  But they'll let somebody else do it first because they don't want to be the ones who always kill privacy.  They'll let, they'll let, you know, Microsoft do it or they'll let a government do it.  And then, oh, what the heck?  It's already out.  We'll come along.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, that's very much this very well may be Google trying to say, Hey, look, we're really not as creepy as you thought we could do this thing, but we don't because we're taking care of you.  You know, maybe this is a PR move and letting someone else to take it up.  Sure.  Sure.  That's I'll accept that.  Okay.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's all mean it.  But I think the question is, as I read that, I was thinking about how could you at least start using it for good.  Right.  Every day on our local news, I suspect you have the same thing.  We have the missing child.  By the way, I've never fully understood because if we really truly had kidnapped children, it's obviously domestic disputes.  Right.  That accounts for most or all of this.  But fine.  So we have that.  When I interviewed Schmidt.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  As long as they're, as long as they're blonde.  Yes, exactly.  And white.  And you're cute.  Then it's a nightly news.  Then we care.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Bring out the milk cartons.  Right.  When I interviewed Schmidt about the German official who said that use official recognition and geo together were taboo forever.  Now.  And I said, that's kind of ludicrous to eliminate the use of a technology before it's used.  And in my view, you could use it to find missing children or to find people after Katrina.  And it can be useful.  And Schmidt said that it would be laughable for that to be passed in, for example, the UK where they do use it, he says, to find terrorists in airports.  And then he said, you know, you kind of have a choice.  Would you rather have more invasive yet more and more and more invasive searches of your body and information at the airport?  Or would you rather have the cameras looking out for known terrorists?  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Good point.  Showstopper.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, no.  Yeah.  I guess that's a good point.  Technology can be used to invade your privacy, but it also can be used to protect you, I guess.  Yeah, I guess that's a good point.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Someone said security theater versus privacy theater.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  It's all theater, though, isn't it?  Yeah.  I like that.  Good answer.  That's what we were trying to think of.  That's what that that's what the delay was.  We were trying to think of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He did respond to the filter bubble.  Eli Pariser's book, he says, the differences are pretty small.  And I'd have to agree in every test we've done, you can hardly tell a difference in the personalization of your search.  I think it's a little bit of an overstatement to make a point.  He says this was kind of a surprise.  Walt Mossberg kind of beat up on him and said that his Google results are more and more polluted.  Schmidt said, and this is because this is in regard to that update where they they kind of blocked demand media and other kind of similar garbage info sites.  He said that the update impacted only this is the Panda update, 12 percent of search results.  He says Google makes hundreds of improvements every quarter that aren't seen.  It's working up working more to come up with direct answers rather than links to information.  If we can come up with the right answer, we'll give it to you.  Answers instead of search results.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But that's that's to me a big issue for them going forward.  If you want to get media companies and destination sites and information sites to hate Google, then bypassing them entirely and just handing the answer over will do that.  Google's response, I think, would be, well, people may don't want to link.  They want the answer. Right.  And so then the question becomes, well, where does Google get the answer from all these sites?  And we'll go around and around around there as to are they at that point if they don't link and they only answer, are they then acquiring the value of those other sites with no return?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, I mean, there might be opportunities for return, though, that then I mean, what have Google said to a site?  If you provide answers to certain questions in a certain semantic format, you know, we'll pay you the ad money, you know, you know, you get some sort of adsense deal for the searches that that return those those answers.  I mean, I'm just totally just speculating that this could be right.  But what's, you know, what's a motivate sites that have these answers to provide that data in a in a in an easy maybe an easier way or an easily crawled way?  You know, I don't know.  I mean, I thought it was interesting that this this this coming up with answers is very much with Bing, right?  Bing markets itself as a decision engine.  And and Schmidt basically said that Bing is better at some of this than than Google is, which which surprised me because I just have yet to see Bing really beat out Google myself.  But yeah, I mean, it is interesting.  I mean, sites really are going to hate Google if they if it provides their content without the.  The first the first test of this is is the airline schedules, which is another story up on the list today.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It is pretty cool. Right today, if you go to Google, is this nobody's tip, is it right?  Nope, nope. Go ahead and put in flight.  EWR LAX, you get the schedule.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Huh? And that's because they bought ITE, ITA rather.  EWR to LAX.  Flight. Flight. You have to say flight.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, like flights to LA.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't have to say colon. Just flight.  I'll just flight.  EWR, which is Newark. LAX.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It gives you your sins.  There you go.  Look at that.  And then click on the link where it says, yeah, there it is.  Bingo. Wow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now, I can't buy it on here.  They should. I mean, if they want to make money, they should have a link right to.  Up next.  Yeah, that's really cool.  Isn't it?  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Same as if you want flight status, if you just put in, you know, CO123 for continental, it'll tell you the flight status.  Do I have to say flight?  No, just CO.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But they've done that for a while, right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  For a while, right?  So now you have the, there's the status from Copenhagen. I didn't even know what it was.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Good guess. That's from a website though, flightstats.com.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But the information I need is right there.  Is right there.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And you do want that, right?  I mean, I always, whenever that happens, like if I do a currency or use Google calculator, I like that, that the answer is there.  I don't have to click a link.  I don't know how, I don't know if they've made a deal with flightstats.com to do that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But I mean, that is a link at the top. If you want to see a map or if you want to dive deeper, right, you would, you would click on the link.  Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I think he's right. That is something that we want our search engines to do.  And I think Google's doing a better job. That's good.  And if Bing's doing a better job, then people will start using Bing.  I think though, ultimately, you don't, you don't steal from Google unless you give better search results, not better answers.  Right? Don't we still use the search engines for search?  Mostly.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, mostly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it's not, you know, I guess if you knew, oh, if I search for a flight on Bing, I'm going to get better results, you might.  I don't think people, I don't think people choose their search engine based on what they're looking for.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right. But let's skip forward to mobile and voice.  And, you know, I have a question. I'm driving from Boston to New York. Here's where I am. My phone knows where I am.  Where's the next Chipotle?  Right.  That's the next thing I want. Not the nearest because it may be, you know, back. Right.  It knows which way I'm going. Where's the next Chipotle? I don't care for a search at that point. I want the answer.  And Maps kind of does that for me.  Right.  Not in that route way, which I want. That's the next thing I want Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you might do it if it's different apps and it's a more protracted search.  I mean, you know, well, currency is a good example. I have a currency app on my phone or I know I could do a Google search.  On a phone, you probably do you launch an app on my desktop. If I had a currency app versus a Google search, I always have the browser open.  I probably just enter the currency into Google.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So how does Google power that? And the irony is that I think Google would power that through APIs.  Right.  But they killed, by the way, their translation API this week, which I'm upset about because you want others to use this stuff to make apps.  Which API did they kill?  The translation one.  What? Really?  Yeah, you can still use translation, but you can't use the API they're killing. They killed about six or seven APIs.  Huh.  And we did put them in the list.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Bad people. They're bad. They're bad and wrong.  APIs are good. Killing them is bad.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, speaking of APIs, this Intel Museum of Me is an example of, because I don't maybe Intel made a deal with Facebook. I don't know.  But they it's very cool. They you have to give it permission and access to your Facebook account.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And pretty extensive permissions.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a long list, isn't it? Of all the stuff you're giving them.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And it is just an ad for Intel, but I think it's kind of a neat demonstration of what an API can do.  So I just gave them permission by clicking, you know, get it. Now it's gathering all the data from my Facebook account.  Let me go full screen on this so you can see it. And you could see quite a bit of stuff going in there, mostly JPEGs.  Is there a special room just for your ugly shirts, Leo?  There should be. And now, ladies and gentlemen, the Museum of Leo.  Now, I did that pretty quick.  It says Leo Laporte exhibition, 2 p.m. on Wednesday.  Already I'm getting chills. I love this. That's a, by the way, that's my Facebook picture, which is a picture of me in college. Old picture.  But I mentioned that because you'll see that I had bad hair then.  So these are the people I interact with the most. All of them are people I work with.  And I'm sorry, Gina and Jeff, you weren't on there. But there's people looking at my exhibition. I'm so happy.  And being in California, the first time, which is a retail.  Yeah. Yeah. And then this is a kind of a montage of other pictures. I think profile pictures I've used.  And now we go into the next room where you can see all the places I've been. Google Maps on that, by the way.  And that's that was kind of a boring exhibit. These are the words I use the most on my Facebook page.  And analyze that. International like dry martini. House time sale week.  Tweet number one. Look at that. Now, I know that this was done algorithmically by sucking data off my Facebook page, but I'm still feeling pretty warm about Intel right about now.  A big thumbs up because Intel made a museum of me just for me. These are videos I've liked.  San Francisco Giants picture. I think I got short shrift on that one. That was a very short video wall.  And then this is this is fun. These are really cool Intel robots taking all the pictures from all the people I know.  These are all my friends. I don't know that guy. And they're going to take those. Yeah, he knows me. They're going to take all the pictures.  These is personal. This is highly personalized of people I know. And they're going to assemble it. What are they assembling it into? I don't know. Let's zoom out and see why.  Look, they've assembled it into a giant picture of you.  Golly, I like you Intel. The chat room is just they're appalled. They're throwing up. They are appalled. There's all the people I know in my universe.  Look, that's you. One node on the network that is our universe. It is all of us together in the connected. I love you. What is that cell of Intel?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't know, but I watched it about 80 times. Everyone in the chat room is like, Leo, it's cheesy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think that's cheesy. I think that now. All right, it's cheesy.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So I was fascinated by this because I think I've gathered social media data. I've been thinking about visualizations of that data. I tend to come at it from the more useful visualizations.  What insights can this give me? And this was, let's face it, this was eye candy. We all just want to look at pictures of our friends and things that have happened to us.  This is another mirror to look at ourselves. Right. I mean, we're humans. That's where the stars of our own mind.  The museum really kind of creates that idea. You feel important and you remember things. I saw a video of Mike the little cousin and I was like, oh, I got the woman fuzzies because these are people that I care about.  But really, this is just, you know, this giant flash movie that sucked in a bunch of Jason showed it.  It's an ode to the API.  It's an ode to the API. I mean, I have to tell you, I was totally impressed with it. I thought as far as social media visualizations go, it was very, very well done.  People in the chat room are asking, you know, what did you, what other permissions, you know, what is Intel going to do with all that data, you know, besides show you this thing? I don't know.  It was a lot.  Yeah, I mean, what are they going to, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And by the way, all this stuff is public. It's all public on my page. So I don't mind. I mean, if you had a private Facebook page, you might want not want to do it.  Right. Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But I mean, it was a great ad. It was a really nice ad. And I do. I agree that I think it's the future of advertising.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it's interesting how you take how you you take away what you're interested in. So your interest is as a developer from the API use of a visualization of data and me, I was thinking, wow, ads.  Now, I think going forward, I expect to see more ads that I'm a star of.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. Right. Well, yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, you know, we think we've been trying to figure out, like, how can you we want to reveal something to you about yourself, given, you know, that your data and aggregate that you shared across these different networks.  You know, this is one of my personal kind of kind of interests. So like, like the words that you use are the things that are most important. I think sentiment analysis is really interesting.  And all sorts of ways to show that.  I think there's there's even more we can go even further. That's why I love things like the Fitbit and things that sort of gather little bits of data over time and then can can make sort of general observations about that you can use to, you know, exercise more better health or, or, you know, I don't know, think more positive.  I don't know. So, you know, we feel fine.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What have you ever seen? We feel fine.org. No, no.  Oh, you love this. I'm going to make sure it's refined. It's a bird.  Jonathan Harris is a brilliant programmer, designer, thinker.  And so go to open. We feel fine there, Leon.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Please wait patiently. Now, always. This is some Java is now I guess this is a Chrome thing. Now Chrome asked me if before Java or QuickTime will run, which I think is kind of interesting.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So what he did was he was he was in a long time before for Twitter, but has collected millions and millions millions of things following I feel or feelings.  So they did a book of it. That's just brilliant. And they got all kinds of data about this that that that talks about the total of the people there of how do we feel happy or sad or whatever.  And then you see what's tied to that and you see specific posts.  So, you know, what I think you can tell is that it can start to check your mood. Right. Yep.  Gmail could do that. I could check how many angry emails I've sent, how many angry tweets I've done.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It really could. It could inject narcotics into my bloodstream.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  According to that, my anger is closely correlated to my cabernet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I could just pump a little cabernet in there. Right. No, but I kind of.  OK, so now get ready because you know that Mark Zuckerberg's whole life is all around.  How can I what what payoff can I give people to incite and sent them to give me more information?  So here is a wonderful thing. Now, if you give me more information, I forget the movie.  I'll pump cabernet into your veins. I'll give you a phone that spritzes Prozac into your face.  Soma, Soma, Soma, all you have to do is just let me see your life.  Just press that allow button and I will make sure that you're happy forever.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, this is why you want apps that gather your data that you own versus giving other people access to your data.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Screw Federation. I'm giving it to Zuck because he's going to do the right thing with it.  He's a man who kills his own meat. Oh, he's he's turning into Ted Nugent.  I just want to warn you. Just get ready. He's going to be weird.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That is the danger of the rich and famous person. Yes, Howard Hughes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Bob Tricent. Yeah, Howard Hughes. He's collecting his pee in a jar.  I don't know. I'm sorry, Mark. I'm sure you won't be doing that,  but it's a little weird to only eat meat that you kill personally.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I did not. I missed this story. Was this a new story? Did Zuck say he only really?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is it true, Leo? I think it's true. He seems to be it's on his Facebook page.  He seems to be pretty out about it. He started with lobster. He said the first thing I killed was a lobster.  He said, actually, that was the hardest because it was live and I boiled it, but it sure felt good eating it.  And then now I think he stepped up to I think he just killed a pig and that's it. I'm a vegetarian.  You know what, though, there is a certain purity, a moral purity that I respect there because you're exactly right.  If you had to kill your own meat instead of buying it antiseptically packaged at Safeway, maybe you would be a vegetarian.  I would. Yeah, I don't want to see the look into the eyes of the animal I'm about to eat. Seriously.  Oh, let's not think about that. I'm deeply disturbed because I'm not ready to give up bacon.  I don't care if that pig has a sad expression.  Did we speaking of which, did you see Rovio is going to put angry birds on?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What a transition you are. I bow to you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The Roku box. Speaking of bacon.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Speaking of bacon and eggs. It's the perfect. That's how Leo's brain works.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That is how my brain works, alas. Looking for feelings. So this is finally loaded.  This is We Feel Fine looking for feelings of people in the last few minutes, it said.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, so each one of those is the worst. So if you click on any one of those feelings, you'll see you'll start to see those are feelings going around the web.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I feel like Bartleby the Scrivener that is the character Bartleby on a regular basis increasing and that's due to the fact that I perceive society to be further and further askew from what I personally accept or agree with.  I think this person's having a psychotic break. Give back personal LASOMA. Yeah.  I've been focusing on four areas that need addressing and have been feeling encouraged. Where is this coming from?  This is from blogs. Oh, I see. So he just skips millions of blogs. He's skimming the internet. I got them about two months ago.  Because sometimes I feel uncomfortable riding along the river road. Even in the early morning, there are a lot of cars going really fast.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He does all kinds of visualizations of the data over time where you can see ages versus feelings, times of year versus feelings.  So you can pick a word. You can pick the word.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  See, I want this for just my friends. That's what I'm inspired by. Or just you. Or just me. Or just me and then just my friends.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't have any friends. So it's a shame. How do I feel today?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I wanted to be like, show me all the negative Nancy's in my Twitter stream because I want to unfollow them. That kind of thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's what you're doing with TweetUp, isn't it? Isn't this what you're doing?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, this is part of what we're trying to do with ThinkUp is to be able to slice and dice things in that way.  We haven't built in sentiment analysis yet. We're doing word clouds. But yes, this is the kind of thing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think we should really play with this because he does some brilliant visualizations.  Jonathan Harris is a brilliant guy. He also does something called the whale hunt, speaking of killing what you eat.  Where he went on a whale hunt and it took a picture at least once every five minutes the whole time, but more often when things were happening.  So he visualized all the photos are clumped together when they kill the whale and all kinds of stuff. So he's really a good visualizer.  And he analyzes the data to say, do we feel more good than bad at what age?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, all of this leads me to want to go to the big data conference because it's all about data, isn't it?  And it's all about getting more data and then smart things to do with that data. I love it that that's what you're interested in, Gina.  I think that's fascinating.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Absolutely. Absolutely. It's not easy, but it's fun. That's for sure.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Gina, there's a conference at Berkman and I think a week or two I'm going on living the hyper public life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you the only guy there?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  You're the foster boy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I'll come. I'll come.  That's interesting. So, but I mean, are you going to speak at this or?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, I'm just a moderated panel. But Dana Boyd's there and folks like that and Berkman. So it'll be smart. They let me in anyway.  That sounds fascinating.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it sounds good. It sounds really good.  Well, yeah.  Living the hyper public. Will any of it be streamed or?  I don't know.  I imagine some of it will be live logged.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Center, I'll bet.  Wouldn't it be funny if it were a private conference?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I went for Zurich on the BBC two weeks ago. They held a conference, a social media conference, and they did it under Chatham House rule,  which means that you can't quote anyone by name or say who's there. Are you berserk? I went completely ballistic on them, making fun of them for this.  And, you know, don't you get the tone deafness of that?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hey, is your number 54%?  No.  Okay. Total US ad revenues.  That's a good number. Yeah.  Yeah. But this isn't your number.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, no, I left it for the general discussion.  Total US Internet ad revenues. $7.3 billion in the first quarter.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a 23% increase from last year. You know I'm liking that.  Seemingly providing more evidence the tech sector is in a bubble. After all, what kind of industry could possibly sustain 23% growth over the long run?  But watch the graph because it turns out Google gets 54 cents of every dollar.  More than half of all that money goes to the goog.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Wow. They know how to make money.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They know how to make money, that's for sure.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And full disclosure, I'm a stockholder and I'm proud of them. My whole Arrington moment there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's your Arrington moment. There's the graph of quarterly revenue growth. This is the growth in billions from 1999 to 2010.  We had a little drop off there. I don't know what happened in 2009.  That was the crash.  That was the second crash. Right. Yeah.  The little bitty. Boy, that tells you something. That was where the recession happened.  It affects even them.  But not much.  No.  Even 2009 was better than 2007.  54% of all US Internet advertising spend is collected by Google.  Google revenue by a quarter in millions of dollars is now almost 90%.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Let me make sure I get that straight. So 54% of all spent gets to Google then gets half of that.  No.  For ads that appear elsewhere.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, because they keep half. I guess you're right. I guess that's revenue.  I guess that's revenue. Profit is roughly a half of that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is that what they said? That they keep 50?  It's not the exact numbers, but it's roughly that. But that's only for ads that appear off Google.  On Google. It obviously goes 100% to Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So Facebook had 8.8% of the display ad market. Google had 14.4% for almost $400 million in display ads.  That's banners, columns. So Google whooped Facebook in that particular category.  Facebook hasn't really started yet though.  Yeah. And they're being a little judicious in how they use that stuff. I think there's no hurry for Facebook at all.  Google has added plus one now to websites. Twitter yesterday added the follow me button.  That's smart.  Yeah. I put it on my website right away to join the...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Journalists will use it, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I want to be liked. I want to be followed. And I want to be plus one. I haven't got the plus one button yet.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Plus one I'm still not enthusiastic about.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, this is the other shoe to drop. When we first saw plus one it was a Google Labs thing that you would do within the search results.  But now you can put it on a website.  This makes a lot more sense because you're already at the site.  This makes much more sense.  Okay.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Okay, but hold on there for a second. So you hit the plus one button. You hit the like button, you know what happens.  Your friends can see what you like. They can come to the site and see what you like.  You hit the plus one, what's the payoff for you?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  When I search for the thing that you plus one, I will see that you plus one in my results.  Same thing. You just let your friends know.  But it doesn't show up on Facebook. It shows up in search.  Right. It just shows up in Google search. Right. So like is on Facebook.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's more benefit for Google than there is for me.  Yes, that's still the case.  I'm helping the Google.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Now, what I would want to do, Leo, if I were you, is I would want to write a little app that would combine the two.  Oh. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, there are plugins like the...  There's Share. There's Hish. Yeah, there's sharing plugins. I use that on my...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  With one click, it goes to both places.  Oh, like. Oh, you should say it's like plus follow. Do it all.  Plus like. Yeah.  Plus like.  Don't just like me, man. Love me.  Plus like me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You want to love me, but...  Love. Oh, yeah, that's better than like.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This is like one of those apps that check you in all the different geolocation services, like the aggregation apps.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I can create a... So this is what the button looks like.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Leo's love button. It's singing to me, man.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, and here's why a website would want to do it, because it shows all the plus ones.  So that's nice for...  Right. They want it.  Yeah, that's good for them.  And then I can include count. I could take that out. I could parse, unload, JS callback.  So I can add my own callback function, which could be the love button.  The love button. And then you just put a little JavaScript right there.  Right there in the code. Easy peasy.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So I'm going to be capitalist Jeff and ask when are they going to be sponsored plus ones?  When is Google going to pay Leo or when are tech companies going to pay Leo to like their stuff?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right? Because a lot of people follow you and your recommendation, especially for tech items, is gold.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, well, there's two layers of that, right? There's the spam layer.  And then there's the mechanical Turk, poor person in poor country who's paid to click 100 times a day.  Right.  Right. So how does Google... We have had that cuts on a long time.  By the way, the previous discussion, Kevin Marx was jumping up and down again on...  I know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was just his kind of discussion.  This is not an on demand podcast.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, I'm sorry, Kevin.  I love Kevin. I'm so eager.  Next time.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We were going to the next discussion.  But with Matt, how do they prevent spam level of plus one? That's one layer of this, right?  And then the other layer is when you just mentioned, Gene, which is fascinating, is does Ashton Kutcher make a million dollars for a plus one?  He should, right?  And Leo 100,000.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But I'm confused. So if I plus one something and it would... How would people... How would Google know if you're my friend?  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So Google knows you're my friend if we're connected on Twitter, if you're in my Gmail's contacts list.  Right? This is all search stuff.  I see Leo Laporte shared this on Twitter. If I search for something and get a link in my results.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, but we're both on Twitter or we're both on Facebook.  But what does Google do?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Google knows that we're friends on Twitter and they know if you're in my contacts in Gmail.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right?  See, this is the problem we were talking about earlier that Google may know it, but can they surface it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So let's go farther. So the problem there is that someone sees that you like the site, but you quite explicitly said plus one.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So what's the problem if people say that Leo likes this? You're telling the world.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. But see, when I look at say here where it says 156 people like this, and if I like it, then it will say Leo and 156...  Well, I'll do it right now. So it will add... See, it now says my name.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. And I see your name if I see things.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If you're my Facebook buddy.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. If we're friends on Facebook, right, which we are. And that's kind of a big deal. If I see that you like something, it's a big deal.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's valuable. But how is Google going to say? Where do they get that information? How do they know you're my friend?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well...  I'm seeing it in search, Gina. You're right. I see people and when I do searches, I see that Gina Capone likes this.  Really?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, totally. That's because we're friends on Twitter and that's public. That relationship is public.  And Google knows that relationship. And I also get so-and-so shared this in Google Reader, which by the way, I can't wait for Google Reader to just move over to plus one.  Yeah.  I mean, there's so many different ways right now to do things in Google Reader, like comment star.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's true. There is following in Google Reader.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. And there's following... Right. And those are public. Actually, I'm not sure if following in Google Reader is public, but they've got a few different social graphs.  I definitely see my friends in Google search results. So what I'm saying is like, so everyone's going to go around and plus one everything, right? But not everyone is Leo.  Like if Leo likes it, then that's a big deal to me. Not only because we're friends, but also because you are a trusted personality and brand and tech recommendations, which is why I got to the part where I was like, when do you get paid?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Kevin Marks, who knows this, says following is public on Blogger and Reader. They certainly could use those two as information.  Yep.  And I guess Twitter's public.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And Twitter's public, right? And following people on Reader or Blogger, of course, they're going to suggest people in your contacts.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. I'm adding the plus one button right now to my website.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Nice. I mean, it feels I'm a little more sold on a lot more sold on plus one now that it appears on other websites. Like plus oneing something in search results seem crazy to me because how do you know it's a good search result unless you've clicked on it and then you're gone?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We kind of assumed that that would happen though.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, we did. We did. But it does kind of feel like catch up to dig this and then Facebook's like, you know, I mean really dig this one.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And there's fatigue. There's button fatigue too.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And there's definitely, right, you have the NAS carization.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's why we want the big heart, the special heart button that just does it, boom.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right, the heart button, right. And then you configure the services you want to share on and you just do it one shot. I'm sure someone's going to...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We just gave you a great startup somebody. Somebody is listening right now. Just gave you a great startup. Somebody just shared.  Actually, I'm not going to say anything because I don't do NDAs or anything, but somebody sent me an email about a startup they had similar to this that was brilliant.  And I'll tell you about it when they when they go public. But it's it was similar idea. So that people are thinking about this.  That's the thing is it's not going to come from Google, I bet you. It's going to come from some independent little guy.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I've been I've been really liking Stellar, which is Jason Kotke's new app, which is not open to the public yet.  Stellar.io. But it's an aggregation of people's favorites on Twitter and Flickr and Vimeo. And it's really cool. I can't wait for Jason to open it up.  Sorry, I shouldn't have brought up something that's not open. You're so mean. I'm sorry. So mean. I'll see if I have any invites. I'll see if I can send you one.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I probably remember don't even know it because I joined everything.  I forget when I come back in a year and I go, oh, I already did that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  By the way, when we mentioned the Gmail mini hacking before, did we know it was China?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, Google's saying that now. Let's do that story in a second. We're going to do that in just a moment.  I just want to briefly remind everybody it's kind of coals to Newcastle because I know you're all members about Netflix.  Here's the deal. You know about Netflix, which is of course DVDs by mail. And now that new watch instantly functionality, which means you can watch your favorite child's watch.  I'm going through all of the Battlestar 79 Battlestar Galactica episodes. I watched two a night. No commercials.  Boom, boom. It's great. Two a night is 88 minutes. It's perfect. And then I fall asleep.  And the nice thing about, by the way, Netflix watch instantly. I'm watching it on a Roku box on my TV, but you could use a PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Nintendo Wii, a lot of DVD players, a lot of TVs.  You go to sleep, you stop it and you go to sleep and you come back and you're watch the rest of the show. I was watching a... Okay.  Okay. This is a little girly, but I was watching a Joni Mitchell biography last night.  No, I'm with you. I love Joni Mitchell.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, it warms the heart.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I love her. And this is a really...  Blue, blue...  That's somebody else. I don't know what that is. The album name is right.  I didn't even know this is... But this is why I like watch instantly because partly it's the recommendation engine on Netflix, but sometimes you just, you know, you stumble across something.  I loved this documentary. It was a PBS American Masters series, which I missed.  But it's available. So here's the deal, which is fun. By the way, see, I've seen... I fell asleep. Look at this. I watched 52 minutes of the 91 minutes total.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  How does it know you fell asleep? Do you have like a kill switch?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, yes. That's right. If I'm not sitting on the Roku box, it turns off.  No, I turned it off before I went to sleep. I didn't fall asleep in the middle. I'm not that bad yet.  However, this is what I love about this. Now, Netflix, of course, DVD by mail. You get the watch instantly and more and more movies all the time and TV shows. Let's not forget.  Do not rent white chicks. You might see it there, but don't rent it. Okay, I'm just telling you.  It's there. But you know, if you think Marlon Wayans and Sean Wayans dressed as white women is a funny thing, maybe you would want to rent that.  But anyway, that's your... the beauty of this is there's tens of thousands of movies. You're not stuck. Oh, wait a minute. Wuthering Heights.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I just watched the Pixar story. It was so good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's neat. I didn't even know that was on there.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it's on watch instantly. Really good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So here's the deal. I know you're already a member. We're just, you know, we're telling you stuff you already know. Please do me a favor.  Tell your friends, your family, your grandma to go to netflix.com slash twit and sign up for twit and for Netflix.  And that way we get the credit. Okay, because I realize it's too late now for you.  We thought you've already joined. And if you haven't, what? Netflix.com slash twit. Try it free for 30 days. You will love it.  So China has been hacking Gmail. Google announced this today.  They said, yes, we notice unusual activity with people trying to steal Gmail passwords.  Hundreds of Gmail users, including US government officials, Chinese activists and Chinese journalists have been tricked into sharing their passwords with what Google calls bad actors in China.  That's not Arnold Schwarzenegger. That's just bad guys. The attackers were able to read and forward the victims email.  Sorry, took a minute.  The web search company, which is Blame China for a previous attack on the company's computer network, said it's security.  By the way, they're back in China, aren't they? Google got out of China, but didn't.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They are.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is there a change? I thought there was a change.  Oh, they're still not in China?  It's just the same there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So that's still true. They're not in China.  Yeah, I think it's as it was.  As far as I know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They're not there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It felt like it kind of faded away like this. Yeah, well, whatever.  So they're not. They're still not. There's no office in China.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, there's no office there. There always has been.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You can't do Google searches in China.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You can do Google searches in China. It just goes to Hong Kong and they don't censor it there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Ah, so they didn't support this Chinese censoring. I get it. Okay.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's what I think. I think the chat room will tell me if I'm wrong.  They will.  Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And apparently they're still using Gmail in China because all these guys are using Gmail.  And Google said its security and abuse detection system discovered a bunch of phishing scams and people are falling for them.  The campaign seems to originate from Jinan, China.  Wow, they really know and is targeting specific individuals.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  High profile, it says.  High profile individuals.  That's what's a little scary too because we owe you for high profile.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, but I don't, they don't. Chinese government doesn't. I think it sounds like it's people. They're going after.  It sounds like it's Chinese government going after this.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, and US government officials and activists and journalists.  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So they're using passwords to change the Gmail accounts forwarding settings and delegation settings. Interesting. Okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So then if you don't pay attention, what happens is your account continues as usual.  You don't know it, but they can read everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Interesting.  What's really interesting is that Google is so quickly saying it's coming from China.  Yeah.  The war is still on.  Yeah.  So their recommendation is to implement their two-step verification process, which you and I were talking about before the show, Gina. It's just so difficult.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's a pain in the butt. It is a pain in the butt.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm a big fan of two-step authentication. I use it on my bank account.  I'll log in with my password and then it says, okay, we're going to send you a code to the phone that you have in your possession.  And then you enter that code. And that's really great because even if you got my password, you'd have to have my phone for it to work.  This isn't that easy.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's not. No, it's not. It's not as easy. You download.  Well, there's a few different ways, but you get a code like a security code.  But then in addition to the security code, you also have to create a per application passwords.  If you want to log into a Google app on another device or if you have, if you granted other applications access to your Google data, you can re-log in with the...  I use so many apps.  Yeah. I mean, right. And for someone like you, Leo, and me to some extent, who uses so many apps and so many devices that you find yourself in this situation.  And I found myself in this situation a couple of times where I have a new device.  I just want to sign into Gmail real quick or Google real quick to do something.  And it's like, oh, you know, I need to either set up this new application specific password or I have to grab my phone and check out the code again.  I mean, it's, you know, it's in security. True good security is inconvenient.  That's just the reality of it. Right. Right.  But I feel really good about it. Now that I've enabled it, I wound up disabling a bunch of apps I didn't use anymore that still had access.  And I just I feel like I know no one else is in my Gmail, which is good, which is good.  But, you know, we should say that Google said that they detected and disrupted this campaign and they notified everyone who was affected and the relevant government authority.  I mean, even if you don't want to set up two step authentication, it's always good to just go in your settings, figure out what your secondary email address is,  make sure that's not some hotmail or Yahoo account that doesn't exist anymore, that someone else could have the name.  Just make sure they have a valid secondary email address. Change your password, you know, once in a while. If you haven't done it in a while, that kind of thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, you know, the most important, in my opinion, the most important thing you could do is to attach a cell phone number to your Google account.  Yes, because even if they hack your account, they get your password, you can always reset it through the phone and they don't have that probably.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right, right. And just make sure that that stuff is all up to date and that's not your old cell phone from five years ago.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I agree with something that uses something like near field communications, let's say that as long as you have your phone with you, it's like the new cars where you're dealing with the car key.  Yeah. Right. And the chips there and let you start the car, which freaked me out at first, but that's fine.  What if I had the same kind of thing where if I'm near a computer, it says, OK, that's you. And I have a very easy way to report if I don't have that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's kind of like biometrics, but instead of biometrics, it's phonometrics. Yeah. Yeah. That's why it's something like that.  You'd need to have a, all computers would have to have an NFC receiver. Yes, they would. But that's a good idea. I like that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There's some way to make security stuff a lot easier and more powerful. Well, there's the thumbprint, you know.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  There's thumbprint, right? There's eye scans, which are less common.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I always feel like I'm going to get blinded. I can put my hand up there and go, oh, gotcha.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's it. I just took a screenshot and now I will be able to scan Jeff's image anywhere and authenticate his MC.  This is the problem with the hyperlocal or hyper public existence, Jeff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Your irises are on file. She's got your eye right.  I missed it again. I keep doing it again so I can press the screen capture button.  No, he won't do it now. Oh, we got it. OK, good.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Good. You can get in the country. All right, Gina, I got a question for you.  Every time this comes up, you defend Twitter when they screw developers and do one more thing.  Oh, they do it again. Did for them. Yeah. And I wonder where you have a breaking point here with them.  They seem like they're at what's the word? Predatory infanticide.  Wow. They're going to kill YFrog and Twitpick and all of these other companies.  I think it was Rafa Ali said today that, you know, name one thing, one real innovation that's actually come from Twitter,  Inc. versus came from the community of developers that Twitter then takes over. Right. I just I don't.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Are you still friendly to them? You know, so we're talking about photos, obviously, right?  So they're launching a partnership with Photo Bucket to easily post photos and and essentially kind of taking over, right?  All the photo posting apps. You know, it's so funny, Jeff, because I just I feel like you're the guy who's like, you know,  business isn't about being nice. It's about making money. Right. So, I mean, you're a developer.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And so it just seems to me that that it's it's it's a risk for a platform to start and say, oh, we're a platform you can develop on top of us.  And then you don't know when that day is going to come. They're going to say, OK, rug, rug, rug, rug, rug, pull out all the rugs from under you.  Right. And you, you, the developer community, built all of the really interesting technology and standards atop them and the user community as well.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. And you know, it's interesting is they they're actually partnering with Photo Bucket.  So there is a winner, which is Photo Bucket. Photo Bucket. Right. Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. So, you know, it's interesting. I don't know. Maybe I should be more outraged about this, but this is kind of God.  I'm upset all the photo sharing the Twitter photo sharing developers. And I'm really sorry in advance, but I got to tell you that I think that sharing short links to photos on Twitter, like it just isn't the most innovative thing in the world.  Lots of services that do photo sharing anyway. And like, I don't I don't know. I never really understood. I never really.  Well, I mean, you know, Instagram, that was something that was just it was such a it was just a complete I just never understood it.  So I kind of feel like for Twitter to grow and be a platform. And actually, what's cool about this photo thing is that it's based on Twitter annotation.  So you're going to actually be able to include interesting metadata. You know, it's kind of an open way to include interesting metadata of all kinds of media, not just pictures and videos in tweets.  And that's super interesting to me as a developer. So another go ahead.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Can you use that or can you get that only if you use the Twitter photo sharing app?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Anybody can use that from what I understand. Yeah, Twitter annotations, the annotations, the metadata will be included with tweets through all the APIs or maybe except for maybe the search API, which is getting deprecated.  And that's that makes Twitter even more of a platform.  It gives you more data for think up.  Yeah, it gives me more data. Exactly. And listen, I do. I feel bad for the Y frogs and the pick pleases and all these sites that have sort of built a business on sharing photos on Twitter.  But I also kind of feel like this makes a lot of sense for Twitter. They chose a partner and and you know, as a business, this is kind of.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think it's I think it's categorically different from clients because when you're a wife frog or twit pick, you're really you're really a lamprey eel on, you know, your parasite on the service.  Whereas if I'm building an application that has that allows me to tweet or has tweets in it, I think that's more that's adding more value than just kind of piggybacking on the service.  It seems it seems different somehow to me. Right. Ironically, there were the that was the third party clients at Twitter is probably going to put out a business.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But right, right. Well, not if the third party clients do something.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They add more value. Right. So you look at seismic or you look at tweet deck where they're incorporating not just tweets, but Facebook, you know, status messages.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So what if what if Twitter did tomorrow? What think of us?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'd be really bummed. I would absolutely. And in a lot of ways, Twitter is doing Twitter's doing more with analytics, which is a lot of stuff.  Much of what think of does Twitter does not offer. You know, our big sell is like we archive your tweets.  You can't get your tweets back from 2007, 2008 from Twitter right now, but you can if you're running think up.  I'm sure that at some point they're going to roll those tweets out of cold storage and make them available to everyone. Right.  I mean, even Facebook, you can download your profile now. But that's always the risk when you build on top of somebody else's platform.  It absolutely is. It absolutely is. I mean, you know, part of what we do with think up is we're networking specific.  We make plugins for different, you know, for lots of different networks, much like Tweet Tech did, like with Facebook and Foursquare and Buzz.  I mean, Tweet Tech is a really interesting situation. I mean, you've got tons of data on your desktop from all your friends.  I mean, Tweet Tech could could have really done and I would love to see them do, but they're probably going to kill it now.  Tweet Tech could have done some really interesting search, all the things that my friends have said.  Show me sentiment analysis of all my friends, right, because it's constantly downloading your friend's status updates onto your desktop, which is like you've got tons of storage there.  Anyway, just to be clear, yes, I'd be really bummed out if Twitter.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm just trying to be honest. It's an honest question because I'm really trying to figure out where the line is of predatory behavior versus, hey, it's business.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, your son Jake wrote apps for Facebook. And surely when he did that, he knew that, well, you know, I live at the...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But Facebook did the opposite. Facebook killed its own apps because they said that developers would do a better job.  So the most successful one he wrote was courses. Facebook killed courses. Jake wrote the one that became the number one courses. He's told it.  That was fine. Yeah.  As Zuckerberg, you know, talked about how Zynga now has higher market cap than Electronic Arts.  He bragged about the platform in Paris. And the platform is kind of, to me, in terms of your Jake level developers, has gone nowhere because you can't be discovered.  It's impossible to be found. But at the very high level at Zynga, you know, it's created one heck of a business.  And, you know, Zuckerberg argued that the next successful, I think we're going to talk about this, the next successful music company,  which understands people and music at the same time, i.e. Lady Gaga, you know, same for TV, same for news, same for other things.  So he's still seen it as a platform where I don't think he's competing. He's not doing anything.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It does seem a little churlish because Twitter, I think that's a very good point. Twitter didn't invent anything. The at reply, the direct...  Everything was invented by third parties and Twitter incorporated it and said, thanks, thanks, kid.  Which is a beautiful thing.  We'll see you later.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I love it. I love that. Unless you go and then kind of screw the people who added value to you. That's what bothers me.  I know what you're saying.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, it seems like Twitter adds these features and takes over these clients because they want to make it easy for new users to discover these things.  I mean, I think Facebook as an app platform is just it's apps are a lot more easily discoverable.  I mean, I think it makes sense that Twitter wants to wants to incorporate image sharing into their own app, you know, with their own partner and have some sort of control over that  because they want more people to upload more pictures right now, like uploading pictures, you know, a new user, someone who's not us is like, what service do I use?  What are these links to all these different sites?  You know, why does YFrog act this way and TwiPic act that way?  I mean, this has been their argument, right? That it's a user experience thing.  I think that's a fair argument.  Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, we think of federation and data ownership, like owning your own data and archiving your own data and your friends data is high on my list of priorities.  And I know that's not high on Twitter's list of priorities.  So and that's where I'm making my bet. Right.  Among other little analytical things.  Thank you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're running out of time.  So I hate to do this because we have some we still haven't talked about Google Wallet.  Yeah, that happened right after our show last week.  We'll save that.  We'll think about it some more.  I got a quick question for both of you.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yes.  Should I should I buy a Chrome notebook?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, my God.  They're doing a sale on guilt right now.  Guilt.com.  And I'm so aggravated because they listed the freaking Chromebook in the men's section.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, man.  Right next to Drucker Noir.  Failed.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Feminists not happy.  Not happy.  I mean, honestly, I don't know what other section they could list it in.  I mean, their sections are women, men, home, children, gifts, gender, it's to be fine.  City taste.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think you should quit.  Quick guilt right now.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, I just signed up for guilt recently because Sarah and Veronica were talking about  it on on on sweat.  Yeah.  And but they're way more stylish than I am.  Like I started looking at clothing and I was just like, oh, man, I'm going to send you

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  invite to fab.  Oh, boy.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Fab.  I don't.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Fab is all about design.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Not clothes, but design.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So Samsung's new Chromebook is now available on guilt.  The sale begins.  Oh, it began.  It happened.  It's on now.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It began this morning, I think.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And how much is it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Does it say?  Four ninety nine for the one with the hundred megs of three G included.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I guess now I have to become a member of guilt.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Jeff, I think it depends on what your you know what your use case is.  You know, I don't know.  Do you think you have a MacBook Air?  I mean, do you have a use for a really lightweight laptop?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I have a regular MacBook Pro.  I guess the question is, do I need it to kind of blow open my understanding about how the  world operates?  So when I teach journalism students and things.  Oh, no, no, no.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Here's what you do.  You just take all the applications off of your hair except Chrome.  So Chrome.  Yes.  That's it.  It's the same.  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Basically.  Yeah.  Except it starts up a lot faster than the Mac.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  OK.  So just, you know, forget that part.  But just always keep Chrome running and then just open the lid and that's it.  You're there.  I'll send you the CR 48.  If I could just found the power supply, I'll send it to you.  But it's just that's all it is.  It's the browser.  So take everything off your computer.  Pretend you have no storage.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So I can't store any file there.  No.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, no, you can't.  Can't you can't you download photos?  I mean, you can.  There's a file.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It has a memory slot.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, OK.  You may be like on an SD card.  Yeah.  Because I think it's a very small memory machine.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's very small.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you wouldn't want to put, you know, a bunch of pictures on it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.  No, no, I mean, like a document I'm writing or something.  Like Google Docs.  I could work on that offline.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Can you work offline on it?  You can.  I don't know.  I'm looking at chat rooms.  It says 16 gigabytes of memory on this thing.  So I guess you could serve some documents.  There's a file browser now.  Oh, that's cool.  So now there's a browser and a file browser.  Right on.  I wouldn't get it.  All right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I wouldn't.  But see the new shiny thing and you can get it early.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think you'd be better off getting a tab.  Galaxy Tab 10.1.  I think that's that'd be better.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm a kind of tabbed out right now.  Yeah.  Too many tabs.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, but writing a document, you do want that keyboard.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's true.  That's true.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Are we going to?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're supposed to get one, right?  We're going to send us one, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, they are going to send us one.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I guess if I disclose that, I can keep it.  I'll send it to Jeff.  I'll send it to Jeff.  Don't buy one, Jeff.  I'll send you mine.  Let us get our tool tip and pick of the week, starting with Gina Trapani's tip.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Two new things in Gmail.  One super exciting, nested labels.  This was a labs feature that actually got promoted to built in Gmail.  I don't know.  It could be just because I was at Lifehacker and people were just appalled that it didn't  support subfolders or sub tags when Gmail first launched, but now it does.  When you create a new label, you can create a nested label inside of it.  One way I use this is I'm subscribed to a bunch of mailing lists.  I have a mailing list, parent label, and then each sub label is the name of the list, for those of you who are hyper organized.  Also, Gmail launched last week a people widget.  When you're in Gmail, if you look on the right side, you'll see photos and descriptions and contact information about all the people participating in a conversation.  Has yours rolled out?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Kind of interesting.  I haven't seen it on mine yet.  Yep.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm using Google Apps, too, and I am seeing it.  The people widget, you mean?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't have a people widget yet.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, and it kind of makes you, you can see which one of your friends have actually set a Google profile photo.  You see their photo and you can see mail from this month.  I mean, it shows you kind of, it's actually similar to Facebook's kind of friendship with this person, kind of interactions that you had with a person and documents you shared.  Yeah, no, you're not seeing it yet.  Interesting.  If you look at an email from someone with a Gmail account, maybe, oh no, I'm seeing it from every domain.  It must be rolling out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, they said they were rolling it out bit by bit.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yep.  So people widget and nested labels.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Finally nested labels.  They've needed that for a while, I think.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jeff Chavis, your number of the week.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Number of the week.  I'm going to be between two of them.  Let's see.  I'll go with this one.  It is 500,000, which is how much Google paid epic, the Electronic Privacy Information Center for its buzz screw up.  And they're going to send us all a quarter, right?  Well, that's the thing.  Yeah, that's what's irritating me here.  And it's on top of earlier settlements with other organizations like EFF and such.  And I understand in theory, this is their mitzvah back, their, their, their, their, their, that's the wrong word.  It compensates them for their efforts.  Well, but, but why do they get the money?  Right.  You see, it's bothering me because it's kind of the, the, the, what I call the regulatory industrial complex of privacy now.  Right.  So by complaining, they're making money off complaining.  And I don't like that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Actually, Google issued that objection.  They said they did not want the funds to go to the organizations.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But they, but they did a whole bunch of settlements and they did it all.  And I think that sets the expectations and the motivations of the wrong way.  And it makes privacy into even more of a goldmine for complainers.  So I just want to get it off my chest.  While I'm saying this, I want to, I have a very, very small piece in IEEE spectrum.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now I wanted to talk about that, but you and Gina both mentioned in this.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Gina is quoted galore in it, in the new issue coming up.  And they wanted me to plug it on twig, which I like that somebody wants to be plugged on twig.  So for that, we'll plug it on twig.  We'll go for that.  The IEEE spectrum.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You wrote a piece called public, I'm sorry, privacy, publicness and the web, a manifesto.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, it's actually one third of the story that I wrote, but we didn't agree on the editing of the rest, but it's fine.  And so that's kind of bookish stuff.  And then Gina is quoted like crazy in predictions of the next five things they're going to control the web.  She has wonderful quotes in there.  I agree.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And you can read this online.  Yes, you can read it online.  It's all online.  The IEEE spectrum is spectrum.ieee.org.  Thank you for the plug for them.  Oh, yeah.  I actually put it in my, I booked marked it.  I was going to talk about it anyway.  And I forgot.  So, or actually ran out of time.  I want to thank Gina for this tool.  I actually had a tool that was very obscure and it's really a more of a news story, but it happened today.  Google has released a developer preview of WebRTC, which is their real time voice and video chat system based on HTML and JavaScript.  This is a direct competitor for Skype and FaceTime.  And developers are now being encouraged to use it to develop video conferencing systems.  And I guess take that Cisco too.  Yeah, Cisco's that's the big player here.  Right.  And I guess the idea is if you have a Chromebook, you'd still be able to do conferencing on the Chromebook.  So this is this is an interesting release, not of much use to anybody who's not a developer, but I'm sure Kevin Marx is looking at it.  And then thank you, Gina, because an example application based on the real time communication APIs we made available on labs.  This is an Ericsson video.  You can watch this later.  Go ahead.  This is this is Gina's tip to me for a tool that I didn't know about called Google correlate.  It comes out of the Google labs.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I score 100 points for that.  You're not knowing about it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I is this new?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I had neither, but now that you have it, I don't feel so bad.  So I'll search for what I just search.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do a search, right?  You enter you enter a search.  And then what happens is searches for correlations.  I don't understand it.  Yeah, it's like when I search for Twitter, I get seven minutes in heaven.  It's like searches that have have had similar patterns over time.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, some of the examples are a little better correlated with the with winter.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You get searches for Nordica, colds, hockey arenas and Obermeyer searches that were most likely to be issued in 2005.  So you compare time series and stuff.  You know what?  I love it.  This is another big data thing where if you've got a lot of data looking for correlations,  and information that you can you can deduce from that data.  And it's great that Google lets us play with it a little bit.  So it's a correlate Google labs dot com.  So there's two tools for you on your level of expertise.  Gina Tripati.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Kevin Marks just corrected me that he wanted me to say and he actually he's right that the Twitter photos are not Twitter annotations.  That they're actually tweet entities, which are a different thing.  The Twitter annotation has not launched yet.  So I stand corrected.  My my declaration that the Twitter platform has just opened up to everything is now is it was absolutely wrong.  So I apologize.  Thanks, Kevin.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But I imagine that those photos are available in the API as part of the API.  It's just not an annotate.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. Exactly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, we got to talk more about Twitter annotations and what that's going to be used for.  I think that's very interesting.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  What if it ever launches?  It's been a long time.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a long time ago.  Yeah, they did.  Gina Tripati is at SmarterWear.org.  She's also ThinkUpApp.com.  Sometime soon we'll all be able to think up.  I can't wait.  Can't wait.  You can also follow her on the Twitter at Gina Tripati.  Oh, good one.  Set it right once.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You did. You did.  Great show today, guys.  Thank you.  This is a lot of fun.  Really interesting stuff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, as always.  Jeff Jarvis is the best.  He's at BuzzMachine.com.  You're the highlight of the week, boss.  Professor of CU at C-U-N-Y or CUNY as it is known to its proponents at Jeff Jarvis on Twitter  and the author of This Fine Book, What Would Google Do?  And now we hear September for Public Parts.  That's exciting.  Can't wait.  Yeah.  And I'm going to buy you guys a brick because I like you so much.  Oh, sweet.  I'm buying a brick.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Are you buying a brick?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm buying a brick.  Bricks.twit.tv.  We can put your name on the wall.  You could get a, you know, if you get the 8x8, you could put a logo, get a picture of  your penis or something on there.  Oh, no, I'm sorry.  Representative Weiner has already asked us for that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think I'm going to have to have Gleek online.  Gina Trapani.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Gleek.  Sadly, I can do that now on the smaller brick.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It'll fit, huh?  Hey, thank you guys.  Always a pleasure.  Thank you all for being here.  Thank you, Twig.  This weekend, Google every Wednesday, 1pm Pacific, 4pm Eastern.  That would be 2000UTC at live.twit.tv, but download it after the fact too because we've  got audio and video.  It's fun and it's all of it.  You can see the hair.  You can see the hair.  Twit.tv slash Twig is where you'd find that.  We're on better podcast clients everywhere.  This, it concludes this portion of this week at Google.  Yes, Tom, you can come in.  TNT is coming up next.  We'll see you later everybody.
