Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hello, good to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Watch her carefully because the sun will set in New York City.  She will darken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is getting dark. I'm going to get darker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think snow's on the way, more snow's on the way, is it not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it's just colder than a newspaper publisher's heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I love it. That's Jeff Jarvis.  He's our journalism expert, professor of journalism at the City University of New York.  Google expert too.  What would Google do? And of course his latest is public parts.  And Gutenberg, the geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which today, this is why students could get it, is free.  What?  If you go, you can get it today for free.  The Kindle single version, not the audible version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Go to amazon.com and type in Gutenberg.  The geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I never require my students to buy my books.  Why isn't that nice? That's kind of you.  I think it's a nice thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, you know, on Sunday we had why gluten free at zero.  Now Gutenberg the geek at zero.  You choose.  Also with us, Kevin Marks.  Hi there.  The expert on open standards.  A guy who worked very hard first at the BBC, then was hired by Apple to work on QuickTime.  Worked at Google, British Telecom, Salesforce.com.  He has been everywhere.  Nice to have you, Kevin.  Nice to be back.  Just before the show began, big news broke.  Kind of a shocker, even.  According to at first China Daily, then Reuters, the New York Times chimed in.  As did TechCrunch.  Google is in talks to sell the Motorola Mobility Division.  The Moto X, the Moto G phones.  To Lenovo, a Chinese company.  Google paid more than $12 billion for Motorola about a year ago.  And now reportedly you're selling it for $3 billion.  Although what's not clear is how much of the patent portfolio goes along with Motorola Mobility.  China Daily says 10,000 patents.  But it strikes me that that might be something Google would keep a hold of.  Although the patents haven't been as useful.  We don't know how useful.  They might have been a deterrent.  They haven't used the patents to sue anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Was there ever an evaluation put on the patents or put on the business?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And there were a lot of articles saying why did Google buy Motorola and the consensus seemed to be patents?  Although I thought it was a great deal to get into the handset business and do something a pure Google handset.  They didn't really do that.  They kept the nexus line.  They didn't want to give Motorola too much of an advantage.  Because they didn't want to lose Samsung, HTC, LG and all the others.  So Motorola was just yet another handset maker.  Didn't have much of an advantage by being partnered with Google.  Except for that big marketing budget for the Moto X.  You saw a lot of ads.  But while we don't know for sure, it seems they were losing a considerable amount of money on the Moto X, the Moto G.  In fact, I just bought a new Moto X, an updated Moto X for $100 off.  They offered a deal on Monday for one hour.  I know.  What's the point, right?  But they've been doing a lot of those.  I think that's coming back.  What did you pay for it then?  So unlocked Moto X, 32 gigs of RAM, wooden back.  Because that's what I really want.  That's the main reason I bought it.  350 bucks.  That's a good price for an unlocked.  Very good price.  It's not a Google experience.  But to me, it's better.  It's close. More than close enough.  It's better in some respects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wish I did have the wake up in the car thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's cheaper than the Nexus 5, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For 32 gigs?  I think so.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  32 gigs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I bought one last week because mine got stolen.  Storage, not RAM.  I'm sorry.  I said RAM.  32 gigs of storage.  So it's got two gigs of RAM, right?  Two gigs of RAM, I think.  Or one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it might have one.  So would you own a Chinese cell phone?  Well, here's the interesting thing.  And this is the backstory to this.  Lenovo already makes phones.  They make quite good Android phones.  There were rumors they might make, considering they're a Windows OEM.  They might make Windows phones, but they haven't to date.  And they have not yet started selling Lenovo phones in the US, although they said they were thinking about it.  So while I don't know how much of a sense this makes for Google, it makes a lot of sense for Lenovo.  It's a way for them to quickly get into the US market with, I don't know how popular the Motorola phone is,  but it's certainly a great US brand, and it is made in the US of A.  So I think for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, what makes sense to me too is that Google gets the value it needs out of Play Editions,  which by the way, it's another story today.  They may change the name of Nexus, but they play in Nexus Editions.  So they get the value out of that.  They can make the things.  And they were never really meant to be a large consumer hardware manufacturer, I don't think.  I think it's just so out of their sphere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yet they were.  They just acquired Nest.  It's looked like Google has been building a portfolio of consumer devices,  and certainly they're pushing hard on...  Here's another theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did it piss off the other phone manufacturers?  Maybe.  And there's another story yet on the rundown today that says that Google reached an agreement, allegedly with Samsung,  in which Samsung is going to get rid of some of its ridiculous apps and get closer to it, get a purer experience.  It's on the rundown.  So maybe Samsung is, we're going the wrong way.  Google says, OK, OK, we're out of the phone business.  Now, stay friends.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a disappointment to me, I have to say, because I think it is too.  This has been my daily driver since the Moto X came out.  And as I said, I just bought another one.  I like it so much.  And I like to say it was...  Would you have bought it today, knowing this news?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Probably not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would certainly want to take a wait and see, right?  I don't know what Lenovo is going to do with it.  But I like it that it's...  I liked how closely tied to Google they were, and I'm feeling like that's too bad.  But I guess you might be right, Jeff.  They needed to do this to assuage...  I never heard tension.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I never heard complaints, saw any evidence of that.  There was some speculation there might be.  None of that seemed to rise up.  So it's rank speculation on my part.  Rank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a head-scratcher, otherwise.  I don't know.  I always looked at the Moto X and the Moto G as their first phone, and it'll get better.  And I had kind of the same hopes as Leo had.  Like, oh, that they'll become a phone manufacturer, that they'll own Motorola more.  Then be like, oh, they're operating under their name and their separate business.  And constantly kind of making them a separate thing.  But I thought that the Moto X is a great device.  Leo, did you say you wouldn't have bought the Moto X if Motorola had been owned by you?  If Motorola had been owned by Lenovo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's the same phone, obviously, so I like it.  But I'd be a little...  I mean, part of the reason I like it is because it's a Google phone.  And one presumes it'll get the updates faster.  You know, it got KitKat within two weeks of the release of KitKat.  It presumably will get 442, you know, imminently.  I just... I wonder...  And the other thing is, of course, I worry about Lenovo.  Now, to their credit, when Lenovo bought IBM's ThinkPad division, they did a great job with it.  And kept that vaunted brand in the forefront.  And it continues to make excellent ThinkPads and other, you know, laptop, Windows laptops.  So in that respect, you know, they're good.  They are, by the way, partially owned by the Chinese government, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the part that makes me nervous.  Though, hell, I'm an American, we have the NSA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, who cares? Somebody's going to spy on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What was the joke? Would you rather have an American server in China or a Chinese server in America?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At this point, you just got to assume everybody knows what you do on your phone and leave it at that.  If there is an announcement, Lenovo does say they will be making a big announcement  about a major acquisition Thursday morning in Beijing, which is pretty soon, I think.  This is a big move for Lenovo.  Big move for Lenovo. Three billion is a good deal, too, I have to say, given how much Google paid.  $12.5 billion.  Lenovo has said the company's tablets and smartphones will be entering the US and Western European markets by 2015.  Well, guess what? Maybe not. Maybe sooner.  Although now this would have to be approved, right? And who knows?  I mean, I don't know what the approval would look like.  Will they continue to make phones in the US?  Will they continue to make the Moto X and Moto G? I don't know.  Will they lard them with crapware like the other phones are? That would be a great disappointment to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's almost 6 a.m. in Beijing.  Yeah, so it should be soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We're all thinking. We're all thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently, according to Tim Stevens at CNET, Lenovo was taking an active interest in Blackberry,  but the Canadian government said no. Remember that?  The Canadian government said Blackberry has to be purchased.  Majority ownership has to be in Canada, stay in Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is there any chance that the US government blocks this?  I think there's a huge chance.  On what basis, by the way?  We don't like China. I don't know.  Yeah, technology transfer would be a good start.  Was there discussion of that possibility when IBM sold?  I think it was, wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good question. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Boy, this one has left us stumped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is probably one of the most unexpected things I can imagine.  They just bought Motorola for a huge amount of money. It was 2011. It's been over a year.  But it just seems like a quick capitulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google stock is down 1.3%, 1.4%, but then so is all of tech.  Except Microsoft, which is up 1%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The market is tanking. Blame Apple.  So the one thing maybe for, you know, if Lenovo is going to buy Motorola,  the big deal for Motorola is they have US manufacturing.  It may be that Lenovo is looking to acquire a US manufacturing base  so that when there are coming trade rules over things made in China, they want that.  That's one possibility.  And I suspect any deal they'd have to do with the government would involve not shutting down factories.  That's the point where governments get interested, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, but, you know, various pieces of the phone will still come from China.  They can still have backdoors installed in them.  We just want to keep the jobs in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't care about the spying part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can still backdoors anything now.  The story that got me recently was that SD cards are very easy to backdoor  because SD cards have stopped being raw storage a few years ago  and they all run little microcontrollers because the storage is so small now it's crappy.  So you have to have an OS running a file system on there to sort of hide the defects in it.  And these are all like strange closed source or semi open source microcontrollers.  Therefore, you can take them over more easily because they never get patched.  SD cards are a new vector for things.  It's not something you'd have thought of at all.  You put the SD card in your phone and suddenly it's sitting there running software  and looking at every image you take and what you call them in time and time things and location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why I've given up.  Take my stuff, please.  Anyway, that was the big breaking news as we sat down at the table today.  Hello, everybody. Good to see you.  Welcome.  Welcome.  This is, by the way, maybe they're going to use the money to defray the expense for the big, what is it, DeepMind?  DeepMind, 500 billion?  Purchased half a billion.  So tell me about that. What does that mean? Who is DeepMind?  Is it artificial intelligence?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's artificial intelligence, but it's self-training networks.  So training neural networks on noisy data was the coverage I read about in describing what they were doing.  So if you remember the project where they wired up a neural network and fed it YouTube and it found cat faces.  Oh, right. That was them?  That wasn't them, but that's the group they joined.  Oh, that's the technology.  It's that same kind of idea, but apparently these guys have been good at training,  getting neural networks to train when you haven't got a tight feedback loop.  The classic neural network is you show it a thing and tell it what the output should be, and you train it to give that.  So you can use it for OCR and things like that, optical character recognition.  So you show it a picture of a number six, and then you tell it the output should be number six,  and you picture number seven and do that over and over again.  And eventually it builds something that's a little bit like an image recognition for a brain.  One of the things that this group has done, they've taught neural networks to play retro Atari video games  by showing them the screen and giving them the four up, down, left, right and fire buttons  and not giving them any rules or in a sense the game, just giving them feedback that is points.  And they've actually got things that can now play Breakout better than humans.  Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's fascinating too is that as part of the deal, part of what sold Google on the deal,  according to one report, is that they're creating an ethics committee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it was the way around it. It was a condition of the deal they wanted.  That's what I'm saying. It was a condition of the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Because everybody fears Google as Skynet and they don't want Google to get intelligent, etc.  So the question is, is this to improve search or is this part of the robotics research that Andy Rubin is leading over?  Yes, it's a research.  Remember that they hired Ray Kurzweil, who was one of the premier artificial intelligence experts of some time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, he still is. His early work was OCR as well. He brought machines that would read text for the blind.  Right.  That was his...  Right.  As well as synthesize and a whole bunch of other interesting stuff.  Right.  But the other thing is, arguably they're trying to build a different bit of the brain.  So Kurtzweil wants to build a cerebellum, like the memory and resolving part of the brain.  It's not memory, it's sort of the layered reasoning part of the brain.  And these guys seem to be trying to build the hippocampus, which is the sort of learning and memory part of the brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love this. Only Kevin Marx would do the anatomical analysis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The problem is nobody's building a frontal lobe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the question. You've got to build a frontal lobe.  But also the bit that no one is building is also the emotional response feedback.  No one's building an amygdala.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Who's building an amygdala?  We need an amygdala.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the piece we're going to need.  Yeah, because otherwise you've got a robot that's smart and has no conscience and apparently no impulse control.  So you're really screwed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They should write movies and stories about this plot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, geez. It seems like it would be a fertile area to plumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It seems like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had oral surgery yesterday.  So I spent the day sitting in front of the TV watching movies with a holding ice back to my face.  So I rewatched 2001. So I'm up to date on this.  You're ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kurzweil gave an interview to the Sunday Times last month in which he said that by 2029 they will create a machine that understands language and human emotion, understands it, doesn't have it.  And well before that, by 2018, just a few years from now, the Google brain, he's apparently called it the Google brain, will have revolutionized searches.  We know it right. This is the quote.  Right now, search is based mostly on looking for keywords.  What I'm working on is creating a search engine that understands the meaning of those billions of documents.  It'll be more like a human assistant.  You could talk things over with.  This is very how to say how 9000 that you can express complicated even personal concerns to your always on cybernetic friend.  I want this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're blessed to call who's fun to be with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't care if it takes over or starts bitching about all the diodes up and down its left side.  I want it.  But I mean, you know, we OK, so they've got the part where you talk to your computer.  It's now in all versions of Chrome.  OK, Google.  Boom comes alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't say that my my phone.  I know this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have pinpointed the problem, by the way, because I was playing with it the other day and people were saying, you're God damn it.  You keep waking up my Motorola X or my Xbox one or, you know, stop it.  All the machines are listening now.  I like the idea of it.  You know, it's very primitive right now, but you can have a little bit of a conversation.  God, I love it if we just let me talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And just let me talk.  You listen.  I think I think it's a good life is talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think this is a you know, this is a conceptual floor.  I know they're all excited about we're building a Star Trek computer.  But the reason the Star Trek computer work like that was because that that way they can actually use it as part of the plot and have them talk to it and have it talk back.  And actually, it's not very practical to talk to the computer when you're in a bridge full of 20 people doing their jobs.  Right.  And it's not practical to talk to the computer when you're in an office full of 20 people doing their jobs or on a bus or in a cafe or any of the other places we use computers all the time.  So for me, this is this is talking.  I don't talk to the entire talk to the computer is when you guys are on the other end of it and I'm doing a podcast.  Don't get misled, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But don't get misled by that.  I mean, because you could type your query or whatever.  The fact that it would be able to better understand your queries, know what you're thinking of instead of what you're actually saying, things like that would be useful.  Yeah, but hold on, hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When you live in cubicle land, lots of people are on the phone or used to be.  Yeah, it would be hated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like Kevin's out of work right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you're sitting there trying to write code, you really don't want somebody next to you on the phone.  This is a problem.  They actually did some research on this and they found that people are much more productive when they've got private offices.  Yeah, if they're actually trying to do something that involves thinking and not being interrupted and having people talking.  What happens is, you know, if you actually look at these open plan offices, everyone has has bigger and bigger and more acoustically isolating headphones on.  It's true.  And that's true.  That background noise.  If you go to somewhere like Facebook where they have these giant open offices, half the people that have headphones on and they're like that, like that, try to hide away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Kevin, my friend.  That's not the normal world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think he I think that is the normal world.  In fact, you have you seen the ads for Beats headphones?  They were running during all the football games and what they were selling was that these that these headphones would let you tune out the noise.  There was one with Colin Kaepernick and then I guess in response they made one for Richard Sherman.  And let me show you.  This is a this is the Beats ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The atmosphere was electric.  What's it like playing in front of these fans?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's incredible, man.  I think we have the most outstanding fans in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How important is home field advantage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Notice what's on his head, of course, a pair of Beats headphones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You pick one game at a time.  I really do.  I really do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do you say your trash talk is a distraction to your teammates?  It doesn't distract anybody.  It motivates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is actually a great timely ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you try to set an example.  You try to be an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How do you cut down on your secondary plays dirty?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'll take exception to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Poor guy.  This is this is why headphones are invented.  Did you buy the light of the cake?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not everybody in confidence gang.  Richard, have you gone downhill since college?  No.  Do you feel you're untouchable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not afraid of anything.  I'm not afraid of anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Your reputation as a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's finally had enough.  I don't have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Richard, do you think you are above the law?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Time to put on the headphones, Richard.  Put on the headphones.  Peace and quiet waits.  Hear what you want is the new slogan for Beats.  I think that's a direct response because how many of us really are in a locker room  peppered by questions from the sports sporting press.  But many of us are in offices where people are annoying.  This is why people wear headphones.  I like what I can't wear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't wear Beats, but I do have Sennheiser 280s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love my headphones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thirty five DBs of noise reduction.  Actually noise reduction.  These beats are amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The studios are amazing.  They're comfortable.  Really?  You like them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They are.  They are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  OK.  I can only exchange.  The only thing I found in the store was that's why I used it as an excuse to get them.  I'm happy with them now.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they sound good.  Hey, comfortable headphones that sound good are really a lifesaver.  I agree.  Don't you know?  That's your life.  And I do not.  If I get on an airplane without my headphones, I go, oh, no, please.  I mean, it's the worst, worst thing that could happen.  So, you know, because that baby behind me, the guy in front of me with his phone and  the and I just I just want to seal the seal the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right now in New York, the double is earmuffs, which we need badly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's right, Gina.  Yes, it is cold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not too late to come back to California, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  My real estate lawyer might disagree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you moved in yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not yet.  We'll start our closings next week.  Good luck.  Yeah, thank you.  Thank you.  These are expensive headphones.  They look good, though.  I still see I'm still a newbie to the whole off open office thing.  I've got crappy earbuds and they just don't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no.  You need ceiling ceiling headphones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How's it two eighties?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  That's that's the pic from Mr.  Kevin Marks.  I personally like studio.  Oh, OK.  Beat Studio, the recommendation from center to I'll tell you what I wear and love.  That's the one.  I like those 90 bucks.  That's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They look comfortable.  They're good.  Yeah.  You know, Sennheiser make the studio headphones.  You can pay like three grand for Sennheiser headphones if you want real studio.  But these these are actually recordist headphones.  So they've got 35 dB of passive noise canceling, which means you put them on and you've already  effectively wearing ear protectors.  I like my classic.  And they sound good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like my classic cans, the AKG K240 stare at studio headphones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, there's a good two, but they don't cut out as much sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they're actually a good choice for people want to hear a little bit because they're  ported.  Yeah.  But if you really want to seal it out, then there's also these are the Sennheiser H280s.  Yeah.  And they and they seal your head like you've got a clamp on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're the ones that those are my favorite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  We we we kind of headphone buffs here.  I think we've got all kinds.  There's the K240s on chat.  We wear most of us tend to wear those because they're comfortable.  We can wear them all day and they don't really seal out the noise.  What are these?  These are audio technicas.  T H M 50s.  Both Alex and John, who are audio files like these, they're comfy enough.  There's nothing comfier than a K240.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this is the fascinating thing for me is that it used to be like five years ago.  Headphones like that were something only people who use already professionally wore.  And now they're being advertised in a Super Bowl by the star athletes because suddenly  over the ear cans are fashionable again.  I think it is this it is this sense of of of shared space that the tagline of that thing is right.  It's like you listen to what you want to hear and you want to be as soon as you say you're in this open plan office.  There's a lot going on and you want to pull yourself away from it.  And that was the it was the original Sony Walkman idea of you have your own soundtrack to the world.  It's kind of interesting that it's back, isn't it?  But it's you know, the other encouraging thing for me is these things actually have good acoustic quality.  Right.  So you can you know, there's been this sort of myth of MP3s destroying audio quality in the in the music industry.  And actually what's happened is that people have been mixing, balancing things badly.  Right.  And then MP3ing them.  But they said, well, everyone's only listening to, you know, crepidated earbuds anyway.  You know, we've got to make sure this stuff works.  Whereas that's that's patently not true anymore.  Gigantic headphones with audio isolation are mainstream.  You know, you there are there are four aisles of them in the in the electronics store compared to like one aisle of TVs now.  And and everyone's walking around wearing them.  So that means that we can go back to good, good quality audio again and stop mixing everything so that it's like compressed for somebody who's got these on and walking in traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think also comes with so you're absolutely right.  It has to it has to start with fashion.  Kids can't wear them unless it's OK to wear them.  You don't want to be the dork who's wearing headphones.  And I saw that with my son, Henry, who started wearing lime green headphones about three or four years ago.  It was clearly had become the fashion.  And that's because these earbuds are so not only sound bad, but they fall out.  They're crappy. That's what everybody had with their iPod.  But I also think it came from the commerce side because people realize, oh, you know, you could build these headphones really cheap and sell them for a huge premium.  He just attached Dr. Drey's name to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The markup on the beats and the follow on is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's a very, very profitable business as well.  And that's why when you go to CES, you see aisle after aisle after aisle of headphones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was a great story. The New York Times, I think about a year and a half ago about the origin of beats and the company that originally made them and how  Dray and company got them out of it.  And it's been a phenomenal business story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See, now the wire cutter recommends Bose QuietComfort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wire cutter is almost always right in this case, completely wrong.  Yeah, I've tried them. I don't like them.  No, I'm a I love wire cutter.  That's Brian Lamb and company.  They do a great job and 99 percent of the time I completely agree because the goal of this is pick one and that's the one and almost always they're right.  I agree with their TV review.  But but in that case, I cannot.  Those are not flat headphones.  They're not accurate headphones.  They're highly overpriced.  But Bose is the king.  Yeah, the Bose is the king of markup on these on this particular.  You know, where you go is Headroom, which is headphone dot com.  They sell all the brands.  They've been doing it for years and they have a huge variety.  But they also have a lot of helpful information so you can, you know, pick the headphone that makes sense for you because it is personal.  And really, ideally, you'd go and listen before you buy because they all have they all have some unique.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, Leo, in the chat room, there is a press release now.  Thank you.  It's official.  Yes, it's official.  I am shocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Gadget Priest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Gadget Priest just put it up.  Yep.  It's investor dot Google dot com.  It's the latest press release from the Google.  Two point nine one billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Including.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  With a strong PC business, a fast growing smartphone business, this agreement will significantly strengthen Lenovo's position in the smartphone market.  They will gain a strong market presence in North America and Latin America, both of which, of course, are Moto X places as well as a foothold in Western Europe where Moto X has just recently entered the market.  Two point nine one billion dollars, including one point one four one billion pay to close six hundred sixty million in cash, seven hundred fifty million in Lenovo shares.  That's interesting.  That means Lenovo Google now has a stake in Lenovo, which I find interesting.  Lenovo and promissory notes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lenovo gets the Motorola Mobility brand, Moto Motorola, Moto X, Moto G, Droid.  The Droid is now a Chinese company.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google will maintain ownership of the vast majority of mobile mobility patent portfolio.  There you go.  Including current patent applications and invention disclosures as part of its ongoing relationship with Google, Lenovo will receive a license to this rich portfolio patents and other IP.  Additionally, Lenovo will receive over two thousand patent assets as well as the Motorola Mobility brand and trademark portfolio.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very interesting.  Of course, subject to regulatory approval.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that means the market is like what?  Nine billion on this.  They can basically get nine billion dollar write down and take that off their profits as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they paid nine billion dollars for patents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that was about the guess.  I think it was worth.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And and of course, there's more to it than this.  Who knows what the agreements include, but they may have acquired a very strong partner in an Android as well.  Maybe, you know, maybe they've said to Lenovo, OK, but you got to keep these Google experience.  We don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you're not making any more windows phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they might have kept them out of the windows market.  Not that that matters that much.  But it also means that you could, for instance, say from now on, the Nexus line is made by Lenovo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Period. Well, that's the other story that's up is they're getting rid of the Nexus line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they're going to is this merely a renaming to Google experience?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what it's perspective.  That's what it says.  They rename it.  I don't know what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does that mean I mean, Nexus has traditionally meant a pure Google experience, not not.  I mean, just so that apparently becomes play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So what this source?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the distinction, though, between an HTC Google experience, a Samsung Galaxy for Google experience and a Nexus five years?  Is there a distinction?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes.  There's if they get rid of that, then you have play editions of other brands phones, but you have no Google brand phone.  Got it.  Right.  If this is true, Google got out of having branded devices.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they're not rebranding right.  The Google Play editions already exist.  Right.  Like I'm holding on.  They're dropping Nexus.  They're just dropping Nexus.  Yeah.  It's super cheating.  That depresses me more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That depresses me far more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, me too.  Well, they have hit a problem in that the next Nexus will be the Nexus six.  And that's actually Blade Runner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they had to stop.  OK, I got another interesting theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That one ends.  It's like, oh, go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is Google most afraid of right now?  Samsung, because Samsung is creating an Android device that is divergent from Google in an extreme way.  Now, you were saying that there maybe is some sort of agreement now between Google and Samsung.  Yeah, I put it under Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's an agreement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's also an agreement for Samsung and Google to collaborate on patents, existing patents and like patents in the next 10 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's under the third one or fourth one.  They're united in their fight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Remember, Google just recently dropped the lawsuit.  Motorola just dropped a Samsung lawsuits, right?  So they're really in united against Microsoft and Apple.  Yeah.  These are the natural.  So recode has the story.  After Google pressure, Samsung will dial back Android tweaks and homegrown apps.  It's not just Google pressure.  I think consumers are doing the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Samsung are realizing that they're losing sales to the Nexus 5 partly on price, but partly on the fact that their apps aren't as good.  Yeah.  And as somebody pointed out, if they're built in and they're undeletable, it's a dead way on the phone.  And it's a dead way on the phone.  And it's my wife has the Galaxy 4.  I had I had my Nexus 5 stolen.  And when I went to replace it, it was like, no, I'm getting the Nexus 5.  Definitely.  I wouldn't think think about the Samsung one because of all the weight of those apps and the way it makes their apps aren't bad.  They're just not quite.  Yeah, no, they're bad.  No, they're bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're just bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The camera app and the slow motion stuff and the things they do in there is fairly good.  But I've been impressed with the Nexus 5 for that, too.  But the yeah, no, they're not as good at the cloud services stuff as Google is because nobody is.  So that's that's the you know, you take this Moto X Lenovo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to tell you what to do.  You take the Moto X, you give it a 1080p screen.  I don't think you have to make it bigger.  I think the size is fine.  And you put a really damn good camera in it.  8 megapixel, maybe 13 megapixel.  Maybe let's go for it.  Let's make it a 20 megapixel damn good camera in here.  And this is a great phone.  So I'm hopeful.  I'm thinking Lenovo can I think Google looked for a partner that could take Motorola where Google has been unable to take it.  A manufacturing partner, a partner that can that can make a much better bit of hardware because Google's biggest fear is the 80 percent market share that Samsung has an Android and they're crapping it up.  And and I think it's very deleterious to Android in general.  And so I make sense that they would both pursue this by saying Samsung, you got to knock it off.  Samsung's also hearing for consumers, I'm sure.  And acquire a selling this company to Lenovo and saying, here, guys, you got to make a beautiful Google experience phone to kick Samsung to the curb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you know what?  It's going to be an expensive phone.  Google used this opportunity to try to drop the prices down and pressure the entire industry on cost.  And now that's gone.  And that the president that's why the Nexus being gone depresses me so much.  Because the only reason they did it on Motorola was because they owned it and they had a business reason to do that.  They want to spread Android Nexus.  They want to do to show an example of a great phone at a low price.  Now, here's the statement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Larry Page has just made a statement.  We've signed an agreement to sell Motorola to Lenovo.  This is an important move for Android users everywhere.  I want to explain why in detail.  We acquired Motorola in 2012 to help supercharge the Android ecosystem by creating a stronger patent portfolio for Google and great smartphones for our users.  Over the past 19 months, Dennis Woodside and the team have done a tremendous job reinventing the company.  They focused on building a smaller number of great and great value smartphones.  Both the Moto G and Moto X are doing really well and very excited about the smartphone lineup for 2014.  On the intellectual property side, Motorola's patents have helped create a level playing field, which is good news for all Android users and partners.  So he's declared victory.  But he says the smartphone market is super competitive and to thrive, it helps to be all in when it comes to making mobile devices.  It's why we believe Motorola will be better served by Lenovo, which has a rapidly growing smartphone business and is the largest and fastest growing PC manufacturer in the world.  This is good for Lenovo, I have to say.  This move will enable Google to devote our energy to driving innovation across the Android ecosystem for the benefit of smartphone users everywhere.  In other words, this will help us not piss off the other OEMs.  As a side note, this does not signal a larger shift for our other hardware efforts.  To your point, Jeff, the dynamics and maturity of the wearable and home markets, Glass and Nest, for example, are very different from that of the mobile industry.  We're excited by the opportunities to build amazing new products for users within these emerging ecosystems.  In other words, we're not getting at a hardware, we're not getting at a consumer, we just don't have the resources to devote to phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Phones are a succubus. Matt Howey has a great tweet.  I've owned pizzas longer than Google owned Motorola.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lenovo has the expertise and track record to scale Motorola into a major player within the Android ecosystem.  This is, I think, directly in response to Samsung's dominance.  They have a lot of experience in hardware and they have a global reach.  In addition, Lenovo intends to keep Motorola's distinct brand identity, just as they did when they acquired ThinkPad from IBM in 2005.  They did a very good job of that.  Google will retain the vast majority of Motorola patents, which we will continue to use to defend the entire Android ecosystem.  The deal has yet to be approved in the US or China, and this usually takes time.  So until then, it's business as usual.  I'm phenomenally impressed with everything the Motorola team has achieved and confident that with Lenovo as a partner,  Motorola will build more and more great products for people everywhere.  Larry Page. So that is very, he addressed directly some of the obvious concerns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Also, Ina Fried points out that Google got 2.3 billion for the set-top business.  Ah, that's right.  So take that off the...  They didn't lose all that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think this might not be a bad deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Tax losses, Kevin says, a tax loss is a beautiful thing for Google.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They may actually be able to stop sending all their money through Ireland now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Send it through China.  All right. So, wow, big, huge story.  Jason Howell is watching with interest, of course, all about Android last night.  But this changes the landscape for next episode.  Always the big news breaks the next day.  The next day. They did it just for us.  Wow, that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It dovetails with the news or the rumors about the discontinuation of the Nexus line.  Obviously, Google doesn't want to be in the business of making phones or tablets.  Yep.  Very clear, right?  They want to be in the early, they want to be in wearables and home  because it's not a competitive mature market yet, but phones is.  They don't want to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think this was the plan all along?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wouldn't think so.  I think they're more improvisational than that.  I think they'd say, yes, we will buy this and keep it for three years and send it to somebody else.  I agree with you.  They would just iterate around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I think, you know, what the hell? Let's buy it. Let's get the patents.  We could turn around right away and sell it, but no, let's use a period of time  to demonstrate to the industry what phones can be.  Moto X is that. Okay, goodbye.  I think you're right in the question, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I tell you, what it does say to me is that Larry Page is a hell of a chess player,  whether he is planned this or improvised this.  This is a very interesting strategic move that makes a lot of sense as he's just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm still depressed. I like my Nexus 7. I like my Nexus 5. I like my Chromebook Pixel.  I like what they were doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, but I'm fairly sure Lenovo can make a good Chromebook.  Lenovo does make a Chromebook, don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They do or they are. They're going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're going to, yeah.  Yeah, they're going to make a major push.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're going to make cheap ones, but I'm saying they could probably make a high-end one too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's part of the deal probably too, because that was the CES announcement from Lenovo.  They're going to do multiple Chromebooks.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And by the way, they said they're out of the phone business, not out of the Chromebook business.  Yes.  Although I don't know what Google's play in the Chromebook business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I can no longer say that I live la vida Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could say I live la vida Chrome OS or Android.  But it makes sense.  Google doesn't need to be in the business.  They need to foster the business and let many companies get involved.  I think this isn't a bad thing at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It helps to be all in.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To compete.  That's what they're saying, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what they're saying. We were not all in.  They didn't want to invest the time and the resources to make Motorola competitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We shall return.  There's more to talk about, including our changelog in just a bit.  Gina Trapani is here from ThinkUp.  How's it going?  Going well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Going well.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's only 99 cents, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, you're saving a buck.  The US.  Is it a new semester beginning?  Is that what's going on?  Yes, it is.  That's why I'm talking about my students read it.  New semester.  And you know, this is good because most people assume that professors assign their own books  to make a little money.  So Jeff's proving it.  I do.  Not Jeff Jarvis.  He gives it away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I plug them a lot, but I don't assign them.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also, Mr. Kevin Marks.  Always a great pleasure to have Kevin in his garden.  Is it raining down there?  No, it's not.  It's dry at the minute.  It will be.  We're having rain up here.  It has been raining up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We need it.  You always need it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's been a very dry winter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it was in the I must say this just to make Jeff and Gina feel bad.  It was in the 80s here last week.  Oh, shut up.  We did.  And what we were complaining because we need the rain.  It's so warm.  Gosh, I wish it would rain.  I can't.  There's the rain.  There it is.  Coming your way.  I know that the reason it's raining is that because my son took the car to the car wash  and he was like, I'm going to go to the car wash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The reason it's raining is that because my son took the car to the car wash yesterday.  So that's guaranteed to make it rain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So did Chad, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yesterday I got my car washed.  Yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  The car wash over here has a saying that says guaranteed free wash if it rains.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait, which one?  Rain tree over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I don't use that one.  They'll give you a free wash if it rains.  I think it has to rain within a few days, obviously.  Our show today brought to you by Personal Capital with Personal Capital.  You'll finally have your entire financial life in one place on your computer, on your tablet,  on your phone so you can see in very clear graphs a dashboard of how everything's going.  There really are two problems in life with how people manage their money.  First, it's hard to keep track of.  You know, you come to the end of the month, you go, where did it all go?  What happened?  You've got, you know, 401Ks, you've got bank accounts, charge cards, mortgages, loans.  Everything's on different sites.  It's not consolidated in one place.  And then if you're, you know, you're lucky enough to have some to invest,  you'll be either paying somebody to management or paying fees to brokerage.  And it's just, you don't know.  And there's ways to do it more efficiently.  Let's put the power of the cloud to work for us here with Personal Capital.  You'll see your whole net worth, how every asset's performing.  No data entry.  You just give them the account information.  It all is collated, put together in clean, color-coded graphs.  It shows you if you are paying money managers, how much your fees are adding up to,  how they're impacting your profit, how you can reduce those fees.  You can get specific advice on your investment strategy  so you can balance your portfolio.  It's very different when you're young than as you approach retirement age.  And it's really important that you rebalance kind of continuously.  But it's a very hard thing to do.  I'm a big fan of this idea of rebalancing your portfolio, at least quarterly.  But man, I never do it because it's so, this makes it easy.  And the best part is it's absolutely free.  It's not going to cost you a penny.

Transcript:  We help you gather and Google.  The Google changelog.  Ladies and gentlemen, Gina Trapani with the latest from the Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Lego lovers, this one's for you.  Build with Chrome dot com.  This is a site that Google graduated from a Chrome experiment to an actual public website  to help them make the new Lego movie.  Yeah, have you seen this?  No, this is so cool.  It's pretty awesome.  The site uses WebGL 3D graphics.  Let users build any creation, any virtual Lego creation they want using virtual Lego blocks.  Very slick web-based interface.  You drag the blocks onto the, you choose your crawler blocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course, it's too complicated for me.  I can't figure it out.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, where's your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And why do I have a map?  What is this map?  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have to kind of play around with it a little.  Now it should have shown, it should be showing you the base, your Lego base, but it doesn't seem to be.  I'm in Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Left click, place brick.  Right click, remove brick.  Space and drag, rotate brick.  Yeah, you can rotate bricks.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can add bricks of different sizes and kinds and connect them just like regular Legos.  It's pretty awesome.  Once you've made something, you sign in with Google Plus so you can share your creation.  You can look at stuff that other people have built on the site as well.  There's an explorer option when you first go to it.  Build with Chrome.com.  This is all the bricks I ever wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Prepare to lose many hours.  Mine's not working well though.  There you go.  Chad, how come yours is working so well?  Mine's working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There you go, Chad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got it.  Chad's smarter.  Chad's smarter than I am.  Maybe if I sign in with my Google Plus.  Know your base, say allow Google, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know how to sign in since it still works.  Huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a really nice, smooth interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That is sweet.  I'm getting dizzy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chad's really good with Lego.  Mine's broken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I blame Minecraft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, it is very Minecraft.  It is very Minecraft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the thing that struck me about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No wonder Chad's so good at it.  Neato.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, buildwithchrome.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's not that satisfying click there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, there is.  Oh, there is?  Can you hear the click?  It goes.  Oh, neat.  Now, I don't know how to trash here.  Let me remove bricks.  Whoa, it is like Minecraft and they just kind of float there.  You can have limitating bricks.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's also a build academy so you can train to become a master builder.  That's good.  So this actually master the, okay.  So do the academy.  Chad, show this.  This is nice.  This is the academy.  It shows you how to get started.  And then every build begins with a base plate which you can rotate.  Try it on your own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then, oh, this is neat.  And I think it features characters from the movie as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's a movie tie-in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's to promote the movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's all right.  Who's not excited about the movie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, who doesn't want to build with virtual Legos?  It's a Lego movie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a Lego movie.  There's always a Lego movie.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know we want to keep building Lego, but I should move it along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google's got a new one-box search result answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's as the crow flies, distance calculation.  So if you want to know the distance between two places, even places that you can't fly or drive, you can just enter the query into the box.  So if you say, how far is it from Petaluma to Brooklyn?  Or how far is it from Brooklyn to Hawaii?  Google will display the distance as the crow flies distance in one box results.  So it's just kind of fun.  Could be a really fun party game as well.  How far do you think it is from Hawaii?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do this all the time with maps, but it's so painful.  This is great.  Yeah, yeah.  This is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  And another little tweak to Google search results.  Google search pages now show the name of the site next to the URL.  And if it's a well-known name, it's a well-known site that they have knowledge graph information about.  You'll see a small card with that information in it.  So you Google search, Twitter, for example, or YouTube, and the example Chad's showing us, there's a little drop down, a little kind of knowledge graph card that shows up and tells you what the entity is, who it's owned by, and any other sort of knowledge graph facts included there.  So I searched for Twitter.  There was a little card there for that.  There was one for Lifehacker.  There's not one for ThinkUp yet because we haven't reached our relevancy yet, but we're working on it.  But yeah, see, it says owned by Leo Laporte, which I guess links to your Google Plus profile, I imagine.  Or Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a Wikipedia entry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a knowledge graph, which is mostly Wikipedia.  Yeah.  It actually sites Wikipedia.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's really neat.  Yeah.  It's very up to date, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cool.  And finally, Google announced new designer frames for Glass.  So if you already spent the $1,500 on Glass, you can now spend another $225 to get new custom frames that have been designed in-house by Google.  They're much more normal looking glasses than the visor-like version.  And Google also partnered with one of the largest...  I lost the...  Sorry, I lost the insurance companies that cover...  VPS.  VPS is the insurance company.  Yes, thank you.  Vision insurance providers.  And we'll cover Glass and get you prescription frames.  Thank you, Leo.  So yeah, these frames are nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They still don't make...  Better than the dork you put in it over.  So two problems I have.  One, they don't make clear...  Because I'm about to send in my old Glass on the exchange program that they have.  First question.  These work with Glass properly.  You're not getting a different Glass, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  You can actually remove the Glass apart from your current Glass and snap them on to the new frames.  Okay.  Which apparently only work if the electronics are snapped on.  And apparently it's very smooth and easy transition.  It just snaps on and works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  What do you mean it only works if they're snapped on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I believe that the new frames are designed for Glass specifically.  So I'm not sure exactly how this works, but I don't think that the frames will stay on your head if Glass isn't attached to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I see.  They are Glass.  So you can't just take the Glass off your Glasses when you go into the movie, but we don't want to go there again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would be a nice feature, though.  Why can't you just unsnap it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, the reaction to that last week?  I mean, it was so polarized.  Some said that I was being a horrible jerk.  Some said that you were being a horrible jerk.  It was amazing.  Yeah.  But everybody loves Gina.  Everybody said, poor Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I realized coming out of the conversation that I really didn't say what I thought because I really I could see both of your points of view.  But in the end, just to make sure that everyone I was with Jeff in the end.  I felt like although I would if I was in a locker room, it's not quite the same in women's bathrooms.  But if I was in a gym locker room, I would put the Glasses on top of my head at the same time.  But I did get with your point of not assuming the worst.  But I didn't want to open that can of worms again.  I just want to make sure I hear about my opinions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Get ready to shoot.  All right. Here's my other question.  I swear.  And since Gina, you have Glass too.  They say, oh, go buy them now.  I saw this was a problem in the forum.  Every time I and many other people went to try to buy this is a become an explorer.  No, I am a friggin explorer.  Let me buy the frames.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can't figure out by is that a multiple account sign in thing?  No, I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because I don't have my glass transferred to Buzz Machine to my apps account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, you do. OK.  Yeah, I transferred it.  But when you become an explorer, they like whitelist your account.  So they may have whitelisted your Gmail account.  So try logging in.  Try seeing if you're signed in as your other account.  Maybe it's some weirdness around that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, Google.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  So when I went to go pick up glass, they like manually added me to some sort of whitelist.  They asked me for my Gmail address and did it.  So that might have been the issue if it says that you're should become the.  OK, just me a favor here, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Look at the four frames.  Which one should I buy?  There's four frames.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought there was just one.  So they're all titanium.  They're all titanium.  They're light.  I like titanium frames.  And how much are they?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They're hundred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Two twenty five, I think, right?  Twenty five on top of the fifteen hundred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's not bad.  Plus, plus the lens you don't have to buy to fit into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, there are companies I've seen here who sell OpticsPlanet sells.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Rochester also.  Adapters for Google Glass so that you could then attach them to prescription glasses.  That's thin, which isn't as thin as split.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's bold.  And that's your look right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you get your lips to look like that, too?  I think so.  How can they all have puffy lips?  I guess they're all young.  I think that one's one.  Glass gives you nice lips.  Yeah, this one.  Yeah, put just Jeff, tilt your face down a little bit.  Purse your lips.  Can grow your.  I know your beard is good.  You're ready with the beard.  Very good.  It's not a good look.  It's not a good look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My nose is over his nose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, we're on now.  Yeah, you got to match it all up.  There you go.  You look like John Boehner.  I don't.  It's not working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If I look like John Boehner, it's like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Boehner was darker than Obama.  That was the weirdest thing.  Has he been in the tanning booth?  What's going on with him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Her eyes and tans.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then, of course, the whitest man in the world is our vice president.  I mean, oh, this is better.  This is better.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Smile, Jeff.  Don't look so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think those are for you.  Yeah, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good look.  Turn your head a little bit to the left.  Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The other way.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hmm.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, when he smiles, it works.  It's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Screenshots are coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They need an Android app that has you try on the frames on your face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Doesn't Warby Parker do that?  That was the rumor they were going to do a deal with Warby.  They should have.  I think that's your look right there, Jeff.  That's kind of the horn rim professorial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The glass hardware is still too big.  It still looks, I said this on all the Android last night, it still looks too cyborg-y.  Still better than the visor, but still.  Well, that's all I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's the Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does it mean if they're doing frames that is imminent that they're going to make less a consumer product?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I don't think they always said they would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I think so.  They've been pushing updates.  It's not like nothing has changed with it for a while.  I think that they're doing frames.  They've been pushing out updates.  I think that they're committed to glass, committed to the consumer release.  I bet it would be this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You just saw Larry Page in his statement on the Motorola acquisition mentioned specifically wearables.  He didn't say glass.  He said wearables.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, and Sergey is the glass guy, right?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gmail goes down for 50 minutes.  The world reels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, maybe not.  Over half of our ThinkUp subscribers use Gmail.  It's amazing how people use it and how it really can throw off things when it's down.  I mean, it's just never down.  But yeah, 50 minutes without the drip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't notice, but that must have been at a time when I wasn't paying any attention.  YouTube comments didn't work.  Google Plus didn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It wasn't just Gmail.  I think it was the user graph thing that went down, which is scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so that's kind of interesting.  So there is a tool, there is a service that Gmail Plus both use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it was the old, it was the contacts thing from Gmail.  And then while I was there, it got made into this centralized service that everyone could use.  Every Google product could use.  And that's partly what, and that's what all these new Plus and everything else is built on top of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it wasn't IMAP or POP that went down.  It was this identity service, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, because that, I'm trying not to say internal code names.  So that basically is an internal service that is all the profile information.  And it was migrated from being your contact details inside your individual Gmail thing,  which was sharded over lots of servers, to being a very, very large database of everyone's contacts  and everyone's personal profile.  And that was then used as the backbone for building out all these other services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that would, for instance, if that's the case, then you would have seen Google Connect go down as well,  or whatever Google calls it, the login, the centralized login.  No, not necessarily the login.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The login is separate from that.  I don't think that went down.  That thing has insane uptime.  That has like had 100% uptime for something like nine years.  Because they really, that is like lockdown like anything else.  But I think it was the actual, the profile information stuff and the ability to pull information about people.  That seemed to be the bit that was down.  And that was, because that's heavily called by these other services, they lost it as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the picture of Larry Page with Yang Yuan-Ching, the chairman and CEO of Lenovo,  apparently in Mountain View right now to seal that deal.  This is the picture that Google released with the announcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're giving you this giant robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looks like he's just bought a used robot.  I am sorry, but it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a Trojan horse.  It gets there and little Google cars come out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If the Chinese regulators don't approve this deal, it will be this picture that did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's an interesting question by the way.  Does this affect the relationship of Google to the Chinese government anyway?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's special complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's news that nobody, I don't think anybody had that news.  And it's very interesting, Kevin Marks, but because of your internal knowledge of how this is all wired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't seen a post-mortem on it yet.  I haven't either.  They normally write a post-mortem post.  I haven't seen one, but I may have just missed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Charles Arthur, the Guardian, just put this up.  Google's original valuation for Motorola Mobility.  2.9 billion cash, 5.5 billion patents, 730 million customer relationships,  2.6 billion Goodwill, 670 million net assets.  And then I guess that's plus the, I would guess that's separate from the set-top business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they're keeping the Goodwill, but they're selling the phones.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, as you say, you can write down the Goodwill when you feel like it.  Right.  So that means that you can take it as a loss when you want to adjust your balance sheet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  New patent for Google Glass.  This is a newer design.  This just appeared at the US Patent and Trademark Office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or does it look different?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It says it looks different, but that looks kind of, I don't know.  You're the guys with the glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are those actually earphones?  As opposed to bone conduction things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well that we knew.  That was the new version of Google Glass, right?  It had headphones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's, I'm not paying much attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But what this, yeah, it's on both sides.  So that's what's new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This piece of hardware on the front doesn't extend back as far as the current one does.  So they're lessening the hardware.  Unfortunately, they're lessening the hardware at the back of your ear, which you don't care about, right?  You care about what's on your head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this was all battery back here, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, this was battery.  Right, it was battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To stop it falling off.  You've got all the weight back here to stop it falling off the front.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Erwin's here. Erwin, come here.  Bring your Google Glass over.  So Erwin, I saw you had a USB connector.  Is that to keep it charged?  Yeah, because the battery runs out fast.  So this new design eliminates this whole temple piece back here.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's the battery, isn't it?  And the bone, oh, that's the bone conductor though, too.  Yeah.  Erwin's visiting from Hong Kong.  Right, so that's why this has the...  How long have you had your Google Glass?  Since November.  Since November.  And you wear it all the time?  You're wearing it over prescription glasses.  Are you going to get the new...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't wear it when I drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He says he doesn't wear it when he drives.  Certainly not in California.  You never want to get stopped.  The other thing is it's no longer over your right eyebrow,  unless this is a reversed image, it's over your left eyebrow.  Yeah.  That's confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, the problem with all of these also is you can't fold them like glasses  and put them in a pocket.  Right.  There's no easy way to...  So thus...  ...for them.  If I had them in the movie, it would be difficult for me to take them off,  because I couldn't fold them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait, but these new frame designs, they're foldable, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You could put them on those little glasses chain  and hang them around your neck, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not doing that.  Oh, come on.  so you might as well just do it with your glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ooh, there's a thing there.  There's a jewelry opportunity, yes.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lorgnette, a Google lorgnette.  I'm waiting for the Google monocle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  To go back to the Gmail...  or not the Gmail outage, well, the people graph outage.  First, the Google SRE, site reliability engineers,  were doing an AMA and asked me anything on Reddit  at the time that the downage happened.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's part of the problem, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then Yahoo, on their official Twitter account,  tweeted that Gmail was down  and then later deleted the tweet and issued an apology  saying that they shouldn't have mentioned it.  Which was their mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was the mistake because it was just a new...  they didn't snark, they just said it's down.  That's a news story.  The mistake was the apology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a news feed and Gmail being down was a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a news story, it's not a snark.  For them to apologize is to admit something that did not happen  and to raise questions about why it happened.  Yeah.  But who knows?  So it said, at 10.55 a.m., this is the official post,  an internal system that generates configurations,  information that tells other systems how to behave,  encountered a software bug and generated an incorrect configuration.  It was sent to live services over the next 15 minutes  causing user requests for their data to be ignored  and these services in turn generated errors.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It gives you a glimpse at how complex this machine is, right?  Wow, yeah.  So the code that writes code wrote the wrong code,  which then pushed the code and caused other code to respond  with a failure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Get this. Engineers were...  This is all from the Google official blog.  Engineers were still debugging 12 minutes later  when the same system having automatically cleared the original error  generated a new correct configuration.  20 minutes later, 11.14 a.m., and began sending it,  in other words, it self-corrected.  Errors subsided rapidly starting at this time by 11.30.  The correct configuration was everywhere.  All user service was restored.  In other words, they say this happened automatically and was fixed.  I think this is very interesting automatically.  That's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's pretty cool.  The challenge with...  For somebody to cause an outage at Google,  it has to be some kind of cascading failure  because they have enough redundancy that any given thing  will not cause a failure.  But it's when something changes to some other system,  that's when things go horribly bad.  And the big ones that we've seen,  they've always had something like that happening  where something causes something else to happen  because something else happened,  and therefore they're blocking each other.  It's similar when Amazon goes down.  What happens over time is they find these new failure modes  and find ways to protect against them.  It's interesting they've got an automatic system  that's going to change generically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  According to this blog,  it's by Ben Treanor of VP Engineering.  This blog post says,  Gmail, Google+, Calendar and Documents were all affected.  But for about 25 minutes,  for 10% of users it persisted for as much as 30 minutes longer.  That's a minor outage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you say YouTube was affected?  Pardon me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No. Gmail, Google+, Calendar and Documents.  The comments on YouTube,  because now those are done by Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess that's not considered a separate service.  There's actually another bug that's kind of a more significant bug.  Google Calendar was for a while  adding others to your private events without warning.  So if you're having a birthday party tonight  and somebody you didn't invite shows up,  it's not your fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just had this vision that's how Kramer gets to a meeting  in the company on Seinfeld,  in the modern Seinfeld.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I think,  if that's the same one I think it was.  I think it was them being over smart.  Yes, exactly.  So if you make a note to yourself to meet with someone  and you include their email address,  then Google would say,  oh, you're obviously trying to arrange a meeting with...  So if I say,  contact fredditsmith.com,  there's a note to myself in the calendar,  then it will send a meeting invitation to fredditsmith.com,  if you put it in the title.  That was the bug.  Which, you know, you can see how they thought of that as a thing.  But, yeah, clearly you don't want it doing that.  Or at least you want a confirmation dialogue.  Yeah, and probably you shouldn't use  email addresses in your

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  event titles.  So, as an example,  this is the guy who discovered this,  Terence Eden,  who says he writes about mobile's Shakespeare politics  and usability.  I don't know where the Shakespeare comes in,  but anyway,  he says, my wife likes to set reminders for herself  in Google Calendar.  Recently, she added a note to her personal Google Calendar  reading,  email Alice at example.com  to discuss pay rise  and set the date for a few months from now.  A few months later,  Alice, her boss,  sent her a meeting accepted email.  Whoa!

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Whoa!

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Whoa!  Whoa!  Oh dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would just say,  if you hit the  Smart Create button,  Quick Add,  because if you do that,  then I wouldn't be surprised.  You can click Quick Add and say,  meeting with...  Be careful who  you use email address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Leo at his company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Leo at Twitter.TV you could use.  I've always, because I don't read that,  I've always  seen a, would you like to  email an invitation  to this person,  dialogue box, which you could then  say no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Send, don't send. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what I got.  When I got that, I said send invitations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, here's the video  of it.  It's the Quick Entry.  It's what you said. It's the Quick Entry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the Quick Entry is trying to pause the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what you're trying to do.  You put an ad in there. It does location.  If you put a time or date, it automatically figures it out.  Now see, there's the  configuration. But he clicks do not send  and it still sends. Whoops.  That's a bug.  Actually, I've had that happen.  Because I...  This actually, I have seen this bug.  But unlike Terrence,  I just wasn't paying attention,  I always  make... I put somebody's email  in calendar  and stuff. When I do a show, I put the  like, maybe your email or whatever,  Gina, in the calendar.  And say don't send an email because I want  the Moto X to think I'm in a meeting.  Unless there's somebody in the calendar event, it won't be a meeting.  So I always put  names. And Chad, maybe, do you get emails  from me every week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. I get a...  This Week in Tech is starting  now. Yeah. Okay, that's because...  But now, did you see in that video  he was showing, if it wasn't the  Quick Add, it didn't do the pop-up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, so it isn't the  Quick Add that's the problem. It was  the normal ad that's the problem. It was when you click in,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  click edit, and then a new event.  And it just did it automatically

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in that video. He says, Google  has tried to be clever. Same...  They all say the same thing. It's tried to be clever here.  It has failed just because I'm  talking about someone doesn't mean I'm talking  to someone that is exactly right. Yeah.  But that's, again, it's  just a failure of artificial intelligence.  Imagine how much worse it could have been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Talk to boss about  resigning or talk to employee  about firing them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chad, forget those emails.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the fake meeting I've just set up  with Leo for next Sunday,  it says, guests  yes, maybe no, awaiting  one. Oh, you must have sent me

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  an email. Yeah, you definitely did.  Well, let me check my mail.  Well, it's going to take a while  to do that. Leo at Twitter TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have to check that one. Yeah, that's going to take.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't even know what the password is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No wonder you don't respond to my  email. No, don't mail me there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know better than that.  Don't mail me at Leo at Twitter TV.  Who's that?  I'm going to log in.  Fortunately, I have LastPass  remembers it. See if I get an invitation from  Kevin Marks.  Nope, not yet.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they fixed this, right?  Oh, yeah, they fixed it. You must have fixed this by now.  Except that, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You just say, awaiting guests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, maybe it's not in important and unread.  Maybe it's in everything else.  It's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You search for Kevin Marks Gmail.  Oh, yeah, you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it's still working. It's still doing it.  Is it? Yeah. Yeah.  Well.  So here, I can do it live.  Did you get one? Yeah. So here, delete  notified guests. So if I'm here  and I just add an event and immediately  hit... Oops. Calendar is insane.  He's a busy boy. I'm busy.  And hit edit event. And then  type in something. So I have email  Leo at Twitter TV to ask him to stop  leaving Ozzy poop at my desk.  And I just hit  save. One second. Let me  let you see it. Yeah. Yeah.  And then I... Didn't ask.  Didn't ask. Didn't ask. And then if I jump back  in, you have been added as a guest

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  on this event. Well, that's normal. That doesn't  mean I got an email. But it didn't see the thing  about email guests. But Kevin's seeing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  awaiting as well. I see that awaiting  is a bit quite suspicious. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like that means it's  in theory, it's emailed me  an invite.  But I haven't seen an invite. So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And at the bottom of this verge story, it says  Google says that it's aware of the issue  and is actively working to fix it.  So maybe it is not fixed. I have this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you canceled the event, Chad. I got an email  that you canceled the event.  It's been removed  from my calendar. But it was  added to my calendar. I didn't even say anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So we'll go to your calendar

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  on that. I don't have a calendar  on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's been removed. So we've got to  do it. I don't... It's enough.  It's a problem. It's a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. So the moral of the story is  do not type people's email addresses into  invitations unless you want to invite them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because Google is very, very  helpful. You know, this  is the problem with robots  and computers in general. They don't understand  anything, but they're trying to be helpful.  But this is the problem with this AI project, right?  They're trying to build this  system. Maybe DeepMind will fix this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. DeepMind will know that you don't want to invite someone who you're firing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This week with this... Do you see the State of the Union  one? No.  I put it in the rundown.  Let me check. The rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I've...  Gmail just saved me from I put the wrong  John in an email and I said,  I don't know. Did you mean this?  It does a good job with that.  It's brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that can be fun.  Especially when it's like, ask me which of the three  people with the same name, with the same icon  are. I want the meeting. It's like,  show me the email.  So  this is  during the State of the Union,  a friend of mine searched for State of the Union  and it showed a link to a CNN  story with a picture of President Nixon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was it this year's State of the Union or was it doing a 1967 State of the Union?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's at the bottom of the Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I see it. Yeah. Tantech did this.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's like  this is  an extension of the  Knowledge Graph stuff and it's like a sort of  ignorance graph or something.  It's like a free association graph. They're trying to make these  machines behave like brains  and they are behaving like brains. They're like, oh, President of the United States,  I don't know, it's Nixon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know the President, he's Richard M. Nixon.  I shall help you  with a small picture of him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I'm not sure where that comes from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the first thing they found at her State of the Union, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Somebody must have done a history of State of the Unions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It maybe came from CNN.  You know what? That's probably what happened.  Maybe CNN.  Well, Tantech says there was no Nixon image on the linked page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, the images very often do not match.  Very often.  They're picked from elsewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, you know,  I saw that with the  the feature  Gina talked about with the graphs,  Knowledge Graph things being attached to stuff.  When I searched for Biden name, I found  on various different websites,  different little cards about me that  had different bits of information on them that they crawled from different places.  And they would actually crawl the one off my own website,  which I carefully marked up with microformats  and sent to them.  They would crawl that, but they'll crawl  Wikipedia and they'll crawl  Google Plus and they'll crawl a few other places  and then cobble stuff together and say, this is what we think we know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've got an idea for a new feature on the show.  The Google Glitch  of the week.  Just where a computer did something really dumb,  trying to do something smart.  Because you know what?  This is just the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google Bot will pause.  This is my theory about AI, is that the AI  they're going to have to build is a sort of  self-justification AI.  Which is, you know,  the latest theories about how our brains work  is that  the lower levels of our brains  decide something unconsciously  and then this sort of  personal narrative part of our brain makes up a reason why we did it.  And there's all these wonderful experiments  where they  can do this by  getting people  to show people something with their non-dominant eye  and then  they will then  confabulate an explanation for why they were thinking about that thing  with the part of their brain  that does speech with the other eye.  There's a bunch of experiments like this  which is  they've basically shown that  we decide something, we make an association  and then we will  come up with a plausible  sounding explanation to ourselves for why we did that.  And I suspect that's going to be the next  phase of AI and that's going to start getting really scary  because they'll get good at baking up plausible explanations  for why they showed a picture of Nixon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, here's something  really sad and I hope this doesn't  become a trend but we're seeing it in  San Francisco. Protesters  not only defacing and protesting  the buses of Google and Apple and other  big corporations that have a bus  for their San Francisco employees to bus them  down. The complaint is of course  the gentrification of San Francisco, the  increase in rent and all of that  stuff. And now here's one.  Protesters show up at the Berkeley doorstep  of the guy who  wrote the code for the self-driving car.  An image was distributed by a group called Counter Force.  Anthony Levendowski  is building an unconscionable world of  surveillance, control and  automation. He is also  your neighbor.  Urging people to go to his home  on Tuesday  and protest.  This is so sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We don't want to fall into the Perkins  comparing this to Kristallnacht.  No, it's not Kristallnacht.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But he said  he of course, the founder of Kleiner  Perkins, in a  Wall Street Journal op-ed piece,  likened this kind of stuff  to a progressive  Kristallnacht, the Nazi  persecution of Jewish  shopkeepers by breaking their windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The most extreme  example of Godwin's law I think I've ever seen.  Yet, I also

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  don't think it's, I mean, what he's  saying is  you know,  what we're seeing is demonization  of computer scientists.  Fine. I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  argue with that, but to compare that to the murder of 6 million people.  It's not the same as killing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  6 million Jews, but it is  nevertheless a demonization.  Did you see

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  him interviewed on Bloomberg where he went  even more off the deep end?  I couldn't find

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that online. Is that online?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know. I would assume  that Bloomberg would post it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's older and out of touch. I'll give  him, it's just, it's not,  I understand what he was  trying to say. He said it in a very ham-handed  and inappropriate way. However,  I do understand what he was trying to say,  which is, and I think this is something  that could potentially be feared, is  the mob turning  against  technology. It's Luddites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Part of this too, and again,  I hate following what he said because he was  such an idiocy, but  the new 1%  is the technology community.  If you take my argument,  the technology leads to efficiency  over growth. It leads to  greater profitability, productivity,  and thus wealth, but wealth  in the hands of technology people  at the expense of huge numbers of jobs,  not directly from robotics or that kind of stuff,  but just through new efficiencies and new networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, let me just say, you called me a  Luddite last week in a way that was highly  inappropriate, and I resent.  Oh, shoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm going to  picket your office, you Luddite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But this is the Luddites  because that's what happened. Ned Ludd and his  protesters broke the looms,  the  mechanized looms because they were being put  out of work  by this technology. That's where the  word Luddite comes from.  Ned Ludd may well be a mythical  character, but nevertheless,  it's where this came from.  That was in 1779, so  the more things change,  the more things stay the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that was, the Luddites  was explicitly job displacement.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think there's a legit,  I think there is, well, not legitimate, but there's a  Luddite protest. It is an economic protest,  though. It's housing displacement. We are being evicted  by the gentrification.  This new 1% is  taking away our city.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  To which I say,  would you prefer that the entirety  of the economic benefit  and jobs and everything else of the  technology revolution had happened in Cleveland?  San Francisco,  so you're complaining about success.  It's a weirdly American thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was trying to have this debate with  Anil  on Twitter, and I think the analogy is  it's like they're sending buses  to Brooklyn and Manhattan  to take the  employees over to their jobs in Newark,  where they feed them all day and then send them back  at the end of the day. If you actually  look at the distance, it's about the same transit.  And Newark would be delighted

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  to have...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Mountain View is very  much like Newark. There's actually,  that's a very good analogy.  And the reason they do it  is nobody wants to live in Newark or Mountain View.  They want to live in San Francisco or Manhattan.  It's not just that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But ironically, it's not Mountain View

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that's complaining. It's San Francisco that's  complaining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But they're complaining, the bus  thing is, they're complaining because they're  clogging up the city bus stops with these buses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, however, if you took all  the people out of the buses and had them in their cars,  it would be a hell of a lot worse for everybody.  And obviously, it'd be

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  much better if they subsidized car training  and put Wi-Fi on it. Nevertheless, what this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  really about, and I think there's a legitimate point  to be made here, is the fundamental  problem of income inequality,  which is a growing problem  nationwide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that is where Tom Perkins is the  appalling poster child for it, where  he pops up with his ridiculous entitlements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, these poor people are just  really getting on my nerves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What was this, Kevin?  What was the watch part of the Perkins thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The watch was...  It was something about  Rolex watches. And  as an aside, Perkins said, well, for this watch,  I could buy a six pack of Rolexes.  And then it's like, what? And then  the interviewer followed up with him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's too rich and he's too out of touch.  It really is. It's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a Richard Meehl watch,  and I was given to it by the company  that built my yacht.  This is like fractal conspicuous consumption.  Just stop doing it, Perkins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He can't stop. That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There is this weird problem,  and it's the fundamental attribution error.  It's the root of all psychology, which is  when I do something, it's because I'm  great and we do something, it's because you're  weird. You attribute things  differently depending on who you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the Bloomberg piece.  Silicon Valley is...  I think Kleiner Perkins  itself over the years has created  pretty close to a million jobs,  and we're still doing it.  It's absurd  to  demonize the  rich for being  rich and for doing what the rich  do, which is get richer  by creating opportunity

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for others. How do you  feel threatened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I said I didn't feel personally threatened.  I feel, however,  that as a class,  I think we are beginning  to engage in class warfare.  I think the rich as a class  are threatened through  higher taxes, higher regulation.  Get off of my case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to move to an island.  You know, we have an island for you.  You and Lovey can move there.  Bring your Rolexes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  It's...  It's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But he also has a point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He has a point, but it's this  dreadful trickle-down point that was  made 20 years ago and has  shown not to actually work.  I think fundamentally technology...  He does not create that much wealth with his yachts  and his watches. No, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I... And venture capitalists  aside, technology is  a democratizing...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It can be both. I mean, the problem is  that the Luddites had a point.  They were being displaced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. And it's only a matter of time  before all the travel agents  rise up and  go to the Expedia offices  with torches and pitchforks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it is  a structural problem we have economically,  which is that the kinds of jobs  that we create with technology  are much fewer in number  and require much more  qualifications to be employed with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think there's more opportunity.  There's opportunity if you have education.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a lot of opportunity.  But the sort of  the large swath of the American  middle class,  which was people who were doing  factory work jobs and things like that,  that's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've seen this coming for 20  years. Jeremy Rifkin wrote about  this literally almost 30  years ago in The End of Work.  We know this was happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the fascinating thing from Pew Research,  which I'm going to stick the link  in the chat room,  which was  did I put it in the right place?  Yeah.  Fewer Americans identify  as middle class. And this is like  quite striking.  So from 53% being middle class  saying they had middle class in 2008,  now 44% say middle class  and 40% say lower class, up from 25.  So  I think there's two things going on here.  One is the notion that everyone's middle class,  which has been the premise of American politics  for a long time. You've got to get the middle class.  But I suspect the other part of this is  the Occupy movement saying  actually  there is a big problem of  the 99% and  there are people who are  taking money from you. And there's  definitely a clear sense of  loss of aspiration there, loss of this  oh yes, we can all be middle class. And you can see it  kick in.  2011, there's a step function.  There's a drone coming for you, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Be very careful what you say next,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mr. Marks. It could be your last.  Or I might just drop off an Amazon package.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who knows?  No, I think that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Davos things I went to,  Eric Bruniel. Davos, yeah, let's bring

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  up Davos right now. That's going to  calm  the waters. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Touche.  So Eric Bruniel  and Andy McAfee from MIT  who wrote the Race Against the Machine  Kindle single have a new book  out and they're exploring  this. I'm sorry I'm reading it, but they're exploring  this idea. I think it's a  gigantic story we haven't dealt with. I wrote about  a year and a half ago about the notion  of a jobless future.  We are simply going to have fewer  jobs and we're not dealing with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. That was what  Rifkin said in 1995.  Actually, he said it earlier than that.  But anyway. All right.  We're going to take a break because this is depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I've got to go  take my Lexus to the  dealer. I can't understand.  No.  He keeps taking me through poor  neighborhoods. I've got to get that GPS  fixed.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. Boy, there's no laughter  at all. No, no, I'm with you.  I'm giving you a smile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did buy an $1,800 toilet the other day.  And you're going to  sale it on the scene?  I'm making jobs for people making  toilets.  Our show today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, people did ask  you to stop with the poop on the show.  And it's my fault. It's been my fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who's people? Four people on Twitter.  That's not people.  That's four people on Twitter. That's a different thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We all actually chat already did poop.  This is the third poop in a row week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have not mentioned. Well, I did.  I mean, it was dog.  So we are a little, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  a little different. Everybody poops. It's poop.  My daughters,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  my daughters taught me anything. It's that poop is a big  part of life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Freud said it's it's this fundamental  thing.  Let's talk about Squarespace. And this is a  much nicer topic, shall  we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sure you don't want to  buffer here, Leo. I should buffer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I should briefly buffer everybody. Just  look at your Rolex for a moment

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  or whatever watch your architect  happened to give you for building your yacht.  And it's the  tic tics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I  do actually think income inequality  is a growing problem. And it's  it's very clear just from the numbers.  And you  know what? Maybe these protests in San  Francisco are just the beginning of something that  could be much, much

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Occupy Wall Street was dramatic.  Occupy Wall Street. That was  aimed at bankers. This is now a new technology.  Yeah.  OK, safe there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just in time for Super Bowl.  Twitter has some new search filters.  I'm pretty excited about this.  When you search Twitter you can now filter results  by people, photos,  videos, news. But this is my favorite one.  You can say just show me  tweets from people I follow or just show  me tweets from people near me.  So much easier  to kind of go back and see your friends  tweets about certain topics or hashtags  or whatever.  And you can try it out with Super Bowl.  You can see if you know if any of your friends  have talked about the game or any of the ads.  You can say just show me videos  with the word Super Bowl in the tweet. So  you know commercials before they go  live or after they get posted.  Just really nice way to kind of unearth  old tweets. I just went back and favorited  a bunch of my friends got notifications that I  favorited stuff that they posted months ago  because I was just searching around for keywords  and found  good stuff that I had missed that had kind of flown by  me in my stream. Very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Of course you should have think up as well.  That way you know everything  that's going on on Twitter and all the people  following you and all your most popular  tweets and all that stuff. Yeah well

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  of course. And Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh I forgot to add my  Facebook. I got to do that. Oh yeah.  Yeah. I love  Think Up. Thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know too. I was showing it to folks just

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this week. This is the one. This is the one that  cracks me up. This is from a few days ago. Did you  see that free advertising followed Leo LaPorte?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. Finally.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We got to work on that algorithm. Sorry about that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No. That's somebody that followed me.  I don't think there's anything wrong with that.  You see my most popular tweets  from years gone by. What lists

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm on? Oh uh oh. You got something.  You got an error there that shouldn't be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know object number B bracket  P is no method F.  I think you might want to go to  work on that Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a Google charts API bug.  Google. What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is up with that?  What? There should be a nice graph there. That's the only one  I saw though. Everything else looks good.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Gina has to leave now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got a bug to fix tonight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way I had  42 people retweet my post.  112 people replied.  42 favorites. That's pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  good on a tweet. That is pretty good. That's some  serious activity. Which tweet was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was me bitching about my GPS.  I keep getting pulled

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  through poor people's neighborhoods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No my you know I have this fancy Audi.  I shouldn't have bought an Audi.  It was a big mistake. Oh no tell more.  The GPS doesn't work  and they say oh we don't have a fix.  Just use your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the fix. Use your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way  it has Google Earth.  It's beautiful. I could zoom  in street view but it shows me here.  It shows me going  off road. Sometimes  I'm in Bodega Bay.  Can you  zoom for something? I guess if I drove off

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  road. Yeah there is a slide

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  building there. I think  you have an obligation to look out the window. Don't  you? Am I wrong?  There are big cases I do believe. Really?  I should look up the case law.  I just want them to fix it. I like the  car in other respects. I just want them to fix  the...  I'll show you the  picture. This is  the smoking  gun picture.  I'm driving down a road  but apparently it's in the middle of the  woods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Technology gone bad.  And you're right. It's a nice car. Somebody said

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's a nice car. Just enjoy your car.  Yeah but you know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a time machine.  It used to be there. Oh that's  what it is. Before

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they built the road.  Google Earth is saying this is a new feature  of Google Earth.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  prehistoric Earth.  I think I see a dinosaur down there.  Kevin, Marks, you have a thing or anything  you'd like to share with us? A tip or something you like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've got a couple of things.  One is it's Homebrew website  Club tonight in  both San Francisco and Portland.  If you want to chat about  building your own websites and Indie Web things  it's 6.30pm tonight.  We can have a video link between the two.  Chat about  Indie Web stuff and websites.  Building your own website.  That happens if you can't do it tonight.  It's every two weeks. Every other Wednesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You mentioned you were doing this.  I'm glad it's going well. That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's interesting.  It's a nice group of people.  It's trying to build  the web of  your own stuff primarily  and then use the social networks to share it.  That's the core of the Indie Web message.  It's a nice group.  I get on well with them.  The other thing I wanted to mention  was Model View Culture.  Which is a  new magazine about  the deeper  perspectives on technology.  Some of the stuff we talked about in the middle  of the show today about  its impact on society and what's happening  and things like that.  That's Shanley Kane's  new startup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have so many.  Give them all.  We could do the 100 seconds

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that took to fire two thirds of Patch's staff  in a voice message.  We could do  Prince Sue's  22 now former fans  for a million dollars each.  I saw that. What's he suing him for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're a fan? I sue you?  Yeah.  We could do

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The Guardian says blogs turn 20,  but I'm not sure I agree with that. So I'm going to skip that one.  For the fifth year, Google is the best place to work.  But I think I'll settle here.  Okay.  On an old  Black Coast patent, Ringo wins  1.36 percent  of AdWords revenue.  Oh, yeah. I forgot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That actually was in our rundown.  I should have mentioned that.  That is a huge. Are they going to, is Google going to appeal?  Oh, yeah.  So what is the patent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The patent  wasn't what I read earlier.  1.2 percent of AdWords revenue

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  has got to be a lot of money.  Hundreds of millions.  It's 1.36 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I'll take that routing there you just lost.  The rounding error alone

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  would buy you a very nice home  in San Francisco.  The AdWords program

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  is a very nice home.  The AdWords program  was tweaked by Google after the  Ringo verdict wasn't colorably different  from the old infringing problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, man.  So I presume there is  room to appeal this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Jackson followed the  methodology laid out in an East Texas  case in which Yahoo was found to  infringe on online advertising patent  by Fame Patent Troll. It's just one more  of this stuff. But Jesus, 1.36 percent  of Google AdWords?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeez. It's good money.  Nice work if you can get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yep. Yep.  Can I tell one other story real quickly?  Yes. So I steer

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  my yacht out of Davos.  And  come into Zurich  Airport to go up to the hotel for  the night so as I have an early flight out the next morning.  And I stop by the Starbucks. And I can't have  any Starbucks in Davos because there aren't any.  And B, because I can't get decaf coffee.  I have to have decaf coffee. I can't believe  there is no Starbucks in Davos.  It is tough.  Well actually the Cafe Clatch  in Davos is one of the best  places in the world. Billet Salmon of Reuters loves it.  It's wonderful. But Google takes it over.  So I go into  a basement Starbucks  in the Zurich Airport. And I  go up and I say,  Guten Abend. And I ask for  a medium decaf  skim latte.  Name please. Namabita.  Jeff. The guy looks up and he says,  Twig?  What?  And so the picture is in there  of, I'm forgetting his name  suddenly. Chad, can you put the picture up?  It's the last one in the numbers  section. Zurich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I saw it actually on your Google Plus.  Such a cute picture. That's so great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is. Can you read his name?  I can't remember his name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's adorable. Isn't that great?  He's a Twig fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's working at the Starbucks  in the 10s.  That's his name, 10s.  That's a Tibetan  name. Is that it?  Yeah, that's a Sherpa name. I wonder  if he's from a team. It looks like he's  from Tibet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So he said, oh, could you take a picture? I said, oh yeah, I gotta have one too.  So the fellow, the barista took a picture of us,  which I just think was great.  Isn't that neat. That's fantastic.  This is the small world of Twig.  This is the power of Leo Leporte.  This happens to me in Munich.  It's happened to me in Zurich.  It happens to me people recognize me from this  wonderful show. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bless you, Leo Leporte. All over the world.  They recognize  you must be the Davos guy.  Let me see your Rolex.  Alright, I don't have a  pic of the week. I was going to pick this Talon  app, which is a new Twitter app that's quite gorgeous  and beautiful. Have you guys talked about this  and all about Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which app is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a new paid Twitter app called Talon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh no, we haven't talked about Talon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's specifically for Kit Kat.  It's quite beautiful, but  and I was going to recommend it,  but it has  killed my battery.  And they even say, because  this will do streaming of  your tweets. And he does  say, you know, I don't recommend this because it could kill your  battery. T-A-L-O-N.  I can't remember how much it is.  I think it's four or five  dollars. But you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that's nothing compared  to the cost of this wristwatch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Talon, there it is.  Talon for Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I had looked at it as, and I thought  I needed to use it for a couple of days before I  bring it up in the arena, and I just  hadn't gotten around to installing it. So you like it,  but it killed your battery. It's wonderful. And the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  story, and one of the reasons I want to talk about it,  the story about the author  is kind of cool too.  If I can  find his name.  He's a student.  A full-time student  who kind of just wrote this  in his spare  time. He has a number of other apps  as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think there are any businesses that are writing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twitter apps. Twitter apps would be crazy.  But it has Talon,  Pole, a lot of things that will  just kill the battery. There it is.  Clinker apps.  And it's just a neat  story about...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, we're familiar  with this. This kid's going somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I got this back because

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Circa sent me an update  about the Motorola purchase.  And apparently Google is going  to retain ownership of  the division that runs Project Aura, which  is the modular smartphone  effort  towards making smartphones. You can snap  together. So Google's keeping that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, interesting. Yeah, I'm not surprised  because that's a very labby kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, the division in charge of  Project Aura is called Advanced Technology  and Projects and headed by  former DARPA chief. And so Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  holds on to Aura. I really wouldn't want to  be in that division right now.  Just saying. By the way, the chat  room's telling me it's a buck 99. It just  was updated yesterday, so maybe the battery  life issues are better. I will try it again.  And the author is a student at the University  of Iowa, Jacob Klinker, who's written  some really good, by himself,  some really good apps.  This is a kid to watch.  Obviously very, very  smart. It's compatible  with all versions of Android. You don't have  to have KitKat.  Alright, that's it for the show.  Hey, thank you very much. Jita Tripani  is at thinkup.com.  Do you have a time frame for  consumer version? Next
