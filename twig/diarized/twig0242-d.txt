Ladies and gentlemen, we brought in a massive panel for today's show. I'm going to start  way on my left with Mr. Kevin Purdy, who wants everyone to know he does not normally comb his

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  hair like that. Hello, I'm going to a girl development party later and the theme is nerds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That doesn't help. Yeah, I know. Complete Android guy dot com, ladies and gentlemen.  Or the Purdman dot com. Or the Purdman dot com. That's my name. He's the Purdman of Alcatraz.  Yes. Nice to have you, Kevin. Gina Trapani is still in her mom's basement.  This show is really not going well. She's being held prisoner. Would someone please call the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  authorities? No, no, don't call the authorities. This is the last show in the basement. If I have  to be in my home with holes in the walls, that's what's going to be. Next week I will be either in  my home or in my office. I'm not sure, but I won't be in mom's basement. I didn't mean to discourage  this. The glow of the... No, no, you want to discourage this. I love this. I love it. I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you guys love it. I promise you're going to be in your house next week. It's not like the contractor  is going to put the hammer through the wall into the next apartment or anything like that.  It's going to all be done soon. It'll be fine. Both Kevin and Gina are doing home remodels right  now. I was getting some stuff put in. What is it about contractors? They get it half done and they  leave and they don't come back. Half life. You're like, uh... And they left the drop

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  cloths everywhere. Like some developers I know too. It's a little bit like programmers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ouch. Burn. That's Jeff Jarvis in his beautiful library. Looks good. What's different? Next time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to do the show from the road. I quite like that. That was fun. Yeah, we watched Jeff pull up  via Skype. I can't be safe. It was news and action. I have this great little thing on the dashboard  and the phone's right there and I can just drive and talk. Yeah, I think it's fine. Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We loved it and we got a good look too at your beautiful estate. Your country estate. A snow  pile. Yeah, hard to believe. Wow. Kevin Marks and his birds are back. Hey Kevin, good to talk to you.  We got a great panel today. I think we should kick things off with a big announcement  yesterday. Facebook was acquiring Oculus VR, the makers of the Oculus  Rift virtual reality helmet that blew everybody away last year and actually this year too,  for two billion dollars. Not exactly sure what Facebook wants to do with the virtual reality  helmet. Kind of mixed reactions too. It wasn't mixed. It seemed uniformly pretty pissed off.  If you go to the Kickstarter project, because as many of you may know, the Oculus Rift was a  Kickstarter project. A lot of people put money in. They were asking for, I think, well let's go see.  They were asking for a few hundred thousand dollars. They ended up getting 2.4 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You forgot what they paid for, right? They got their developer kits, yeah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We did. Well, it depends what you paid for. For instance, if you just supported it with $10 saying,  I think this is a great thing. I can't afford to buy one, but I just want to put some money into  this so that you continue to build a fantastic virtual reality experience for gamers. Then you  might feel a little miffed. If you read the comments, there are a lot of people who feel  very miffed. I was a $300 level backer, so I got exactly what I paid for, an early Rift developer  kit. But I think also you give people, well for instance, let's go to Notch, the creator of  Minecraft at Mojang. He was very interested in the Oculus Rift. Went to visit them,  just thought this is really an exciting thing for us. As soon as Facebook bought him, well,  I'll give you his post at Notch.net. Virtual reality is going to change the world. It's amazing.  You strap on some gear, then you're inside whatever world you want. I got my Oculus Rift  development kit, played around with it. It was convincing. He visited the office a couple of  weeks ago. They wanted Minecraft. I said, well, it doesn't really fit the platform. It's on Java,  but maybe we could do it. So he and the folks at Mojang started talking to the folks at Oculus Rift.  Then he says, not two weeks later, Facebook buys them. Don't get me wrong, VR is not bad for social.  In fact, I think social could be one of the biggest apps on VR, but I don't want to work  with social. I want to work with games. I did not chip in 10 grand to seed a first investment  round to build value for a Facebook acquisition. So he's pulling out. That's an example of some of  the people who are a little bit upset. I don't think anybody who has invested, however, in the  real world invested in Oculus VR is too unhappy. They're going to have a big payday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  As someone pointed out, I think if you had invested the $300 for the developer kit and the  headset, and if that had been a real investment, like it eventually will be under Title III,  you would now have on the order of $20,000.  Yeah. Had this been an actual investment, you'd have 20 grand in your pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which is, there's a great piece in the show notes by Joel Johnson this morning on

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Valleywag or Gizmodo.  That's who gave that number. Yeah.  I think it was actually more than that, Kevin. I think it was more like $225,000.  No, he said, and then somebody calculated it better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was that what it was? Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, factor attended there. You would have, yeah, on the order of $200,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What I found most interesting about that piece and that argument is that it's true that down the  line are some regulations that will allow people to invest at that kind of level without having to  be what they call an accredited developer. So I think that's a good point.  That's the Jobs Act, which is passed into law.  Jobs Act Title III, I think currently making its way through SEC hell. But when it arrives,  it would prevent it from seeming like-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you got muted, Kevin, right when you said seeming like.  We'll never know what it seems like. Can you unmute there?  Now he's just frozen in time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I think that Joel Johnson has the right title for this Valleywag piece. Oculus Grift,  he calls it Kickstarter is a charity for venture capitalists. Is this unreasonable? I mean,  don't we all know going in that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so. I think that's the deal. No, you don't get equity. And I think in the end,  it's a good piece by Joel because he says, you know, I got what I paid for.  You may not like it, but this is the way this is the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sure. He also points out, though, that would feel a lot different if it was a company that got to  two billion through hard work sales, iteration and such versus a company that's just being  grained out at two billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, in fact, it seems unlikely that although Mark Zuckerberg did say that they were going  to continue with the game stuff, it does seem unlikely that this is now going to become a  consumer product in any near time frame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, not necessarily. I mean, they've given them enough that they're in the league of the other  two that they've bought that they haven't completely destroyed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  WhatsApp and Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, they've bought a lot of companies that they've shut down and folded in for engineers,  but they've said this isn't one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, is this an investment then by Facebook into a whole new category for Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, one of the some of the commentary I saw was saying Facebook missed the boat on mobile gaming.  They want to make sure they catch the next wave of gaming and that will be this,  which I'm slightly suspicious of because, you know, like Notch, I remember playing  VR helmet games in the late 90s, early 90s, late 80s, which was, do you remember the pterodactyl

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  thing?  Yeah, at SIGGRAPH, they had the pterodactyl. You put the big helmet on and you'd be flying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This was actually in arcades in London. It was in the chocolate.  Really?  Yeah, and CN Tower had one. This is John Walden. I actually know the guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you had to put a big, as Notch points out, you had to put a big old thing on and

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  it was a huge thing and it was really low res.  It was.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, this is the other sad thing is that for people who like me bought in, we only got to see  the low res version one of Oculus Rift. We never did get to see the second one that everybody said  now, where now they've really got it down and we probably never will at this point.  Joel Johnson suggested, and I think it's a good idea, why don't you know, you got two billion,  spend a little money and send all of the early backers, you know, the version two development  kit or maybe just 10 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be a nice thing to do.  Pay us back.  That would be a nice thing to do.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But they have VCs now who would like to recoup as much of their initial seed investment as  possible at a high rate as possible. That's the nature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, they already have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, that's the point. They just got their payday, right?  400 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sure. But now they have to approve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  400 million in cash, 1.6 billion in inflated Facebook stock. Again, Facebook is using its  stock really effectively to acquire stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The VCs will cash out now. The VCs are done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And there's still money on the table, I would guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I get Joel's point, but it feels indicative of this weird sense of entitlement  that really like turns me off. I mean, it's like saying if you purchase something from  a company that at some point goes IPO, it makes millions of dollars, that you're owed  something back. And I feel like that is very specific to our industry because we have these  crazy blockbuster stories of young kids making billions of dollars.  And I think that on some level, all of us are feeling like, well, I'm owed the same thing,  you know, because I'm just as smart or I could have had the same idea or I could have written  that code. And that's just not true. I mean, that's just not true. And when you back a  Kickstarter campaign, you're not purchasing equity. And that's very, very clear.  And look, I'm speaking as someone who crowdsourced the early round of my own company.  This feeling of like I'm owed something. And with the Oculus deal, it was particularly bad  because I didn't know much about Oculus and I'm not much of a gamer, but it felt like it  really added more insult that it was Facebook because there was such a clash of cultures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely. Had this been Google, I don't think you'd see this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I completely agree. I completely agree. But this whole like, you know, how much are my tweets worth?  You know, how much money did I make Twitter? I just am like, how much money did you make?  You chose to use the service. And, you know, the idea was never like I'm owning a part of this  company. Now there's a way to do that. You can purchase shares in a public company, right? But  that's not what you were doing. So I find that whole angle sort of off putting because I do feel  like it's indicative of a weird sense of entitlement. That's got false faces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the counterpoint to that is the situation that happens all too often, which is the  thank you for a wonderful journey letter that appears when the startup that you've been dumping  your data into for the last two years gets bought by Facebook or Google or Twitter and shuts itself  down and all your data disappears. And that's our incredible journey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And now we must part. We have come to a fork in the road.  It's the our incredible journey post. Yes, we're shutting down. You have this much time to get your

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  data. This has been amazing. Thank you so much. Good luck. There's been enough of that happening

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that people feel that when this happens to Oculus Rift, even though I think in this case,  it's fairly clear that Facebook want to keep this going and they don't want to give them two billion  just for just to hire John Carmack and the other chap whose name I forgot who founded the thing.  They really do want to build something here and they think there's something there. And yes,  it is have been a geek dream since the 1980s, 1990s. We've got ages and ages of like sticking  screens on your faces and hoping they work. And the vision may actually be doable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the way to contextualize this is you gave your 10 bucks or 300 bucks or 10,000 dollars  and you established this company. You got them to the point where they could then go get additional  venture funding and they could then go to the next prototype and then they could get acquired for two  billion. It would be a different. I think you're right, Kevin. I think part of a lot of this is  that people just don't trust that Facebook is going to continue on with Oculus Rift.  But assuming that they do, then this is all how it's supposed to happen. Is that what you're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is good. I mean, I think this is potentially, you know, I don't think this is what this is.  That feeling of they've bought this thing and it's kind of going to die now. I think they're going  to keep working on it and potentially Facebook will take it further. But we know we don't know.  The thing is about this VR thing has been a dream for a long time. I watched the Matrix with my  son this week because he hadn't seen it and it was interesting to watch that and go, oh yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I remember this theory as well. You know, to me it goes back to Neil Stevenson's snow crash. That  was the first time I and I think a lot of people, maybe Neuromancer by William Gibson, science fiction

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  where we... Snow crash is a bit later. So Neuromancer, there was never any technology in it.  There was just, he just said he sees this thing and there was no explanation of how it worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, he jacked in. He had a little port in the back of his head. We don't know exactly how it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  worked. But Gibson deliberately didn't describe anything so you would imagine. He wasn't a  technologist. He's a technologist whereas Stevenson was like, and there's a laser scanning your  eyeball. And you know, he went, he did massive nerdy. But either way, I think we fell in love

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  with this idea of a virtual world we could enter that would be indistinguishable from the real  world except that all of this amazing stuff could happen. I think part of what the other

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  pathos behind it is whether when Kickstarter really works well, I think you've helped create  a product or a project that would not have existed were it not for your support. And I think  you might question or someone might question whether they helped create a prototype VR kit  that would have never existed if it wasn't for geeky enthusiasm or if you helped some folks get  closer to Facebook. I'm not, I kind of see both sides of it. I totally get the Kickstarter is not  a store. But you know, you're also not a shareholder. But I think it's tough when the idea is to  help individuals and small teams get started. And then you see something like a, you know,  a $2 billion figure show up all of a sudden. Yeah, but listen, at the end of the day,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've been around investors with them invested in companies. And the wise investor, even if it is  an investment, puts the money in and then lets the smart company run itself. And it's got to do  what's best for the company from that point out. And so what were they to do say, No, we'll turn  down this $2 billion because we want to stay in our garage, right? Because we want to be loyal to  our peeps who gave us a few bucks in the beginning. Sure. Put on a show. You know, it's just too,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  too surely temple. Does it hurt Kickstarter in any way? I mean, I the other one you might look  at in Kickstarter blazes is on their front page. When you go to kickstarter.com is Veronica Mars,  a Hollywood movie that was made with money by from its fans. I think the fans don't feel  let down. They got the movie. Yeah, I mean, something that would not have existed were it not  for their and it wasn't enough money to make the movie just gave Sony pictures or whoever enough,  you know, input that they said, Yeah, maybe we should do this. Sure. I mean, Kickstarter is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  never going to have on their front page, you know, sold to Facebook for 2 billion, right? I mean,  they've always been about works of art and supporting creators. And I even think they're  moving away from software projects a little bit, although, you know, this really, really is hardware.  But look, you know, in five years, if Facebook invests in Oculus or Oculus operates on its own  and it comes and it becomes the vision and becomes a mainstream consumer product and then  I then I could see Kickstarter saying, hey, they got their start here, but not now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other thing about this whole thing, too, is I still don't know what Facebook does with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm getting flashbacks to Second Life. Yeah, I think it's well beyond that. But I think it is  the reason I bring up Snow Crash or Neuromancer or the Matrix, whatever is because I think that  many of us geeks share that dream, right, of a world we can enter and what it's a social world,  isn't it? It's a social network. I think what Zuckerberg said I thought was very important  yesterday, which is he sees this as a platform and then and I think Facebook's being very  aggressively interested in what's the next thing. They almost missed mobile, which could have killed  them. And I think they're there. That's why they're being very aggressive with Instagram  and WhatsApp. They want to be and I think they implied that they feel like VR could be the next  thing, maybe after wearables or maybe as part of wearables. Well, that was the Ray Costa post,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  was good on this because he was talking about the different variations on a theme here.  Where he basically says, there's like four different, he did a quadrant diagram, which is  like what you do when you're a game theorist. But he says there's this difference between  virtual worlds and augmented reality and life logging and that you end up in different  quarters of this painting which pieces you're doing. And Google Glass is basically mostly  useful for life logging with a little bit of augmentation. But to do an actual augmented  reality, you want to have glasses that will let you overlay stuff on the world, which is  some of the stuff that John Walden, who did the original virtuality headsets is doing now. He's  building very, very good heads up display things that have got mostly military uses but could be  useful for individuals too. There's the Skigulls that do that. But again, they're just giving you  little terminated displays as opposed to actually replacing bits of the world, which is  one of the things that people wanted to do with this. But the idea of a virtual world that you  completely disappear into has been this thing that people have dreamt about for a long time.  And that is potentially doable. Though I've always found that it gives me a headache, but  that's for the same reasons that watching 3D at the cinema gives me a headache, because  your eyes are trying to focus on something that's at the wrong depth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Rafe quotes John Carmack, who of course, the creator of Doom, and very famously went to  Oculus VR to work on this. He tweeted today, I have a deep respect for the technical scale  that Facebook operates at. The cyberspace we want for virtual reality will be at this scale.  So it's true. Facebook's got the money. Facebook's got the scale, got a billion users.  If you're going to make a metaverse, I can't imagine a better company to be doing it with.  Well, maybe Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, his reaction was a little bit defensive. He tweeted something like,  I'm coding today, which is the same thing I was doing last week at this time.  Yeah, see? Yeah, nothing's changed.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Still got long hair and a katana. I can do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like this Rafe Koster post. It's very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, Rafe's a good thinker on this stuff. Yeah.  But it was, I mean, one of the interesting things last week with GDC and the reaction to GDC was  a lot of people being very sort of stressed about where gaming had gone and the  destructive effect that all this selling rubbish all the time inside mobile gaming has had on game  development and the ideas of it. And this, I think part of it, part of this sort of backlash  is that this reaction was they were thinking, great, this is finally us, like dedicated  console gamers, going to get something that's even more immersive than staring in front of the TV.  And it's not going to be like all that rubbish on mobile and Facebook, which has been this  sort of culture war that's been going on in gaming for a while. So I think that's a big  culture war that's been going on in gaming for a while. So in a sense, this is selling to  the biggest enemy of the core gamers. And I think that's part of the culture clash here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I agree. And if you are a core gamer, then you'd probably be relieved to know that Microsoft and  Sony are both working on their own virtual reality projects, although I don't know if they are the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  companies that are going to innovate in that space. And I'd be amazed if Google isn't doing  something as well, though I suspect there's more augmented reality to virtual reality.  They've already got the little tiny screen thing with glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I always thought that glass would be much better as an augmented reality device. It's just really  a second screen that you look up. I'd love to see it overlaid on life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'll put a link in the IRC. This is pretty cool. This is, you can get that up. This is the company  John Walden, who did virtual reality 25 years ago, which was the original arcade VR stuff.  He's been still working on optics and he's got this neat like, he's just going to the core tech  of it. He's got these overlay glasses that are bright enough and are raised enough to actually  overlay stuff on your vision. And the point is, they're building chips for it now. I'm not sure  they've done the whole software stack, but there's a little interesting history of all the  different variants of this that they've had. And of course, our friend, Jerry Ellsworth,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  she came up here and she had a kickstart project called Cast AR, which is again for gaming more,  but it was kind of wild. You wear glasses that project a gaming space onto a screen in front  of you so that you can interact with it. I think this is something that is very often the case with  science fiction that inspires development. They want something that they read about. And I think  this is where, you know, Rafe talks about the metaverse. I think this is where what geeks want.  So a lot of people are working on it in a lot of directions. It's just that it's Facebook. Nobody,  I don't, you know, do you want Mark Zuckerberg? Let me ask this. If it hadn't been for the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kickstarter, let's say they hadn't gotten the dime for Kickstarter, never did that.  Right. Would there be the same resentment? No, of course not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nobody resents WhatsApp's getting 16 billion. I mean, we're all kind of flabbergasted, but nobody  resents it. So yeah, and I think it wouldn't have been, if it hadn't been Google or Apple,  I don't think it would have been this kind of reaction. Maybe Apple. I don't know. Go ahead,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Kevin. The metaverse wasn't all as well. I mean, the metaverse was a very commercialized vision.  Right. And that's, you know, that it was the assumption that it would eat the web, which was,  remember, a lot of this was pre-web. When was Snow Crash? Was that 90?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was it? It was a long time ago. That was like, that was required reading at the first .com I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ever worked at. It was like part of our education. See what I'm saying? That's exactly it. That's,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  people wanted to live that in 1992. Yeah. 92. So yeah. 92 feels like a long time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, there's, I think this thing before, Douglas Adams Hyperland, I could be my link of the,  of the week, if you like. If you haven't seen this, it was a documentary Douglas Adams did  in 1989 with friends of mine at the BBC, which was talking about what it means to interact.  It's actually, in the start and the beginning isn't a good idea because it takes a long time  to get going. It starts with Douglas Adams being asleep. But he talks about the idea of interactivity  and the examples are based on hypercard and video disks and little bits of VR and they've got these  lovely floating icons and things. There's an idea of how you interact with it.  And he's wonderfully, the avatar talking to him is Tom Baker camping out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It all comes back to Dr. Who doesn't it? So if you haven't seen this, see this. But like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  so you watch this and he predicts he has this little person who pops up, he asks questions of  and they just finds things and everything's linked to everything else. There he is sticking his face  in. And then at the end they start going into VR and there's a great bit. I'll see if I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I found the VR helmet. They're showing a NASA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So this is the NASA guy. He puts the VR helmet on.  Look at the size of that thing.  Oh my God.  This is just down the street. This is NASA Ames.  He's got a model of the room he's sitting in, which is like a gray cubicle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Most of us do not want models of the rooms we're in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but understand that this is the base technology. They just got better and better  and better. That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But this was 89. We had this. 1991 was when Virtuality built the arcade things with the  Teradactyls.  These both predate Snow Crash.  And then Snow Crash was being written about that time. It took him a while to write it.  So it was published in 92, which means he was running it around 1990 as well.  But that was thought through about what you would actually do with this.  The web came through and sideswiped everyone.  This piece is sitting on the side for a bit, so it's nice to see it coming back again.  But it was very much a sort of...  And I suppose the other fork of this is Second Life, which was the other assumption of the  metaverse in the virtual world, but that was all done on the screen.  Right.  That is still ticking over and it's there, but there was a huge excitement around it as a space  for commerce. But people did exactly like the NASA guy. They built models of their shops in it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  which is like, no, I don't want a model of your shop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would nominate Second Life as the single most overhyped thing on the net.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But like all of these, their early stage and things will evolve. The early web was pretty  awful too. I think that this is aiming towards something very exciting.  And if $2 billion investment from Facebook moves it along, I guess I'm all for it.  We're going to take a break. When we come back, change log time.  Gina Trapani will have the latest from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the work she's done and her support of this. And let me add, let me add Leo, that at the CUNY  Graduate School of Journalism where I teach, we buy a site license for Lynda.com for all of our  students. And that's how they learn an immense number of the tools that they do and how they can  dig into more tools on their own. And it's an invaluable resource. We do kind of the same for

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  our editors and stuff when they need to learn Final Cut or the new version, we always go out and  get them on Lynda.com. That's a great place to learn. Let us bang the drum slowly. It's time  for the Google Change Log. The Google Change Log.  Gina Trapani is in her basement with the latest Google stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Man, I just love that intro. Thank you, Leo. Google Now. Google Now has arrived in the stable  build of Chrome for Windows and Mac. We saw this in the beta versions a couple weeks ago. We've  been talking about Google Now on the desktop. Well, it's rolling out to everyone now. The cards  will only be visible on your computer if you use Google Now on your mobile device and if you're  signed into Chrome. And the cards that you see on your desktop Chrome are a subset of the mobile  cards. So you'll see weather, sports scores, commuter traffic and event reminders. I'm seeing  some stock prices in mine. Some cards may be based on the location of your mobile device,  which hopefully is near the computer you're using, but others will just work independent of location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How do I see those cards? Where do they show up? So if you've got Chrome installed, I'm on a Mac

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  here. I see a little bell at the top of my menu bar. Yes, like the notifications. Oh, yeah. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you're seeing now cards there. Well, I see the notifications from Google Plus. Well, no, no,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  up in your Macs, actually in your Macs. Oh, in the Mac menu bar, there's another little,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  oh, look, it's Greg Burnett's birthday. Happy birthday, Greg. Yeah, you're right. Twitter stock  falls 7%. There's always the weather. And there's always the weather. That's nice. No, no love for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Linux. Oddly, I don't think I have this on my Chromebook. And no love for the Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If you switch to a non-stable channel, Jeff, it's there, but- Is there in the beta? Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. I always run my Chromebook in the beta channel. That seems safe enough. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not Canary. What could possibly go wrong? I didn't see the now ones in mine, but maybe it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  hasn't run the update. Yeah, it's rolling out slowly.  Now, Google Play Music got a bunch of new features to the web app, that is drag and  drop uploads, a mini player and offline downloads. So you don't have to use that desktop, a client  called the music manager in order to upload your music to Google Play Music. You can just drag and  drop your music in the browser. Yeah, you actually have to opt into this. It's a music labs. You have  to opt into the lab feature. And then you can even configure your Google Play Music in the browser  to add music automatically in the top right, which is kind of nice. You can also download  your music now from the web app. And the little player has a little pop out new pop out functionality  that you can click the arrow on the bottom right of the corner of the UI and pop out the player.  Some nice upgrades there. A new Chrome experiment called Chromecast Photo Wall. You can see it at  g.co slash photo wall. So this out works. You got a Chromecast plugged in and then you and your  friends all have your Android devices. You got this Android app and then you can create a photo  wall and everybody can start adding photos to that wall. Yeah. And it shows up on your TV and it  generates a YouTube video automatically when you're done. And I think this also works just  with your laptop as well. If you don't have Chromecast. We did it at cowork Buffalo the other

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  day. It got a little anarchic, so we had to shut it down, but it's pretty awesome. Is it pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  awesome? So the Android app doesn't have the best reviews in the play store. We were talking about  this last time and all about Android, but it looks really neat and it's it is, it does seem like more  of an experiment than the most stable app in the world. But Kevin, I haven't tried it. So I'm glad  to hear that you that you had it going at cowork Buffalo and that it worked. The setup is a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  wonky, you know, especially when you have to type in a code on your Android and then make sure you've  got the right Chromecast and all that stuff. But when it's working, it's pretty neat. You're all  literally just kind of pin boarding it in front of each other. What happened that you had to stop

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  people put up pictures, naked pictures of themselves? It's a coworking space. OK,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  lots of lots of sensitivities and sensibilities at play. So someone's got to step in and be the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  police. Yeah. OK, just checking. So there's no one who's so you can't there's no one who's OKing  photos. They just go whatever gets dragged on there. If you. Oh, yeah, I think you can make

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  it private. But then why are you posting your own private photo wall just to show people,  you know, like if you want to show people your vacation slides and force them to watch, I guess.  I don't know. You must watch this. No, it's really fun when it's working. It's it's very

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  experimental, but totally fun. It sounds like like a lot like Google Plus events where everybody  could contribute their photos to, you know, at a particular event, like if you're having a picnic  or something, I don't even know if this is still around. I think it is. But it seems similar in

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  that it's a social photo sharing. Yeah, one quarter of your event attendees don't email you and say  they never got the invite. So it's like that. All right. Well, on that note, Google Drive

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  adds image editing features in slides and drawings. This will just allow you to do basic editing  tasks without having to leave the app. That means you can crop, apply shape, mass and more from  inside a presentation or drawing drawing. And you can also add borders. So little little lectures  there for docs for slides and drawings, users and docs. And finally, I know you've been waiting  for this forever. I know this is that this is what you wanted in Gmail forever. Pinterest for your  inbox. It has been called the Gmail promotions tab is getting is getting a little visual makeover.  This is a this is a test of a new design that switches from being a list based view to a grid  images, which of course Google is now caching on their servers. Right. So they've got all those  images and so shows images from the emails that make it easier to see exactly what the message is  promoting. And the grid view makes it easier to scroll through a lot of messages with infinite  scrolling. And you can sign up to try this test. It's a field trial. So you have to do have to opt  into it. And you'll be able to toggle between the traditional list view and the grid view within the  promotions tab. And this test is just for desktop only right now. So I almost never look at my  promotions tab. But hey, if you're if you're into coupons, promotions, that sounds cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where do we sign up? How do we do that? Yeah, in the labs is I don't see in the labs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm on Gmail. So I have to there is a long link that marketing land had. Sorry. Well, if you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  if you go to the Google Mail blog, you can get that link. I guess. Yeah. Okay.  Sorry. A more visual way to view your spam. Thank you, Google.  It's it's it's a g.co slash mail field trial is the shortened URL. Oh, perfect. I'm sorry. Gmail,  g.co slash gmail field trial, email field trial. Yeah. And then you have to click join field trial.  And then if you're accepted, yes, I want to join the field trial. If you're accepted,  they'll let you do it. If you're selected, you'll see a message in your promotions tab when this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  features turned on. G.co slash gmail field trial. I opted in and I do not have it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me check my Gmail because I might be better than you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You might be trying with my not yet. I'm trying with my Gmail account. There's basically all

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  spam. So that should be a good one to try. Yeah. Well, that's why it's perfect for that. Yeah.  All the stuff in promotions is spam. Isn't it? Isn't that what it means? It's you signed up for

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  spam you signed up for. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know that the Google would call it spam. Yeah.  Yeah. Let's see. I have multiple multiple Google accounts going on here. So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but that's all I got. And that my friends is what we call the Google changelog.  Ladies and gentlemen, we will take a break and come back with more Kevin Purdy is here.

You're watching This Week in Google and we are talking about  the goog and the cloud. There's a lot of news about Google, not just Google, but  Google and Apple, Google, Apple, Intuit, Clear Channel, Comcast, eBay, Microsoft,  Adobe. Apparently they've been colluding, violating antitrust law by agreeing not to poach each  other's employees and the really nasty part, which we've seen this before. This antitrust case has  been going on for some years is the email from Steve Jobs to Eric Schmidt, then CEO of Google,  saying, Oh, you got it. What is that? Oh, you're in the class. I'm in the class. I was working  for Google at the time. Oh my God. Wow. So tell us Kevin Marks, why this was a bad thing for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  as an employee. It was not particularly a bad thing for me because Google paid me fairly well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but had you been looking for another job at Apple or maybe? No, the thing is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  if you actually read the transcripts and what they were saying, it is fairly damning. That's  the piece that the smoking gun is horrible. And they're well aware of what they were doing. There's  Eric Schmidt saying, let's do this verbally. So we don't need a paper trail leading a paper trail.  But they're basically saying, we're all friends here. We shouldn't  recruit from each other's companies. This is the effect of reforming a cartel.  And it's interesting reading Horowitz's book, which is a great book, The Hard Thing About Hard  Things on being a CEO. The one piece in that that made me go, wait a second, was a chapter where he  talks about not poaching people from your friends. And reading that in the light of this sort of made  me think about how far the attitude is. And from their point of view, it's we don't want to annoy  these other companies to get into a bidding war because that will raise the price of engineers.  And as an engineer, that's like, yeah, please raise my price. Raise my price. Yeah.  Please fight over me. And that's effectively what happens when they do these these acquires.  They end up getting into bidding wars for a company to get the engineers. And those are the  ones who benefit. And I suspect that this is the unexpected consequence that they've done  by deciding not to bid against each other and hiring and not to post each other's engineers.  They're creating incentive for people to leave and build startups instead and then get hired  that way. So I think they've they've probably shot themselves in the foot with this. I'm fairly sure  that this is going to this is a lawsuit. Some lawyers will make a lot of money out of it.  There'll be a settlement and I'll know it'll be like the Amazon. Maybe not. I mean, it's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Department of Justice suing here. This is the US government. This is antitrust law. There is a class  action suit as well. But this is a classic violation of antitrust law. Everybody knows  this rule. And, you know, Steve Jobs, apparently furious that here's the email from Sergey Bryn.  So I got another irate call from Jobs today. I don't think we should let that determine our  hiring strategy. But I thought you'd let you know, basically said if you hire a single one of these  people, this means war. In any case, let's not make any new offers or contact new people at Apple  until we've had a chance to discuss. Eric Schmidt agrees. He says I got a same call from Meg Whitman  over at eBay. Let's do this orally. And then and then this is the one that's really reprehensible  is Eric Schmidt writing to Steve Jobs saying, Hey, don't worry, we fired that person that offered an  Apple employee a job there. We're out of here within one hour. We're going to make a public  example of them and Jobs sending back a little smiley face. And then Larry Page says, gosh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I never got a smiley face from Steve. One thing that amazes me about a paper trail like this is  that companies, publicly traded companies that you assume have these huge structures and delegation  and so many committees and shareholders meetings. But this the way this article reads, it's like,  Steve calls Larry, Larry tells Eric, Hey, Eric, got some friction over here from Steve. And Steve's  like, Yeah, I heard from Meg too. Like, it's a clubhouse. Oh, it's very much very much so.  Like, it's not it's not multi billion dollar companies with hundreds of thousands of employees  and all these, you know, assigned roles. It's like playing about the flower shipments. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's the email from Steve Jobs. Eric, I'd be very pleased if your recruiting department would  stop doing this. Thanks, Steve. The next day Schmidt sends an email to Google's top HR people.  I believe we have a policy of no recruiting from Apple. This is a direct inbound request.  Can you get this stopped and let me know why this is happening? I need to send a response back to  Apple quickly. Let me know as soon as you can. Then they respond. The person who contacted the  Apple employee will be terminated within the hour. We're going through her records to make sure she  didn't contact anyone else. Please extend my apologies to Steve Jobs. This was an isolated

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  incident. And Steve sends back the smiley face. What if anybody's yet to surface that fired HR

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  person? Boy, you know, that would be that'd be interesting. Doesn't somebody in HR say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that sounds weird. Why are we doing this? I mean, is it because that doesn't make sure it's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  HR is there to be the tool of the company? Well, and they know it's illegal. They know it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  illegal. It is a clear violation of antitrust law. There's no like, oh, we didn't know that.  Oh, you can't do that? Oh, I didn't know that. They knew that. So I think part of this is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and that was interesting about Horovitz's book, was that when you're a company of like 20 people,  not poaching your friend's startups employees makes a bit of sense. You don't actually want to  do that. And the problem is people, as these companies grow, they forget that they're now  behemoths. And Microsoft was a classic for this. They would always think they were a startup,  even at the point where they were half of them with conspiring to knock other companies over.  And Apple and Google and Facebook are like major employees around here. They employ  thousands and thousands of people. So at some point, what seems like a reasonable like, okay,  let's not get into a war over this. Let's do this amicably becomes this power structure.  But the companies still think of themselves as small and scrappy. And that's the piece that's  tricky. And because when these companies grow like this, it does creep up on you. And the  challenge is to put structure in place in time. I mean, if we look at a similar thing with  the GitHub fiasco last week, where they've grown to be this huge company without building a  management structure and still behaving like a bunch of kids hanging out, and now it's blown  up in their face because they were ridiculously unprofessional. Mike Errington's at it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just love this. Oh, we're gonna do this Errington story, aren't we? Let's do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's do it. So it goes back to the story we've been talking about for a couple of days now.  Microsoft had an employee who was leaking code to a French blogger. He was very loyal to the  company doing it on Hotmail, Microsoft's MSN Messenger, and SkyDrive. So Microsoft said,  well, let's take a look at that Hotmail thread and read his stuff. And since Microsoft has said,  no, obviously you don't need a subpoena to read your own email server. We don't do that though,  unless there's a clear violation of the law. But from now on, we're going to have it live up to  the standard that we would have to if we were trying to read Google's mail, the standard of  subpoena. We're going to hire a counsel who is a former judge who will review all requests before  it happens. Not that it happens very often. So Mike Errington's reading about that and he says,  I have firsthand knowledge of this. A few years ago, I'm nearly certain Google access to my Gmail  account after I broke it. I'm nearly, I'm almost positive. Mike, by the way, this is kind of how,  this is his MO. He's kind of a little paranoid. Nearly certain that Google access to my Gmail  account after I broke a major story about Google. A couple of weeks after the source,  afterwards the source approached me in a very inebriated state and said that he or she had been  asked by Google if they were the source, they denied it, but they would then shown the email  that proved they were the source and a little while later was unemployed. Google says, no,  we don't do that. No, it didn't ever happen. Google accounts general counsel told Liz Gaines at  recode, Mike makes a serious allegation here. Google opened email messages in his Gmail account  to investigate a leak while our terms of service might legally permit such access. And that's kind  of the point to underscore all email services have weasel words in there that allow them to do this.  We've never done it and it's hard for me to imagine circumstances where we would investigate

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  a leak in that way. There's two things about that. One is the follow-up question is how would you  change your terms of service to make that not possible in future? You're the chief counsel.  Please do that because you should not have terms that let you do that. But the other piece of it is  we did not investigate it in this way. What will have happened is they will have had some kind of  security team to go and look at this and that may have been an outsourced team that went and did  something more fishy. They may have gone and looked at the employee's mail and investigated  them and see what other ones they'd use. Yeah. So, Ockham's Razor would tell you it's almost

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  far more likely that they looked at the email on the employee's computer than they went through

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  their own Gmail service. Okay, but Arrington said the email that he saw at the party was sent from

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  a non-Google account to Arrington's Gmail account. Well, sure, but what computer did he send? If you

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  hire a private investigator, what do you think they're going to do? Right. They're going to read  the emails. They're going to go and try and hack the employee's emails. And they're going to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and they don't really have to hack it. They can just look at it. Yeah. Because he was using

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  something on Google service. He wasn't completely stupid, but clearly he was like clumsy and drunk

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  according to Mike. Drunk later. The fact that drunk thing is like why does that need to be,  couldn't you have just said the employee came up to the party and said no? Because it's Mike Arrington,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  he's making it colorful. Because it's Mike Arrington and he has to be a dick about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there's my answer. Kevin and I know have some experience in this matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't want to bring that up, but I get on with Mike. He's a good journalist. He does interesting  things. But he will grandstand a little bit about this. Like when he got all the Twitter internal  emails. He's not in a great position to grandstand about this given that he got leaked with his  internal emails and spent a big chunk of time trolling. That's a good point. We should just say

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  your email has never been private and if you want to send private email there's encryption and use

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  it. Because that's really the fact. But what Google should say is if we don't want to do this  and we're not going to do this, then we should change our terms of service. That's the pressure  to put back on them. And it shouldn't be us saying change your terms of service to be like this. It  would be okay general counsel you said that you don't do this therefore change your terms of  service. You can't and explain to us why you do that. As John Gruber said it is interesting that

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  they chose to respond at all to this particular you know allegation of email reading. Whereas  there are six thousand others that exist on the web in some form. But they didn't do this to Mike

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Arrington's claim. It was like it was a it was re-reported and spread out so they were under

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  control. Let me look at the the the smoking gun on the Google terms of service. Let's see if we can  find that. You know apparently Yahoo, Microsoft, Google all do this. I mean I have all have these  terms in their terms of service. Let's see. Oh well I can't quite find it. But  you know it says under certain circumstances generally it says something like

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  under certain circumstances. And that may well have been put in because they get subpoenas.  The very common one is someone's going through a divorce and they subpoena the spouse's emails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That goes on all the time. For a subpoena I understand. I think the issue is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No I mean the Microsoft thing was that they didn't require the investigator to get a subpoena. They  reported this thing to the investigators and they said oh we're just going to look at his  journalist thing. So they didn't get the clear separation of powers thing going there. Google  has been good about that in the past. They are fairly good about that. Making sure you know come  back with a court order type stuff. And I don't think that they would have. I'd be surprised if

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they did that internally. Microsoft's response I thought was fairly good but they need nor  neither did they change their terms of service. They still allow it but they are going to have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  high standard etc etc. That's the problem. It's like trust us we're going to do this internally.  And it's the same people who are doing this other phoning each other up and firing people  and conspiring in that way. It does make you a little suspicious yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The M8 from I bet you guys talked about this a little bit on all about Android last night. The new  HTC One. We did. You are an HTC One owner. I am. It's a really bad name isn't it. So this is the two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The mate. Yeah. They are offering it on the Google Play Store which yeah the M8 because oh mate oh I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  didn't even get that. Oh I didn't either. It was the M7 was last year's year. Yeah. Yeah.  It was the M7 was last year's you own an M7. Yeah. Yeah. So you can get it from the three big three  of the big four big carriers and there's a Google Play Edition which is great news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's in my cart at the moment. Oh really. I haven't pushed the button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So why is it nicer than a Nexus 5. Oh god I could go on and on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do do just give me a cell. Sell me on it. My son needs a new phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's a gizmodo post that is side by side is a GIF that has the photos from the Nexus 5 and the  new HTC One like gifting in and out and in and out and it's it's all you need to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Camera. Well camera. I there's a little debate on the camera. It's very very similar to the camera  you have Gina the old HTC One camera still four megapixels although the front camera is five  megapixels but they're but they're doing this super pixel thing. They are putting two  pickups on the back so that they can you can have selective focus on your images which is odd again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can change your focus after the fact. Yeah the second sensor is actually a depth sensor

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so something's going on there. I'm not sure what. You can also just take out the things in the  foreground can be treated one way and the rest of the photo can be treated another way because it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  understands depth. But it's still a four megapixel camera and a lot of the issues I think that I had  with your the M7 are still there. It's good in low light except it over exposes. There's still  some issues with it. I'm not sure that's a great camera. Do you really like your camera and your  M7? The camera's okay. Okay. I still I still. It's an ultra pixel thing. I'm not sure I buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a lot of photos that definitely doesn't focus the way I'd like. You know it's okay.  My daughter likes to throw my phone a lot and I actually I just bricked it today like I it's it's  dead like I can't quite boot it up. That's why the M8 is in my is in my car. I think you have a pretty  good excuse. It seemed like a good excuse to me. The big thing with my problem with the M7 is the  battery life and the verge and and everyone is saying that battery life on the M8 is way better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's it's a bigger battery and it's also using the new Qualcomm quick charging capability.  It comes with quick charge one which is not great but the new quick charge two which apparently is  just a software update means it can charge like twice as fast. Yeah that's really nice and I even

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not big on cases but I love that dot view case. Yeah that's kind of neat. Yeah yeah. So that gives

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you a dot you know a small like kind of like the the Moto X where you have a  version of the screen that doesn't use up a lot of power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've got to torture you more than this. So because when you bought that that one the  the Nexus 5 wasn't out the Moto X wasn't out as I remember. So now that you have a panoply of

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  choices. Okay so the boom sound you got the two speakers on the front that's a big difference.  I love the speakers on the front. Sound is really much better on the on the HTC One both the 8 and  the 7. It's twice what the Nexus 5 does. It's 700 bucks instead of 350. You can't put an SD card in  it which you can't do in the Nexus 5. That's right. I think the screen's better I like the screen  better it's 441 dots per inch. It's very high res screen. It's the same as this I mean they're  both 1080p. Yeah I guess it's exactly the same isn't it. Yeah they're both five inch screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay yeah and I think I shared with you guys I bought the HTC One because of the design. I was  completely just suckered in. I just think it's a beautiful problem. Well you'll like the M8. I played

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  with it yesterday. It's very nice. It's even nicer. That metal on the back. Yeah it's even I think it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  even nicer frankly. Yeah yeah a little softer than the than the not as not as quite a rectangular.  It has a little bit rounded edges. More roundy feels good in the hand. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think if you're getting the Google Play Edition I think you're spending 350 bucks for better  better hardware design because otherwise it's the same software right. Yeah yeah well the Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Play Edition is just it's the same as the Nexus 5. Yeah yeah same as that. Plain Android. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I actually got a Verizon Edition because I like the the HTC Sense. I want to see the new Sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You like Zoe's right. I love Zoe's. Okay. Zoe. Apparently they've improved the Zoe's as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what's sad is this is these I think these really are great phones.  They're comparable to an iPhone or I mean they're really among the but because they don't have the  marketing budget for Samsung that Samsung does they just don't they get no traction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  HTC itself is not doing so well every time I see a news story about them right financially and  market share wise. They're struggling. Yeah. Despite putting out phone after a few phones now where  every site almost is in agreement about how good they are and how well designed. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So 32 gig Nexus 5 is $399. 32 gig HTC One M8 is $699. So it's about $300 more. Would you push

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina to a Moto X Leo? No she likes her she likes her metal. She's beyond that. You love the Moto

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  X though Leo. I do but I have a feeling I may be trading it in for the M8 when it comes. Oh really?  Yeah. Well it's you know see I got again I got the M8 with all that you know sense stuff on it so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we'll see. Yeah and I don't know that I buy five right now. I feel like you know I'd wait till after

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google I.O. Oh yeah you might get one in the in the mail under your seat. Yeah that might be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  not you know it might be something new soon right. But that's always the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well there will be a new Moto X this summer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hmm. Boy I've used the voice stuff on my on my and I don't have the as good a voice as you have  but on my Nexus 5. I was using it today to get Chad to tell you I was late coming  and just dictating emails. Works pretty amazingly. Yeah. Well the voice on Android is great period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We all love it. Somebody's getting a Skype call which is bizarre because you're all on Skype.  Bizarre. I know. Google I.O. is open for business. Well it will be soon. Registration opens April  8th. It's going to be random once again. Random. Random. April 8th through April 10th. I don't know  why they have the extra two and a half days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that what you have to do now? You have to play a game. I mean it's so I went through it while we  were on beginning and you just kind of click it a bunch of times and it goes around and around

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  around. It goes what goes around must come around. Do I have to do this to to win? No it just kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  gather these elusive subatomic particles. So just click on the big thing and it. Oh I'm gathering

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  them. Because Google is gathering every bit of atom in the universe to become part of the new

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google universe 2.0 Larry Page's Island. Now what? Now we'll come up with another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh and you gotta think who spends all this time in the Googleplex. Exactly. Right in this crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well click and you're making you're making a tetra to Mahanahedin polyhedron monoline. Click on the  right thing at the bottom. This is what my pants are made of. Click on the pink thing in the bottom right of

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  open this box. Silicon. Build up the atoms to create a full crystalline structure of this highly

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  geez imagine how good this would be in an Oculus Rift.  Now what? I have in there a neural network. Add raw data to see what this network's processors  can come up with. Okay sucking in the raw data. It came up with a Rubik's Cube.  Now a donut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is so stupid. It's weird in the post NSA world that Google has a bunch of games where you  have to gather everything into. Yeah your sphere. Keep it all safe. Now what? Tap the earth to see

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  how we connect with one another. To share ideas instantly. With balloons. Project Loon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's the point?  Oh modems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And now satellite technology. Soon we will travel to Mars and this strange jigsaw puzzle planet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What the hell? Or possibly a Death Star. Oh the Death Star.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is like I feel like. Oh my god. There it now just starts over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What? After all that you're back to the back to. Oh well I should have just scrolled down. That

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  was the test. That was the test. Scroll down. Oh hey wow. Geez. Let's break stuff. Experience I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is that a Facebook shout out? Getting to I.O. was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They are round. Oh break stuff. Move fast and break stuff. Is that what Facebook says? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Let's reboot. Let's hack. Let's grab a drink. If it's broken break it is the Google equivalent.  Right. If it's broken break it more. Well the point is if you find something broken  demonstrate that it's broken so people fix it. Oh this is good. So there's no rush this year

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  just apply to attend any time during the two-day window and we'll randomly select who gets to come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You. No. You. Yes. It's pretty good opportunity for them to capture a lot of data about  people who are interested in going to I.O. It's also $900 for general admission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They don't mention that. There's no price tag at this point. Yeah. Okay so we're going to wait

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and here's a binary clock counting down. It's on the help page and there's actually a press

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  pass request form on the help page as well. Oh there is. I guess I should fill that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah you need to use Google Wallet. You use Google Plus in order to apply  and its academic admission is 300. I mean this is way better than rushing to try to register you know  at a yes moment in time. Yes. But you are competing for the ability to have the privilege to pay $900

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  to go. Lots more stories. I'm going to let each of you nominate a story from our long list  that you'd like to talk about. We're going to get Ray Ban Google Glass. Oakley Google Glass.  That's kind of interesting. Glass is doing it. Google's doing a deal with Luxottica which makes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  all of the you know major consumer glasses brands. I want to talk about the cloud computing stuff a  little bit. Okay. Yeah that one's interesting. Yeah I actually I went to I got an email from  Google a few weeks ago saying that they were doing this cloud platform live event. It was the events  going to be in San Francisco but they were going to do satellite viewings like with streaming video  at like Google New York and Google LA a few other offices and that they were going to do a live demo  on stage showing how to connect an Android app to a cloud service and that they'd found to do text  and they thought that to do text would be a great candidate to do that and was it okay with me if  they you know live coded the cloud plug-in for to do text and you know what I like to attend the  event and I was like absolutely I mean whatever the app is open source anyway they didn't really  need to ask my permission. So it was really neat. I got I went to Google New York yesterday and just  kind of watched the live stream. There's quite a few people there. They announced a bunch of really  cool features some of which I like didn't even really get my head around because I'm just not  this kind of engineer that does this kind of op stuff but huge huge price drops in cloud computing  services virtual machines and you know as as it always is at these events it was the conversation  that I had with a Googler kind of in the back in the hallway you know for five minutes that was way  more informative than the actual presentation but you know that the nut of it is that that Google  first of all is obviously taking on AWS right. They want to take Google's internal operations  like all the systems they have set up to deploy code and deploy servers they want to turn that  inside out and they want to offer that to companies so to startups and they want everyone to sort of  benefit from all the awesome automation that they do. And so this series of announcements yesterday  I think really lays the groundwork for I think for some even bigger kind of cloud platform stuff  that we're going to hear about at IO. Again this is like super backend you know systems kind of  stuff but some really really neat stuff and another interesting thing that at the announcement  that I found is that they're they're really embracing GitHub. They've stopped pushing  developers toward code.google.com they said you know GitHub is where the code is GitHub is where  the community is they're doing continuous integration and checkouts and and and integration  with GitHub doing pull requests and requests they're they're hosting a lot of their own open  source projects on GitHub which I was impressed by and surprised by. I really liked that they were  saying you know we're going to go to where the people are versus ask them to come to us. So anyway  it was it was a really cool event and and yeah they forked to do text and they hooked it up to  the Google Cloud. It was kind of fun. I'm still awaiting my pull request. I would say I want that yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah that's nice. I don't like using Dropbox. So they huge these price drops can kind of  mirror the price drops on the consumer storage that they announced last week on Google Drive  and Google said at this event that up to now pricing on this stuff has not followed Moore's law  but now it's going to start following Moore's law which means dramatic drops you know halved

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  every 18 months or something. Yeah and they've got AWS in their sites. I mean the first question  that they got was like hey are you going to offer tools you know person in the audience stood up and  went to the mic and said are you going to provide tools to move from AWS and you know the Google on  stage said we will provide tools to switch from other providers like you know they wouldn't even  say Amazon. Although Amazon's event is today I might point out. Well Amazon just just announced  virtual workspaces which is really cool. I'm very intrigued. Yeah you deploy a full desktop into the  cloud so it's like you can have a Windows desktop running on an Amazon workspace and get to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  through your Chromebook. Well I think not on the Chromebook. I think it's not compatible with the  Chromebook the last thing I read. So seriously yeah which is kind of interesting. I'm not sure  exactly what that all meant. I read a long thread about it and I wasn't clear but yeah apparently

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there's an issue with the Chromebook. They said any device with an internet connection so that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that'll be interesting. Yeah because there's an actual technical issue or a political issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. You know what I'm going to have to I read this on Google Plus today. The idea is though  that for instance a business could have a provisioned workspace that you as a worker or  could or a student could do it with a school could log into on any internet connected device and  there's your apps including Microsoft Office for instance if you want it or whatever. There's all  your data for a company it means the data is stored safely in the Google cloud instead of on  some worker's local desktop. The Amazon cloud. I'm sorry yeah the Amazon. Although I got to say  Google's got managed workspaces or managed virtual machines. I think that  probably they can respond by doing something almost identical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I think Google is not saying run Windows in our cloud at all whereas Amazon is saying  sure we can run Windows in our cloud. We're agnostic about that so that they may be pushing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  difference. The upshot is we're in the middle of a war. And it's great for everybody right because  prices are going to go down the tools are going to get better. It's great for everybody. We want a

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  war. Yeah we want a war. We want a war for all of these things which is good. That's definitely true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Particularly small businesses. So this is actually in response to your post Gina. It would work well  with Chrome OS but doesn't work with it at all. You could use Chrome desktop sharing if you first

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  connected from some other client. So you could point your Windows machine at it and then Chrome  into your Windows machine which is pointed at the Amazon. I don't know if this guy Charles

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  knows what he's talking about or not but that that's not encouraging. If that's the case.  Yeah that would be anti-competitive I would imagine. No I suspect it's just that you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  it's not a big install yet. It's not a big install base. Right. It says works with Windows, Mac,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  iPad, Kindle, Fire, Android tablets. Kindle Fire. So you need some sort of a client app. It's not  a browser based. Ah that's probably what it is. That's what I was I assumed it was browser based.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's not browser based then yeah then that's a shame because then it won't work in a bunch of

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  other things too. It's a good deal for 35 bucks a month you get a single virtual CPU 3.75 gigs of  memory, 50 gigs of user storage, internet explorer 9, really Firefox, Adobe flash and Adobe reader.  That's the standard bundle. You can get office professional for 75 bucks a month.  Wow. Things I never use. So it's basically Windows 7. You're getting Windows 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We. Meanwhile Microsoft is taking the word Windows out of Azure. Yeah no it's just Microsoft Azure.  I don't know what that means. It means they're trying to pitch the people who want to do  Linux hosting there which they've been able to do for a while but this is good. The fact that  we've got three suppliers that let us run stuff in the cloud and don't require us to use their  technology as much as they did is good because you know the Google App Engine was originally  you have to write everything in our own weird ways with our own weird libraries because then  you can use Google stuff and it'll scale for you wouldn't that be lovely and people said yeah  that's kind of nice but I don't want to write in that weird way I just rather write the things I  know and what's changed with the Google Cloud Engine stuff is they're saying okay we'll deploy  SQL we'll just deploy Cassandra we'll deploy a bunch of other things and they did a demo last  week of deploying some insane like a million concurrent clients on a Cassandra entrance  instance in Google Cloud which was which is pretty impressive. So there's definitely a play there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was a little animation on the screen I'll admit I was I was multitasking but there's this  animation on screen they're like okay yeah we're now inserting 45,000 rows per you know millisecond  into our database and look it's gonna do a live migration right over and look the animation's  not even gonna stop and oh my god look it didn't and everybody clapped and I was sort of like what  it's like one of these things is just so impossible to demo you know but okay live migration happened

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  like I believe you. Well it's also like they have to create a million a million clients as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in order to do this. Right it's like let's deploy a million clients. So we got over the server and

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  then we want to put another million clients over here to attack our server it's like okay I'm glad  I'm glad you guys are doing that I don't want to do that that's good that the message is we deal  with this and you don't have to which is the message I want as a as a developer. Right. Doing  that op stuff is really annoying I've done it it's not not fun at all and having people specialist

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  do it is a great thing. Yeah and this is what this particular product manager was saying to me was  that you know at Google they don't have ops teams like they've automated the crap out of everything  right and everything just kind of works like they've got teams of fleets of site reliability  engineers SREs right but this op stuff they don't do and nobody wants to do the op stuff  and nobody should have to do the op stuff like and because they've optimized the crap out of it and  automated it all they want to offer those services to everyone else so that other startups don't have  to have ops folks doing migration I was just we just switched to AWS and I spent I was up all night  on Sunday migrating a database with my with my ops person and that's you know we had to take the  site down for four hours I mean it was you know in the middle of the night but that's but that's  something that really shouldn't have to happen ever so you appreciate this yeah I mean yeah  absolutely I mean I have somebody who's really good at this kind of thing I just sort of you  know ran some scripts and stayed in chat and ate some you know some pizza Chinese food but yeah  exactly I forgot your book yeah but it is it is the worst kind of work so that the more that you  can automate it and the more that Google can kind of you know open source their their processes

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's worth the money it's worth the investment any other stories before we move on you guys want

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to talk about Jeff anything on your mind well I've got two things Pew mapping Twitter conversations

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's kind of an interesting analysis Pew Pew is a non-profit does research on how we use the  internet great stuff and what they're talking about political stuff just conversations in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  general and so they worked with oh who was it well for instance they say that Excel the Social  Media Research Foundation which created node XL to collect the data and and and so they see  various kinds of conversations they see polarized crowds we've heard a lot about that where people  talking about he said she said you idiot you moron yeah and then they map a tight crowd  with highly connected interconnected people so it's not as if to say that you know there's just

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  one kind of conversation conferences just south by southwest tweets for instance brand clusters

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  every brand there is out there and community clusters I'd like to buy these maps and put them  on my wall aren't they pretty yeah then finally broadcast networks you know when when important  stuff go out and the hub and spoke on support networks so that's interesting too the whole you  know Comcast Dell and so on those those kinds of conversations support network so I just found  they were pretty and interesting to see the different kinds of conversations that do occur

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  on Twitter all right I'm just going to take a long download I can tell to get the interactive

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  version and I think we should probably mention I think just for the kind of the record as far  as I'm concerned I see it as an Edward Snowden victory that on the path to victory that the  White House is looking at ending a bulk collection of our metadata that would be amazing well I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll wait and see yeah yeah but at least they're making the right sounds yeah good news for Pebble  I didn't realize this is a success story Pebble has sold 400,000 watches and they're on track to

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  of minimalists as opposed to all the kind of right things you've been hearing about what might come  out of Google and Android is you know monitor every aspect of your health and connect everything and  Pebble just wants to be like hey do you want your text messages we got those Chad you you still

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  enamored of the I'm still I'm still in love with the Pebble yeah why it's it's it does  basically everything I needed it allows me to do triage on my digital life as fast as  it all comes in and so so instead of pulling out my phone or or if I'm in a rush which happens  all the time where I'm trying to get somewhere I need to do something that I have to focus on  instead of pulling out my phone interrupting my life I can basically look down on my wrist and  see whatever notification or whatever thing sort of popped in and and it's it's expandable and the  battery lasts a really long time it's really simple I really I actually really is this kind  of blew me away I love that it's not a touch screen I really like that it has physical buttons because  I can check something and then go straight back into doing whatever the heck I was doing before  I don't need to worry about the screen wake time finally turning off so that I don't actually  accidentally like add some you know do something to it or if I'm in bed and and I get a message  I can look and then and then you know go back to sleep or whatever I'm not worried that the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  touchscreen is going to create that's a sad that way wait wait wait wait wait wait there Chad that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  what you do I mean everyone everyone has this story even I even I don't pick up the phone with  the buzzers well yeah I mean you don't have you don't have to I can look and see it's oh it's mom

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  and just dismiss them with they just released the 2.0 firmware or the 2.0 um app and uh app store  and they're starting to get a little interactive uh just a little bit of back and forth so um I  have an uh watch face or an app on here called glance and uh shows the weather shows the time  and then when someone texts you you can actually respond to them with one of your preset responses  so um oh so it has touch no no no it's preset response so oh you press a button I get I can  set the lower right button to be like so primitive wow you can't see my eyebrows on the audio feed  scary high school as Chad was saying you this is nice it's nice to not have a touchscreen it's nice  to not get completely out of your zone and have to like type out like can't talk right now Gina  explaining pebble to leo I can actually just hit the bottom right button and you already have that  as a as a preset well yeah and I can tell you how the dog did on his walk and I can just say 10-4

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and all kinds of stuff it's real I have to say with 400,000 units that's probably beating anybody  else in that space yeah they're in there that's why for god's sakes probably beating the pants

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  off the galaxy gear if I had yeah probably eating the gear which which in and of itself is like

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  is awesome for them yeah good for pebble yeah um good for maker studios the youtube network  which produces pewdiepie sold to disney for half a billion dollars for the record that's not  pewdiepie that should be pewdiepie but it's not it's actually the founder of maker studios who  had a big payday this this puzzles me a little bit because I would imagine well maybe they've  got all these guys locked in but I would imagine that they don't really own any of these shows

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  good would be on the chrome box so the chrome box you drive a tv screen which means you can give  you a portrait mode screen that would be good yeah yeah yeah oh no no no it's going now it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  upside down oh it goes all the way around yeah it keeps going it's a very if you hooked up a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  keyboard and a and mouse to it i mean i've seen a lot of developers who like to have their screens  in portrait mode right because they get the longer scroll and their code how did we not know about  this that's what puzzles me they tweeted about it today and i was like what i tried it on my  pixel i was like what avid reader press control shift refresh so that would be good it's particularly  good on the pixel because it's got the touch screen yeah uh because because typing like that  doesn't really work so well but you do you know scrolling works i had one other quick thing  that i'm kind of excited about um hold on kevin's saying something i don't know if you can hear him

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  what do you say kevin oh sorry if you're looking at something inappropriate you can then use the  keyboard as your shield to make sure the person on the train next to you can't see what you're  looking at it's upside down right just a tip for you commuters okay i have that problem lately i've

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  been watching shows on the path train coming back on my nexus 7 and um uh you know just kind  of cable shows but but you hit the sex scene and they're not you know not even x-rated but you kind  of feel a little awkward that yeah next to you see you switch off i had to do it twice on one  train ride the other day band totally thinking the girls something else so this is where you

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  need the oculus rift and just sit there on the path that's right they still can hear you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  whoa uh jeff did uh you have a number you'd like to gina has something else i think oh i'm sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah that's okay i had one oh this one's good yeah yeah yeah yeah this is pretty good um so  last pass which i know leo at least you know and love and you have it you too kevin pretty  um they're they're auto login to android apps and on the browser on android just got way way  better like it now the app if you're subscribed to premium which is like 12 bucks a year it's  literally like a dollar a month completely worth it it will auto fill your username and password  into apps and into your browser on android in the latest update you have to enable accessibility so  that it can do that screen overlay and then it can detect you know there's a username password  getting just dead and displayed but this is huge this is really huge this started with 3.2.0 yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that was the thing that was putting me off using it because that might it wouldn't yeah well you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  just have to open last pass copy the password basically yeah that's like a wow the other way  i used to do it when i when i had a lot of you know like a new phone and i had a lot of logins to do  to install on my apps is you can use the last pass keyboard and then it will do that yeah the last

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  pass keyboard to do it there was a shortcut you could say copy my username password to clipboard  and it would show it in shade uh so that was a little faster but kind of insecure because if  you left it up there you know in your shade or if you left it on a clipboard this is way better like  this is how last pass works in the browser right uh and which is the which is the best way so i'm  excited about that i just want to mention that it can't happen on ios because apple won't give

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  them access and it's it's optional too it comes up and it says fill with last pass last pass can  help you fill logins in other android apps would you like to enable this feature so it's not like  last pass is going to start throwing your password onto the screen every chance it gets very nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  oh just checking myself and now it's time for jeff's number of the week well so i like this one

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  um in recode the bay area council surveyed 500 san francisco residents and they found that  in this survey uh people are just fine with the buses and with google oh really 72 had strong or  somewhat favorable reviews of tech workers uh 57 had strong or somewhat favorable views of employee  views of employee shuttle buses and 67 said that allowing them to pick up and drop off  a limited number of bus stops is just fine thank you very much well we knew that it was just a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  yeah you know a small group of people who i'm you know have to make a point i mean it's very  expensive to buy a house in san francisco but it always has been that's why i live in petaluma  would you prefer detroit i mean you know right yeah good point uh let's start with kevin purdy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you got a pick or something like this for that matter would you rather be in buffalo

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  not right now oh boy wow i have to put up with this um not right now roll me is it snowing uh no  it's it's not warm i will say that um there's sun you can actually see it on my pale face um so  earlier you mentioned that google or jean mentioned that in the change log that google now has the uh  the visual uh promotions uh tab so that you can see little visual previews of your mail  as as you put it you know your your desired spam mail and it reminded me that there's a really cool  startup that's been doing this kind of like visual inbox thing for a while called unroll me  it's unrolled.me and you can go there and it totally does require you know a gmail uh  permissions where you get you give them access to your gmail inbox that's going to be a you know  full stop for some people but if you know if you are really fed up with all the email you get  you can start using unroll me and um one of the things it does is it batches all your email into  kind of um subscribe you know don't want roll it all up the the roll up though the emails you  send to it to batch all into one big email they arrive as these little thumbnail previews of the  top of the email just like what google did there so um whenever i see something like that where a  big company takes something that seems like something i've seen before i always like to  just point out that there is a uh you know some have trotted that path before so if you are both  inundated with email like we all are and you're you're interested in that kind of like quick  heads-up thumbnail preview of your email try unrolling me it's a really cool service

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  all right now i have to turn on all mail in my imap that scares me all right like i said let's  try it again but i do like the idea of getting out of all of these god most of my mail now is  that stuff is the bacon yes spam that you want yes spam i well maybe wanted or at one point signed  up for i mean spam they could argue it's okay to send you yeah yeah because google does a great  job stopping the spam they yeah they're just not great at the bacon uh good i'm running it right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  thank you for i've been using it for a while and you can see like some some of them it'll show a  nice little preview of what what this the one unsubscribe to night attack well that's i didn't  i didn't unsubscribe i rolled it up so now it'll it'll it'll come in um and i've been doing it for  a little while now okay um and it is the one of the nicest things is that it will show you all the  lists you're subscribed to and you can have an unsubscribe option that's nice which are just like  forgot that was seven years ago a lot of this stuff is that subscribe to that i still have a ruby

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  language mailing list that i really don't need to find the bugs in ruby anymore kevin do you  have anything kevin marks do you have anything you want to thank you kevin pretty well i've got a

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  couple of updates on um last week's thing so 2048 has gone on to take over the world and destroy  everyone's productivity but there are there um but the fun thing is because it's open source there  are some other silly ones so there's the number one version um which so do you know do you get  the reference here number wang so play this and see what happens when kevin marks says do you get  the reference here almost always no odds are no so so nub there's um is a british comedy show um  so basically it what is happening is randomizing the numbers oh this is very frustrating but it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  seems to the colors so you have to do it by color oh it's by color well i can do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  well except that the yellows all look the same so once you get to the high numbers you can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  play anymore yeah because there are some where the numbers are the same for different numbers

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  yes i'm number wanging that's number wang so number wang is a parody of tv game shows um done  by mitchell and webb where they just you look the video up on youtube you probably should play into  the show um where they they have this incomprehensible tv show people people shout numbers out and they  say that's number wang give me points and it's just it's just made up it's just a da da game show  and so but very funny and so as you play this every once in a while it shouts that's number wang yes  um so the fun thing to do with this is still so lost actually pretty good this is a good one to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  play on the bus or train when somebody you know they say what are you playing oh i'm playing number  wang how do you play well just can't you tell it's obvious just watch it so my son said he

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  was doing this um in the break room at school to troll his friends he was saying just definitely

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a troll they were like what i know what i'm doing some of the numbers come out backwards that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  what's really fun yes you go back with as you get square roots and okay and so it's just recently

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  to even understand this besides the fact they have to understand british a british game show parody  you also have to know about 2048 which we talked about on last week's episode so we're going to  pause the show now while you go and watch last week's episode and some youtube number wangs and

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  we'll be back in an hour and then there's i like to confuse them to look up and then there's the  the next 2048 um variant which is the 2048 meta edition ah so in this game um you start out with  2048 then it turns to doctor who and then you get the doge one and then you keep adding things and  you get it's all the other ones so the other variants of 2048 appearing as as bits of 2048  this is actually almost completely unplayable because three of them are the same but this is  fascinating no but i'm just loving i haven't seen an open source game take off in this way before  that's the piece for me that's that's amusing about this is that everyone's going oh i can  mix this up with that and mix up with that and is it because it's so easy to write um it's open  source it's already written so right people are just forking off the okay version of 2048  but also there are like now you know 20 versions for android and for ios as well right right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  she into the apps yeah there's an infinite app store collection and then there's everyone saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  oh it's just a ripoff of threes and it's like well yes but space invaders was a ripoff of breakout  what's your point you know there's there's a fact that they made it into something different and  that is fun it's interesting to watch so it's it's it's it's only subtly different than  the threes but but that's the point but it's a refinement it's actually more fun to play than

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it is more fun i think but lisa who's a master at threes won't play it she says it's ruining  it's like playing badminton if you're a racquetball player it ruins your it probably

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  would ruin your threes game you just get crossed with threes like why are these things pink and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  blue again right it seems like the only difference is the is the way the tiles move

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  as far as i can tell and i haven't spent a lot the way the tiles move all in one go here which  is actually nicer than threes but also the fact that their powers of two rather than three means  that you don't have that awkward one two three yeah it's prettier yeah yeah you don't have to  seed it with ones and twos um wow so then another update on the something else i mentioned last week  was this this 10x people focused focused mobile communication yes which is part of the um indy  web stuff yes um and he's he did a post so i showed you the post of trying to put link icons  on your home page so that people could contact you and he went through and worked out what all  the urls are for different ones so this is quite fun so basically you can put these kinds of links  on your web page it will launch that app and they can have a conversation with you in that particular  app so if this is there any browser will understand these no this is particularly focused on mobile so  this is android and ios um some of them will work with other browsers he documents which ones do  and which ones don't and some of them don't work until apparently the g-talk thing has been dropped  by google which makes it quite hard to do that but if you do sms colon email address both android  and ios will then um open a chat with you using either hangouts or um i message which is which is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  interesting would you suggest people make a page on their website with these links from well this

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  is what we're spending with the idea is is that um you want to have a contact me page but he's  saying well we'll make a contact me page that you can actually contact people on right most people  on the phone and they don't want to copy and paste something and do that um how do we do this with  and they don't necessarily want to use email they want to use the chat things that they've got so

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  how can we make that work t a n t e k dot com urls for people focused mobile communication i like

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  this idea um and that's there's a homebrew website club tonight in san francisco at mazilla again
