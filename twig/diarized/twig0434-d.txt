Transcript:  It's time for Twig this week in Google. Jeff has the week off, but Stacey Higginbotham's here and Erin Newcomb, our favorite maker.  We're going to talk about all the news, including Qualcomm.  They've got some big announcements. Both Stacey and Erin know a little bit about chipsets, so they'll have a lot to say about that.  Lawsuits flying between Mozilla and Verizon, oath, and a whole lot more.  Of course, the biggest Supreme Court case of the year.  It has a lot to do with your privacy. It's all coming up next on Twig.

It's time for Twig This Week in Google.  The first episode of December 2017.  And Jeff Jarvis is off doing Santa Claus duties so thank goodness Aaron Newcomb has decided to fill in.  Aaron Jeff's more like a Grinch actually.  What am I then? Am I a who?  Yeah you're a who in Whoville.  Aaron works at New Relic. He is a regular on all of our shows. A maker. In fact he founded the Benicia Maker Space.  And I know you're doing a fundraiser for that.  Yes absolutely.  Which we want to plug. So hang in there. We'll tell everybody about how they can do that.  But before we do that let me introduce Stacey Higginbotham our regular from Stacey on IOT.com.  Great to see you Stacey from Austin Texas.  And you are not in, we were talking before the show, you're not in Hawaii I gather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am not in Hawaii. In my Austin home office where it is freaking cold you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Woo it's not cold in Maui at least judging by Paul Thurotte's Instagram.  He's out there with an event, a Qualcomm Microsoft event they've announced.  We knew that they were working on WoWa, Windows on Arm.  They've announced their first ARM laptops from some of the big companies.  And the story of Windows on Arm is, they say quote, all day battery life.  Which is kind of who knows what the heck that is.  But I know you cover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it a shot in the arm? For arm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well it's interesting because it will, you can tell Paul is working really really hard right now at the Grand Wilea.  Nice up in there.  Yeah I have too. It's really beautiful.  But anyway no I think that we'd also heard that Apple was doing ARM or might be doing ARM version.  Now if Apple does it will be different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well yeah, Apple licenses ARM's technology not to reproduce exactly.  They've got an architecture license so they'll probably do their own version of the ARM chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And a desktop, Mac OS might be, on ARM might be a very interesting product.  It's kind of where Apple's headed given that ARM runs everything else Apple makes money on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been waiting for this for like 2010 maybe.  Because I was like you know most of your computing, the same thing Google thought when they put out the Pixel or the Chromecast, Chromebook.  The Pixelbook.  The Pixelbook.  Is that everything can be, most computing can be done in a browser.  And the browser equalizes everything.  So why can't we start having ARM?  And for a while it was because there was only 32 bit, now there's 64 bit.  So now you can put it in servers, which we did that.  We started building out you know OS's that would work for that.  And now here we are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They run cooler, they run lower power.  They're not, Aaron they're RISC not SISC right?  That means, does that mean inherently they're not as fast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think so.  No they can, well so it used to be the case right?  Anymore they can certainly be just as, not as powerful as full blown.  You know you're not going to replace your gaming rig with ARM these days.  But you can certainly do desktop computing with ARM.  And we're seeing that already with you know all kinds of devices that can be converted.  In fact Mike Elgin wrote a great post the other day talking about you know why, what's the next thing?  Why not get rid of laptops and just use our phones everywhere?  Plug your phone into a monitor and keyboard and go for it.  And I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually Samsung did that already with, Microsoft's done it with, what do they call it?  Connect.  What do they call it?  They have a name for it.  I think it's Samsung that calls it Connect.  But I have this Dex, it's a Samsung dock thing.  You put your phone in, you connect it to HDMI, to a monitor and to a mouse and a keyboard.  And it's a much more desktop like version of Android than you'd expect.  And given how much Microsoft's pushed its Office for instance to Android, and iOS for that matter,  they're really pushing the mobile versions of Office.  Other apps are doing the same thing.  I think it's just a short way off.  The reason I mention this to you Aaron particularly is because you've been using ARM for a long time  and things like Raspberry Pis, it's very popular with makers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah exactly.  And Windows actually, Microsoft actually released a version of Windows a few years ago for Raspberry Pis.  That's right.  They called it, let's say IoT or something like that, IoT version.  But it wasn't very popular.  You couldn't do much with it.  You couldn't get a desktop.  So all you could do is really get into a terminal.  So it was really for developers and that's fine.  But it sounds like where they're going here obviously with getting vendors like ASUS and so forth on board  is they really want to bring Windows to the mainstream on ARM devices.  And I think it's great.  What's interesting about this is how will Intel respond?  I think every time there's a competitive threat, Intel, it seems to force Intel into working even harder  and doing something more innovative, kind of gets them out of their rut so to speak.  So I'm kind of interested to see where Intel is going.  I mean Intel has kind of, I don't want to say shied away, but they've drawn back a little bit from,  certainly from the developer maker community by getting rid of their Edison platform by end of lifeing that.  I know that was still involved in a lot of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was like a year old, right?  That was very quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Intel fails at anything requiring power.  I mean, if you played with one of those Edison boards, they ran so hot compared to a Pi.  It was not fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But people built, I mean, people built projects.  They built ecosystems around the Edison.  Now those are all defunct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, so I don't think, oh, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, like as a chip reporter, I have lots of thoughts.  I know you do.  I know you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In fact, this isn't really exactly the right up the alley of this week in Google, but it's a big breaking story and it kind of is.  And since I have two people who know a lot about this subject, I thought, well, let's talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I think Intel's big challenge, and I said this before, is it's really good at general purpose compute.  And we're moving away from that because we're putting it into devices that need to be mobile or we're saying, hey, we want to do artificial intelligence, which is going to require massive parallel processing that Intel hasn't really been historically good at.  If you remember, like Larabee and things like that.  So the challenge here is can arm is power more important than general purpose processing and is arm good enough at general purpose now that it can actually compete with Intel in the laptop space.  And if you look at it like that, once.  If the market decides that arm based chips are then crap.  What does Intel do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, they did kind of weirdly.  One of those cats and dogs sleeping together stories.  They did a deal with their arch rival, Radion, ATI and AMD's Radion to put a graphics processor in the die with the Intel microprocessor.  And that may be one of the ways that they hope to respond.  Obviously aimed at high end computing.  Today, Qualcomm, along with these laptops announced its Snapdragon 845.  And it's interesting to hear where Qualcomm is aiming the 845.  They mentioned that it will allow 4K HDR video capture on smartphones.  They're going to focus on AI immersion, which I guess maybe AR their their name for AR security connectivity.  Immersion immersion is the ability to capture and render the world around you at high resolution and quality for more realistic results.  They do have a GPU.  It'll be Adreno 630 this time around.  And they're putting a image signal processor in the in the die as well.  This is a 10 nanometer die, which means even though these chips are really small, Paul had a picture of the 845 at 10 nanometers, you can pack a lot of functionality to that little die.  You know what's funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Qualcomm's Adreno, their graphics processor, they actually bought from AMD after it bought ATI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, interesting. That is funny.  So that is that is interesting.  Of course, this the Pixel 2 XL just is about to get Android 8.1 Oreo 8.1, which would turn on the image processor in this phone, which hasn't been on up to now.  For those of us who have Pixel 2s, it'll turn that on.  So I think that is telling also that the Qualcomm is putting an image signal processor into the 845 as well.  I don't know if I don't think I don't know if it's the same one that Google's using.  It's a Spectre 280 image processor. Google built their own, didn't they?  Google did their own thing.  That's the other trend, of course.  Apple and everybody wants to build their own based on ARM architectures, but build their own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why it's so good to be ARM right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's good to be ARM because they don't make any chips.  They don't need to.  Ultra HD color capture.  In these new chips, cameras capture more color volume than before.  I think they mean that's a broader range of colors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can see like hummingbirds or dogs.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's going to go from 8 to 10 bit color.  Oh, wow. And the color gamut will be Rec 2020, which means it's a little brighter.  You know, Qualcomm is not going to say things like as the, what was it, the 810 that turned into a, you could also fry an egg with it.  Or was it the 820? It might have been the 820 or 821.  I think it's 820.  Yeah. Yeah. But anyway, here comes the, you know, this is a battle that's going to rage.  And I love it because you know who benefits from that kind of competition.  It's us. So.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Whenever we used to talk to the big data center guys, like guys, ARM is not even going to work on your servers.  And they're all like, yeah, we got to keep Intel in line though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and power is a big concern in data centers, right? That's like the biggest concern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is, but our ARM was not ready for the data centers.  But what's really cool, and this is super kind of subtle, but I think it's worth talking about.  So for a long time, you only had Intel and x86, right?  And so what Intel gave you, you took with ARM because they offer these architecture licenses.  You can actually develop a variety of different ARM based chips to offer a vendor based on different specs,  which actually brings a lot more competition or potential competition and potential feature competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So look what you've got. You've got Apple, you've got Qualcomm.  Are there other big ARM licensees that I should be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, like Caviam, Google, Amazon all has those all have architecture licenses in different.  They have gone in.  I wish I had paid attention to their most recent shareholder thing,  but they've gone from like having a dozen architecture licenses like five years ago to having like more than 30.  I mean, it's a huge growth in architecture licenses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So here's I didn't know this. I'm learning something that they roll in zero zero in our chat room says Adreno,  the name for the graphics processor in the Qualcomm Snapdragon chips, is an anagram of Radeon.  The techno, of course, the technology that AMD and ATI created.  It was originally called Imigion, which I think they had to change the name because how would you imagine Imigion?  That was ATI's name. They acquired AMD acquired in 2006.  Qualcomm renamed Imigion or whatever the hell to Adreno as an anagram, according to Wikipedia and rolling zero zero an anagram of Radeon.  Anyway, we'll have a lot more on Windows on ARM and the new Windows laptops based on the ARM chip, which are definitely the proof of concept.  Of course, Google's been doing this for a while because Chromebooks, there are ARM Chromebooks.  There have been for some time. You could get the Samsung Chromebook in ARM or Intel flavors.  And while some people seem to think that the Intel version, the Chromebook Pro is faster than the Chromebook Plus, I have two.  I own I bought two Chromebook Pluses for my kids and they love them.  And I don't think they're slow at all. They run Android software perfectly well.  So as you'd expect. All right, let's take a little break.  There's lots more to talk about, including Cher.  It's her fault, by the way, that everybody's agitating for all this net neutrality stuff.  According to Agit Pai. It was Alyssa Milano's and Melissa Milano and Agit Pai, as we speak, is speaking in secret to his former employer, Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, we'll clarify that for you. Oh, he's not after after the break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, OK. There's the tease. There's the tease.  What's the real story? Google is shutting down the apps section of the Chrome Web Store will tell you what's going on there as well.  Lots of big news here. But first a word for your shopping list.  I have already purchased. I am so way ahead of the game.  I have already purchased many of the Christmas gifts I'll be giving in a couple of weeks, including 23 and me for my mother and my sister.  We're going to have the whole family. Oh, I have to get one more for my dad. I forgot.  We're going to have the whole family. 23 and me is named after the 23 chromosomes that make you you.  It's a personal genetic service that helps you understand what your DNA says about you.  And right now is a great time. I did 23 years ago.  And I you know, the nice thing about this is a gift that keeps on giving when you when you spit in that vial.  And that's all you have to do. There's no blood draw or anything.  You just you'll get a little kit. They will get a little kit because I got it all packaged up for them.  And they just spit into it. And then you send it back.  And then your reports appear online and the reports are constantly evolving as we learn more.  And we are really in a period of learning an awful lot about our genetics.  So as a really good example, when I first did 23 and me, they didn't mention Neanderthals because at the time it was thought,  oh, the homo sapiens never interbred with Neanderthals. There's no Neanderthal genes in there.  Then they were able to find some bones with Neanderthal remnants.  They were able to analyze the genetics and they found out. Yes. Yes.  We do have many of us Neanderthal genetics. Now with 23 and me, shortly thereafter, they told me my Neanderthal ancestry.  I have 265 Neanderthal variants. We didn't even know this until 2010.  This is this is new stuff. I am less Neanderthal than most of you.  It's only four percent, but four percent is a big chunk of DNA, actually, if you think about it.  So I'm in seventh place out of my family and friends in the Neanderthal category.  But I don't yet have my sister, my mom in there. I think it'd be very interesting.  Speaking of your mom, among other reports, you can get the maternal and the paternal haplogroup in your ancestry reports that show how your how your family migrated the maternal line around the world.  So going back, if you go back far enough, sixty five thousand, actually one hundred eighty thousand years ago, I, like most of us, came from Africa, Central Africa.  Then sixty five thousand years ago, they migrated a little bit north to roughly where Kenya is and then into the Middle East.  Fifty nine thousand years ago and then a little farther north.  Forty seven thousand years ago to Central Europe and then migrated from there into Europe itself.  This is fascinating stuff. Another good thing about this gift is a great way to engage kids.  By the way, I am in the same group as the Cheddar Man.  That explains a lot. That explains.  First discovered in 1903 in Cheddar Gorge, Somerset, England, Britain's oldest complete human skeleton.  And he had the U5A variant in his maternal haplogroup as well.  So this is a great way for kids to learn about DNA in a way that engages them because it's your this is what's great about this.  It's about you. This is your report.  And it's always advancing. You can read about the research and the discoveries that have been made lately.  They also offer you for downloading the raw data.  So, for instance, when you learn about something, you can look it up and see if you have that particular gene.  That's been fascinating for me. You also learn a lot in the trait reports.  The traits are kind of silly, but I think kind of fun.  Like, can I smell asparagus odor? Likely. But I likely cannot taste bitter.  And I and this is true. My genetics say I am likely to prefer salty or savory snacks.  This is fun and informative and actually educational.  There's also a DNA relative finder tool that will help you connect with new relatives. I found a second cousin.  It's so amazing. 23andMe, 75 online reports in ancestry, wellness, traits, carrier status.  And this holiday you can give that as a gift that is as unique as the ones you love with a DNA kit from 23andMe.  Now through December 26th, you'll get up to $50 off every kit.  That's why I bought a bunch of them. When you go to 23andMe.com slash twit, 23andMe.com slash twit,  make the holidays even more special with 23andMe.com slash twit.  And this is Anne Wojcicki's company, one of the Wojcicki sisters or other sister.  Susan runs or is it the other way around? I can never. I get them confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Susan runs YouTube. Susan runs YouTube. Yeah. And Anne is I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And was married to Larry. No, Sergei. I can never. It's all good. It's there. It's all in her.  It's because their mom, Esther Wojcicki, rented the garage to those young boys, Larry and Sergei, when Google was first starting.  And then the sisters and then you know how that happens.  You can find out about it if you don't know in 23andMe. All right. Where did I get it wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is Ajit Pai not speaking to Verizon, Stacey Higginbotham? He's at Verizon, but it is a telecommunications and media forum event.  Not a keynote. It is a keynote at this particular event.  But there are other speakers and he's not speaking specifically to Verizon.  He's speaking to the 100 and some odd people who are at this particular event.  And it's under the Chatham House rule. Oh, God, I saw that and I thought instantly of Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a British rule that the organizer Verizon applied to the organizer isn't Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not. Is the Internet or is the International Institute of Communications at Verizon's headquarters.  The event for this particular event, it's held at Verizon's headquarters. They hold events all over the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right. So it really isn't a Verizon connected thing. It's just the venue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The venue is Verizon. Verizon is a member of the IIC.  OK, it's a nonprofit. I'm not saying that it's less, but it's a telecommunication. It's an event for telecom people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right. And the Chatham rules were applied by the IIC so that people can speak freely, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. So, I mean, yes. Is should Ajit Pai be hanging out at Verizon a week before he's trying to destroy the new company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The optics aren't great. And he was formerly a counsel at Verizon, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the optics, I mean. Who cares about optics when you're Ajit Pai?  No one in this administration cares about optics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Who cares? We don't need to worry about optics. We are the government.  So he will, they I think, be still holding the vote even though numbers of people have said, look, you can't have the vote because the comments are screwed up.  We think it was taken over by a lot of phony comments, as many as a million phony pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That stole normal people's identities. I cannot. Yes. That's what's so stunning.  Not only are these robo comments, they're robo comments masquerading as individual consumers comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's actually a database. There's a database you can go to to figure out if your comments, more than half of the 21 million public comments supporting the rule change were likely faked.  And faked, I might add, in the direction of repealing that neutrality.  So the Attorney General of New York State, Eric Schneiderman, has put up a site where you can see if a comment used your name in vain.  So you enter your name. And actually, I did comment and this does not find my actual comment.  So I don't know really if this is searching right now. That's the blank screen. And I see the little logo in the bottom.  We are searching. We are searching. I like state government web design right there. Right there.  Okay. Searched. Perg. Delivery. FCC. NN. Comment. Google Docs. PDF. Updated. I don't know. Is that my comment?  Actually, I don't think this is. That might be your comment. Well, is it? Let's see.  Well, it's maybe I signed this. Oh, yeah. I must have been on the 56,000 signatures. Don't kill net neutrality.  Well, if it was me or not, it might have been my dad. Suppose one problem is we have the same name. Here's the net neutrality petition signers.  I don't think I sign any petitions. I don't really believe in petitions, but I guess I'm on the list of signers for a couple of petitions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it may have searched all the way back to the original 2015. Yeah, it goes way back. But I'm I've been very active.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My name was my name was not used. Oh, here it is. I kind of here's my actual comment. Good. It does have it there.  And that's it. And as me and it was disseminated. Does that mean they took the semen out of it? What does that mean? They disseminated it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They sent it to the commissioners. Oh, good. That was that was sent that I am an Internet broadcaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My company, Twitt TV, creates video and audio programming that reaches seven million people a month with revenues approaching ten million dollars yearly.  Our shows are distributed all over the world via the thing called the Internet.  We would not exist without a free and open Internet last mile access to our audience.  ISPs is critical and allowing ISPs to prioritize traffic could put me and my 25 employees out of work.  Please protect net neutrality. I said that was quite eloquently eloquent. That's a good comment.  Well, I wanted them to understand the economic argument because that's the argument on the other side as well.  We're just we're lightning. We're light touching federal regulation.  But this is federal regulation of businesses that would do me harm. So I don't mind.  OK, I'm going to take a deep breath. Your name was not used in vain. My name was not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No one would use Higginbotham in vain. No, it's probably not.  I did write a story about net neutrality in my newsletter last week.  And this doesn't get brought up a lot, but I think it's worthwhile partially because I wrote it.  So obviously, I think it's worth my worth. But the point I would like to make is especially when it comes to IOT,  we don't know what we're building. We didn't know back in the early days of the web what we were building.  We didn't know back in the days of mobile broadband what we were building and what would come of that.  And the reason we got to that point is because people were allowed to innovate.  And frankly, once we got to wireless, it was because they were allowed to innovate around the carriers once Apple  launched its app store and Google launched their app store.  So my thought and point here is we're at another crucial development point in technology and of the Internet with the Internet of Things.  And to put these rules to abandon net neutrality now could shape our future at this point and make it different, probably worse, less innovative.  So that was kind of the point I was trying to make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess you could make the argument, well, this is not the time. When you have these nascent technologies,  it's not the time to regulate because we don't know, as you say, we don't know where they're going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just talking about net neutrality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We want to protect. It's like we want to protect these and give them a chance to grow without the income.  The problem is the incumbents, right? The companies that are already doing it.  And I include, by the way, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, well, no, because you're conflating two things.  And I don't want people to do this because the telco industry is really trying hard to conflate these two things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. In fact, that's one of the things that you're saying is don't blame.  Don't blame Comcast, blame Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So purely net neutrality right now, as it's regulated, is to deal with the issue of infrastructure,  which is anti-competitive here when it comes to broadband or it's not competitive, rather not anti-competitive.  And these incumbent players have too much power just providing bits through a pipe.  Now, if you want to talk about different layers, like if you think of your OSI stack, right?  If you want to talk about different layers higher up at the application layer, let's talk about Google and Facebook.  But that is not a net neutrality issue to me. That is a completely different issue.  I'm not actually sure the FCC has the rules to regulate that.  I know that they've kind of dabbled in it, but you can argue that the FTC is better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And I would say that. I would say that.  But I would also point out that that is why you can't really count on an alliance if you're for net neutrality with these big companies,  because frankly, it's not going to hurt them.  Although we can go back to 2005 when Ed Wittaker at AT&T said,  I think the fundamental question that the ISPs are, this is what really is bugging them.  He said, quote, Why should Google be allowed to use my pipes?  The Internet can't be free in that sense because we and the cable companies have made an investment.  And for a Google or Yahoo or Vonage or anybody to expect to use our pipes free is nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's what consumers pay for. They just want it on both sides.  And that is that is a stupid argument. It was stupid back in 2015 or 2005.  And you know what's really you know, what really is frustrating slash possibly one day could be hilarious is the cable companies,  the ISPs have long had a decision to make and they've long chose the path of scarcity.  And if you look at other parallels in technology, you will see a company like Intel way back in the 80s.  They were like, hey, we've got this awesome chip technology and we can scale it up.  Let's get people. Let's fund people to actually build on this stuff.  And they did. They funded EA. They funded all these companies.  And we as a company as a country went out and bought faster and faster chips and we bought them from Intel.  So, yay, the telcos instead of saying, hey, let's learn how to deliver broadband because we're really good at that.  And people are going to totally need this in the future.  Let's figure out how to optimize our investments, deliver it super cheaply.  I'll Intel or Google or Facebook, how they've done.  They said, no, no. Let's just figure out how we can control this and charge people extra money.  So we'll charge them coming in. We'll charge them coming out.  It's a completely different way of thinking utterly at odds with the way that computers and technology work basically.  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Congress and the other big part of this real quick.  I'll let you jump in, Leo. The other big part of this drives me nuts.  I'm sure you guys have talked about this ad nauseum, but well, we're going to keep talking about it as long as they keep assaulting it.  We should. We should keep talking about it.  But whenever the arguments that Stacey just made are brought up, then they come back with its counter argument that says, oh, well, it's OK, because we should let competition improve the marketplace.  Just let's let competition rule here.  We all know that people have choices, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  But the fact is people don't have choices.  I can't go to an alternative.  I have to use Comcast if I want the level of service that I get right now.  I want to do work from my home.  Comcast is the only choice because the other alternatives I have aren't fast enough to allow me to do that.  And so that's another bogus argument that keeps getting thrown out as well.  We should just let competition take over.  It's like we've been down this road.  They tried to do this in the past when they first came up with these rules and regs.  And they said competition would make this work.  And it hasn't made it work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Congress is already going forward.  Congress, by the way, which can override anything the FCC does, the FCC only operates at the, you know,  with the oversight of Congress, has received half a million calls from this site alone,  battleforthenet.com.  Half a million calls.  You could do it too if you go to battleforthenet.com.  The vote is a week from tomorrow.  But that won't be the end of it.  Battleforthenet points out that the next step is to pass legislation that actively allows throttling  and extra fees and censorship on the Internet.  And so they're not even done yet.  First, we repeal Title II regulation.  But then Congress is going to step in, is expected to step in, and explicitly allow ISPs to start charging.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if that happens, what will happen is this.  We will start treating broadband as a scarce resource, and we will get companies innovating around it instead of on it.  And you'll see this with Google investments in 5G.  You see it with companies like Starry trying to do, you know, millimeter wave home delivery.  If you talk to Dane, I'm sure he'll start thinking about ways, you know.  It's not ideal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, we have a system that's public, it's free, it's open.  But if it's, but you're right.  I mean, that's what technology does.  It routes around the damage.  So, but what would it look like?  Would it be a second tier Internet?  Would it be another, a different Internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I mean, right now we've got fixed wireless is kind of a huge option.  So people are looking at like millimeter wave spectrum.  You're going to have lots of little small cells in dense areas.  It's going to screw over the rural people, as always happens.  And you'll have these alternate ISPs and they won't be crappy Internet.  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So a couple of things to watch for.  First of all, battleforthenet.com.  Contact your member of Congress.  This has been very effective with SOPA.  It was very effective in getting the Title II regulation put in.  It was very effective.  Tom Wheeler resisted that until he received millions of comments saying, do it.  And we were very active in that campaign.  So we know we can, we can affect this.  Take advantage of that.  Battleforthenet.com.  Then watch what Congress does, because if Pi gets his vote, he probably will in one week.  Then the next step is for Congress to step in.  And that's why you have to, you have to stay in touch with Congress.  And the other thing to watch for, as we pointed out, is people who basically the big ISPs are trying to deflect blame for this to the big ISPs.  To the big four, to the big companies, to Google, Amazon, Facebook, and say, oh, it's Twitter's fault.  It's shares fault.  And Ajit Pai has already been saying that.  He says that the problem isn't AT&T, Charter, and Comcast, and Verizon.  The problem is Twitter.  And so watch for that deflection, because that isn't even, as you point out, it's not Germain.  It's not even related, Stacey.  All right.  Have we said everything we want to say about that?  We'll probably say it again next week and the week after.  But please do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been saying it for almost a decade.  I know.  Please do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because we, I mean, it's a personal issue for all of us who listen to podcasts, for instance.  The podcasting exists because people can create content and distribute it over the internet at very low cost.  We don't want to go back to the days where only the rich could afford the radio transmitters and the TV transmitters and the newspapers.  That's not the way it should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's a personal issue for consumers.  You would not have Waze if carriers could charge for that kind of stuff.  You would not have Dark Sky.  You would not have so many things if you go back.  And a lot of people, unfortunately, don't remember this.  But like, God, remember carrier app stores?  Oh, it was heinous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that was so horrible.  Oh, my God, you're right.  You'd buy apps from the carriers and ringtones that would expire after three months and you have to buy them again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So think about that's where your innovation is going to be clogged at.  And it's horrible.  And I'm not exaggerating this.  I mean, look at all the benefits that we have gotten from our open internet culture.  You cannot and we don't know what's next.  And, oh, OK, that's all I'm done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And, you know, Aaron, you make a point.  Competition would solve this.  In fact, Ben Thompson, a strataquiri, he changed the headline because the headline was really, you know, inflammatory.  Why Ajit Pai is right.  That's not really what he was saying.  What he was saying is if we have competition, then Ajit Pai is right.  But we got to be very clear.  We don't have competition because of any competitive moves by the FCC at the behest of AT&T and Verizon going back years.  So that's exactly right.  Yeah, there is no competition.  Eighty six percent of the country has two choices of Internet service providers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they're crap choices because it's cable or DSL.  Right.  And DSL is not a choice.  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not anymore.  It used to be OK.  Right.  But we've gone beyond that.  I mean, the difference.  It's a 20X difference in throughput between what I can get from DSL, what I can get from cable.  And, you know, I think you're right.  I mean, the wireless option may be the best one going forward because at least then you don't have to worry about access rights and things like that.  You just have to worry about where you can put the towers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But watch out for another thing to watch out for because these companies understand that there'll be competition then from other new arenas as you squeeze in one area pops out in another.  And already part of this is, oh, and by the way, no municipal Wi-Fi.  No, no states can do their own Wi-Fi thing.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  And no states get pass any net neutrality bills.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  So this is really a grab by Comcast, Verizon, AT&T.  They're really grabbing and saying and holding on tight.  And they don't want anybody else to give them an end around.  So, yeah, there are great technologies possible out there.  But these companies are not stupid and they know exactly where the threats are coming from.  And since they have a tame Congress and a pet FCC, they're going to use those tools and we have to stop them.  We really do.  Let's see.  Let's see. The Chrome Store is no longer going to offer apps.  Anybody have any idea what's going?  I think Google has said this before, but they're actually doing it now.  They're shutting down the app section.  Progressive Web apps are the future.  And Google's all behind this.  But interestingly, so is Microsoft.  We've talked a lot about PWA, Progressive Web Apps on Windows Weekly.  And until you or somebody else tells me it's a bad idea, I think this is a very good idea.  The idea of a progressive web app is it starts as a web page, but it's not exactly the web apps of the early iPhone.  It starts as a web page.  But when you go to that web page on your mobile or your desktop, it downloads assets which can then be run offline  using something called service workers that are running on the desktop or running on the phone.  So in effect, websites become apps.  They use less bandwidth. They can run locally. They can run offline.  And that's what Google is saying.  Use progressive web apps, not Chrome apps.  Agree? Disagree? Thoughts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What happens with the files after you're done using them?  If every website you go to on your phone gets stored someplace, so what's the caching and cleansing kind of process?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's an interesting question.  There must be a timeout for the resources at some point.  Just as cookies expire after 90 days or 60 days of disuse,  you actually are starting to see that both on iOS and Android.  Both operating systems are looking for unused apps and moving them off the phone.  And I think that's probably the first step towards that.  That's a good question.  The service workers are persistent.  And the idea is that these apps are somewhat persistent because if you go, for instance, Facebook, imagine Facebook.  You don't have a Facebook app anymore.  You just use your browser to go to Facebook, but Facebook then downloads the assets that make it effectively an app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I love it for all the common times.  The reason I ask these questions is because there's so many like, you know, every time you go to a restaurant, they're like, hey, you want our app?  And you're like, no, or you go to a certain website.  So I'm thinking more the one off or two off kind of cases and what that because everybody in within the other question tied to that would be what permissions would you automatically end up granting these?  Because, like, everybody wants your information.  You don't actually have to give it to them today, which is nice.  Right.  Would you automatically give away location if you've accepted and bought into this progressive web app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think there'd be a permission structure that you would offer that you would.  It even works now with websites.  Websites will say, you know, your browser will say this website wants location information when you'd like to grant it.  I think all of those things will continue.  And but the service workers will allow things like access to the camera, access to the GPS, access to physical hardware.  That's what those service workers are there for.  I like this idea.  It's basically their HTML five.  If you use React JS, for instance, that's a commonly used framework for these progressive web apps.  Google has a whole getting started with progressive web apps page for developers where you write your first app, which I think is a weather app.  So Google says this this is for us.  Now, of course, Google changes his mind regularly.  The thing that encourages me is that it's not just Google.  In this case, Microsoft's doing the same thing.  Google says this is for us the replacement for Chrome apps because it'll run on desktop.  It'll run on mobile.  It's a universal thing.  It'll run on iOS and Android.  I mean, that would be great for the cool thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I look at this from a developer standpoint.  I mean, anytime I'm not a huge I do this as a hobbyist.  Right.  So but anytime I can write a web app versus a discrete app for a particular platform, I'll do it because that way I know I can access that information.  I can access that information from anywhere.  And so I think this is a push in the right direction.  And also, I mean, who uses those Chrome apps?  I mean, I was a believer when they first when they first came out, I was like, oh, this is cool.  This is cool.  I can play this game.  Right.  But anymore, I just use utilities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My Synology NAS has a note app that I've replaced Evernote with.  And I can I'll give you actually a really good example that probably a lot of people use is Hangouts.  Hangouts is now persistent.  You can close Chrome and Hangouts will continue to run.  That's the text messaging.  And since that's what my text message is, it gives me a desktop and mobile version of text messaging.  But there's no reason that couldn't be a PWA.  And by the way, Apple is also supporting this.  This is really good news.  When you see Microsoft, Apple and Google all behind it, that's encouraging.  So Apple is saying we're going to build this into Safari as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, well, that makes me feel a little bit better about privacy and permissions information kind of getting out there, because I think you're optimistic to assume that that will be taken care of.  I think we always have to ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, you're right.  You're right.  But I think, you know, certainly at least Apple, you know, is really very ever assume the as a journalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're really secure, aren't they?  Especially with their root passwords.  Boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, we're going to do a whole security now.  Steve, Steve didn't have time to do it for this week, but next Tuesday, the the entire show will be devoted to the rapidly shrinking security platform of iOS.  iOS was for a while like the gold standard for security, but but probably mostly because users are having trouble.  Apple has decided to favor data persistence and reliability over security.  You know, people were losing their photos because they could unlock their phone.  And so Apple has said, maybe we went a little too far on that.  So we're going to talk actually about that and the impacts of that next Tuesday.  So why build this is Google's property, I mean, website developers.google.com.  Why build a progressive web app worthy of being on the home screen?  That's one thing.  You know, web apps were always a second class citizen to standalone apps.  They weren't quite as good as fast.  They didn't the user interface wasn't.  But the idea here and boy, we've seen this the industry go through this time and time again is, oh, no, these will be first class citizens worthy of being on the home screen works reliably no matter what the network conditions.  That's actually pretty important.  Not not just for here, but in the developing world.  So lower the amount of data required just to do it.  Increased engagement.  And that's what you were talking about, Stacey.  You know, you know, you you go to the target web page.  Well, suddenly you have a target app on your on your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't want that.  To be clear, that's not an advantage in my world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, but I think a lot of users might.  I'll give you a more better example, maybe open table instead of installing.  And you want to make a reservation in a restaurant.  You can do it on the table website or you can install an open table app.  And if you ask Google Assistant to make a reservation for you and remember, Google's been touting this since Google IOT.  A year ago, you make a reservation with Google Assistant.  It was going to get a little bit of open table onto your phone, download it.  And then it was going to say, I did this with open table.  Would you like the app?  Well, this would be much more seamless.  It would just in effect give you an app for open table.  But you're right. I want to know about persistence.  How long does that last?  Am I still going to have five thousand apps on my phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Both both persistence and data sharing and permissions.  Absolutely.  Because like I can see like open table might really want my location all the time.  But I don't see a reason to give open table that information.  Absolutely not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So well, there's but there's also a different kind of persistency, which is persistence across devices.  Oh, yeah.  That would be great. Right.  If I could open up something on my laptop, one of these apps and then go to that page and I'm halfway through filling out a form or something.  And I got to go. I got to run. I'm busy.  So I get on the BART and I can then pull up the same thing on my phone and continue filling out that form.  That's a huge time saver.  So I don't know if these PWAs will help with that problem or not.  But I run into this all the time where I'm halfway through completing a task and I've got to run and then I've got to start all over from the beginning again.  It's so frustrating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The other thing that this other side effect of this is.  And this might be something Google wants.  It starts to disintermediate the App Store.  You don't need to go to the App Store anymore.  You just go to the website.  And that's probably better for Google than Apple.  Apple's App Store is a massive revenue generator for Apple.  Tim Cook was just saying that in China.  What was the number?  Let me just look it up real quickly.  The amount of money that Google made in China.  Was billions of 17 billion dollars.  That's a quarter of the global App Store earnings over how long it can't have been the very long.  Is it just in one year?  Total revenue throughout the store going to developers.  Remember is 70 billion.  But that means 30 billion for Apple.  So the App Store is a cash cow for Apple.  And this would kind of change things.  Furthermore, if you're Amazon, you hate the App Store because you can have a Kindle app there.  But if you sell books through the Kindle app, Apple takes a 30 percent chunk.  Right.  If you do in the App Store, I mean in the progressive web apps, it's just a website.  I have a feeling Apple doesn't have quite the death grip on your revenue that they would otherwise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does that mean if I'm running the progressive web app, I can access YouTube on Amazon devices?  No.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's talk about that.  That's really frustrating.  And by the way, it's personally frustrating because we tell people all the time, for instance, if you have an Echo show,  it's not a huge number of people I would imagine, but I have several.  I love the Echo show.  It's the Echo with a seven inch screen on it.  You can say Echo watch twig on YouTube.  Now, that was when it first came out.  It was nice.  It was a full screen experience.  Google killed that.  Then it came back last week and now Google says, no, it's Amazon's fault.  It's not our app.  It's their app.  And we don't do it that way.  And Amazon hasn't agreed to our terms.  So we're killing YouTube access on the Amazon Echo.  Furthermore, on January 1st on the Fire TV.  And this also, remember, is because Amazon won't sell Google products on the Amazon.  It won't sell the Google Home on the Amazon store, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or does it sell Nest?  I think it still sells Nest or it did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.  In fact, I think when Amazon released a camera of its own, let me see.  That's a good question.  I think I remember them pulling the Nest.  No, they do.  In fact, Amazon's choice, the Nest Cam Indoor Security camera works with the Echo.  So they do still sell all the Nest stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, maybe if Alphabet spins Nest back into the Google Pixel hardware division, that will change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If I search for Google Home on Amazon, look what shows up.  The Echo Dot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and they are neck and neck on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, same thing with Chromecast.  So I understand Google and Amazon are at each other.  I think this is dumb of Amazon.  That's not because the show is this week at Google.  But I think if you want to be retailer to the world, you can't be.  This is a net neutrality issue for retail.  You can't be picking and choosing.  Okay, don't call it that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it is.  Please don't call it that.  No, it is not.  It is a competitive issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's not net neutrality, but it's the same idea that a retailer should not discriminate.  No.  Against products because they compete with the retailer's products.  Right?  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The concept of net neutrality is that we view the Internet and access to it as a basic right.  Okay, that's a good point.  Or as a public utility.  Amazon is not a public utility, so that's right.  So let's stop it, Leo.  You're playing right into their hands.  I'm shaking my finger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, but there's something wrong with a retailer that doesn't sell products that compete with  its own products.  I think if Whole Foods didn't sell ragu pasta sauce, which they wouldn't anyway, but just  as an example, because they've got their 365 brand pasta sauce, wouldn't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's why the grocery store brands, what is it called when you don't have a brand?  Generics.  Thank you.  The generics are such an issue.  And that's why actually a lot of companies don't let Trader Joe's make their stuff and  put their stuff in Trader Joe's.  Right.  This is a dynamic that plays out outside of the tech world.  It's not unusual.  Okay, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I feel like if Amazon pretends to be customer centric, not including stuff the customer  wants, worse, surfacing their own product when you search for something you want.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's just, I mean, and also if you look at like, if your core business is getting eyeballs  onto your property, then this really hurts.  I've long been frustrated with Amazon video because I can't cast it to my Chromecast for  my device unless I cast my whole screen.  And even then sometimes it blocks out the video.  And so I've stopped using it.  So Amazon, wake up.  I'm not looking at your properties anymore.  I'm not going to buy a video that might pop up in an ad or something like that because  I'm not using your thing because I can't watch it.  It's stupid.  It's ridiculous.  But it is Amazon's right.  Do you know that this is Amazon versus Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know because Amazon now is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're making an assumption again.  It could be Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, we know Google yanked YouTube from Amazon's.  Right.  But do we know that Google has Google's...  Oh, you mean Google's not putting its products on Amazon?  Yeah.  Why would they do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe Google said, I don't want to sell the home there.  Apple doesn't sell their stuff on Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't imagine that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I'm just, you know, we're...  Right.  We shouldn't make the assumption.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As usual, Stacey is the voice of wisdom.  We get all excited and Stacey slaps us down.  That's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I think it's totally crappy.  I'm not against...  As a consumer, I'm like, guys, get your crap together.  I'm sick of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sick of it.  But you don't have to buy stuff at Amazon.  There are other places to buy stuff, I might point out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But as a prime member, I prefer to buy at Amazon.  I'd buy my Apple gear there.  I'd buy my Google Home there if I could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Lincoln, our chat room says, I use my Fire Stick almost exclusively to watch YouTube videos.  I'm watching Twig on it right now.  This really sucks.  My Fire Stick is now pretty much worthless to me.  Yeah, if you bought an Amazon TV device to watch YouTube on...  See, I think that's going to bite them because I think that's certainly a lot of people...  I know YouTube is their television and they watch it on their Chromecast.  Or they watch it on their Apple TV or they watch it on their Roku.  If it's not on the Fire TV, that's bad for Amazon.  In fact, I don't know whether it was Apple or Amazon that was keeping the Amazon Prime video off of the Apple TV.  But as I said today, it finally emerges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ScooterX points out that it is Amazon thwarting Google's ability to put their stuff in their stores.  It is?  Yeah, he said he posted a statement in the chat room from...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Scooter knows all.  We've been trying to reach agreement with Amazon to give consumers access to each other's products and services.  But Amazon doesn't carry Google products like Chromecast and Google Home,  doesn't make Prime video available for Google Cast users,  and last month stopped selling some of Nest's latest products, giving this lack of reciprocity.  We are no longer supporting YouTube on Echo Show and Fire TV.  We hope we can reach an agreement to resolve these issues soon.  Thank you, ScooterX. That's Google's statement.  And Google pointed out, this isn't our app. This is Amazon.  Anyway, it's bad for...  But again, dinosaurs battle. The little people at their feet are the ones getting squished.  And here we are. We love it that people could watch our shows easily with a single...  You could still listen, but the idea that somebody who had a screen on their Echo device could watch our shows was really great.  Amazon has also pulled the Twitch channel from Roku, apparently.  What?  Roku is like Switzerland.  Yeah, that's right. Roku is Switzerland.  Damn it.  There isn't a Twitch app on Apple TV either, or on Android TV.  Although there is an app for the Nvidia Shield.  Tablet, not Android TV.  So, starting today, the official Twitch app for streaming is now a Fire TV exclusive.  Who owns Twitch, I might add? Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess they're trying to make a YouTube thing.  I mean, the truth of it is, whoever has the most audience and power has the most power right now in these sorts of dynamics.  Of course. Yeah, but we're hurt by this.  Yeah, but this is like the cable retrans disagreements that happen all the time.  And you know, because those travel in part, retrans being an issue of public airwaves and access to public channels, the FCC gets involved.  Because this isn't the application layer, this could be an option or a thing that gets the FCC or probably the FTC involved saying, hey, are you guys behaving well?  So that might be the impetus to get people to regulate, you know, at the application layer.  And that'd be very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  We consumers always end up suffering from this stuff because we want to watch what we want when we want it, when we want it anytime.  For free.  For free.  Can I tell you?  That's what Twitch does.  We put ourselves anywhere anybody wants to watch us.  As long as we get to count the viewers and you don't take out our ads and you don't charge people for it, you give it away.  You know, it's everywhere.  And you know, in airplanes, it's actually on terrestrial television in some areas you can watch our shows because our philosophy is, well, we make our money from the advertising, so the more eyeballs the better.  But that's because we're unaffiliated.  You know, if Amazon bought us and Jeff, I just want to say for everything I might have said about Amazon, I would be acceptable to that amenable to that idea.  But if Amazon bought us, we might have to say, oh, yeah, you can't you can't watch us on a Roku.  I wouldn't like that.  No, we built, you know, we intentionally I always said from day one, we want to be everywhere.  People want to see us for free, easily, easily accessible.  That's what makes podcast work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the content providers mantra as the distribution platform.  You want exclusivity for something.  So people come to you know, house of cards and the Internet was supposed to eliminate the middleman as the distributor.  But it hasn't because, you know, you still have to still have to need a software.  You need an OS.  You need something depending on you still need the platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're in the platform era, really.  It's actually we never lost.  Stop being it was Microsoft in the 90s.  And now there's a little more competition.  By the way, I'm very excited that Robin, what's her name is going to get to be the star of House of Cards finally.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Did you see that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're going to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So he's been the best thing about that.  Robin Wright is fabulous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it always bugged me a little bit and they were making Kevin Spacey's character wimpier and weirder.  They are so they're throwing out everything they shot and they're going to do a new eights, eights episode arc with Robin Wright as a star as it should be.  And then that'll wrap it up.  Yeah, now the story is that Doug Stamper, who is the weasel, the chief of staff, is going to get this spinoff.  The Doug Stamper show.  Really?  Let's just have all Robin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love Robin Wright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I don't need anybody else in that show.  She is a great although part of what was amazing was the interplay between her and Spacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think she could develop.  I mean, because she is she is competent.  She is evil in a way that women are never allowed to know.  Awesome.  And she is just like you root for her, though, because she is powerful.  And I'm like, I would love to see her dynamic develop with anyone.  And especially because I did get a little soapy.  But, you know, it's not as soapy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think Christopher Plummer is available.  That's kind of an in-joke.  All right.  Because, OK, I'll explain it.  Christopher Plummer in 10 days, they reshot the movie All the Money in the World.  They took Kevin Spacey's character out and they reshot it with Christopher Plummer in 10 days.  And the movie's coming out.  That's crazy.  Crazy.  And now Christopher Plummer is going to play all the male leads in Hollywood from now on.  He's the only the only one left who can act in these movies.  Time magazine.  Person of the Year.  Women of the Year.  What do they call it?  The truth tellers, the speak upers, the talker bouters.  It's not the president.  Did you see this?  Thank goodness.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Me Too.  I saw it this morning.  I thought it was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the Me Too.  No, they have a name for it.  Let me see if I could find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like well played.  The Silence Breakers.  Silence Breakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well played Time Magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Silence Breakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, there's a guy in there.  Look at that.  Terry Crews.  Yeah.  So that I think is I think you know what I think that's accurate actually.  They certainly that has made a massive impact on not just politics but culture and at large  and Silicon Valley too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they managed to still get Taylor Swift on the cover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because by the way, do you think Time Magazine now that it's about to be owned by Meredith,  do you think that what will guess who's going to be the person the year next year?  Just a wild shot.  Maybe Ajit Pai.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think Time will still exist as a magazine?  I wonder because Meredith is such a lifestyle brand.  If Time and Fortune and those guys still exist.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why would you spend a lot of money to buy it if you didn't want to continue to publish  it?  Steve Case has created a new fund called the Rise of the Rest.  I would call it the Flyover Fund.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Didn't he do this like five or six years?  I swear to God, Steve Case has been traveling Middle America for a decade.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And he's raised money from Bezos and a lot of other people to fund startups.  Bezos, Eric Schmidt, Starbucks chairman Howard Schultz, Tory Burch, the fashion designer,  Henry Kravis of KK&R, Michael Milken, John Doerr, the Waltons, the Cokes, the Pritzkers,  Sean Parker, Ted Leonsis.  They're all putting money into this fund to foster startups in Middle America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm almost 100% sure he's done this before.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it seems like that's not really happening.  I mean, there's lots of reasons why startups happen and where they happen.  But just because you decide that geopolitically you feel like it should be somewhere doesn't  make that happen.  Even if you throw a lot of money at it.  You know what I'd like to see him do?  Throw money at makerspaces.  Yep.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Put that money where...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Especially with TechShop going under.  Isn't that sad?  Makerspaces are incredibly important right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So TechShop was the first for-profit maker.  Most makerspaces are like yours, a Benesia makerspace, a nonprofit.  But Techspace, they thought we could make this a business.  Did that go under just because you couldn't or because there were some structural problems?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think it was a little bit of both.  I think there were some structural problems.  They put out a press release.  Sorry, I don't have the link to it right handy.  But they put out a press release kind of explaining publicly why they went under.  But it was a funding problem.  But look, I mean, if you look at what TechShop, I think, was started at like $125 a month or something.  And we start at $50 a month.  And, you know, yeah, we're scraping by, but we're doing it.  It is possible to do.  But once you start adding in the layers of bureaucracy and you have to start paying a lot of people,  it does become quite expensive to run even a community-based makerspace.  It's not easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  TechShop said that they weren't they were getting memberships,  but this growth was slow and they couldn't keep people as members.  And that's what funds it, right?  You have to buy it.  And, you know, I suspect the model was somewhat like gym memberships where people aspirationally will buy a membership,  but maybe not use it a lot.  There are some have very heavy users and there's some people who effectively subsidize it by not using it.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's that's what we're doing right now is we're looking for, you know, people to become sponsors.  We're looking to reach out to the to the business community and say, hey, look, this is an incubator for you guys, too,  because people come in, they learn about stuff, and then that gives you skilled work skilled laborers to hire that can come in  and work on, you know, your projects for your business.  So we're trying to get the business community involved now to sponsor this as well as a growth opportunity for skilled laborers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was being kind of facetious, but honestly, that's really invest in that in the flyover states and you're investing in the future.  You're investing in a whole generation of people who will have the skills, the knowledge, you know, Jack Dorsey invented Square in a makerspace.  He built the prototype, did the whole thing in a makerspace.  That's what you not the Jack Dorsey was a 12 year old with the dream.  So you're doing a fundraiser, a crowd fundraiser.  We've got to get some money in here, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we actually started this about four months ago and we put a hold on it because a couple of weeks after we started this,  the hurricane season started and then the fire started and we said we are not going to we want people to donate to those causes.  So we actually put this on hold for a while and we're just coming back to it now.  Good to try to to try to finish this off, especially with the end of the year.  People like to contribute, at least for now, to get a tax donation.  We'll see what happens.  But this year you can still get a nice deduction on your taxes for contributing.  So, yeah, we're trying to round this off.  We've had a lot of growth, which is great, but it's slow growth.  People don't still don't know what a makerspace is.  They don't know what they can do there and getting them in the door and showing them what they can do.  It's like the light bulb goes on.  They're like, wow, this is incredible.  But just getting them over that threshold is is tricky.  So it's it's good growth, but it's slow growth and we need a little bit of funding to help keep us going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I'm going to just kick in a little bit here for that.  I think we should be a corporate sponsor, don't you?  Oh, thank you, Leo. Appreciate that.  That's great. Let me let me throw in on on that because yeah.  And you know, I want this to continue.  And I do think it's good. It's good for us.  It's it makes geeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a geek maker. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a geek factory. It's a geek factory.  So let's see.  Yeah, I'm going to put it on.  Please enter all required. Oh, I got to do.  I'll do the I don't want to put my credit card on on the air as I have done in the past more than once.  I cancel credit cards a lot these days, so I'll do that when we get off the air.  But I think that's really well worth doing.  It's on Indiegogo search Indiegogo for Benicia, Ben, E, CIA, Makerspace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we're using their they acquired a company called Generosity.  So we took a chance and use them.  It's a subsidiary now of Indiegogo.  So yeah, just search for Generosity.  Benicia Makerspace should pop right up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There it is. And there's a nice picture of Aaron in a twits T-shirt, which I like.  Oh, it's like you're already sponsoring it. Yeah, we already are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was the I think that was on.  Well, yeah, that was on the screen savers when we talked about how to how to build a makerspace.  Yeah, yeah, it was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you got my corporate contribution right there.  We'll put it on. We'll put it on.  That'll be your holiday holiday gift.  That's awesome. Actually, we already said we already sent you the food.  So yeah, I know you said some cash.  You said your kids ate it all. Oh, my word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the kids just ripped into it.  It's like I opened it up. I set it on the thing.  I'm like, I'm going to leave this here to show my wife.  Right. So I come back in an hour later and all the little packages are open and all the food's gone.  Teenagers. Yeah. What are you going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stacey, you get yours. I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you very much. You're welcome.  We we did not.  There's only three people in my house.  So none of them are teenagers.  So it lasted a long time.  You know, my husband did come.  He's like, I think most of this is packaging and not chocolate.  Oh, I was like, well, it's a gift basket.  It has to be packaged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, he's like, he just very literally.  You know what? Next year, I'm sending you a basket with just a ton of chocolate in it.  No, it's just a brick of chocolate.  I mean, it should be wrapped.  Do you like your deli? Because that's the local chocolate.  We'll send you actually, you know what?  We'll send you Cho TCHO, which is the Silicon Valley, the chocolate of Silicon Valley.  Oh, wow. Yeah, it's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This was delicious.  We all appreciated.  Apparently, some of us more than others were just some of us one and more, and we're bitterly disappointed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, God. I'm going to send you another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  I just I just thought it was kind of cute.  Like a 40 year old man reduced to like a kid.  One more chocolate.  I want more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's so frustrated over those those toys that you get that are all twist tied in the back and you can't get them out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. Frustration free gift baskets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, that's the next next time.  That's the next time our show today.  What? Go ahead.  You know, you got it. No, no, no.  I don't have to go to an ad yet. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was just saying, I do think it's a big opportunity miss with Amazon buying Whole Foods that they have not brought gift baskets like high quality gift baskets to like.  I wanted to do that for Christmas this year, but no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, Aaron, you are breaking my within less than 24 hour embargo on crowdfunding because I'm so burned by crowdfunding last night.  Lisa and I said to each other, OK, no more.  Right. Right. No more.  But but you're breaking it because that's different because I don't expect anything from that.  That's just I'm sorry, Leo. I didn't mean to.  No, no, no.  Send you down that road.  I finally sent an email to Jibo because I'm number 382.  I sent them five hundred dollars in 2014 for the robot that looks around.  Right. What?  So I finally sent them a note.  They said, oh, you must have received our email in October asking your address.  They have my address, but it's been so long.  It was the old studio.  So it's probably good.  So so I sent them the new address.  They said, your Jibo's on the way.  So maybe by next week, Stacey, you'll have we'll get rid of Jeff and we'll have a little friend join the show.  A little Jibo.  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I can be replaced by a robot or Jeff can be replaced by a robot.  No, I would never do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can't. You can't.  You can't. But I am curious.  The Jibo, the thing that got me to send the money completely on spec is it's Cynthia Brazil, who is a very good roboticist out of MIT.  And so I thought that was a pretty good ancestry.  We'll see. We'll find out.  It's been so long, though, because she announced it before the Amazon Echo came out.  Oh, yeah.  It's got times have changed.  At least you're getting it.  I mean, I know all the things that the Echo does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very disappointing.  Yeah.  Do you have a Jibo?  I don't. But one of my friends does.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're trying not to let me down easy, OK?  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twenty nine dollars.  It's cute, though.  It's very cute.  Stacey has a long tradition of shooting me down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just pooping on everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe that should be the title of the show.  Yeah.  Stacey's pooping on everything.  Last time when I bought it, was it a Nest IQ cam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She said, you doofus.  But she was right because she wanted me to buy this thing back here, the lighthouse.  And she was right because they're a sponsor now.  They weren't at the time.

Captera dot com slash twig.  You'll get home on time.  Let's see.  Some people are getting Google Home minis that are crashing and rebooting when you listen to certain songs at high volume.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which songs?  OK, here's some songs.  Royals by Lord, Jaden Smith's Icon.  If you turn it up to 100 percent, it will crash, at least according to Reddit.  Reddit subreddit, Google Home subreddit.  Actually, people on both Reddit and the Google products forums are complaining.  You think it's overheating?  It could be overheating.  I have to say Google's had some hardware issues with this mini.  Yeah.  Do you have either of you have one yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have one.  I'm giving it away as a white elephant gift, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You don't like it?  I do not.  Are you all in on the echo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I like my Google Home.  I actually we put it on our gift list.  It doesn't hear you well.  It's a pain to use.  Tapping the thing is just irritating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe you want the Google Home Maxi, according to Best Buy.  Well, you never know, by the way, when you see these listings.  But Best Buy had a listing, a placeholder, that said December 11th, just a few days, a week from today, right?  Or a little less.  Google did say they'll get it out this year, so that means they only have a few more weeks.  So the Maxi is not the Maxi.  It's the Max.  I'm going to call it the Maxi because it's mini, midi, and maxi.  The Maxi is the one with the speaker, the big speaker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That understands its environment.  Self-calibrating speaker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  $400 self-calibrating speaker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So expensive.  Have you guys actually heard the sound coming out?  I haven't heard one in person yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Would anybody that we know hear it?  I don't know.  Google could be forced to pay 5 million UK iPhone users, oddly enough,  £2.7 billion in compensation  because it's, according to the consumer watchdog group,  actually, no, it's a class action, a consumer campaign called Google You Owe Us.  They allege that Google was unlawfully harvesting the browser histories of iPhone users without their permission.  Google, Google, you owe us.  I feel a little bad for Google.  It's like your rich uncle.  Everybody comes to him with their hand down.  Although at least one state is probing Google's secret tracking of Android users.  So the Connecticut Attorney General is...  He's always doing that.  George Jepson.  Meet George Jepson.  This is that thing that we talked about where even if you had disabled location services,  Google would know where you were based on the cell phone towers.  Of course, your carrier knows that.  Right.  Carrier keeps that information for quite a while and even hands it over to law enforcement.  By the way, that is the subject of a Supreme Court case that is going to be maybe one of the most important cases of the year.  We'll find out by spring.  Supreme Court is hearing a case about whether these pen register warrants are legal.  So currently, thanks to a number of court decisions,  it's deemed that the location information coming out of your phone is not a search  because you voluntarily conveyed that information to the phone company.  So that is the current precedent.  But there is a case the Supreme Court has agreed to hear about a Radio Shack robbery.  The alleged perpetrator was caught because the police were able to get his phone records  and were able to tie him using the phone records, tie him to the robberies.  He was near the robberies in many cases.  So this is going to be a fairly important decision for people who want privacy.  And they did that without a warrant, right?  Right. It's a pen register.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the key.  I mean, it's fine if I give my information to my cell phone provider,  but that's a agreement between me and them.  They can't just take the information and give it over to somebody else.  They could give it over to law enforcement, I would say,  if law enforcement had a warrant to go get that information.  But they can't just say, oh yeah, sure, it's open. Anybody can go find it.  There's got to be some security around that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Facebook and Google have all filed amicus briefs urging the Supreme Court  to bring Fourth Amendment law into the modern era.  No, quote, no constitutional doctrine should presume that consumers assume the risk  of warrantless government surveillance simply by using technologies that are beneficial  and increasingly integrated into modern life.  Of course, Google, Apple, and Facebook have quite a dog in this hunt.  We've known that this goes on.  We've known that the police did not need a warrant to find your location and to track you.  And of course, the cell phone companies keep years of tracking data.  In fact, even have special portals just for law enforcement where the police,  local, federal, anybody can go in, pay a small fee, a few dollars in most cases,  and say, well, where was Leo on the night of November 29, 1956?  We will see. June, by June, the Supreme Court will rule on this.  I don't know if arguments have, if they've had the, I think they had arguments, but I don't know.  That would be, that's the only chance you have to really to get a Wednesday.  So tomorrow, arguments, that's today rather, Wednesday.  No, that was last week, last Wednesday. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, you know, I'm laughing because Virgil in the chat room says they could use a potato chip bag to block the track.  Maybe that's what we all should do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wasn't there a worker who did that? He put his phone in a ruffles bag.  One of the small ones. Apparently they have metal and was able to skip out on the construction site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  His company was, they had built-in tracking software to track whether they were on the job or not.  So he puts after lunch, he puts his phone in the chip bag and goes to a movie.  I kind of think that's awesome. But, you know, shame on him for not doing his job, I guess.  But still, it's pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I don't know if you're teenagers still believe in Santa, but certainly mine do.  And that's why we have the Santa tracker app from Google on my phone.  And now you can take Elfies around the world with the Santa tracker app.  Make sure you put it on your, on your phone.  New activities will pop up between now and Christmas Eve, including an AI drawing game, an Elf dance coding game, and a virtual snowball fight.  Google's Santa tracker.  I put it on my phone. This is a perfect example of what a progressive web app should be.  You should just appear on your phone and then disappear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you guys, I don't know if this is new or not.  Have you guys done the Google security checkup? Has that popped up for you guys?  Oh yeah, I get that all the time. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had not gotten it until the other day. I was like, this is awesome.  And we encourage people to do it actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, cause I've forgotten some of these apps.  I went through it the other day and I'd forgotten some of the apps that had access to my drive, for example, things like that stuff I had uninstalled years ago and they still had access.  You should do that for Twitter too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, everybody should do it. Yeah. Yeah. It's google.com slash security.  They offer a security checkup, but this will give you all of the things and all of the different capabilities.  The thing you're talking about is checking which apps have your Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Right. Yeah. If you just, if you just Google, Google security checkup, it'll, it should pop.  Should be the first link in the list. And it's, it's great.  Certainly probably I don't believe they're required to do this in any shape or form, but it's popped up for me the other day.  And I'm like, yeah, I really like kudos to you. Google. This is pretty awesome.  Sorry. Public service announcement for the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's see. We're going to wrap things up because we have to get out of here in 12 minutes so we can get to Mr. Paul Thurotte and Windows weekly.  We're going to find out about those new ARM laptops.  Crack Wi-Fi patch coming in December to Pixels and NexEye.  That's important. Make sure you get, I hope you're getting those regular patches, monthly patches in the December patch should be out any day now or may actually, maybe it is out.  Okay. I haven't seen it yet, but I should check.  Let me, let me check up my Pixel 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wouldn't it have come out yesterday? Don't they always come out on Tuesday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, that's when Microsoft does.  That's Microsoft. Nevermind.  I wish Google were that consistent. It isn't though. It's just kind of usually in the first couple of weeks of the month.  But you never really know. System update.  Oh, you know, I'm on the 8.1 beta, so I don't know if I will be a good test of that.  Yeah, I currently only have the November 5th security patch. Don't yet have the December.  That's all I still have.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just checking to make sure we got everything before we run.  You guys have any stories you really want to get in here?  Did you see the virtual cats? Have you bought virtual cats? Are you going to buy virtual cats?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No. I mean, yes. I had not heard about them, but yes, I will buy them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Crypto kitties, collectible. This is, I think blockchain has gone off the rails.  Yeah.  So this is, there is no value to these, but people have already spent a million dollars.  A million dollars. The most expensive kitty right now is $112,000. Just so you know, it's speculation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like gambling, guys. People spend a lot of money on gambling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's not even as fun as gambling. You're just hoping that you can sell it for a higher price than you buy it for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some people think that's really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's brilliant on the part of the designers because they aren't doing diddly-doo and they're, you know, you have to install a Chrome extension for Ethereum called MetaMask.  And then you're using Ethereum, the cryptocurrency Ethereum, to purchase crypto kitties and then auction them and sell them.  And what fun. I don't think there's anything involved in like feeding them or taking care of them or anything like that.  I think it's just, it's basically a market for virtual kitties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I think that we're a little more mature, I would say, age-wise, but I know that my kids love this kind of stuff.  I mean, every game they play, they always want, there's, it doesn't do anything to help you in the game, but they want the latest bling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it's big on kids. I know. This is not for kids. This is not for kids for sure.  So Chuck Schumer, Senator from New York, has done a good job in the past of stopping ticket-buying bots.  You know, it was a big problem on Broadway and its concerts where these bots would go out, scoop up all the tickets and then resell them, scalp them for higher prices.  Schumer says the bots are back. He passed the BOTS Act last year to protect games, concerts and Broadway shows.  Now he wants to expand it to toys.  Bots can locate the, and I'm not surprised given that a lot of e-commerce is online now, locate the product page of a popular toy, even before it goes on sale, buy them up,  and then resell them to panicked parents who just have to have that Cabbage Patch Kids or the Furby.  Toys that sell for $15 are now being sold on websites like eBay for as much as $1,000.  So Schumer is calling attention to it. I don't know if he's going to enact a law.  He says we're asking the National Retail Federation and the Retail Industry Leaders Association to block the bots.  They can technologically, and they should be, and I agree.  What is the toy this, what is this season's toy, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They said the Barbie Dream House was doing big and then these fuggly little puppet things, fingerlings maybe?  Fingerlings I think is what they're called. They're like, they're not potatoes. They're little puppets, finger puppets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, I'm really disappointed and saddened to have to report that the Winklevoss twins have taken their $11 million settlement from Mark Zuckerberg.  You saw the movie. You know that they think Suck stole Facebook from them. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't.  He settled, apparently, I didn't know this for $11 million. They've invested it in Bitcoin and they are now Bitcoin billionaires.  Wow. Because Bitcoin's almost $12,000 now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, just sell and change that into real money or at least sell most of it and change it into real money.  Diversify. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But they did say a few years ago they were all in on Bitcoin and it turned out to be right, although I don't know how that happened.  Yeah, it's been crazy lately.  Crazy. $13,000 now? Wow, that can't be. Really? This is crazy speculation.  Let me look at the Coinbase. See what the quote, what's the quote for the current, is that the place to go to get the, what's the best place to get the quote?  I like Coinbase.  $13,315.71. Up $6,000 almost half since last month. And 88% growth since last month. And no end in sight.  And I, my son has been texting me more and more urgently every day saying, Dad, you've got to unlock your wallet. You've got to find your wallet.  Because I have a Bitcoin wallet somewhere with seven coins in it.  You really should. $91,000 now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because if you let it, if you let it go bust. That would be terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What are the tax implications of Bitcoin? Oh, IRS wants to know. If you go to Coinbase, they're asking Coinbase to hand over those records to the IRS. It's taxable income.  I don't know what the basis is. I didn't find them. There was, you know, I don't know what to do. I don't want to pay the taxes on that.  Chipotle is, I'm sorry to say revamping its queso recipe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, if they were a gift, you would pay a gift tax. But I don't know if it was the value when they were gifted or the value now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's that, the burritos or the Bitcoin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, queso.  Taxable value of the queso.  So Bloomberg confirms Jeff Jarvis's assertion that it's grainy. That would be uncooked flour probably, right?  So they are made, still made without artificial ingredients, but now has a creamier texture and a really nice spicy flavor, according to Chipotle spokesperson Chris Arnold.  People are saying they can taste the flour. Let's spice it up.  Well, to thicken it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's melted cheese. It's supposed to be thick.  I mean, if you're saying I'm not using artificial ingredients because I'm using soybean oil, then that is a real ingredient, but it's also not a real ingredient in queso.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, we don't know what the ingredients are. It's a secret recipe.  Yeah.  I learned today, I learned, T-I-L, that you remember that Mozilla had a deal with Yahoo for search when Yahoo was sold to Verizon and turned into Oath, still the worst name in technology today.  They, that Mozilla, the Mozilla Foundation decided to take advantage of out in their contract on sale.  If they didn't like the new company, they could stop using Yahoo and start using Google.  But what I learned today was, regardless, Yahoo has to continue to pay Mozilla $375 million a year through 2019.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my God, those people sucked at making deals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Guess who?  Marissa Meyer made that deal.  That is such a terrible deal.  Even if you don't use Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did that get stuck into, did they not notice that in due diligence?  Because that's pretty material.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, lawsuits are flying.  Oath is suing Mozilla and Mozilla is now counter suing because, well, I'm guessing it's that $375 million that's the problem.  Oath at least says you got to use Yahoo, but Mozilla says no, the contract is clear.  We had a unilateral right to terminate based on a number of factors, including not liking the company that bought Yahoo.  So back and forth and back and forth.  And you know how court actions are.  By the time it's done, the $375 million will shrink to nothing.  We're headed towards.  Yes, I know we just got our new emojis for 2017.  But guess what?  As soon as you get the new emojis, you got to start working on the next generation.  One more step.  We finally, I'm so relieved.  We got rid of frowny poop face.  This was a controversial.  There were battles were told raging on the Unicode Emoji Committee over the frowning pile of poo.  It's been removed.  As has the face with letters.  OK, as eyes and the frowning face with question marks as eyes and all three reject rejected.  But good news.  You will be able to flip your emojis in 2018 right to left or left or right.  That's always been a problem.  You know, the flag blowing the wrong way or the train going the wrong way.  So now you'll be able to flip them.  And they got some new.  The new candidates here are here.  Bagels.  Is that what that is?  I'm not sure.  Oh, what is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that a mango?  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Teddy bear mango party face skateboards, spool of thread.  Really?  Spool of thread.  Now, these haven't been approved.  These are just these are but they are still in the running.  There's a swan.  Curly afro hair, I guess.  And red hair.  Redheads finally, finally represented in the emoji spectrum.  And yeah, I think that's a bagel.  I guess that's a bagel.  It's not a donut.  It's not a donut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's probably why they cut it in half, right?  Because otherwise you'd think it was a donut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, boy, you're smart.  And they looks like they toasted it and put butter on it.  And now I'm hungry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I skipped lunch because I was running so fast.  Well, let's wrap it up.  Let's get your picks and we'll have a final word in a moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have two things.  One is pretty limited, I feel.  And the other thing is old.  But I just discovered it.  So maybe you guys don't know about it.  So my first thing is for Tesla owners only.  Sorry.  But there's the My Tesla Skill on Amazon.  And I was at a trade show.  Yeah.  Someone was like, have you tried this yet?  And I was like, I have not.  But now I have.  It is super fun.  And you can even say, ask my car, dude, where's my car?  Which I enjoyed.  You can literally say the words dude.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can also just say, where is my car?  But it's way more fun to say, dude, where's my car?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So those are the commands you can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I'm adding it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The most cool.  The most cool.  Yeah.  I'll say that.  The start charging command is very helpful because sometimes you forget to start your  you plug it in.  But like the schedule, it's scheduled for something and you need to go.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what?  Then I would plug it in every time and then I'd just say, start charging.  That's nice.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there in C would you like crap.  But you have to say, you have to say, echo, dude, where's my car?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  You have to say the trigger word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have to say, Madam A, ask car or tell car, where's my car?  Tell car is the opening the skill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The problem with all these skills.  They're so arcane.  But have fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Play with that.  See what you think.  So that's for the small percentage of people have a Tesla.  But for the rest of us, which is everyone who likes Harry Potter, I put this on the  list because I didn't know it existed.  Kevin Toffle, my cohost on my show, was like, yeah, this has been out since like 2014.  But due to me, I don't care.  It's a remote control wand that converts.  I know I'm sorry.  It does not convert.  It does not convert to expect those CSI Las Vegas.  I'm sorry.  It does not convert it to Wi-Fi.  My bad.  But what it does is you program your remote with this thing.  It's just an IR remote basically that you program.  Is it based?  Yes.  Yes, it is.  And that is why it's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you see, I think it's apocryphal.  The guy who said he turned the computer in his Tesla into a Bitcoin miner and he's using  the free power from the supercharger to run it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I did see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's got to be a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's going to get a nasty gram from Elon Musk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Elon is not going to be happy.  That is definitely not.  He could actually take your Tesla back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He could shut it down.  It could be like, you know what?  Because didn't they send out those letters to people in California like you can't charge  here anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  So are you giving the TV remote one to everybody in your household?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm giving it to my mom because she's a huge Harry Potter fan and she likes watching TV.  So, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Lumos.  I'm going to go get one because for makers that's great.  You can have an IR.  Well, no, you can add an IR receiver to your project, right?  Now you can do a spell and make LED lights go off and all kinds of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Skip us commercialists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's kind of expensive, but it's pretty cool.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe I'll just build one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Aaron Newcomb, your tip this week.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So actually, I try to do a project.  We'll see if my voice holds out.  I try to do a project every week.  And this week it is something I built for work.  It's actually the...  I don't know if you can see this.  It's a big red button.  I call it the holiday cheer box.  And it's a big red button on a green box.  And it's pretty simple.  When you press the button, it plays some sort of holiday sound.  So let's see if you can hear this.  That's what Christmas is all about.  Sorry, Brian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that your kid?  I don't know if you can hear that.  Okay.  It says press here for holiday cheer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Press here for holiday cheer.  Let's try it again.  Hey, Santa, what's shaking, man?  So there's a bunch of just random sounds that I picked up from around the internet on there.  And when someone walks by, if they're feeling a little blue or something, they can just  press the button and it'll play a little sound.  Maybe it'll cheer them up.  I don't know.  So it's just something fun, super easy, using Arduino Nano and a little sound module that  you can buy off of eBay or wherever you hook the two things up.  I'm going to publish this on an Instructable.  I tried to get it done in time for the show, but you know, life.  But follow me on Instructables.  I'll put up an Instructable on how to build your own a little bit later on today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What?  Instructables.com slash Aaron Newcomb or?  Yeah, I think so.  I don't know.  Any?  I've got it.  Any W-C-O-M-B.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just do a search on Instructables and be looking out for it later today.  It's fun.  And then you can, the cool thing about this is you can build it into anything you want.  So, you know, if you're having a Harry Potter party with your magic IR wand, you could build  one that does Harry Potter sounds or whatever you want.  You know, you can turn it into anything.  So it's fun.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or just when you swivel your wand, it'll make a noise.  It'll make the noise go off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Perfect.  I'm doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then you sound fancy.  All of your friends will be impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to channel Jeff Jarvis and have a number of the week.  That's a number that has a near and dear to my heart.  In 2017, digital ad spending $209 billion worldwide, beating TV $178 billion for the  first time ever.  Digital ad spending.  That doesn't just, that's not just podcast.  I wish it were a podcast.  It's mostly panners.  But still, that is a big watershed event.  And it's by a big margin.  In fact, it's going to only get bigger.  So good news for digital.  People are making money doing it.  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for being here for this weekend.  Google's thanks to Stacey Higginbotham, Stacey on iot.com, at Giga Stacey on Twitter.

Transcript:  Let me call my lawyer.  You have no choice.  Thank you, Stacey.  Aaron Newcomb, thank you so much for filling in.  It's really great to have you.  And again, generosity.com.  Look for the Benesia Makerspace fundraiser.  A very good cause.  It's a great thing.  You know, I think somebody should call Steve Case and say you really want to help innovation in this country.  Help Makerspaces.  Can I add something?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead.  I keep thinking you're saying Venetia, like Venice, like the city in Italy.  But you're really saying Bonesia.  With a B.  Yeah.  So I didn't see it until I was like, no wonder I couldn't find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, not Venetia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not surprised there's not a Venetia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which is actually the problem Chevy has with their Bolt and Volt.  It's the same.  It sounds the same.  Sounds the same.  B, as in Bravo, E-N-E-C-I-A for Benesia.  You got it.
