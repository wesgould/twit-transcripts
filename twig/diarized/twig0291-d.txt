Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good to see a little tiny spot here. This is big enough for one chair sitting up against a filing cabinet with my microphone here  Trying to act like this is normal

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can do it from any crappy corner

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly where I am you see behind me this where they store the sodas for parties  in your office now the hall had to move all of the  cabinets away from the opposite walls to cut they cut like a foot and a half in the bottom of  Numbers and numbers of walls around here to then go up and dry it out. God knows what they did. There was a snow emergency  It snowed  It froze it froze in the hell froze

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You had it was frozen pipes. Is that  Who's that? Wait a minute. What? Wait a minute. What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait a minute. What am I am I dreaming deja vu? Am I dreaming? Did I lose my mind? It's Gina Trapani  Asia Gina am I back in 2014?  How's everything going to think up

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you. Yeah, yeah, we actually just launched a new insight last week  It's a big up lets you know now when you're when your friends have changed their avatars  So you get to admire high-res beautiful pictures of your friends when they change up their avatar. So that's been really fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I asked you this before  Is this?  Ruby on right? What is it? What is the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a good question. Yeah. Well, you know think of startup startup office an open source project  So one of our requirements was like hey somebody should be able to run this on the simplest cheapest  You know hosting package so it's it's PHP so it's a lamp stack. It's a lamp  It's a it's it's old school lamp stack. They ain't nothing new or fancy going on here much to my  Chagrin, but it's old technology that works. So, you know, it feels very  Modern I guess that's the design right? It's the design right, right? Yeah, but the back end is just is straight PHP

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which you know, you know what? It's easy to do. It's easy to maintain  I'm all I'm all about the node JS and I know you're like fancy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right, that's right the way do it if I was building what you were building you choose your technology on what you're building  That that is the right choice. I'm very proud to say that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The great team that's doing this at four kitchens has already contributed some of the code back to the Drupal core  So we're not good. Maybe it is core. But yeah, so  Because we're using an open source CMS Drupal  As the back end for the API to serve the API actually everything where you all this stuff  We're using is still open source nodes open source, right?  so  But yeah, they did something cool. I guess I don't understand it, but they said hey, yeah, we contributed back. So that's nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's awesome. That's a good feeling. It's a great great feeling. Yeah, it's an open source software to be able to contribute back to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's great. Anyway, Gina said when Gina

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't feel so bad. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right when Gina left us she said very kindly she'd come back once a month  I mean, she's got to focus on her startup and we understand that but it's really nice to have you you were not all about  Android last night

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that was a lot of fun. It's great to be here. You couldn't be completely rid of me. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why I'm by the way chat room said did Jason think I was talking about him when I said but that's why I always  Say Jason. Yeah, it always throws me off  Just to make sure that you understand the distinction. I like to think that I'm that important to the website using Jason

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've never been busier than I am right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There is a lot of Google News this week  but I think we're gonna start with the one that Jeff Jarvis is so most excited about which is  The new this happened minutes before the show began the new pixels here  Oh, oh, I should say by the way if you're I gotta explain this there's a and this only matters if you're watching live  We flip-flopped Windows Weekly and twig this today because of travel schedules Jeff. You're going to Madrid  right tonight and  and then Paul was just coming back from  Colorado so it worked out great. Everybody was happy but if you're tuning in  That'll be after this week in Google this week only  Yes, anyway new pixel is here  Apparently it's been ceded to people because tech crunch has a review the verge has a review Wall Street Journal has a review  It's up on the rundown to they like it. I would have given one to Jeff Jarvis. Google. I really would yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just let me let me review it for God's sake  Yeah, I'm the only your only friend in pick and crime in pixel land

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it an action look that this comes out like like a couple of months before?  Google I oh, I mean are they gonna get they're gonna give everyone they do that again. Well, I don't know what

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They don't seem to repeat themselves on the things they give out. They seem to be very different every year  So you've got a cardboard wondering. Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It looks exactly the same right? I mean, it doesn't look any different from the pretty much exactly the same. Yeah. Yeah, but  It's got newer processors. I presume these are the broad world screen comparison. Does anybody know it's the same I think  Same screen same screen. It's 3 2 still that weird aspect ratio  2560 by 1700 still touch so it's  Exactly the same in those specs. The color gamut is wider  That just means that she could show more colors it's got a different color space it is  Cheaper 999 for the i5 version and then they have an LS  Which does not stand for a luxury style. It stands for damn or luxury sedan  It stands for look literally Google says ludicrous speed. It's an i7  And I can't think of any reason you'd need an i7  For a Chrome OS, but  Remember this is these are mostly used what do they say like 85% used in by Googlers? Yeah. Yeah  So obviously this is what Googlers wanted  they said I want more speed more tabs to 8 gigs on the base model of RAM 16 gigs on the  LS version but 999 for the base model 1299 for the LS. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Video said 12 hours of battery life. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Within 15 minutes you get two hours of charge value. Yeah, that's the connector

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the biggest thing and this is the second device we've seen now there have been others  I think there's a there's an ASUS out there with type C connector  But the Mac book that was announced on Tuesday was the first I'd seen with a type C charger  This is good news. I would love to see a mass move  From laptop makers to the type C port for charging because then we could use one charger for everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's Apple what's that see yes, that's really so unprecedented that they finally used this I know enter

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's just for the one MacBook the new MacBook. Yeah, but that's gonna be the future type C, which is a USB 3 port  It's a standard 3 actually. It's a 3.1 port  will do  Not only power in and out by the way, you could charge your phone from it, but it will also do data  Just like a regular USB port and video  So that is your video port. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you can't charge and do video at the same time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no Jason go back and what's on the other side because I see two USB ports  Actually three with the type C and I see an SD card, but I don't see any other video ports. So yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's I'm seeing it what that appears to be a type C on both sides or two C's. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's better actually so you could do both right? Yeah, you could yeah, I love that  I think it's good to buy just for that. What if you can charge from either side?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Man, it's a night. The pixels just a nice computer. It's  Price drop is nice, but you know what get it down 800 and then talk to me like it just seems like  Computer but look at the Wall Street Journal headline, I don't think it's that far

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She doesn't buy retail

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For a laptop that only only surfs the web that's such a lie first of all

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't just I don't blame their the right. That's the head. That's a that's a headline writer. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like a thousand dollars is a is a place

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Phone what is where's the iPhone cost you it's a thousand dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is the iPhone of Chrome OS machines. This is this is the this is the  rain man of computers if you want a technology cost you a thousand dollars if you want to buy it go to  Store Google comm it's on sale now in and the newly redesigned Google Store  whoa  This is pretty huh? This is pretty  This is pretty right now in Nexus 6 Nexus 9 some Android wear watches  I thought the next player was gone. Isn't the next player dead yet Chromecast?  nest learning thermostat  And the Chromebook pixel alright, so let's see shop now. Can you buy it? Can you get it? Did you buy it?  Yeah, you can buy it. Yeah, I bought it any nine  So you really have one choices?  Why would you get an LS? I can't think of why my background is because I'm that important Leo. I deserve the best  Should I should I should I buy it? Oh?  Whoops, I slipped. Oh man  That happened to that just happened slipped  Pay for not sure I can hey review your purchase. Oh, I see it's still oh  Don't show that I'm not I'm not I'm off it right now  No chances should I ship it here?  Yeah, why not?  $1,081.42 with tax you're not gonna get ludicrous speed no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry I have to be the the voice in your ear  Pushing you to the next level

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's good that they named it that most clearly that's for the Goulars. That's what they'll give you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You are the god of the internet you deserve

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But really I do I do question the the but this is just to show you can make a beautiful machine

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this isn't oh, yeah, well they really did was just update  I mean they did what I've kind of wanted they want a longer battery life. They just updated the the innards

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's all they did one thing you didn't want or they didn't do one thing you did want. I'm really unhappy about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What no LTE?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  At all none maybe but didn't okay though, but this did this happen last time two years ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but I'm pretty sure they announced both at the same time  You did they did it was a long wait for the LTE it was and I waited for it and this time  I don't it was the LTE they gave out at IO  Yep  This time no, I was always unhappy that the LTE only worked with

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Verizon I've been making kind of a point of  Looking at all the Chromebooks as they come out and even the low-end Chromebooks now the new Samsung Chromebook 2  Acer there are a lot of really nice Chromebooks out there there are a lot less

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, we're talking 300 bucks not oh, yeah. Yeah, so this is this is kind of ludicrous and and  Maybe I should you know, but the problem is I bought I bought the who wasn't nothing  Has HD screen?  so the problem is the text was just an exit six I know no no no no the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Chromebook Oh a Chromebook. Yes. Yeah. Yeah  I there was a twin with a touchscreen 1080p touchscreen that was almost impossible to use

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a tiny tiny tiny type yeah, I could you know my whole eyes I can't do it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Chrome is somebody in the chat rooms Scotland's calling  No, I'm sorry Scott in Fort Collins  Chromebook is the answer to a problem that doesn't exist

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that is that fair I don't know don't listen to your clock I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Have been I have been saying reference that's an old  Collins and we still listen to  I  Have been saying for a while that the Chromebook really does make sense in certain environments in schools makes a lot of sense  Not not a thousand dollar one, but it makes a lot of sense for our students

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know the journalism students who need to do video editing that kind of stuff  No, but by social journalism students by entrepreneurial students. Yeah, they could use it and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and maybe  I a lot of users who call the radio show for instance. I say what do you do web?  Email web surfing that's what they do. Well, here's the other one sales more secure. It's it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't have I think a sale a sales force could use it. Yeah, right you go out you make presentations  You're on the cloud you're it's all you're doing and and you know, you'd be absolutely fine for that  And if you're a corporate IT, this is kind of a dream  Because you just don't have problems with viruses and Chromebooks support jump for the very young and the very old

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey  Just bought one come on knock it off I I'm supporting you  Yeah, I've completely come around since we first started talking about this and I remember getting in a little tussle with Sundar Pichai  And and he really was defending it. This was early on I said, I don't understand it and I stand corrected Sundar

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You were right. This is Googlers Googlers because we know there are a few of you out there watching if there's gonna be an LTE  Blink twice. Yeah. Well, yeah, you're something. Yeah do something for some old Jeff here  I've been a friend of the pixel blink blink

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's to tide you over I was fed by Jason

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anyway, that's exciting that we we we had you know reported the rumor actually wasn't really a rumor was confirmed by a Google executive  At a meeting and in fact there it is  The new the new pixels here the new pixels here the phone books in the phone books in  It's gonna be an expensive a couple of months for me. Hmm  Apple watch  $17,000 which one did you buy you didn't buy the $70,000 Apple watch you first of all you can't buy them till April 10th  But I will be buying one of them  Can you still run Linux I mean crouton is is still vital and around and alive  There's somebody in the chat room who's says he's he's a developer he uses a Chromebook all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uses Linux uses Linux editors the problem the problem unless they've changed this problem is you needed well at the time  You need a dev mode so it's flakier right and then you couldn't now you can reverse, but you couldn't reverse the time  Oh really once you went ahead you couldn't go back. That was a commitment  Yeah, so you could rebuild with it with a stick with a USB  You know an image right, but it was a real pain in the butt

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Chrome Linux is there what is your cities in the chat room right now? What is your suggestion?  For doing that is just is it still crouton. I guess you know it's a little tricky to install, but you did right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not that I even if I can do it. I went through a few bad detours  But I finally got there stick on my tongue out the whole time  But if you're if you're a Linux jockey, then you're gonna be able to do what I couldn't do he's his curb into

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He says crib onto is better than

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  chrome

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I don't know is does that work with the  The dual boot it's not really a dual boot. It's a it's because it's the same  kernel  You just you can start up, but you could you can the great thing is you can flip back and forth with a key  You don't have to boot right that's what's so amazing about it. Yeah  Making me want to do it again

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You showed me that I feel like we were in the backseat of the car on the way up to Petaluma on a  Trip yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See I've gotten you slathering over it a few times

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The nice thing that crib onto is it supports so the pixel is an Intel  x86 most of the other Chromebooks are arm aren't they or many of them some are Adam  There's a mix but to crib onto apparently requires Intel  I said it okay, so I will look into this because that sounds like what I want to do with my old  I'll do it with the old pixel  Yeah, yeah, right. Yeah, I'll do that  Crib into is also dual boot says Chrome Linux you repartition your drive  So that would be an argument to getting the ludicrous speed version just for the hard drive

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're any if you're a Googler, yeah, that's usually the Linux then that doesn't make sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you don't have that crouton is the one that lets you do the flip back and forth by pressing a key you cannot  Do that I thought there was a form that would allow you to run a Linux window on top of Chrome OS  That would be my ideal if I had a little bash shell on top of Chrome OS  Can you do that maybe not?  It sounds familiar. I thought crouton could do that now. Anyway, I will yeah, I don't it's been it's been a year and a half

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Since I ran it. Yeah, I'll have to do some research  the other problem was at the time I couldn't get Netflix on the machine because  Netflix wouldn't operate in dev mode because it wasn't secure to Netflix definition

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's that's the big story numero uno  not much more to say about it except  there I  Why I guess is the question does Google continue to make a thousand dollar Chromebook when no one else does

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's three times. I mean besides Googlers. Who's the who's the market for this and besides Googlers and Leo  and Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it was not really a market Leo buys everything I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Literally, I literally buy everything just because you want to review it and Leo Leo is the Mikey of technology  well since Google doesn't you know, like seed one to me three weeks earlier and and I wouldn't want them to because then I would feel  Obligated so I would have read by it. You would have done it. I know what I buy it anyway  I bought my last one. I buy this one. Yeah. I did not buy the last one. I should be clear. That was a Google I Oh gift

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, me too. Yeah me too. I my when my wife left her job in San Diego  She handed in her computer in her phone and I gave her the pixel and we got got got her a Nexus 5 and she's she's still  There. Yes, it's her main computer. She loves it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  Once I got the printer working that was the one thing once I got, you know cloud print set up  She's hasn't I expected her to you know, come to me and be like I need to do this and I can't do it here  She hasn't happened. It's been over a year  And sometimes I see her using her computer and I'm like, oh god, that's such a nice machine

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is really pretty isn't it's weird that it's three two. It's so strange to see a square screen in this day and age  So do you guys still use your Nexus sixes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm one plus one still. Yeah one plus one. I'm six

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  well  You're in luck because apparently this Google  wireless  Carrier that they're about to start an MVNO that is a the weirdest thing of all may only work with an Nexus six  Are we we still haven't got?  Confirmation or have we that they're gonna do this?  Wall Street Journal leaked it out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pachai teased it at Mobile World Congress  Yeah, but I don't know if we have exact confirmation of all of these details

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, he did say soon like the next few weeks  So we're still waiting for the other shoe to drop on that that could happen anytime now  But the rumor is first of all, it will be an MVNO mobile virtual network operator with using both  T-mobile and sprint and  Wi-Fi and will seamlessly hand off from one to the other  Depending on which connection is better and it will be much less expensive  I think that's the only reason that Google would want to do that is because the price would be so much better  But the Wall Street Journal also says it will only work on a Nexus six and that I don't know if that's a technical  Just start. That might just be to start

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They do say that it's not going to work on older Nexus devices  So if you have a Nexus five, it wouldn't work with it  I you know, I don't know if that's a technical issue or not because I had a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Republic wireless moto  I think was a moto G  I think was a moto G  I can't remember was a moto of some kind from a public wireless that did the handoff from a  Sprint to Wi-Fi and it did it seamlessly did it beautifully. I actually tried it when I reviewed it for before you buy I started a call  In the house actually what I did is I called my voicemail and started leaving a message in the house  Got in the car drove away and at no point was there any audible handoff and I just went from Wi-Fi to sprint

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Seamlessly and beautifully so there's a there's a piece I just put up on the rundown from Kevin Wehrbach  Who's from the Wharton Business School? Kevin's brilliant about the stuff. He worked with the FCC. He knows his stuff really well  He argued that that this is the uber of wireless. Yeah  That it just intermediates because because what it means is now anybody can provide wireless to the thing and back and forth

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's gonna go to the best women. No, that's not that's not what he meant

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I really want to retire this like uber for I know I heard you I heard you moan. I just I'm so tired of

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, but it'll be it'll be something else next month, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These this is the like uber for though has been around this has been sticky and persistent  Yeah, nothing against Kevin and I and I totally get what he's saying here. But yeah, he says he doesn't like it either

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He doesn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See also says that this is the one of the reasons they're gonna use the Nexus 6 is  I know I thank you Jason for highlighting. I hate the X of Y comparison writes word Bach  But I can't think of a better way to describe this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not saying I'm just saying I think it's a I think that's a fine thing to say  I just it's specifically the uber for  has been  Like uber for is like uber for weak metaphors, but okay  Analogies I guess I should say

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You are the uber for

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, let me say what he means by this and what he I think  Actually, it's Tim O'Reilly who created this  Metaphor but he said Riley said uber is an example of the Internet of Things cars become the network devices with phones as sensors  This is Tim classic Tim O'Reilly  Because he kind of he's able to kind of out of the box kind of think about this stuff and I think that's a very  interesting and apt way to put it  so the idea is  industry as a service  So  Eliminating kind of the friction the commerce friction  and just having  Having it be  Kind of you just press a button the bills paid, you know, it's all magical kind of I think this is great for Google  I think what Google wants to demonstrate is it's possible to have a good wireless carrier. I wish they had bought that 700 megahertz  Spectrum it was very expensive horizon got it  But it would have been great to see Google really go in all in on this  However, in this case, they're gonna be able to sit on top of existing networks get a much better deal  For some reason I never really understood  Sprint resells its wireless service for much less you can buy sprit get sprint from much less expensively  Than buying it from sprint directly actually think all the all the phone companies do this  so  And and this and and we're buck labels this as a trial and that's why it's Nexus 6 only I  Don't think there's a technical reason. That can't be anybody else

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry. I'll shut up you want it want it. Yep. I mean my phone won't support it  My current phone would support it, but I'm in I'd get the phone that supported it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, especially if it's a lot cheaper  There might be issues though because you it is sprint or t-mobile neither which has a great network

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd love it if they had one of the biggies in there. I wonder how they fill in each other's, you know lack of coverage

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, maybe that's the idea. Yeah, and well if it's if it's sprint  It can it fail back from

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  4g to 3g if the 3g is still so that's the other issue sprint is is a CDMA voice carrier  T-mobile's GSM so they must be using voice over LTE for sprint, which means it's probably all LTE all the time  But that's an issue too, that's an issue too because T-mobile does not have voice over LTE everywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the other big question is how they price it because  Well, it's gonna be unlimited data if it's unlimited data too, that's that that's the key it's got Google's got  So unlimited data don't they?  That could be the thing that makes me leave AT&T because the only reason I'm still on AT&T is when I wind about no  LTE on my Chromebook  Kevin Marks came in and said, you know, you cry baby. Why don't he didn't say that but I inferred it  Why don't you just tether and I said a cuz it's a pain in the butt to do that  My current Chromebook just goes online and b I'm still the grandfather AT&T plan. It doesn't allow tethering

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But shy said they are not competing on price though  So here's the other interesting thing this is not they're not the first company to think of this  Xfinity Comcast has for a while and it's been getting heat for it. Remember  Been taking if you're a customer you have their wi-fi access point been using some of some of it for  Wi-Fi access everywhere. So I  Everywhere in Petaluma pretty much now I have Wi-Fi because there's so many it's a Comcast neighbor  neighborhood and there's so many Comcast users with  Xfinity Wi-Fi access points that I get free Wi-Fi every everywhere I roam and  Actually, we're box speculates that maybe Google's thinking about doing a deal  To get access to that Wi-Fi then it would be cheap, right because you'd rarely be using minutes  Yep  And then maybe put some balloons up  And who knows loon would not be a good choice for this I think latency would make that an unappealing choice

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And actually probably somewhat related but the latest version of Android 5.1  Just pushed out a couple of days ago  And one of the features of that is for Android to recognize whether a Wi-Fi signal  Actually has internet access or not and if not to just bypass it all together  So it doesn't just connect to it and then you realize you can't get anything from it  So if you're hopping around all these Wi-Fi networks that actually makes a lot I'm gonna repeat because I'm that's all I do is repeat

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Myself, I'm gonna repeat my desire from last week  I want a standard that says I hereby agree to whatever stupid Wi-Fi rules you have  Just go ahead and connect me. Yes, I won't do anything bad on your network. I don't know how I would just connect me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just get me past the blah blah blah sign me in  You wouldn't connect to one of these networks that has the sign-in page where you have to agree and  Look cuz that that does not that is not internet access. That's an intranet access and Gina

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How often do you run across a network like that? I hardly ever see those networks  So there's got to be something else happen in here that we don't realize  But if you are a Comcast or a cable vision subscriber in my neck of the woods  Yes, you can go on because but you're already  authenticated as a customer  Unless is Google gonna do a deal with those with the cable companies. I can't see that happening is they're competing with them  I don't see that much open Wi-Fi in the world anymore. Remember those days of what we call it was fighting  What do we call it when you went drove driving or driving?  Drive  That was that quaint look look there's Wi-Fi here, isn't that cool? Yeah, you know  the phone books in the phone books in  Not anymore in fact

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not saying in the chat room that cable vision sells Wi-Fi only phones in your area. Yes, they do. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can't get a Wi-Fi only. I guess you know what that would work for your kid at school

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe no because the whole idea I guess cable vision is doing the same thing Comcast is doing  Which is using a little bit of your barring a cup of access from you so that anybody walking by can use your your

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Access points. Yeah, I also think I'm not sure that you know, I see it  I see these connections come up most often when I'm in commercial places. So I think they must put  Access points around on poles and things too. I don't know. I've been meaning to ask about that  Yeah, well because what I most often see it it's in commercial spaces  Yeah, not you know, I'm not in a residential neighborhood where I can be anywhere near somebody's Wi-Fi

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what I get about Xfinity Wireless. It is it's most strong in residential neighborhoods  I've been able to literally just walk through small neighborhoods and never leave Wi-Fi. It's amazing Wow. Yeah  That's  Apparently cable vision has deals with Xfinity as well. So if you  Who's the cable provider in Brooklyn? Is it also cable vision? It's high Warner. I'm Warner. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. You didn't say that with joy, Gina  Oh  Don't forget it's already spun off. Yeah. Oh they spun off HBO  It's off time Warner  From a well time Warner cable time Warner cable from time Warner  Oh, it's not part of time Warner as we knew it has spun off a well fused time Warner cable and  Time ink  Spun off so what you have left in time Warner movie studio HBO

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  CNN that kind of stuff. I think this is a really kind of it's kind of a guerrilla form of  Wireless accesses as these companies beef up their Wi-Fi everywhere  Apparently in Vancouver one of the chatters is telling us Shaw a big cable company  There is building out street level Wi-Fi throughout the entire region  So it's it's interesting that the ambition of these cable companies expands

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What what is the security implication of this maybe this is a little bit of an attention  But if I see Xfinity Wi-Fi in my Wi-Fi list  And it's gonna connect to it automatic like I would say no because I'm like well  I don't know who that belongs to I don't want my phone connecting to a random person's Wi-Fi  What is the security aspect of this when you're connecting to hundreds of Wi-Fi access points while you're roaming around town oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Who cares who cares all right? That's a good question. I don't know I didn't even think of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In order customers that set up the default and just left it open they did they didn't add a password on their route

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, no, it's not that at all. It's actually done by Comcast  Okay, so if you subscribe to Comcast and use and use their wireless access box the box they give you which I don't  It will automatically create this Xfinity Wi-Fi account  Nothing you're doing you can opt out of it, but you but it's opt-in. It's not opt-in. It's opt-out and  You're now, but it doesn't go against your bandwidth

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, so it's and it's completely firewall from yours. It's your stuff. They insist. It's firewall from your stuffs that makes sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it doesn't go against your bandwidth for charging  But what if everybody in the house is watching movies and somebody walks by watching a movie? That's a good question

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you only have so they I think they say we add more we give you more capability we  Bump you up. You don't know we don't give it to you. Yeah, we use it for us. Yeah, the router could certainly do that  And I do have to log in so in order for it to work  The first time I use it. I have to log into my Xfinity account  But you're right the phone doesn't really know if it's it could just be an open access spot I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mean what is there?  Is there anything stopping just random person from setting up setting up an Xfinity, you know naming it the same things that your phone  Recognizes it was like well I connect to these by default so I'm gonna do it and then something bad happens  Mm-hmm  Sorry to rain on the parade guess I'll be forgetting Xfinity Wi-Fi

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good question works nicely

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then somebody else is pointing out that phone or FON which was started many years ago has been doing this for some time  That was the plan phone was gonna or fawn was gonna create a mesh network of  Wi-Fi  and  You would get a fawn router and you would then get free access to global Wi-Fi in other locations  Apparently there are 14 million  access points all over the place  This is not well known in the US, but I think it is available in the US. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but I don't know but you got to be you know play the odds of being by you have to get a phonera

Transcript:  Have a budget, you know  You can tell it's a European country it's 49 comma zero zero dollars USD  For the gramophone or the phonera  Or you have phonera for business. Let's see more details  So it's a little a little doohickey  a  Classic fawn sharing features with is it fawn or fawn? It's spelled FON  It's probably phone isn't it but that's very confusing because it's a homophone  The new phonera is so small it fits in the palm of your hand  But don't let this tiny size for you for you is 802.11 compatible comes with WPA encryption and a powerful antenna  It looks powerful

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Huh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's not expensive it's $50 no no, I mean it's it's it's a Martin Vossowski  Started phone and it's a it's a cause

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, trying to get Wi-Fi everywhere. So he's not trying to make it make up money out of it. It's just well

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know do good well I live in the country so I can't really do much good with it  I guess we could put one in the window here. I  Never see any of these around so I think it's not widely used  That's neat though. If it were widely used, I think this would be great  Yeah, part of my pay is in gadgets. That's exactly  It's actually the reason I got into tech journalism in the first place  30 years ago as I stuff I just I want I couldn't afford to support my habit  So I had to find a way to a means to do that

We bought a mattress and we didn't like it  Too it was too firm  Fortunately, we love our Casper and here's how Casper gets around that showroom problem  You get the mattress you try the mattress for as long as a hundred days  Free delivery and painless returns within that hundred day period so you can literally sleep on it for three months and say yeah  No, it's not right for me and they'll take it back. They'll come get it and say thank you very much  We appreciate the opportunity to take that you gave us a shot  Not returning my Casper, but I've bought more Casper's  Casper's in our guest room Casper's in my son's dorm room. Well, he's in a house. So not a dorm but  He loves his Casper Casper mattresses combined latex on top and memory foam on the bottom  To give you just the right sink and bounce. They are so comfy  So comfy and yeah, they come in a box. That was a queen-size mattress  Easily easily fit through the door  Simple to do it. I just love it. That's one of the reasons we got it for my son  He's up three flights and I he couldn't had a big mattress upstairs. He wanted a king  Mattress has started five hundred dollars for a twin 950 for a king  That's a lot less than that showroom mattress, but it's a lot more comfortable. It breathes. It's cool. It feels great  They're made in the USA even Ozzy the Wonder Dog loves Casper. You will too. In fact, you'll save an additional 50 bucks  Because you're watching this show if you go to Casper casper  Dot-com slash twig twig  $50 off any mattress  This is an example of the this is the uber of mattresses  Example of how the Internet can revolution. Well, it's true. Oh  You have a Casper. I'll come home with you. Yes, exactly  Make new friends fast. Yes with Casper  It's not how we're selling it Jeff.

Transcript:  On the Apple watch when you you have a watch face, but you can add like weather and and it's called a complication

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is it's interesting funny. I mean as a joke

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's a heart. It might be a horological term. They're using a lot of watch terms in this thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting a complication. That's what I want. I want more complicated

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By the way, you can't get the Google Calendar for iOS right now because the app store has been down all day. Oh  Really all their services have been down up and down and it's been a mess and I haven't checked lately  But that the Apple has like Google does the status thing and it hasn't been indicating any problems. Maybe it is now  But yeah, they've been having all sorts of problems even the status is down  That's not a good sign. Well, let me see. Let's let's look Apple support system status. Yes. See all that green  Oh, well, no, the app stores down iTunes stores down Mac app stores down. So it does show  Store services all users are affected been going on since 6 this morning. Ah, that's a long time  Time and stores so I'm not sure what that's all about  whoo

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, good luck Apple engineers the app store comes back. You can get the Google Calendar on it  Good luck  Android 5.1 we talked about this at length actually last night  Yeah  Google announced Android 4 5.1  This is a minor update to point release to lollipop is rolling out to Nexus devices now  It's been posted to the Android open source project, which means that people who flash it'll be it's available to flashing parties everywhere  And the new features are pretty good multi SIM card support multi SIM card support  Device protection for loss of stolen devices now, of course Android had this before but this this is this is a new way to do it  It requires Google sign in so you lose your device you sign in to Google to unlock it  But it works even after someone has  reboot and factory reset the device  Which is pretty pretty cool. Yeah  And HD boys thugs you yeah, right like yeah, just try to wipe my phone. Just try and wipe it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Places where kill switches like that have been implemented show really good results, right?  even like I think I saw some Manhattan statistics for iPhones and it really drops the number of thefts and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's good. Yeah, it's good. That's good  And then HD voice calling for compatible devices and carrier  So I think you both would have to have a Nexus 6 on the right carriers in order to in order to enjoy  This HD voice calling but voice calling but it's there and then there's just a bunch of little just minor  Lots of lots of icons got animated. There's some volume settings updates  I mean, this was kind of just a you know polish and you know  Minor minor update that kind of think make the whole lollipop experience better  I of course had don't have lollipop in my one plus one yet  And no one on all that Android last night had gotten 5.1 yet over the air  So that but that should just check my six no

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let me run again my Nexus 7 while you keep talking and I'll okay Jason

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you did you have you seen it on your phone? No, I keep checking

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you know we already know really does not a whole a lot of good right as I said last night  I was tempted to flash it, but I knew once I did that  I would then be authorizing another  Device on my Google Play music all-access account and because Google's so limiting on that now  I didn't want to run up against the limit  So I decided not to do that because those authorizations are precious to me at the moment

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right and then  Finally Google releases released a standalone PDF viewer for folks who aren't using Google Drive  Yeah, it's released standalone to the Play Store that makes it easier to open PDF  So you probably got a few different options. I yeah, we tried to last night on the show  And it's like, you know quick office PDF viewer and then the drive viewer  But I think this is targeted toward Android for work folks  But it's open and available to everyone in the Play Store now. I just I you know, it's for years especially on Windows

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Especially on Windows  Viewing PDFs has meant downloading additional program in the case of Adobe reader program full of bugs and holes  It was such a blessing that Google Drive just we can read it now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it should be treated like a text file it should be a system utility a PDF at this point is such a ubiquitous format

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know Apple does it that way they offer, you know, they come with a program called preview preview, right?  Right, but Google had to do it for a Chrome OS  I think you know that that was a necessary and it's what a great feature. So let's see about tablet  This is my Nexus 7 which is currently running. I think 502  Gosh, don't you hate that? Let me check it. It's not you lie  My system is not up to date  So the Google change log  Yeah, it's not available in the 7 either  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's on its way the next time you see that little robots you'll know it's 5.1

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I should just show you but one more thing Leo has now written his first Android application  It's very stupid and simple because it's it's the app of better though  but I you know, I wanted a little a countdown timer for the radio show and  And  so app inventor made I took me, you know, the hardest thing was getting used to the idea of like I had  You know, I couldn't do a case statement. I had to do multiple if then else's things like that, you know  Yeah, real programmers will go. Oh, this is you know, you're fighting app inventor, but for a non programmer  It's great. You can actually make an APK you can give to people  I just download the APK put it on my Google Drive and I could put it on any Android device  It's a very stupid little simple thing. It just counts down how many seconds left  If we were on the radio show right now  I'd have you know  Like three minutes of talking left then when it gets down to two minutes it gets yellow when it gets to 30 seconds  It gets red when it gets to zero then it goes to the commercial. It's goes blue  It's very simple, but it's really handy and I used it this weekend  It's the ability so that's the app inventor from it was from Google's from MIT now  If you search for app inventor to it's very easy to write and create new  At new APKs that you can install on yours or anybody's you have to be able to install third-party APKs  But that's easy to do somebody's counting down the number of viewers. I hope not  Can you go the other way  And that is the Google change  So nice to have Gina here

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everything going well for you things are good things are good now that spring is starting to happen  I'm feeling a little bit more human and a little less like what did I do the reason for winter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's this you know, it's this you can't enjoy anything unless you know suffering. It's so you can enjoy spring

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've been trying I was discussing this at length with a friend like did like is spring better because we earned it  You know what I mean? Like yes, I think I think so. I think this is what I'm telling myself anyway. No absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely, absolutely  Spring is coming March comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what they say. Have you heard that before?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's take  Let's take a break lots more to talk about our show today brought to you by hip chat comm  This is I I'm on hip chat all the time on my Android device on my iPhone on my desktop. There's a web app for  You know Linux  I actually they may be a dedicated app for Linux. What is hip chat?  Well, it's designed for teams to keep them on the same page  It's like instant messenger  So you'll immediately be able to use it and understand what hip chat is but it adds video chat document sharing screen sharing  Code sharing it's really great for develop developers use a hip chat  We're using it with our development team in Austin that's doing the new website  And it's just it's it's like having a permanent record of everything that went on it's real-time so it's not asynchronous like  Email it's SSL  So it's fully encrypted it integrates with 57 other services that  developers like like github and Jira and Zendesk so  You're you're really very productive with hip chat  It's easy to set up fun to use and I'm telling you by the way fun is part of this  They have emojis and there's a little plug-in called linky that when you paste a link in it does a little preview of the  Page and the hip chat thing just look just little things like that make it make it really a pleasure to use  We liked it so much using it with four kitchens. We started to use it with our engineering team and our sales team  I just love it hip chat. So here's the deal. It's free  You know, there's a freemium version anyway that you can use free forever  But there's also a full version and you're gonna get that for the next 30 days if you go to hip chat comm slash twig  That includes additional features like video and screen sharing hip chat comm slash twig  No credit card needed just sign up click on start chatting and invite your team members  And you'll have it free for 30 days actually for the first hundred people who respond right now  You'll have it free for 90 days  So don't wait do it right now before the other guy gets to it three months free for you and your team of  the full hip chat at hip chat comm  slash twig hip chat comm  Slash twig. We're a hip chat house. I think I could say that now  I have at home my hip chats always running we scrum every day  We have the hip chat going. I feel so agile  It's kind of fun. You know, it's funny like a mountain goat. You're agile. I'm climbing the hill  Have you done like full-on agile development Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have not I have not I definitely have used you know parts of it. I'm a  Cafeteria agile practitioner, I guess you say like you're a cafeteria Catholic. I understand exactly exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think for most people that's the right way to go  But if you have a big complicated project with a lot of moving parts and a lot of moving people and this is a perfect  Example where you have a you have various stakeholders and you know, lots of different developers  There's a developer for Drupal. Actually, there's several there's developer for no JS  There's developers for the dust templates. There's a designer the only way to do that  I think is with some real structure and agile is very interesting very process heavy  But I found it to be really fun. We're having good  But it's it's really interesting and I think we're getting a much now that the product that the bridge is almost built  I feel like wow, this has really worked at first. It's like very process. I mean you go nothing's happening

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, like we're spending a bunch of time. Yeah deciding what how we're gonna do things. It's like designing programs, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know who nobody wants to spend time writing tests writing a design writing a spec you want to get in there and code  That's true. It's the hard part is the front upfront work, but it makes a big difference. It's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you should write it. I hope you'll write up or do a show or you know, maybe on an inside tweet  I would love to hear about about your impressions because this is your first time full-on agile. Oh, yes  We did a little strumming with lullabot

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it was really like you say just a little here and there they may have been fully agile internally  But we weren't exposed to it this time. We're fully exposed to it, you know, it's really good. It's really interesting  I understand why?  It's a it's a way of managing complexity and you and software so complex you really need this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, especially when you're plugging together different things the way that you are. Oh my god. We're doing what we're doing. It's insane  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Bring you in a little bit and bring you into one of some of our meetings and show you we'll be doing a beta  So there's gonna be three phases of development  But we're gonna be doing a private beta soon and when we do that, we'll certainly invite you guys all the hosts  And and those of you in chat will probably be part of it as well  I want the the users to get a chance to bang on it a little bit  Great. Can't wait public. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But all the programmers understand that huh, do you feel pregnant? I feel like I'm in week 38

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like this such delicious agony when you're building something I'm in this space right now  We're like you're building something you're really excited about it. You know exactly what has to be done  It's not quite done yet. You can't wait to show people. Yeah  Yeah, and then and then there's the postpartum after it launches and all you have is a list of bugs

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So get ready for that really looks pretty though. Oh, and I know we're gonna have but you know, I think  In a way though this process this agile process does make the bug squat  You're really squashing as you go I think mm-hmm. It's a very good way to do it. I don't know. We'll see  We shall see the new Android where street art pack is out  Thank you scooter X in the chat room. I don't even know what I'm gonna look

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just a bunch of

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Funky watch faces. Exactly street art and this is from Google education of all people is it? Yeah, I didn't realize that yeah  So this is so one of the nice things about anywhere and I think now all the attention shifting to Apple's watch  It's gonna be interesting to see how Android responds, you know, we've heard some people say oh, they should make it compatible with iOS  But one of the one of the things the Apple watch does not offers third-party faces  You have to use Apple's faces and they're only half a dozen of course, of course  so third-party face space is huge in an  Android where but Google's also doing new faces all the time. So is Motorola  What is it is there more than one or is this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There there is I haven't played around with it too much I just showed the time I'll install it and we'll find out

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you have to install it as with all Android where faces on a phone first and  Then it come communicates at some point to the watch. So I'll stall it on my phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I will say the the flat tire of the motive 360 is not doing it any favors  You can only see the top half of the number six at the bottom. So how hard would it be to make Android wear work with iOS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Pebble works with both you won't have the full set of yeah, I know that somebody's got it working

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've seen at least a proof of concept. Would it be Apple could Apple get in the way of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess they could they could not approve Android wear right support maps  Yeah  Well, I'll be getting a watch to of course an Apple watch too, I'm not gonna get the gold one  Don't even think about it. That's for Kanye and the company

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So really quickly are you filled with desire for this watch? Well, I'm feeling about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm filled with desire for everything. I just I'm a walking bag of desire  Okay  Sack of techno lust a new garage door opener is happy. Yeah  No, but then I'm not happy for five minutes. Then it's like what's next? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The announcement were you excited about the announcement? Yeah, like, you know, this is something I can't wait  You're switching iOS and you're gonna go full tilt and just and and watch it up

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, we knew we knew everything about the watch already except price and availability  There was nothing new to say about the watch really pretty much  What we didn't know at all about was the new MacBook  And I'm actually really excited about that. It's two pounds  It's only about twice as thick as a an iPhone. I mean, it's really it's like half an inch thick  Type C connector only

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not even just one just one that's really irritating

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, their claim is we're gonna you're gonna get nine hours battery life and Apple by the way  Unlike a lot of people including I think Google is when they say nine hours  You really will get nine hours a lot of times companies say nine hours and you get five and a half or six  Because they say well your mileage may vary but but Apple really tries hard to give you accurate numbers  So the idea is you know, I don't know how how many hours a day do you think you use your Chromebook?  Me yeah without being plugged in  Without being plugged in. Yeah  Not nine hours to yeah  So the idea is you've got that type C connector for all the other times that you're not charging and  Then when you and then you'll do I think the theory is you'll do with your MacBook what you do with your phone  And your watch now you just plug it all in at night wake up the next morning and you get all days left

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm very in type C USB extender

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Situation they have a $79, of course  Connector you plug into it that gives you a standard USB that gives you a power type C connector  And get and gives you video a HD a full HDMI video out

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if I wanted to do this if I bought that machine, which I'm not going to I wanted to do this show. Oh  God

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's see if you got the connector you because you need the camera right and you need power  Well, you could do it. Yeah, and you  USB you need a USB hub because you'd need  You need a hobby and I couldn't do these one for the mic and one for the camera and I couldn't do a monitor, right?  There is by the there are by the way, there's an Asus that's very similar came out six months ago  Almost as thin 2.6 pounds not quite as light has all the ports  But there's a problem. You have to use Windows and I'm in us

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so this is what happens to the air brand isn't this smaller than an error?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is and it makes the air brand kind of confusing because this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is a MacBook period it's not  Just the MacBook, oh, that's interesting I'm thinking

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm thinking  That what they'll do is eventually phase out the air. They're gonna keep it out  Oh, they need to have MacBooks that have all the connectors and everything  But I'm thinking if what you want is thin and light. This is what you want  Does the post will have a?  Drive. Oh, yeah pro has well there is one optical drive. There is one Mac with an optical drive. It's not a pro  It's just a weird one. Okay. I don't know how long that will last  so  It's I like I don't know I like thin and light  But then I also like Chromebooks. I'm kind of crazy  Let's see  So the CFO of cool. He's only been there six years you think though in six years you can make enough money  You'll never have to work again  Patrick Pichette  Google's chief financial officer apparently very well liked he's the guy's been handling the analyst calls since Larry pages voice problems  is leaving and he wrote a quite a I  Think Larry Page said interesting  Goodbye letter it starts pretty traditionally after nearly seven years as a CFO  I'll be retiring from Google to spend more time with my family  They says yeah, I know you've heard that line before  so he talks about climbing Mount Kilimanjaro with his wife tomorrow and  They enjoy the view and their kids have grown and out of the house and tomorrow out of the blue says hey  Why don't we just keep on going?  let's explore Africa then go to India then the Great Barrier Reef then Antarctica and  He says I remember telling tomorrow typical prudent CFO type response. I would love to keep going, but we have to go back  It's not time yet. So she says  Great question tomorrow reminds me a little bit of House of Cards  Claire Underwood saying to Francis so when is it gonna be time our time my time  In this case Pichette said yeah, okay. I quit so he's gonna phase out slowly  He's gonna he says I want to wait until we find a googly replacement  he literally used that word a googly a new googly CFO and  Help him or her through an orderly transition, which will take some time and then I'm off  He's 52  But obviously made enough money in seven years of willing to good for him. Yeah right on it makes me want to quit

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When is it my time man this man all the stuff about his kid is just killing me. I know you're reading it. Yeah  Because you're there right now, you know, yeah, yeah, we're in the thick of the Cheerio encrusted minivan  We are we're in the thick of it we are in the thick of it, you know  And it's so funny because I hear people with older kids, you know talk about with such nostalgia and like, you know  Yeah, baby was up with an ear infection all night  Like I was exactly I mean and of course like I love her and you know, and she depends on me  But it's it's a weird thing, you know  When you look back at that at that young time and think of it so I would do it again in a heartbeat  It feels like such a grind right now. That's what everyone says. Yeah, they need you in a way that they don't ever need you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't mean to go all like no, I'm with you. In fact, Jeff and I both I'm sure have that experience of if we could go back  Maybe not the first two years  Diapers if we go back and talk when they can talk when they once there's three or four  You're just entering the best time you're just getting out of the worst time Gina. Yeah, but but I would go back to that a heartbeat  But I think also Jeff  There's a sure humans have a short memory for pain. Yes. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, this is why women have second children

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, you would never have another child otherwise  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but wow, yeah, this is this is quite a this is quite a letter

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Isn't what isn't it what all the grown-ups tell you though Gina's? Oh enjoy this Gina. You're never it's so it's the best time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is that's what everyone says and I and I and I tried to but it's it's hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's hard. I didn't feel that way when I was in the middle of it either. It's like hey, can I get out of here?  When do I get to go to work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's yeah, there are some days when it's like if we could just if I could just make it till bedtime  And do they sleep then maybe we could watch an episode of house of cards and I'll fall asleep in the middle of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. Okay. No spoilers  finish season 3  Yeah, have you finished it Jeff? I haven't started right kind of started but but getting some bad reviews. It's very different  Yeah, that's almost say  Have you watched any of it Gina? Yeah, we're we're a few in for maybe four in it's a little different, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not so much in a good way  Francis is kind of a wimp  Well, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think this is a spoiler. If you don't like spoilers, put your fingers in your ear  I don't think this is spoiler, but in the last episode  He yells and he loses his accent and I can't figure it out if that's cuz Kevin spacey can't talk like this when he's yelling  Or if they're telegraphing something that we're gonna learn about in season 4, it's very strange  Give me a hand sign. Is it over yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what he said was

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm actually very curious what you'll say about it Jeff when the time comes. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Should have downloaded it on my nexus 7 so I could watch that on the plane. Oh, yeah  Watch that on the plane. Oh do it now. I already paid no one else really can't you can't download it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, it's so weird about house of cars and I can't figure this out  Is that some of the there are definitely some high-profile product placements for Windows phones in it  Like very high profile, but there's also iPhones and Macs and it's a very strange thing they didn't get an exclusive on it. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually think they do a nice job. I like the way they just they display text message conversations  Oh, it is Windows phones. Okay, so it's funny. So I thought oh they just picked a generic style for you know  No, it's Windows. Okay, so clearly Microsoft gave them some money

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But not enough money for an exclusive I guess that's the bottom line  Yeah, there's Windows phone sounds in it. There's clear shots of screens  Interesting  Yeah, I was a little disappointed I confess not not not horribly so but just different it's different it's different  I'm gonna have to defer to Gina on this we wouldn't even have this story in the rundown if you weren't here Gina  Microsoft and Google collaborate on angular to framework typescript language  What does that mean what is angular to  So it's a web JavaScript framework

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  JavaScript framework. Yeah, pretty pretty popular pretty well-known  I think some at some point somebody threw an angular t-shirt at me at a Google I owe at some point. I'm looking at it  It looks great. Yeah, listen the more collaboration. I agree. That's better. That's great. You know, Microsoft makes a makes a browser  Google makes a browser. I think I think collaboration is a good thing. I don't like it  Is Microsoft's kind of well, it's not a framework. It's a extension of JavaScript

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which I presume compiles into a JavaScript angular to will be written in typescript and  I  Presume at some point compile into plain old JavaScript. Yeah, that's interesting. That's gonna be written in typescript

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I have I have friends who work in the Microsoft stack. Absolutely love typescript. Okay, so but then there's Dart

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But then there's Dart  It's so confusing so many frameworks out there it's it's really yeah, what is a framework is it it's not a language

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's it's written in a language  It's basically it's libraries that you can use to do to do very common actions without having to write all the code yourself. Mm-hmm  And then different frameworks have different taking different approaches and are better in different situations  But yeah, I guess that's that's the simplest way to explain it right right Ruby on rails is a framework

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mm-hmm. That's written. Oh is a Python framework. It's Python framework. Yep. This is a JavaScript framework. Okay  JavaScript is it probably a great language to know I mean it seems like so much is done in JavaScript

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely absolutely it's it's crazy well  So now JavaScript especially things like node run server side as well as client side  So it's really JavaScript and and and Jason has really come the language of the web, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google has launched we'd heard rumors that they were gonna launch an insurance  Agency. In fact, what it looks like is Google compare for auto insurance  So this is from a search engine land  They with the tool which I guess is an app or is it a web it must is it an app or a website  It's an app Google delivers 14. This is where you don't want to use it 14 sponsored listings  from insurers with rate quote information  Then you can buy policies online and by calling an agent from your phone. Is it just auto insurance or that's what it says right now  Now it's only in California. So that may be why  You'd you could probably see it, but it wouldn't be any good to you  The program is gonna roll out to more states. The reason is insurance is regulated state by state

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you have to go through the regulators in each I should have this in the changelog. It looks like it's a web app  Yeah, it's Google.com slash compare slash auto insurance

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they've we've been this has been rumored for a long time Google at one of a Google employee got an insurance license  There's been a lot of evidence that this was about to happen  Google will act as a lead generator more than just to add  Facilitator and pricing will be based on a cost per acquisition. So they get a cut in other words

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so  Does Google have to go to the insurance business because self-driving cars had better be self-insured

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's a business. It's a profit center. That's what I'm saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Preparatory to autonomous vehicle if I don't drive the car why insure me insure that which drives the car and  That which is libel, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What what are you insuring then the computer

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you're insuring the software seriously, right if there's a bug of the software that kills somebody  Am I liable because I'm sitting in the car that means yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Yeah, it was stupid  It was it was one of the first Android wear apps I ever installed and I was like, oh, this is very useful and it's terrible  It's just like reminding you that it's not working the way it should work, you know

Transcript:  So what happened? Seriously? What happened? No one's talking

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's an interview here with Matthew Ingram actually haven't read through it somebody in the chat room

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We and we got to get Matthew Matthew Ingram and Kevin Toth will both regulars on our show  great writers Stacy Higginbottom  Jenko Rutgers  All had left the site a year ago because he wanted to become a venture capitalist  I think he was you know, still part of the company. In fact, he tweeted  Yesterday or the day before when the news came out I just left gig home for the last time and you know, my heart is breaking  Home has not I don't think given any interviews  Were there any indications  Are there any indications this is gonna happen before Monday? No, you were just totally blindsided  Yeah, I think the majority of staff were as well  We were writing right up to the announcement Kevin Toth will posted an Apple Watch announcement  Minutes before the news came out. We did get a new CEO recently  So I think people thought maybe there needed to be some changes maybe some strategic changes  But there was little literally no talk of even layoffs

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think when I looked at the about page as I was I couldn't find the CEO on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what happened a  Gig a home which is a great tech blog one that we read religiously and many of its contributors were  regulars on this show and other twitch shows  Had taken I think eight million dollars in venture funding over the last couple of years. No, that was just last year  I think total of last year 23 last year. I think so. Yeah, holy I think you're right eight million last year  But weirdly enough they say the on their clothes they put a closing announcement on this on the page saying this is it  We're shutting the doors and they said the the creditors own us now. We're done  So it's not a bankruptcy exactly it's not right  It's just good we're going on giga home recently became unable to pay its creditors in full at this time as a result  The company is working with its creditors that have the rights to all of the company's assets as their collateral all operations have ceased  We do not know at this time what the lenders intend to do with the assets or if there will be any future

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Operations and that was lenders of course, we were senior twenty two point three million and six rounds

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Go through twenty two point three million and they had ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, is this bad last last eight million the last eight million February 2014 from read else severe ventures  Aloy ventures true ventures and shave ventures. Wow  Didn't have a lot of ads. They have some ads true and alloy. We're in for a lot of that's a Google ad

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  These are all Google ads  What is this? What does this portend for the future of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See everybody's don't want this already let me do a story on that  We don't know enough to know anything right Danny Sullivan wrote a good piece about how you know being the being the tortoise is a  better way to go  Is once you you're the same way  You know, I think that's one lesson in a media company unless you have an entirely new model. We have no crimes so

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And no other owners and no other owners  So the in order for us to go out of business people would just have to stop watching and advertisers would have to stop buying ads  Both of which could happen at any time, but it wouldn't be a sudden thing. It would be a slow slow degradation  So something this sudden is is kind of odd. I don't I can't it's very odd

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why I think speculating is pretty meaningless  I mean it's fine to contrast and look, you know, Danny's always pieces a good one saying here's how I'm running this right  Rafa Ali doesn't believe in taking too much venture money. I think he's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it doesn't mean that  For well for instance and somebody in the chat room said it said it I  Don't who cares. There's a hundred other blogs. I don't people no longer go to a blog and read the stories  They get links from Twitter or other sources

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well the difference here is that the giga-ohm was making money not just by being a tech blog  But it had its high-end reports it had events. It was trying to move past just a volume base

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's how tech crunch made made made its money was it said oh, we're gonna do we're gonna do conferences  There's a lot more money in conferences than there is in being a tech blog

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah, you're still dependent upon advertisers sponsors for it, but it's it's you're not dependent upon a  Commodifying business of impressions the mass business model is dying. What's unknown now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're big strut big data conference structure is coming up in a week

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't even know who the lenders are

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, so who so when these creditors they're not talking about their invest

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're not their venture capitalist no because your lent your lenders are senior to that  Okay in a bankruptcy. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In a bankruptcy. Yeah, so that could be rent

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That could be servers. It just could be lines of credit, too  You got eight million dollars venture last year and you have and you can't pay your creditors  Yeah, I mean I don't want to speculate

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean this could just be straight-up mismanagement. I mean I hate to say this because we love you  And we love all men we love all the writers there and we love their work and we've talked about it here, right?  But it's possible. This isn't like a sign of what's coming in the future  It's possible. This is just straight-up mismanagement

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By the way, so there's no conclusion to be drawn  It's not it doesn't mean that tech blogs aren't gonna be lucrative or you're not not even lucrative so self-supporting or not necessarily

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would love to hear and I and who knows

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know if we get me if you go to the about page  business team  No, CEO there all vice presidents and executive editors there. We have one CEO disappeared sort of I don't that's what I'm that's what?  So strikes me as odd here  He took the money and ran no  board  The board was read Elsevier true alloy  And shea ventures. Yeah, so with the board was for ventures and the founder

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, what's really sad is there a lot of people that we love out of work all of a sudden without preparation and  We if I could hire them I would but I don't want to I don't want to bankrupt my company either and  So on the editor on the editorial side, it's Igne Brewster is Carson Barb Darrow Carmel Di Amicius  Katie Fahrenheit backer. We've had many of these people on Kevin Frichard Derek Harris Stacey Higginbottom Matthew Ingram. We love you Matthew  There's a long list of Yanco records Kevin Tuffles just on last week. I think oh, I so well Borski Paul

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well Borski who was CEO he stepped down in September 2014 and they had interim CEO brought in

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's not on the on the no business listing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, this is this is not something to extrapolate

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, good. We know what let's hope let's hope not and ohm hasn't spoken  No one's spoken really except Matthew with this one interview with the Columbia Journalism review

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ohm just said to Kara Swisher not now, dude, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Kara of course reached out and said what really was said was some of the other tech blogs piling on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's mean this is a lot, you know what I've seen this happen with other closures  You know the very same one thing  I think when Stacey was out on Twitter immediately just singing the praises of every single staffer and why you should hire them  Yes, which is a generous thing to do. Yes. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, these are all very talented folks who I I don't think are gonna have trouble finding their next thing  But certainly we should all help them wreck on their work and we will and we do yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One reason this is so strange giga ohm seemed like it was doing so well  What should the takeaway be for other media outlets? CGR asks  Matthew Ingram everyone has their own favorite lesson Matthew says Danny Sullivan at search engine land  Talked about what this says about taking venture capital money when you're a media company and that's part of the story  Giga ohm has been VC financed from the beginning other media startups were not and when you take venture capital  They're golden handcuffs in a way. It's a Faustian bargain  You make certain promises about your growth if that growth doesn't materialize then VCs lose interest  But they didn't say it was the VCs that pulled the plug no no means it would they ran out of money and obviously the VCs chose

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not to pour more in and at twenty two point three million. I get that. Yeah, they ran out of runway  But the issue here was they ran out of runway. Yeah  And so was where they had a burn rate of eight million

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is a couple of million I mean it but well they but they went through eight million dollars in the last year

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they but but they went through eight million dollars in the last year  That's a lot and they had revenue on top of that that means their their burn rate was higher than that at ten million

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, whatever. Yeah, that's a lot. It's a lot. Oh, we don't know what their debts were before that  I mean and the fact that that you know that Matthew was totally blindsided that they didn't they didn't do any cutbacks or austerity manager  You know, I mean generally you see this coming right? I it's that's why it sounds like just kind of mismanagement  if somebody messed up who handles the money  but it's sad and  You know  Before I was a business owner. I would have maybe rolled my eyes and said oh, you know  They took VC and they made about now as a business owner  It's like I really has like feel the hurt I could really can feel you know what it's like. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Matthew says there are 22 people on the editorial staff. So it's a you could you could easily have a  Multi-million dollar burn rate for that alone. What's your total staff Leo 20? Yeah  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But we don't know what their business well with their business side and events side and sales side  I don't know what their total total was right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would imagine it was north of 30 and I did post on his blog, but it was mostly it wasn't what happened  It was just sad. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. Well, there we go. Well, that's a Debbie Downer
