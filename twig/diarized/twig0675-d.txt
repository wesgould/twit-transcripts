Transcript:  Now that Davos is no longer on the agenda,  we can pretty much count on him.  He's the Leonard Towne Professor for Journalistic Innovation at...  Craig, Craig, Craig Newmark.  Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York  and always in a major key. Hello, Jeff.  Welcome back to Fine Fetal, boss.  I am in actually Petaluma now, but Fine Fetal was very nice.  Thank you. Was I not here last week?  Yeah, you were in your isolation room.  Oh, I was in my booth, my sample booth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And a fog apparently, since you don't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am still in a fog, I might add.  Lisa is also in a fog.  COVID doesn't go away after the symptoms are gone.  There's little lingering...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is that why you never delivered the coffee machine to me?  Did I promise you that while I was gone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's Amp Pruitt,  Amp Pruitt,  twit.tv slash H-O-P.  If I could fit it in your Christmas stocking, I will.  Let's just put it that way.  Got you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ant Pruitt, the man who never says please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whoa! That was a good effect.  I don't know what happened there.  And then I got punted.  We kicked him, kicked him out.  All right. All right.  We, Stacey and I are here.  We were hoping to have another third person,  but there was a scheduled snafu.  So it's just the three of us.  I hope you don't mind, gentlemen.  It just gives us more chance to talk.  Adam Mosseri of Instagram.  Or just poked a bear.  Poke the bear, baby.  Who's the bear? Jeff?  Arrrrr!  Weirdly enough, and I don't know if it's related,  Nick Clegg of Meta  and Adam Mosseri of Meta's Instagram  are both moving back to the UK.  Actually, Adam's not from the UK.  Nick Clegg at least is.  Mosseri, of course, is the head of Instagram,  aka TikTok Lite.  TikTok wannabe.  TikTok wannabe.  I love the Vanity Fair headline.  Mark Zuckerberg and Adam Mosseri  just need you all to stop being big babies.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Just knock it off!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In recent addresses to both Meta employees and Instagram users,  the executives got uncharacteristically unapologetic  asking everybody to get with the program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's like, remember when News Feed was introduced  and people got mad about it,  and Zuckerberg said basically, tough!  Other things that he didn't change too fast,  he apologized for and shifted.  There was a whole ad thing he got rid of and all kinds of stuff.  But News Feed, people gave him a lot of crap for it,  and he just said...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In hindsight, he was right.  He was right.  News Feed was a huge success for Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was the essence of Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Mosseri, who used to be a Facebook guy and was then...  He was in charge of News Feed, in fact.  That's right.  Facebook, right.  So maybe he learned the foot of the master.  He was put in charge of Instagram when Kevin Systrom and company,  the founders left, kind of left in a huff, I think,  saying, well, we don't like where you're going with this.  You may remember from last week that Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian  didn't like what Instagram was turning into,  which is essentially a video.  The issues that matter.  Yeah.  The people that matter.  Well, hey, between them, they have how many?  60 million followers.  They're huge.  Yeah.  They clearly matter.  Yeah.  Mosseri said, well, maybe they don't matter.  He did admit it's not good yet.  But he, I think, was dodging it because he was actually talking about  this A-B version of Instagram they were testing.  It's always their excuse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're just testing.  Only a few people have seen it.  You're all overreacting.  It's not ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think even those of us who are using the plain vanilla Instagram  really notice that Instagram is favoring videos, right?  All videos are now reels.  And it's all very obviously because of the success of TikTok.  And Instagram is looking more and more like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Ant Pruitt is not happy about it.  And that had an impact.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not happy about it and it impacted.  Okay, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So meanwhile, Mosseri, besides saying it's not good.  I don't have a problem with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mosseri says, I need to be honest.  I do believe that more and more of Instagram is going to become video  over time.  So we're, like when a nurse says, how are we doing?  So we're going to have to lean into that shift.  Which Vanity Fair says, that's tech exec talk for you.  So I'm going to keep doing me.  Sorry to you.  It's actually so toxic.  You're even mad at me right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The thing is all of the videos that are being served up to me from the  algorithm are from people that I don't follow.  That's my big problem.  And it does look a lot like the content that's on TikTok.  And it's a ton of them.  So maybe it is a trend that they're seeing.  So they're figuring, all right, let's just lean into it.  Not that I particularly care for it.  But if they're seeing the data that more people are recording and trying to  post similar TikTok like stuff, why not just go ahead and leverage it, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There was an interesting discussion today on Twitter with Siva Varianathan and  Dana Boyd got into it.  Others got into it.  I'm trying to find it.  Where Siva said, I think it was Siva started it, saying that social networks  aren't social anymore.  That's gone.  And the interesting thing was that it's not.  I disagree to an extent because everybody uses these things for different reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, didn't we read that article last week that said social is over.  It's the end of social.  That was what we talked about last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your social is now your private text messages that you have in your group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Discord has become your real social.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  I think that's the business model of these companies is to have people create  media and content and to try to get large audiences on their own.  But I don't think that's how everybody uses them.  Some people just talk to their family or their friends.  I watched my sister, the Reverend Jarvis, talk to people on Facebook.  She's not trying to find an audience of millions.  She's talking to her former parishioners.  And, you know, that's what she does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I mean, it's of course, their absolute right to do whatever they want with the platform.  What happens is that people like you and me and who like still photos are kind of cast  aside in favor of the tick tock of vacation of Instagram.  And you're right.  I see that is what's funny to me is I see a lot of the people I see on tick tock.  I see them now.  In fact, sometimes even exactly the same video like this salt Hank guy on Instagram.  It's like from for many creators.  I mean, and I'll blame them.  Creators shouldn't care at all.  They just put it wherever people will watch it.  So I understand where the traction is.  Even YouTube now is really promoting shorts.  Oh, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and making it so it's easy to turn a video you already have into a short.  Right.  Is one of the stories.  So what Seva said, I misquoted a little bit.  He said he'd never accepted tick tock as social media.  He's not sure why others have.  It's full of you, CG.  It's creators, creators, creators.  And so he says that by mimicking tick tock, meta is giving up on social.  I disagree to this extent about about about tick tock.  It is the one platform that does enable collaboration, and that is a social act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not a social graph, but there's another piece that makes it social that most people don't see.  But my son has explained this to me.  The comments are super important.  Somebody said that.  And and he gets all of his feedback and tunes all of his videos very successfully.  So he's over two million followers to what he reads from the comments.  And so are there nasty comments, too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or is it is it?  He's surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He expected more because he's seen my life.  And he was actually very surprised that there were far fewer than he expected.  He gets a few every, you know, of course, but much better than, say, YouTube comments.  Which are kind of notoriously awful.  The tick tock comments are very positive.  A lot of it is young women offering to marry him.  I wouldn't because, hey, you cook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think what a catch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think who knew if I had only known if I should have highlighted the cooking, I might have done, you know, well, actually, fine.  But, you know, that's what I think.  It's interesting. Yeah.  But he says that's very important.  And that is absolutely social.  And also he I'm not sure all tick tockers do this.  In fact, a lot of tick tockers don't.  But he interacts very much with his comments.  He's always responding to them.  Furthermore, and it's not just it's not just the sharing this collaboration.  So he's very aware of other cooks.  He's a cook on tick tock, other cooks on tick tock and does collabs.  It's kind of more like YouTube.  So it's it's it's social.  But see, then that's social with creators only.  So maybe that's not fully social.  But for I would say for Henry, tick tock is absolutely a social platform.  And he's using Instagram much the same way.  Although now that I think about it, his Instagram account used to be much more his personal Instagram account.  Now it's the salt Hank.  It's the marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can I can I make a little can I be so bold as to make a suggestion to the young man?  Yeah, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do it all the time, but it doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It doesn't matter because I was going to go just as I usually do to tick tock and look for salt.  Hank can get mad that they don't show me often enough.  But instead, I just Googled him and I go to Hank's kitchen, which, of course, is where he sells the salt.  But there's no links there to his social that I can find.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what Hank's kitchen is.  I don't think that's him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, Hank's not kitchen.  It's his salt.  Go look, Bob.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dad.  No, his salt is salt Hank dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, if you go to Hank's dot kitchen, really got a redirect, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that kitchen.  OK, good for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's good.  He's got another.  Oh, yeah, that's him.  Yeah, he has.  He doesn't.  He used to have a link.  Oh, there it is.  You just you're so old.  You can't see the little tiny tick tock.  God, you're down in the bathroom.  You really are a boomer, aren't you?  I am.  Oh, man.  I have, by the way, man, you've got to be nice to us old people.  As with all dads, I am, you know, I go over and I can't even help myself.  I go over and say, well, Henry, you know, you're really.  And it's and then I catch myself doing it.  It's like, come on, knock it off.  I come from a different generation, even though podcasting seems to me be modern and new.  It's not anymore.  And he knows what he's doing.  He really I mean, I can't.  Oh, he does.  He clearly knows what he's doing.  So I can't I can't advise him.  But I was a little hurt because Lisa met somebody in town who says, oh, I love Hank's cooking.  She says, what do you mean?  She says, oh, whenever he cooks something, he brings it over.  Oh, he has not once.  We're in the same town.  Not once has he brought any of his food over.  He promised when he heard I had covid, he said, oh, I'll bring you some pozole.  Didn't happen.  But apparently, hey, he's bringing it to other people.  He's feeding other people.  Was it a young woman he was feeding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you got it.  Very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, well, Leo, I know I'm an old guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You were talking about it not being as social anymore.  It made me think a few minutes ago about the concerns I had with my family, with them being youngsters and access to social media and how dangerous it could be.  What does that mean now with the platforms like Instagram?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think isn't it less dangerous if, like, for instance, Discord?  And didn't you say you have a family discord like that?  They all got a slack or slack.  That's right. Slack.  So that's not as dangerous, is it?  Because it's only invited people can participate.  All the invites. Yeah.  So you can post pictures of the kids.  You don't have to worry about somebody who's macking on them or.  But at the same time, they're there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have half a brain to know how I can just start my own instance of slack and sure something and just lie about my age if I have to.  Sure.  So I wonder if there's still anything like if there's anything like that happening and if we're in danger of having some type of scary stories coming out of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ant, have you ever heard of something called a Finsta?  I'm just joking. I'm just teasing.  Yeah, I mean, of course, kids know better than we do, Ant, about how to manipulate all this stuff.  I told you I've told this story before.  My daughter, who's now 30, was on Neopets many like two decades ago when she was little.  That was a big social network.  You created Neopets, right?  And she learned about web design and all sorts of stuff from it.  And I said, but you got to I did the dad thing.  I got to be careful to make sure, you know, you don't tell people at school you go to.  Says, Dad, I'm a 33 year old guy from Chicago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They know.  Go ahead, Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're way ahead of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is Dana Boyd's point about this.  Dana Boyd is long with this.  People think that they're revealing everything and they don't care about privacy.  No, they have their systems for privacy that are very simple.  They have systems for privacy that are very sophisticated.  Not everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'm sure there's some kids who really do need some oversight and some, some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, and then right.  And then there's this then there's hard hit Jacob who who come who comes to me fairly regularly because he's wanting to be in fashion in the future.  So he's constantly posting, you know, fashion type content.  And it's pretty easy for the bots to spot him.  And so he'll he'll come into come into the office and say, hey, is this is this OK?  You know, these people want to offer me ABCD.  And at one point, I knew it was a fake thing, but I just wanted to do it.  Use it as a teachable moment and say, hey, let's just go ahead and follow through and just let you see what's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good.  And I never have I never have the sense to do that.  You know, like the the the patience, I think is the word I'm looking for to do that.  That's a smart thing.  All right.  Let him let him try.  Let him learn and under supervision, but let him learn.  I think that's smart.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We did it together.  You know, but he was able to clearly see the process because I mapped it out.  I said, they're probably going to say this.  They're probably going to do that and they probably want you to do.  Oh, yeah.  And sure enough, check, check, check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Close family friend I found out yesterday got a text message saying from Texas saying, you know, this payment that hasn't cleared.  You need to call us.  And she called and she.  Oh, no.  She had to freeze all her account.  She fell for it.  Oh, no.  I felt terrible.  Dang.  Yeah.  Close family friend.  And I said, you should have called me.  But she didn't know.  She I mean, this is the problem.  This stuff is it is a little dangerous out there.  I think it's more dangerous for people our age, Jeff, than it's for the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, there's a famous there's a famous one.  I think we might have talked about years and years ago when when son Jake was, I guess, about 19.  My parents phone rings with somebody saying, I'm your grandson and I'm in trouble.  I ever fall as they won't let me out.  Right.  And my father was ready to go to.  Yeah.  Very worried.  But, you know, didn't call him pop pop, which is what we call them.  And these things just didn't click as as as as plain on the emotions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, nowadays, oh, yeah.  The scammers are out in force.  You've probably seen this.  There are more now text scams and phone number scams than ever before.  In fact, I think we have one of those as a story, which is the wrong number scam.  See that. OK, so this is interesting.  You've probably started getting messages.  I have many on my phone.  I can probably just pull one up to say something like, hey, Una, I'm not going to be able to make it in this afternoon.  I hope you can get my shift covered.  Sorry about the short notice.  And you as a nice being a good citizen, say, oh, I feel bad for her employer or for Una.  I better text him back and and say, oh, no, you've got the you've got the wrong number.  And the FCC has just started warning about this.  These are scams.  2022 is on track to be the first year where more people have reported scammers contacting them by text than by phone.  The FCC says nobody answers their phones anymore.  And text work.  The FCC says, and they say this is good news, 90 percent of consumers do not fall for these scam texts.  The bad news is that means 10 percent do.  That's a that's a lot.  That's a lot. This story from NBC News.  Odd text from a wrong number is probably a scam.  This is the text message that Kevin Collier got it.  Una, good evening.  Tomorrow morning, the contract time of 10 a.m. is shifted to 3 p.m. for signing.  I don't feel well. I need to go to the hospital tomorrow morning to see the doctor.  And of course, Kevin, a hospital.  Oh, throw that in.  Yeah. Kevin, being a good citizen, said, oh, sorry, it's the wrong number.  The other the person on the other end, Anna, struck up a conversation.  Here's actually the text of it.  I'm not Una, but I'm sorry to hear that.  So the texter, the scammer, says, I am so apology.  Should have been your tip right there.  I dialed the wrong number to send the wrong SMS.  I hope I did not disturb you. Not a problem. Hope you feel better.  Thank you for your concern. I feel much better after taking the medicine.  You are a caring person.  What is your name? And that's the hook. It's Roger.  What is yours? Hi, Roger. My name is Anna.  I'm from Taiwan. I live in Manhattan. Nice to meet you.  Nice to meet you. What do you do for work? I'm in real estate.  I work as a fashion consultant for three fashion design companies.  And in my spare time, work, learn about crypto currencies with my uncle.  And there's the hook.  And he said it took a few minutes before she started to sell him investments in crypto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's absolutely brilliant, though. You've got to give him that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's a lot of work. Geez, you've got to string that along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, can I make an appointment for my dog at your salon?  You might be tempted to say, oh, no, you got the wrong number.  And just don't, which is fine, but don't get involved because they will draw you in.  I get these all the time. Usually they're not working that hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't? I'm surprised. I don't. I get other junk.  You know, like a lot of expletive products and stuff like that.  Oh, just try. They're right up front.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a bunch of them just say, hello, or here's one from a 601 area code.  What are you doing?  You know, that's it.  And I guess if you were lonely, especially an older person, lonely older person, you might respond to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, but you know, it's funny. I get messages like that on Instagram.  Direct messages here. Yeah, here's one just come in yesterday.  My name is Lisa from L.A. and a senior account manager in Bitcoin mining.  Have you heard of Bitcoin before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, at least she's honest. Have you ever heard of Bitcoin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At least she's honest.  I get a lot of those. A lot of those.  Not in my SMS, but that's why I tell people don't DM me on social because DMs on social for me is just a flat out mess.  I'll never see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm pretty good. I get the simple, you know, Angela X4371006 and a certain busty picture that just says hi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I get a lot of those too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On my web interface. I don't even get that. I just get hi.  So on my web interface, I report it because I want to be a good citizen to Twitter to try to report it on the mobile interface.  Oh my God. They want you to hire lawyers and start a trial. It's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm impressed that you reported. Honestly, in fact, I get this call a lot on the radio show.  Somebody asked me this weekend, should I report this?  And I said, there's no point. That phone number will never be used again. You can't block that phone number.  That phone number is not real. Reporting it does nothing.  I do a DM.  Yeah, I guess on Twitter, because you're going to get the account taken down.  But text messages. Those are always spoofed.  The CHIPS Act has cleared Congress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Too bad Stacey's not here for this one.  We need a little dance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'd be happy about that. 52 billion dollars.  Now Biden has to sign it still, but everyone is assured that he will.  52 billion dollars to US companies to build their semiconductor fab plants in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And how long will that take?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know, because you know, Intel, as an example, has been holding off groundbreaking for their 20 billion dollar fab until this bill is law.  They were hoping for the subsidies and they're not going to break ground until they do. That's in Arizona.  TSMC, the Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturing company, is also opening fabs in the US.  They may not be pleased by some of the features of the CHIPS Act.  One of the features is you cannot, if you take this money, invest in fabs in Asia.  Which, if you're the Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company, probably is a non-starter.  I don't know, what do you think? We talked about this over the weekend.  We had Shoshanna Weissman on, you know her. She was on this show a few months ago. She's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You've stolen her for big tape more often than we've had her on the show.  No, she's been on once on each show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that was just once.  Fair, still. One of you will win.  No, we love Shoshanna. Partly I like her because she's conservative.  And so it's nice to get a, you know, we're all sort of a pro business.  We've got the moderate with Ant and the leftist, you know, Commie with Jeff.  But I think it's nice to have some. And she does work for the R Street pack.  And she said, and I don't disagree with her, that while this makes sense kind of on the face of it,  when government pours billions of dollars into an industry, it's like putting your thumb on the scale.  It kind of changes the economics of the industry.  And, you know, maybe we do need to do this to keep competitive because China is certainly doing it for its chip manufacturers.  But on the other hand, you know, you look at the subsidies and so many other businesses, especially farming and agriculture,  and you can see how it really does kind of shift the scales of economics.  So I know I think it's a good idea.  Bernie Sanders criticized it for serving as a blank check for semiconductor companies that are already profitable.  He might have said that before Intel's quarterly earnings last week.  They announced they'd lost nearly half a billion dollars in the quarter.  So a profitable not so much this year anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the strategic issues. That's where I think it's important is that versus China, we are too dependent on their manufacturing.  I agree. I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. It also country has us on a stranglehold.  I mean, we couldn't even get cars for the most part. Right.  You know, as big as a car is and all of those moving parts, but that one chip is this totally shut it down.  Yep. My uncle works for the dealership as a mechanic, just like my just like his dad, my grandfather.  And, you know, for the last year and a half, his whole story, every time I talked to him, it's like, well, there's no cars on the lot because we just can't get them.  And when they do get them, it's just a handful of cars that a dad gum big car dealership.  And it's bizarre to see something like that.  Everything is just a used car. And even that is overvalued now because they're here and they're available and they're a hot commodity because people need vehicles.  But a new car can't seem to find those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The bill gives the Commerce Department ten billion dollars for states and localities to build out regional technology hubs, mini Silicon Valley's.  I don't again. It's not a lot of money as the budget, the U.S. budget goes.  But is it going to is it is that can you do that?  Can you just say let's spend a couple hundred million dollars and create the next Raleigh-Durham Triangle here in beautiful Paducah, Kentucky?  I don't know if you can do that. I don't know if it works that way.  They also and I would agree with this gave the National Science Foundation billions in additional funding for semiconductor manufacturing research and workforce development programs.  And that, I think, is probably well spent. But anyway, big, big bill got through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And and since I'm the House liberal, you know, stuff is happening from the Biden administration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. The U.S.  Is going to stop TSMC and Intel from adding advanced chip fabs in China, however, as I mentioned.  And that's interesting because I guess I guess when you give somebody billions of dollars, you could probably say, I was going to say, is the government basically saying, hey, not on our dime?  Yeah, well, no, no, that no, that's not the question.  The money that they give them will have to be used in the U.S.  But TSMC, for instance, if they take that money, I think they did, won't be able to substantially upgrade or expand its existing facilities at all.  Oh, is this thing? OK. Yeah.  Which means I mean that I think that that means they have to turn the money down because that is a you know, that they're the number one chip maker for Apple's iPhones, for instance.  Anyway, we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess I guess you could put it differently.  You could say we're going to give you money and we don't want this to go to China.  Well, I think that's a given.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like this money is going to be to build a plant in the U.S.  Fine. But they go farther farther and say, and by the way, if you take this money, you can't spend any of your money to do anything in China.  And I don't know because it's fungible in a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess I can tell either Intel needs this plant or not.  Right. Now, that's a good point.  Right. And so they're waiting to get the money before they like like, OK, so let's say the bill doesn't pass.  What Intel you're not going to build a chip plant plant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really? That's a good point.  It doesn't really matter.  Actually, speaking of this Huawei, we talked a lot of this on Sunday as well.  As you remember, this has kind of been going on since 2018, the Commerce Department at first, then Congress and eventually the Trump administration said Huawei networking gear should not be used in any facilities in the U.S.  And other countries have said the same thing.  There was some kind of a weird story in CNN this week.  A CNN exclusive that on the face of it, if you read the headlines, kind of confirms what the Commerce Department and the Trump administration has said about Huawei.  CNN exclusive FBI investigation determined Chinese made Huawei equipment could disrupt U.S. nuclear arsenal communications.  That sounds pretty bad, except the word could is maybe more important in there than anything else.  A lot of work that word.  They're really they're really pushing the could because it in fact is more like, well, it's very near these these equipment being put in very near nuclear installations.  See, look, here's a picture of a missile silo and a cell tower just a third of a mile away.  But. We cannot confirm or deny ongoing investigations.  We are committed to securing information and communications technology services supply chain, the Commerce Department spokesman said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I understand. Are we are we is the is the the the missile run like IOT over a cell phone line?  It seems to me that, yeah, you're probably not using that cell tower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if you know, personnel in the missile silo should probably not be using consumer grade cell phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Stacey's gone this week consulting for the DOD and missile play system ring doorbells.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so this is a lot of smoke with very little fire.  At the end of the CNN article, they do have this graph.  Graph critics see xenophobic overreach despite its tough talk.  The U.S. government's refusal to provide evidence to back up its claims that Huawei poses a risk to national security has led some critics to accuse it of xenophobic overreach.  I guess you could say, and I understand this, that, well, the spy agencies aren't going to tell you what they know, because that would be giving away their sources and methods.  On the other hand, you've got to give us something or it's just, well, we think they could be, you know, problematic.  Huawei says Huawei says all of our products imported to the U.S. have been tested and certified by the FCC before being deployed there.  Our equipment only operates in the spectrum allocated by the FCC for commercial use.  It cannot access spectrum allocated to the DOD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So finger to the wind, because you just said we don't know anything, so we can't actually speculate.  But hey, that's what we do on the show, is speculate. So I'm going to ask you to speculate.  What's your feeling about Huawei? Is this all a political puppet show or are they in fact risky?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good question. We don't know, do we?  There's no question that in the Trump administration, a lot of it was just anti-China, right?  Yeah.  It's Chinese, so don't use it.  And it was really about supporting American companies making the same equipment.  But which is not to say, though, that, you know, this equipment could be dangerous.  One of the problems is the FCC, which we thought had allocated billions of dollars to pay back companies who were replacing Huawei equipment,  didn't actually allocate that money.  So there are a lot of in the CNN story, they talk about a telecom, I can find it, that has a lot of Huawei equipment.  Let's see, it's a big, it's a long article.  So the FCC, in 2020, Congress approved 1.9 billion to remove Chinese-made Huawei and ZTE cell technology across wide swaths of rural America.  But two years later, none of that equipment has been removed and rural telecom companies are still waiting for federal reimbursement money.  The FCC received applications to remove some 24,000 pieces of Chinese-made communications equipment,  but it's more than three billion dollars short of the money it needs to reimburse eligible companies.  So where is this guy?  He's put this, there's this small telecom of V-I-A-E-R-O, Viero, Viero started, they had a contract beginning in 2011 with Huawei to provide upgrades for its 3G tower.  A decade later, Huawei Tech is installed across its entire fleet of towers, Viero towers, roughly 1,000 over five western states.  So in response to the Commerce Department, Viero is pulling it out, but they said, but we're not going to get, Viero CEO Frank DiRico said it never occurred to him that cameras could be a security risk.  The cameras, by the way, some of them, there's a lot of misosilos in the area we cover.  There's some military presence. I was never told to remove the equipment or make any changes.  These cameras are basically for monitoring I-25 traffic and weather together and advance tornado warnings.  But they were also inadvertently capturing the movement of U.S. military equipment and personnel.  So there's some concern that China could be actually tapping into these cameras and seeing this.  So DiRico, being a good American, has decided to rip them all out at great cost.  And he's not going to get reimbursed.  So FCC ordered telecom companies who receive federal subsidies to provide cell services, companies like Viero, must rip and replace their Huawei and ZTE equipment.  DiRico said the cost of ripping and replacing is astronomical and that he doesn't expect the reimbursement money to be enough to pay for the change.  He's expecting to receive half the funding he's actually due, but he's going to remove it anyway.  It's difficult. That's a lot of money, but he's a patriot.  And so he's going to do it anyway.  It's not going to be easy, said DiRico. I'm going to be up nights worrying about it, but we'll do what we're told to do.  But you know what? These cameras are public cameras on the Internet showing traffic.  I'm sure the Chinese also have very good satellites covering the same area.  Yeah.  This guy, I feel bad for this guy. It's unclear. He wants to do the right thing. It's going to cost him a lot of money.  Anyway, interesting story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm no fan of China these days for matters of politics and human rights and freedom of expression and all that.  I'm reading a book now which I'm disagreeing with a lot, but I think you might find very interesting. Have you heard of this one?  Four Internets.  Four Internets. Kieran O'Hara and Wendy Hall. I read their paper and quoted it in the Gutenberg book and then they came out with a full book on it.  This was the SplinterNet paper, right?  Yeah, basically. The four Internets are, there's actually five.  The one Internet is the Silicon Valley full freedoms openness.  Then there's what they call the Washington, only because the Supreme Court said this, but they're leaving it as the American business Internet where it all becomes corporate.  The European bourgeois Internet where can't we all get along? Can't we just behave, please?  Then the Chinese, they say paternalistic Internet, which I think has been very...  Generous.  ...territable to Chinese.  Then the fifth is the Russian, let's screw everything up just for the sake of screwing it up Internet.  I think that their taxonomy kind of falls apart in places, but it's still a really interesting analysis. I give them this.  Get into the Chinese part, the fact that they call paternalistic and some people, you do hear people here say, maybe we need to be more like China and control things. No!  But there starts to be that belief is we need to do something, we must control this Internet. Maybe the Chinese are onto something, which scares me to death.  The other part of it is the business side of it, of course, which is no American company can go into China.  Everybody, including Rupert Murdoch, who's tried, the New York Times have failed, and Google, and Facebook couldn't get in.  And so the thumb, the fist on the scale that China government puts on is amazing.  And then if you misspeak like Jack Ma, you're in the Shea Woods shed for a long time.  So it's not an Internet that I want, but interesting to analyze it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's only really a problem, to be honest, for companies that want to be across all those Internets like Google.  It's challenging for Apple, Google, Microsoft, Metta, because they want to operate in all these jurisdictions.  That becomes a problem for us. Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because then you end up with the lowest common denominator of freedom and the highest common denominator of regulation.  Only in those companies, though. I mean, we still have our own Internet, don't we?  No. If you're in Europe and they're demanding you do all this stuff, you just say, oh, screw it.  It's easier if I do it for the whole world.  And then if you want to be in China, that's not really possible now, but that would happen, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Apple does that. Apple kowtows to China because they want to be in that market. It's a big market for them.  Kowtow is probably not the most appropriate word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, it's exactly the right word.  I know it is.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's exactly the right word, I think. It's exactly what they're doing.  Is it now considered racist to say Kowtow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. My antennae go, yeah, I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look it up. I don't know. This is the old bow, the head to the floor bow, excessively subservient.  Kneel and touch the ground with a forehead.  That's hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is.  Ant could do it. I'm sure Ant could do it.  Ant could do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have my days where I can. Not many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  According to Wikipedia, a kowtow is the act of deep respect shown by prostration, kneeling and bowing so low as to have one's head touch the ground.  In sinospheric culture, the kowtow is the highest sign of reverence.  I don't think it exists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, how kowtowing acquired negative connotation in English.  Language matters by Lisa Lin.  Let's see here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're dueling Googles here.  I don't know.  I take Google off.  I think it's a good use of that word.  Mind your language how words are weaponized.  I did it consciously because it is an American company now kowtowing to the Chinese government.  I think it's a good word.  Bowing down to the school.  I think it's a good word.  Anyway, I defend my use of kowtow.  I only make $80,000 a day.  I know what she'd say so I'm not going to say.  I'm going to have trouble with her.  You're right.  You don't want lowest common denominator internet.  But at the same time, I don't think it's a bad thing to be regional and to have an internet in India that serves India as opposed to...  That's a really interesting question, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me put it back to you this way.  If you were Facebook starting today, but if you were starting something that wanted to be international, wouldn't it be better to...  Since Facebook started at Harvard and then went out to universities and went to the country, right?  If you were going to launch in that way, wouldn't it be better to say I'm going to run a different Facebook in Germany than I run in Indonesia?  And Malaysia than I run in the US?  Is it possible to have a worldwide service or that was a mistake?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think that's who complains mostly about this.  Splinternet is the companies who cannot then do business across all those borders.  I have a podcast network that is basically American centric.  We have listeners all over the world.  Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who I've met all over the world, by the way.  I've been in Munich and Australia where people come up to me on the street saying, oh, Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I don't have aspirations.  In fact, people ask me, we should do a Spanish language version of Twit for South America.  And I said, well, good, you do that. That's a great thing.  You really should do that.  I don't need to do that.  I'm not trying to be a global international podcast network.  I just want to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's hard enough being an American.  You're not ESPN, is what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's pretty much what ESPN does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think it's a bad thing for companies to operate in a sphere of influence and not say, well, we want to be everywhere.  It's a hard thing to do.  I feel bad for companies like Google that are trying to appease Russia.  They gave up on China, which is I admire them for.  Yes, same here.  Apple won't do that.  It's just too big for their business.  Apple did give up on Russia.  Too much money.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Too much money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Too much money.  Anyway, let's take a break.  Come back with more.  It's a small panel today.  Nobody just scold me.  Or to help us understand chips.  Stacey, I hope we'll be back next week.  Jeff Jarvis is here and Ant Pruitt and our show today brought to you by a real podcast.  IRL in real life, right?  An original podcast from the great folks at Mozilla.  I'm a big Mozilla fan.  I love the Mozilla Corporation.  IRL is a show for people who build AI, people who develop tech policies or just people like you and me who want to understand AI a little bit better.  Bridget Todd does a great job hosting it.  This season of IRL looks at AI in real life.  Who can AI help?  Who can harm?  Conversation is fascinating, I might add.  Conversations with people who are working to build more trustworthy artificial intelligence.  As an example, there's a show about how our world is being mapped with AI.  The data missing from those maps is just as important, maybe even more so than the maps themselves.  You hear about all the people who are working to fill in those gaps and take control of the data.  There's another episode about gig workers who depend on apps for their livelihood.  Of course, they're pushing back these days against algorithms that control how much they get paid.  That's really a story right from today's headlines.  Those gig workers seeking new ways to gain power over data.  For political junkies, there's an episode about the role AI plays when it comes to the spread of disinformation around elections.  Big concern these days.  Another episode explains the role AI plays when it comes to elections and the spread of misinformation and hate speech.  We talk about AI all the time.  This is a show that's very informed, very intelligent, that really talks about it in an issue by issue basis.  IRL in real life.  All you got to do is go to your favorite podcast player, wherever you get your podcasts, and search for IRL.  Or go to our show notes at twit.tv slash twig.  We'll have a link right there.  Thank you Mozilla for supporting this week in Google.  We're glad to support your podcast, IRLpodcast.org slash twit.  Yeah, I love Mozilla.  I use Firefox religiously.  I'm a Mozilla fan.  They are good people.  They're good for the internet.  Yeah, one of the reasons I really choose to use Firefox is because otherwise everything's Chrome.  Or WebKit, I guess, if you're an Apple person.  But Chrome is becoming the...  And as you know, monoculture is bad for every living thing, including the internet.  So I like to support an open source tool like Mozilla that doesn't use the Chrome engine, the Chromium engine.  All right, Jeff, are you ready to pay $2 more for your Twitter blue?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.  So yes, Sunday we had a poll.  It's not.  All the panelists who said, no way we're going to pay five bucks instead of three bucks for Twitter blue.  Are you a Twitter blue guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sir, I was formerly a Twitter blue person.  You dropped it.  About a week and a half ago, my card expired and I just totally forgot about it.  And I got my new card just the other day, one day last week.  And I saw my notification about my Twitter blue subscription had failed.  So I was going to go back in and reactivate my said $3 subscription.  The reactivation was like, no, it's not going to be three bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's... you lost.  So we're grandfathered in for a little bit, right?  What's the deal?  A little bit, a few months.  Just a few months.  Eventually we're going to... I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I was like, no, it's not worth that.  I did enjoy using it because I enjoy top stories.  It seemed to get better for me with the stuff that was serving up.  And then I also enjoyed the undo option just in case I have a typo in there and want to fix the typo.  The whole ad-free stuff, I still think they need to work on that because if I wanted to see something from the LA Times,  I couldn't... I could never see it because I don't have an LA Times subscription  unless I was reading those terms incorrectly, far as what the Twitter Blue service included.  But anything that was like under LA Times or I don't know, some other publication that had a Washington Post,  I couldn't read any of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Washington Post is really inexpensive.  I buy the Times, I buy the Post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because I did try to have a Washington Post subscription at one time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so I'm a little angry because I loved Nuzzle,  Jonathan Abrams' really great tool for news people that took your Twitter feed  and then took the news stories out of it and just didn't have any tweets,  just the list of news stories and the people who tweeted about it.  So you could, I guess, read those tweets if you clicked.  And then it would show news from your friends of your friends and then news from people you don't know.  So I loved that.  Twitter bottom.  And now they've buried it behind that paywall.  So I don't know, is it worth five bucks a month?  Because I don't, yeah, like you, I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I also use it to back up on tweets, even though the UI is not great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You mean to change your tweet, to like change...  Yeah, change your tweet to say, oops, yeah, I have TRIPO.  So it's just... but that's just a... that's a discipline thing.  All you have to do is look at your tweet for a second or two before you...  No, I don't do that. I know.  But I don't do that.  So, all right, you use that.  There are those ad-free with Twitter blue links to some stories.  I don't find it enough stories to make it work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that working for you, that feature?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, let's see. Here's... let's see, I already pay for the Washington Post.  Because you see it's got that little banner right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That blue thing, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Provide it.  I pay for the Washington Post, so I...  Oh, here, the Rolling Stone.  But I would think that this article would be free anyway.  Is Rolling Stone behind a paywall? I don't...  Oh, yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, and see, that's why I also assumed that that little banner meant that  you're seeing it there in your feed without having an ad presented to you.  Oh, no.  That's what... I sort of assumed that's what they meant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I thought it meant you could go to the site and then if you click that link,  that site would be... but see, there's no difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no, and it's right... it's just the old scroll version.  Oh.  Is you see the... if you subscribe, you see it without an ad.  Oh, okay.  That's all it does. That's the scroll.  That's the scroll.  Okay, add free.  That's how he hailed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I find this useful. They did add that feature where it's not just people you follow,  but the people they follow, which I guess because I'm living in a bubble,  is exactly the same stories.  So maybe if I didn't live in a bubble, it wouldn't be that way.  I find that useful, but I don't know if it's five bucks a month useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, not for me.  Well, it depends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Listen, if Elon Musk owns it, no, no effing way, I'm not giving him a penny.  I'm not buying a Tesla. I'm not giving him five bucks.  But it's almost as if... you know, the reason I subscribe to the Washington Post  and the New York Times is to help support them.  I want to support them.  Yeah.  I want to support Twitter.  I respect that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't have a problem with three bucks. Not at all.  For some reason, that extra two bucks just grinds my gears, I guess.  I don't want to give them...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm right there with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want to do it, but I guess I... I don't know. I probably will.  I probably will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because you buy everything that you could possibly buy in the entire world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I buy... I support modern journalism, is what I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You bought 20 pictures of me, for God's sakes. You can afford to support Twitter.  Did you get any of that money?  Not a penny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what else I bought? I bought a Roku.  And you notice, if you have a Roku, that at the very bottom of the Roku remote control,  there are buttons that take you direct, in my case, to Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, and Voodoo.  And I figured this is probably the case. They pay for those buttons.  Do you want to know how much they pay for those buttons?  We know.  How much?  Because Roku has revealed it in their latest quarterly report.  It turns out, they really make more money from the buttons than almost anything else.  Yeah.  About a buck per customer.  So Disney+, in other words, plays a buck per Roku user to have that button there.  Which means, because there's four buttons, that's $4 for the remote.  63 million active accounts times four, that's $252 million a year because of these buttons.  What's funny is they change all the time.  So the reason I brought in my remote, do you have a Roku remote? Anybody have a Roku?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do. You said Disney+, on yours, and I'm thinking mine didn't say Disney+. It said like...  It changes.  Netflix, Hulu, and maybe Amazon.  It's whoever pays for it.  Yeah, I didn't know that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Leo, I have it in my office. I don't have it here.  Along with QCat, the other thing that I got was this tablet. It's about this big.  And all it was was brands and buttons and a wire.  You were supposed to plug this into your computer because no one was going to do with these HTTPS, slash, slash, colon, semicolon junk.  The real estate you want to own is to be on this thing.  Oh yeah.  The Wall Street button, the journal button there.  Oh yeah.  You hit it. It was only about 25 years too soon.  And wrong in all kinds of ways.  But yeah, on my TV remote, I have a Netflix button.  Yeah. So they pay for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In its most recently quarterly report, Roku was bemoaning the loss of button revenue.  Wow. That's an entry on the ledger.  The company said it had to adjust its forecasts because people haven't been buying as many Roku devices.  According to the company's CFO, the main reason a dip in player sales affects its forecasts from the verge, quote, would be a lower expectation of button revenues in certain deals where we've sold those deep link buttons on the remotes.  They are losing money this quarter because of loss of button revenue.  Isn't there some type of forecasting in place?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't there some type of forecasting in place when you look at the pandemic and people were staying home or so those that could afford it probably bought another television to maximize the screen and television experience.  Yeah, but then there's a recession.  There's a recession.  Then it's those people that just bought one probably not going to buy another TV for three to four years or so.  Are they not forecasting any of this stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure they are, but they either didn't get it right or they knew it was going to happen and it happened.  Right.  So,  Geez.  So anyway, according to this piece in the verge, and I should give credit to Mitchell Clark, the current buttons are Netflix.  I got that Disney Plus, and they've replaced my Hulu and Voodoo buttons with Apple TV Plus and Paramount Plus.  That's three, three out of four pluses.  Is what's on mine.  You got Voodoo on yours.  Yeah, I got Voodoo.  By the way, this is the pro remote that costs a dish you buy separately.  It costs more, but still got the four buttons on it.  Still got four dollars.  You buy remote without the buttons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But the buttons are actually useful, except for Voodoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I am never going to Voodoo.  That's for sure.  Mitchell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not sure he ever uses those buttons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mitchell says, I like to imagine that someone once received the worst remote ever, only featuring buttons for streaming services they never use like Sling, RDO, PlayStation View and Quibi.  Wow.  I'm glad mine doesn't have a Quibi button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  R.I.P.  That'd be a collector's item.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You do want a Quibi button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tell me in the chat room if you've got Roku to hand what your buttons are.  Because I know I got this maybe a year ago, so I'm sure they...  And probably I'm going to guess that whoever pays for these buttons only pays for a year.  And then the button opens up and somebody else can come along and buy the button.  But only if there's a new remote.  Right.  Right.  Yeah, if you have an eight year old...  So, HD Editor says Netflix, Amazon, RDO?  Really? You've got RDO on yours? And Hulu.  Reverb Mike says Netflix and Hulu buttons.  I don't think anybody has a Quibi button.  That would be so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they should have done those as LCDs, right? So they could change them from HQ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Retcon says Netflix, Hulu, which is I think still the power number.  Dominos for pizza and twit.tv. I think you've got a special one, Retcon.  Declare says Netflix, Hulu, Voodoo and Sling.  So these do change, don't they? Interesting.  By the way, Out of Sync is pointing out that the Chromecast with Google TV also has dedicated buttons.  Only two of them. And one of them is a YouTube button.  And this bugs me. Not YouTube TV, but YouTube.  But I think, Out of Sync, correct me if I'm wrong, I think you can reassign those buttons.  You can on the Roku. They are what they are.  Yeah, that's right. The Chromecast, one button is remappable, but not Netflix.  So you could do the YouTube button. You can change. That's right. I remember that.  Anyway, that's why Roku missed its second quarter estimates.  That and a bunch of other things. People aren't watching as much TV, etc.  Turns out Roku is not a hardware device. It's an advertising device.  Well, that's true of everything in life. Amazon now has more advertising revenue than the magazine industry has revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait a minute, say that again? Amazon has more advertising revenue than the magazine industry has total revenue.  It's bigger than the magazine industry.  It's amazing how the world has changed.  Best Buy, we've talked about this, the floor space is marketing space.  Right. That's true of all grocery stores, isn't it?  They make more money from product placement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Selling wires. Yeah.  Lena Kahn is kind of weighing in. You may remember she was made chairman of the federal...  Talking about a thumb on the scale.  Yeah, she was.  She's the new chair, relatively new, Biden appointee, chair of the Federal Trade Commission.  When Metta said we want to acquire within, which makes the very, very popular VR app supernatural, which competes, by the way, with Metta's own fitness app.  So it's acquiring a direct competitor.  But it's, I mean, let's face it, VR fitness apps are kind of a small, small business.  So Beat Saber is Metta's and supernatural is within's. Metta's trying to buy within.  Staff said, yeah, for the first time, they're going to buy within.  So they're going to buy within.  So they're going to buy within.  So they're going to buy within.  So they're going to buy within.  We're going to start seeing more and more of this from Lena Kahn, although I hear Tim Wu has left.  Oh.  So that's interesting. Tim Wu was also there, another Eddie Trust advocate.  What do we think? First of all, are you familiar with Supernatural and Beat Saber?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Do I look fit?  Ant looks fit and he's not familiar with them.  He does it on his own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My kid plays Beat Saber on his Oculus Quest 2. He loves it. It's a really fun game.  It's kind of like Guitar Hero or something. The sounds are coming at you and you have a saber and you get it.  It's really good exercise. Supernatural is cardio.  Yeah, it's cardio. Similar. You're jumping around. I think you're shooting stuff instead.  Admittedly, the FTC did nothing about Instagram. They did nothing about WhatsApp.  Maybe they're saying now's the time to slow meta down a little bit.  I can't imagine it's a very big business.  But if there are only two companies making these VR fitness apps and Meadow wants to own them both, should they be allowed to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Adam Kovacevich, who is the CEO of the Chamber of Progress, so libertarian, democrat kind of cross over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's been arguing against it. He said that it's not a vertical case arguing that it is going to lock up the whole VR stack.  It's a speculative horizontal case arguing that it could, that word again, monopolize a narrow VR dedicated fitness app market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I also saw, I think Benedict...  And by the way, I should point out there's nothing to stop some third party from coming along and saying, I'm going to make an even better VR fitness app.  It's a tiny market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's a punishment of meta. She just wanted to pounce on the first thing that she could.  It's not, I don't think it's good antitrust here at all.  Are you saying this is just publicity?  Well, no, no, no. I think it's politics. I think it's saying, see, I'm going after him. I'm tough. I'm going to get him. Look at me. I went after Mark Zuckerberg while he's down.  It's like the EU kicking Microsoft when they were down.  My fear of this, I don't care about about meta.  Yeah, they bought a lot of stuff and maybe we can argue about whether they should have bought Instagram or whether Instagram was too small at the time.  We've argued about that before on the show.  My fear is that if if for a thumb on the scale becomes too much, we turn into Europe where investors are going to be scared of investing in companies because there are fewer exits.  And and so it's it's a it's a non market interference on the exit market on the IPO and acquisition market.  And that's where I worry about the what the the innovation that's kept us going in this country over Europe.  Oh, you know, everybody in Europe's jealous. Why? Because we this country invests and they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They just don't have I remember talking about this with Loic and murdering the Web quite a bit.  They just don't have the robust infrastructure for VC cap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They don't know that they don't have the guts. They culturally don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He says he says and I think this is another angle on what you're saying, which is that failure is not celebrated in the same way in Europe.  It's a celebration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Precisely. It's fetishized in the U.S. Right.  But it's it's it's shunned in Europe.  You never want I've had this discussion with Germans constantly.  Oh, no, no, no. We never we never want to admit being wrong or failing in public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no. I know people are against Facebook going in and gobbling up different companies or what have you.  But what if what if other companies are that's that's their mission?  I think we've talked about that's what that's exactly what Jeff was saying is like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For a lot of companies. But I'm questioning.  See, maybe I'm being moralistic. A lot of companies.  The whole idea you found the company in order to get acquired.  That's their mission. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  YouTube wouldn't have existed if they had been wrong for coming in and saying here, we'll give you some of this this this money that you really, really wanted all this time.  Is Facebook in the wrong for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just well, that's not what the FTC is worried about.  They're worried about the Facebook monopolizing the tiny VR fitness market.  Yeah, I think I think Jeff's right.  It's a con saying, like, I got to get in. I got to get my foot in here somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm tough. It just sounds like grandstand into it.  That's true. But and maybe this is very old fashioned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll let you both yell at me for this.  I don't like the idea of businesses being founded in order to be bought.  Like that. I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It feels like I'll yell at him. You go ahead and agree with him first.  Then I'll yell at him. I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If I if I'm creating a product or widget or what have you, that is essentially my baby.  You know, their quotes. That's my baby.  And I want to see my baby grow up and flourish and just be the biggest, baddest widget on the planet.  But that's that's just how I think.  But I know that this I think is a generational thing or people are thinking, OK, well, let's come up with this little magical idea and just get ready for our payday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's where my problem is, is that they they start with the idea of we're going to sell it.  I mean, I look, if somebody came along and offered me fifty million dollars, I'd probably sell them to it.  I'm not against the idea of selling. But it's a good 45. Go ahead and try.  Let me know when it happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but because I got to save some for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I don't I don't I don't I feel funny for me to start a business with that as your intent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So let me give you let me give you two scenarios.  OK, where it makes sense. YouTube was in no possible way sustainable.  It could not last much longer than it did. Right.  It was a great idea about to be seen out of existence.  Yeah, everything. And they couldn't afford the bandwidth.  They couldn't afford anything. But it was visionary.  And they had to find a buyer to be able to live ways.  Ways is I depend upon ways immensely. It's great.  It was made on its own and Google left it independent working inside.  But I don't think it could have grown to the service that it is with its incredible data around the world of all of our driving and all of our streets and all of that.  If it hadn't had, again, Google come in and buy it.  So I think there is a position where you start something because if you tried to start ways within Google, you'd end up with Google Maps and it didn't do everything it was supposed to do.  You're better off starting some things outside.  And look how many people leave big companies to start it than only going back when they get bought because they have more freedom outside to do it.  But they know that they they have a long way to go to get sustainability and the path to sustainability independently.  Yeah, maybe you get richer, but you also end up with with awful boards of horrible VCs and a long time and it's a pain in the butt.  And sometimes you're better off inside the firm.  So I don't think it's always a cynical act.  It can be, which what you're saying is we'll come up with this thing and that's that.  But I do think there is a case for investment in startups that where purchase is an appropriate exit for the investors and founders.  And I worry about what happens to that path.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I wonder what's going on on the education side of things.  You know, what's what's being taught in schools?  Because this a whole different approach from, you know, up to years ago when I was in class and they tell they're telling you to be able to be proficient in this subject and that subject.  So you can go towards this career and that career and be able to provide for your family.  Or they now saying, OK, make sure you optimize your tick tock and get all of the hashtags.  And what is being said in class far as, you know, starting your own business?  Do you know? Is this something that's shifted?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're the ones with kids in school still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I, but I, well, they're telling, well, they're asking me stuff.  And I tell them, look, I want you to go to college, but I can't really push college on you because I think college is overpriced.  But yet at the same time, I enjoy the college experience and the stuff that you're going to learn as a human being.  But you don't learn it unless you go to business school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't learn entrepreneurship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you go to a journalism school and learn it because after all, I do head the town right center for entrepreneurial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It says it right here. Entrepreneurial.  But it says that the reason it says that is because most of the time it's not entrepreneurial.  Absolutely. Right. Most J schools are not.  And so it's in it's it's an exception.  Because we're exceptional.  You know, I don't know. I guess I guess what we should do is get some venture capitalists on.  And they could probably argue the case that it that it's fine to start a business with the idea of having an exit.  You know, who would be great is both John Boothwick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, because John started, for example, he started a when Twitter started, it had no search engine.  He said, well, this is ridiculous. Got a research engine.  Twitter wasn't doing it. I'm going to start a company. It's a search engine.  Guess who was going to buy them? Right. Right.  But he ended up doing development for Twitter.  It was more expensive for Twitter that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess it makes sense that there are if what we want to do is foster invention, innovation, creation.  It makes sense that some companies are started with an idea like that of it.  Well, it's not going to be a tenable standalone company, but probably Twitter would want to buy it.  I guess there's nothing wrong with that. I mean, on the other hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I've been writing a little book about magazines.  And so in it, I'm reliving the start of Entertainment Weekly.  I have my files from from there, which is somewhat painful to relive.  And we the publisher, who at the time was my friend and throughout the long term, he was.  But and I had pushed it.  We got favorable research and what we're going to start this thing.  And then Timing being timing appointed a task force to come up with every reason not to do it so they could say that they'd done that.  And so then the publisher got all angry.  He was CFO of the magazine company and he sent them a memo, which I still have, which said, well, damn it, this is all bull.  Just give us the just give Jeff and me the idea.  We'll go out and find the money to do it and we'll do this.  No, no, no, no, no.  We start the magazine.  The magazine went through well, well, well more than one hundred billion dollars lost before it broke even.  And so in that case, we couldn't have started it outside.  It had to be started inside a company because only that size.  That was the last larger magazine launch that will ever occur in history.  I was that one helped kill.  Right.  So some things have to start inside the company because there are that capital intensive.  But some things are better if they're innovation intensive to start outside, which really sounds horribly business school to me.  I apologize for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what I was speaking of journalism, what about this?  Metta started telling people yesterday, we're not going to give you money anymore.  Metta had paid about one hundred five million dollars to they had three year deals with publishers.  They set up a couple of three years ago as part of their investment news.  They hired journalists to help direct publisher traffic to its new tab for news and they were giving money to companies.  Let me see.  I think Axios has some numbers.  It was 10 million to the 10 million to the journal, 3 million to the CNN, more than 20 million to the New York Times.  In some cases, you got what you get with Twitter.  Blue unlocked paywall content.  Metta says, never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Toot toot toot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Last stop on the gravy train.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Is that another case of the thumb on the scales or is it important?  No, this is this is it was always back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sheesh.  It was always I was always blackmailed.  Right.  And it didn't work.  So so if we're nice to you Murdoch, will you shut up and stop trying to lobby governments for protectionism?  OK, if you actually pay us, we will.  And I was there at the event held the Museum of Broadcasting in New York.  Campbell Brown and not Mark Thompson, the other Thompson at News Corp, the president of News Corp up on stage.  Basically, the check is practically passed.  And OK, we'll be nice now.  What happened after that?  Australia and the effort by News Corp to make publishers pay again and even more and more European regulation aplenty.  And so it didn't work.  The news tab that was created on Facebook Zuckerberg said at the time, well, not many people going to use this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like sand through the hourglass.  So are the days of our lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  Did I interrupt you, Jeff?  That's for the next story.  What I just did to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought I was going a little too long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, it was a little late in sound.  From the next story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could you could use that as a gimmick in the future.  So far from Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like sand through the hourglass.  So are the days of our lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So are the days of our lives.  You know why I'm playing that theme song?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I cannot figure it out.  There's got to be a reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  NBC is moving its longest running series, Days of Our Lives, off broadcast to streaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To help some people make people watch Peacock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody will watch Peacock, by the way.  Zero subscriber growth in the last quarter.  Zero.  Yeah.  Not good.  Surprised.  No losses.  Starting September 12th.  All new episodes.  Losing a big amount of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although no losses subscribers.  Probably.  Yes.  They.  This is this is churn.  And yeah, they lost a whole bunch of people and then they had they had to market just to get back to even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And now they're moving their longest running show, which must be doing poorly, right?  Otherwise you wouldn't.  But maybe it's not.  I don't know.  All new episodes of the show will debut on Peacock Daily.  Peacock premium subscribers will be able to access past shows if you lose if you miss an episode of your show.  And it will be replaced by a news show.  NBC News Daily.  An hour long program.  Oh, that's that's got to improve the ratings.  Anchored.  Anchored by Kate Snow.  Erin Gilchrist, Vicki Nguyen and Mark Morgan Radford.  You know, mom wants to watch an hour of news for instead of days of our lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The 2021 season of Days of Our Lives averaged a point three rating.  Oh, that's not 18 to 49.  Female demographic with one point seven million total viewers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's not bad for a middle of the day show.  Seven.  No, that ain't bad.  14000th episode aired in 2020.  Set in the fictional Midwestern city of Salem, it revolves around the Brady, Horton and Demira families.  It debuted in 1965.  Days of Our Lives.  Take a guess.  How many Emmys?  Days of Our Lives has won.  Two.  Three.  Five.  Fifty eight.  Wow.  Fifty eight.  But it's a daytime Emmy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It doesn't count, Ed.  It's only a daytime Emmy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have the only thing worse than a daytime Emmy I have, which is a regional Emmy.  Regional Emmy.  Do you ever, Ed, I feel like you might occasionally buy an occasional dumb, dumb lollipop.  Do you?  Yes.  Yes, you do.  It's a simple pleasure.  I think it's a southern brand, I want to say.  I don't know.  So here's a story from Blimberg.  You haven't done that in a while.  Blimberg Business Week.  Mitchell Owens recently discovered that mysterious entities were selling bulk orders of dumb, dumb lollipops on Amazon for a couple of bucks less than the price charged by his company.  Spangler Candy Company, which makes dumb, dumbs.  So he placed an order from one of the Amazon merchants.  A few days later, a 500 pack of lollipops arrived on his doorstep.  They weren't counterfeit and strangely had been shipped directly from Sam's Club.  It's a get ready for this, a price arbitrage scheme, which is illegal according to Amazon.  They don't want people, not illegal, like you go to jail for.  Against the rules.  You go to Amazon jail for it.  Terms of service.  Sellers, often guided by how to tutorials on YouTube, TikTok and Instagram, scour the internet for products with lower prices than Amazon.  Then they post the items on the website, wait for someone to place an order.  Wait, they don't even buy it yet.  Right?  No inventory.  Purchase the product, drop ship directly to the customer and take the difference.  And they never actually touch the merchandise.  It is a violation of Amazon policy.  But because Amazon's so big, good luck.  Hard to notice.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought this hustle has been going on for a while though, sir.  It has.  Five, six years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With dumb, dumbs, the sellers are leveraging a yawning price gap between Sam's Club, which sells a deeply discounted 500 pack of lollipops for about $15.  And Amazon, where Spangler sells its exclusive 400 pack for $26.  Sellers can charge $25 on Amazon to lure price conscious shoppers in pocket about $6 after subtracting Amazon's fees.  That's arbitrage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you go all the way down to line 151, one of my numbers...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Am I done talking about the lollipop drop shippers?  Yes, I am, actually.  I just wanted to say the words lollipop drop shippers.  This is a Business Insider article.  Say that five times fast.  Yeah.  This is a Business Insider article.  I quit my job to buy and resell used books on Amazon.  Now I use my six figure income to travel the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Travel the world.  So she drops, she goes to a used bookstore, she buys the books, she ships them to Amazon, and then the rest just happens.  People buy it on Amazon and Amazon ships it and she gets her pennies and she travels the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How can I do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know, I think that's my retirement.  I think that's what I'm going to do.  I don't want to sell any of the books I have.  That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So she's traveling around the US going to used bookstores.  So it's not like...  She did that already.  She's not like going to Florence.  She's going around the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, she did that already.  But once she did that and got enough books in Amazon's warehouse, she said, see you later.  I'm going to Turkey.  So I often will buy...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mailbox money.  I will often buy used books on Amazon.  A lot of the programming books, especially the old ones I want to buy, that's the only way to get them is used.  Most of the time I think they come from a bookstore, but occasionally you get shipped and fulfilled by Amazon.  That means that somebody like this woman has gone around and found these books.  Amazon will store them for you for a fee and ship them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's all for a fee, but what the hell?  Plus, my local used bookstore doesn't list their inventory on Amazon or anywhere.  And so there's some stuff that's really cheap.  I just got, for the magazine book, I went there and bought some old Life magazines.  I have the Life Kennedy shot with Zabruder film issue for $2.  I'm going to bet I can sell that for more on eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I have this fine picture of a handsome gentleman, former TV guide critic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If somebody is going to buy, if some schmuck is going to buy even that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't you think this probably was somebody's arbitrage? Come to think of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was an old, they bought a file of old press pictures.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Press releases.  I'm pretty sure they're not traveling the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Based on the big bucks from Jeff Jarvis, portraits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Selling Jeff Jarvis, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be kind of ironic.  Yeah, I've been kind of aware of this whole idea of dropshipping for a long time.  And I think anybody who buys on Amazon has.  Because frequently you'll order something and it kind of like comes in this beat up box bubble wrap.  Like some guy bought it at Sam's Club and then threw it in the box and sent it to you.  And it's just arbitrage.  It's the difference between the price he paid for it and the price that I paid on Amazon.  And I always figure when that happens, I'm just paying for the convenience.  Because I didn't have to go to that Sam's Club to pick it up.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, or you're finding things you just couldn't find otherwise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But a lot of the stuff, yeah, maybe I buy obscure stuff, but a lot of the stuff I order on Amazon is like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, do you use Bookfinder?  Yes, after you told us about it.  It's the best.  Oh, I did, okay, yeah, it's the best.  Yeah. I often remember that though.  It's a meta search engine of all the used book search engines and it's spectacular.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So let's see.  I want to just see if Paul Graham, I spent like 60 bucks for this book called On Lisp by Paul Graham.  Because it's out of print.  It's a very valuable book.  This is it.  On Lisp used.  I got a deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's rare.  You only find one book matching.  That's really rare.  That's shipped from Japan.  That's probably why it's so expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, let me see if I can find it on Amazon actually.  Now that we're in this loop, we can edit this out too.  Let's just edit out most of the show.  Geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One collectible for 500.  So go buy that one, Leo, and sell it on Amazon for $112.  I should.  Look at that.  It's interesting, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They are all within a penny of each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  114.91, 114.92, 114.93.  They also may be the same place that lists multiple search engines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, two of them are Bay Street book companies.  This is the Book Purveyors, ST Media.  $383 books in demand.  Boy, it's good.  I got it for 80 bucks when I did.  Tomorrow is a book sale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Book sale, the AAUW, the American Association of University Women, book sale, here nearby.  And it's a middle school cafeteria that's filled the first day, costs more to get in.  Because the people who go in are these people.  And they have scanners, and they go rushing around the place with the scanner and the phone,  and they know the price, and they know what to pick up, and they cherry pick the entire place.  I've watched them in action, and it's phenomenal.  And they have lots of rules.  If they find, let's say, an Oxford University Press book, those don't get discounted much.  They pick those up, and they look around, and I watch them with their, you know,  it's grasshopper and the assistant coming, learning the tricks of the trade.  And they leave with boxes and boxes and boxes of books, which in turn end up on Book Finder.  But this is a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, it keeps them going.  This is even, but not even that.  You might say, well, come on, people shouldn't be able to make money arbitraging book prices.  No, no, this is smoothing out demand and supply.  It's getting books to be...  It's a perfect market of information.  It's a perfect market. It's exactly what it is.  It's exactly how it should work. So I don't have a problem with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because otherwise, it would have cost you at least $20 to buy that picture.  At least.  I think it would only cost you $10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, these were cheap.  Wait a minute.  Oh, it was so expensive, Jeff. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say that.  Yeah.  Our show today, let's take a little break.  Our show today brought to you by New Relic.  You don't want that 3 a.m. phone call.  The server's down.  You push something, it's broken.  It's not working.  Oh, the worst in the world, right?  Because you don't know what's going on with your network or with your cloud or with your production.  I know lots of devs.  Smart people.  Developers. Of course you are. You're smart people.  You're the first to explore the newest tech.  You actually read the documentation.  You not only want to know how things work, you want to know why.  That's why so many engineers don't like to live in that uncertainty,  that 3 a.m. phone call where you don't know what's going on.  They turned to New Relic so that they know what's really happening in their software lifecycle.  New Relic gives you data about what you build.  Shows you what's really going on.

When teams come together around data, it allows you to try triage problems,  to be confident in decisions, to reduce the time needed to implement resolutions using data.  Not a guess.  Use the data platform made for the curious.  I hope I've piqued your interest and now I'm going to get you.  Because right now you can get it all for free.  Access to the entire New Relic stack.  16 useful tools and 100 gigabytes of data per month free.  And not just free for a month, free forever.  You don't even have to give them a credit card.

Buzz machine dot com.  Ant Pruitt.  Hands on photography.  Neelay Patel tweets, help about this headline from the Verge.  Google meets Duo Meet with Meet in Duo, but Duo isn't going into Meet.  And it's all happening today.  Thank you Emma Roth.  Well done Verge.  Very, very well done.  We talked about this in our change log some months ago.  Google announced that it was going to bring the features of Meet into Duo.  Technically that began today.  It's not getting rid of the app.  Duo is getting rebranded as Meet with the features from both apps and Meet staying Meet.  Wait a minute.  Let me look at my Google Pixel phone because I should have Duo on here, right?  So is it no longer going to say it's Duo?  It's going to say it's Meet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I still see Duo.  And I do not see Meet.  But it does say this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Duo is getting even better.  Your Duo app will become Meet with a new name and icon and more features like background effects.  Got it.  So maybe I just need to do an update.  Maybe that's what's wrong.  Maybe I haven't updated today.  Update all.  Let's see what I'm going to get.  Let's see what.  Am I getting a new Google Duo?  I'm getting.  You got it to force to update?  Yeah, I just said update.  But I don't know.  Are you sure?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Meet Diet.  And then there'll be New Coke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, and the new Meet that combines Meet and Duo.  The combined app will let you conduct both group and one-on-one calls as well as whole meetings.  If you already have Duo installed, you won't have to do anything.  Just like me, it will get updated automatically.  Last month, without your knowledge, Google pushed a Duo update that added the features for Meet today.  Google's rolling out an update on iOS and Android that will change the Duo logo to the Meet icon.  By September, anyone who downloads the Google Meet app will receive the new Meet Duo combo.  And if you go to duo.google.com, what do you get?  Let's see.  Duo.google.com.  You still get Duo, but soon it'll go to Meet.

Transcript:  Pichai said Google's productivity as a company isn't where it needs to be given where the headcount is and warned of a toughening economy.  HR chief Fiona Ciccone also acknowledged industry-wide concerns about layoffs and said the company, oh, this is good news, is not currently looking to reduce Google's overall workforce,  but we do need to become more efficient and improve employee focus.

Transcript:  Uh-oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now I know where this rumor came from.  Replaced an experience room, sent it around Google Stadia.  There was a rumor that Stadia was going away.  Maybe that's where that came from.

Transcript:  He lives in the UK.  He has 15 followers.  Anil's my friend.  Watch it.  How can you only have 15 followers after being on Twitter for 13 years?  You who kill your accounts all the time ask that.  So let's do some TikTok, shall we?  First, let's look at the prestigious magazine, The New Yorker.  And their article by Cal Newport,  TikTok and the fall of the social media giants.  Which kind of fits what we were saying before.  Oh yeah, this is yet another article saying social's dead.  Because they're all copying TikTok.  Yeah, they all want to make content.  But let me tell you, as a content creator, it's not all it's cracked up to be.

In 2020, they launched a music streaming app in India, Brazil and Indonesia called Reso.  So maybe they were testing it out.  If you already got the rights, why not?  Sandwich Guy.  Remember the sad story of the Sandwich Guy?  Last week, he got fired because he was attracting too much attention.  So now he's doing it in his house.  Now he's at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  different.  No, let's not promote that.  Okay, forget that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's terrible.  Right below that, Leo, is a story of interest to you.  I saw this.  A new revenue stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should be charging $50,000 to let Jeff on the show.  To us.  Yeah, to me for having to put him through TikTok Corner.  This is just more of the same.  I've been bemoaning YouTube creators who are obviously getting paid for their backscratching  little log rolling videos.  Well, apparently this happens in podcasts too.  The FTC says, it's our general guidance, regardless of the medium, deception occurs when consumers  acting reasonably are misled about the nature or source and such misleading impressions  likely to affect the decision.  So you must disclose if somebody pays you to be on your podcast.  And for those who do, it's a lot of money.  And by the way, some people charge.  Manny Pacayo, the MMA boxer, charges $15,000 to be on your podcast.  Sorry, Manny.  Not interested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Has anybody ever come to you asking ...  All the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sponsors do that.  Oh, all the time.  A very popular thing.  And I'm sure, I told you the other day, I got somebody CC'd like 1,500 podcasters and  YouTube people and said, hey, would you like ... And I guess some ... A lot of them didn't  understand that reply would reply to everybody.  So I saw a lot of replies, YouTubers saying, yeah, sure, pay me, whatever.  And then some guy really getting in on this, he apparently represents YouTubers in negotiations  with people who want to pay them for free reviews, I mean, good reviews.  He said, oh guys, you're under ... He's more than $3,000.  You're under ... Come see me.  So this whole thing is happening in public because people don't understand reply all,  I guess.  And ethics.  Guest IO or Guestio is a agency which works with people to pay to be on podcasts.  They say they paid out more than ... Since 2020, more than $300,000 to podcasters.  Oh, and guests, it goes both ways like Manny.  In just the past six months, four podcasters on Guest IO have made more than $20,000 from  appearance fees.  One podcast alone took in more than $50,000.  There is no standard price, but Chappelle, who runs Guest IO, says, we suggest you charge  $100 to $150 per thousand listeners.  How many listeners do we have on this show?  How many listeners?  I think it's around 75,000.  So that would be $100 per thousand.  That'd be 75 times 100.  $7,500, that's nothing.  By the way, we charge more than that for an advertisement.  For an ad?  Yeah.  Yes.  And we tell you there are ads.  But a lot of podcasters aren't making any ad money.  So this is ... Here's one podcaster.  He does Entrepreneurs on Fire, a daily program.  John Lee Dumas, its host and creator, says he currently charges $3,500 for an appearance.  He raked in $146,000 in June.  In June.  Good, nice work if you can get it.  Just disclose.  You can do whatever you want as long as you disclose.  But you can't just say at the end, hey, thanks for paying me $50,000.  Next, you've got to say at the front, right up front, this is a paid podcast, things like  that.  And when we do an ad, I always say, thanks to our sponsor, our show today is brought  to you by.  I think that's understood that they're paying us, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you separate out the content.  It's like going to conferences where various speakers get into the program because they're  sponsors.  Which is also wrong.  You know, if you say, this is sponsor time, and here's the sponsored talk, fine.  I'm okay with that.  It isn't all of life marketing now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm actually having fun with the stuff you added.  Much more than ...  Now I can see what you did.  We have a special section for you, Jeff.  It's wacky stuff.  It's wacky stuff.  For instance, I saw this story, and I didn't actually add it, but then you did, so all  right.  A16Z, which is a venture capital, that's a VC fund.  Isn't that Mark Andreessen?  It's Andreessen Horowitz.  Andreessen Horowitz.  He's put $50 million into Gary Vaynerchuk's NFT project, VFRIEND.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Yeah, Ant.  You could have said it better myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  I'm sorry, it slipped.  $50 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It had to, Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But he does do conferences, which makes money.  You know, I mean, he's not just ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But what's so stupid about it is you draw some little character and say, oh, this character  As if there isn't a lot of work to make Rugrats characters what they are, right?  There's more creativity in their stories and their character development.  No, I'm just going to draw this stupid little mouse, and I'm going to be rich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How about Pearson, a big textbook publisher, who charges hundreds of dollars for many of  their textbooks, right?  Oh, yes.  But they've decided there's a problem, because people are buying textbooks and then selling  them on in the used textbook market.  On Bookfinder, by the way.  Yes.  And they're not getting their cut of those, so they're going to use NFTs to lock in their  books so they'll make money on the secondhand sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The pyramid.  Yep.  The print editions of ...  You know, I've said this before.  Yeah.  You know, the whole NFT thing has just baffled me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you ... you know, and I think you really liked the idea initially as a creator, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I know of a couple creators that are in NFT space, and one of them, again, her name  is Elise Swope.  She's doing really, really well.  And when you see the art that she's creating, I get it.  It's not these doodles of a green dragon on a football field.  She's doing legit, flat out spending time to create art, and it's totally paying her  bill.  She's absolutely crushing it.  But when I see stuff like this from the big names of Gary Vee, who's ... yes, he's a  smart businessman or whatever, and just sort of built himself from the ground up.  I get that, but it just seems scammy at this point.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It really does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The other thing is that the ... because for you to support your art in new ways, I'm all  four.  But what people are doing with this idea is saying that everything should be owned.  And some people say that Web 3 is the ownership web, which is going back on the stupidity  that was wrong about copyright.  That copyright turned the act of creating art into a tradable asset, and it didn't help  the artist.  It helped whoever bought it next.  And so now they're trying to exploit everything in this way.  And there do need to be more ways to pay you for your art, but in the end, it doesn't help  you.  It helps people like Gary Vee.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or Kevin Rose.  Or ...  And then I look at the likes of the NFL or the NBA.  Why the heck are they in the NFT space?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, actually, we talked about this on Sunday, and what I didn't realize is that the NBA  NFTs, I thought they were being sold directly by the NBA.  That's just NBA licensed it to a third ...  Oh no, it's Top Shots.  Yeah.  The NBA Top Shots are just licensed to an NFT company.  So the NBA is making some money.  Well, why not?  But really, this is a third ... it's like Tops, the bubblegum company that makes money  off of basketball or baseball cards.  It's just like that.  I love this story, Jeff, that you found.  Somebody decided to do a Wikipedia deletion report in the style of Hunter S. Thompson  written by GPT-3, and it's wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Shall I read a little bit of it?  Oh, you're going to have to bleep yourself for a few cases because it is Hunter S. Thompson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hello, you Fs.  I'm back from the dead and I'm writing this month's column.  Why?  Because I'm the only one who can deal with the sheer volume of BS that gets deleted from  this website every day.  It's a damn travesty is what it is.  If you're looking for a sensible, boring article on the month's Wikipedia deletion statistics,  you've come to the wrong place.  This is gonzo journalism at its finest.  I can't believe GPT-3 wrote this.  And I, Hunter S. Thompson, am your guide.  Why am I writing this article?  Wikipedia has decided that in the interest of full disclosure, it needs to provide more  information about its deletion process.  What better way to do it than to have me, Hunter S. Thompson, write about it.  I asked the boss why they decided to have me write this instead of the normal human  editors.  He just said that he needed someone with a quote, unique perspective.  I'm not sure what that means, but I'm pretty sure it's BS.  Anyway, here's the deal.  That's pretty good.  Pretty good.  I like it.  You know, now I'm all for it.  If AI could start doing stuff, make it more fun like that, that's good.  All right.  Now we do have to do, I'm sorry.  We do have to do the Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This TikTok corner doesn't need trumpets.  It doesn't need an intro or trumpets or...  Poor changelog needs trumpets.  It needs something to make it exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, you may not have noticed it, but the good folks at Search Engine Roundtable  did the Google timer has disappeared from search, but it will be coming back because  Danny Sullivan says it's probably a bug.  So you know that you can, did you know you can do this with Google?  You say set timer for five minutes and then it will show a timer and it'll do it.  Just like, you know, this has been around since 2013.  Apparently the timer started deleting itself around July 18th.  So they asked Danny Sullivan of Search Engine Land.  Yes.  What's going on?  Sullivan tweeted, we have an issue we've been looking into.  We expect to have it back fairly soon.  That was back in July 21st.  A week later, the team's still checking on it.  We're not sure.  And now I guess they say it will be coming back.  But meantime, you could still use the built in metronome on Google search because that's  still there.  Let me see if I can set a timer for five minutes.  By the way, you can see how people use this timer because of the...  No.  It gives me a video.  Wow.  A YouTube video.  A good YouTube.  Somebody enterprising.  Somebody made...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Try six minutes now, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See if somebody made a six minute.  Oh, you bet.  Right?  This is Adam Eshborn, September 7th, 2015.  Wait, but before we do that, I would like to see how many views this timer has.  How many views?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How many views?  It's a new business for you, Leo.  That's brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  27.3 million views.  Yes.  All right.  As soon as this show is over.  Holy crap.  Holy cow.  Here's...  Let's do what?  How many minutes?  Just say any...  Six minutes.  Six.  No.  No.  No, Danny.  I mean, Adam.  There it is.  Oh, he did.  But that's from Instructor Beats.  Instructor Beats.  Let's see how many.  See, Instructor Beats, six minutes...  Okay, I'm sure that's good.  That's kind of a niche.  It's not going to be...  It's more niche-y, right?  Yeah.  That's only got 44,000 views.  5 minutes was the sweet spot.  Try 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  10-minute timer?  Yeah.  Because I'll bet people use this in presentations and in conferences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and I bet that once Google took the search away, these guys were very happy.  Yep, Adam did one for 10.  Adam's again.  See, he knows.  He knows the market.  Let's see.  He knows.  He understands the market.  Let's see.  21.8 million views.  Outstanding.  He's got a...  The guy...  Wait a minute.  He's got subscribers.  He's got 146,000.  He's got more subscribers than we do.  Oh, he does other things.  But, his big runs are timers.  He's got a whole timers playlist.  He's got a Christmas-themed 15.  He's got a Christmas-themed 15.  Oh, yeah.  All right, nine.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you want one with animals?  Do you want one with scenic nature?  Oh, yeah.  I can see.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  From now on, before the show, we're just going to put that up.  And you'll have scenic nature.  Now we'll make us a video.  Yeah.  Just put that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Of course, it's a lie because we never start when you say we're going to start.  Well, now we'll have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, do you think I'm going to get a takedown because I'm showing this timer?  Wouldn't that be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought it was on sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it on video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who knows?  I don't understand that stuff works.  No, it's audio, I thought.  How about an 80s-style five-minute timer?  Ooh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ooh.  Miami Vice feels so Don Johnson-y.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Whoop.  Yeah, I think you're right, Jeff.  I think people put this up on the screen before their speeches and stuff.  This probably does have a legit use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ellis Lindsay does this a lot for office hours.  Does he?  It's just a good general practice for when you're doing live streams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I should do it in class when they realize they're late from coming back from the break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, under the nine-minute timer, here's one of the comments.  The legend returns.  Legend?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just watched it to hear the sound at the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute now.  Let's jump ahead and hear the sound at the end.  Let me turn on the sound.  This is very exciting.  This is what will get you taken down.  This is very suspenseful.  In nine seconds, eight, seven, six, five, we're going to hear the final sound.  That will get us taken down.  That will.  That's it.  You missed a great show.  Edit it out.  Holy cow.  Holy cow.  That's a discovery.  This is the edit it out show.  I got to tell you.  This whole show is edited.  Edit this whole show out.  YouTube Music can now show other performances.  So if you are a ... In fact, let me launch this just to show you.  I love this because I like covers, right?  So let's search for a well-known song covered a lot.  Hallelujah, right?  A lot of it.  A lot.  Love it, right?  And I'm going to get the Leonard Cohen live in London.  Stop.  Don't play it.  Whatever you do.  Whatever you do.  Now, this is YouTube Music.  Supposedly, there's going to be ... Well, I don't know.  How do I ... Huh.  I guess not.  Maybe if I go to the song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've heard the words I say to the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think to think ... You think this will stop it?  I hear the Lord, Hallelujah.  Sorry.  I had to do that so that it wouldn't get taken down.  Where is the ... Well, maybe it's not ... I haven't got it yet.  Maybe it's not rolled out.  But if you like covers, this will be a very nice feature on YouTube Music.  It'll show you other versions of the same song.  And I picked Hallelujah because it's probably the most covered song.  It's a magnificent song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to see the movie.  Can't wait.  It was in theaters.  I got to wait.  By the way, that's a feature I want, by the way.  What's that?  I want a I'm not going to see it in theaters wait list.  Yeah.  So when it comes out, I get a ping that says it's on Hoo Hoo, it's on Apple, it's on here,  it's on there, and I'll watch it.  I do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, when I see a movie that I want to see is in theaters, I get excited because  I know there will be something to watch in a month or two.  But then I forget.  Well, you just all we do.  I'm old.  Lisa and I have a ritual practically every few days.  We go to Apple on iTunes or whatever it is on Apple TV or Apple Music.  No, I guess it's the Apple TV.  We'll go to the movies section and we'll see what new movies there are.  This has a new releases thing.  If you just check that religiously, you'll see every time something comes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, oh, this is not, you're in the change log.  Still changing.  Hold on.  You mentioned this.  I do not want to ruin the magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're full circling here.  YouTube's new tool lets creators turn their own videos into shorts because everything's  better like TikTok.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This hasn't rolled out to my account yet.  I tried it earlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'll convert your nice wide screen into a vertical video under 60 seconds.  Great.  New look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How long is that going to last?  I mean, people are going to get so sick of this.  Oh, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.  Well, Facebook's already video.  Vertical video?  No, no, that's the future.  No, I just think the short, the short thing of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think maybe it's a strategy that everybody ganged up in an antitrust and they said, let's  all get the world sick of TikTok.  It's the only way to defeat them.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We'll all do it.  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gmail's new look.  The load about the fact that most people have shortest attention spans and it's the  only way to get to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't it ironic that as I'm trying to do the changelog, Ant asks a question about short  attention spans?  I'm just trying to get through this, Ant.  Please.  Gmail's new look is now rolling out to everybody.  Who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got it.  I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We already did the Google Meet Meets Duo Meet with Meet and Duo, but Duo isn't going to  meet.  And finally, Google Play Store takes aim at annoying game ads, copycat apps, and misinformation  with new rules, which number one, very number one rule.  Apps with subscriptions must offer users a way to easily cancel their subscriptions from  within the app.  Yes.  Great.  It's actually Apple's secret sauce in their app store because Apple aggregates it all  in your settings.  You can see every subscription, when it's going to renew, when it's going to expire.  That's so important.  Also, requiring by November 1st that all legitimate monitoring apps use the is monitoring tool  flag, which means Google can pop up a thing saying it's monitoring you.  All of these policies coming this fall.  One of them takes aim at ads in mobile games, full screen ads prohibited if they can't  be closed after 15 seconds.  Except, there's an exception which isn't good, ads that unlock rewards in a game, but only  if the ad is opt in.  And this happens all the time in these free to play games.  Hey, if you'd like 1,500 more rings, all you got to do is watch this ad.  Anyway, Google will also prohibit something that can be very painful, unexpected interstitial  ads.  Ads that appear in games prior to the loading screener when starting a new level.  Man, when games do this to me, I just delete them.  I just delete them.  So, thank you Google, finally, for doing that in the app store.  Wait a minute, somebody's adding...  I thought I was done and somebody just added another...  This would be the way to torture Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Change log that never ends.  Did you do that Ant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Ant added the story.  I just added it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I saw it and I thought about you.  No, you're good Ant.  Google Play Store removes version numbers.  What?  From Android app listings, that seems like a bad idea.  Right.  Right?  You want to know what version.  Although, if the version is like this, 11.8.02446165824-beta-arm64-v8a, which is Google's own version for the Google keyboard, that's not so useful.  But that will disappear.  But that makes no sense.  I want to see the versions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whenever there's a problem with an app, the support person is going to ask you what version are you on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, 9to5Google says Google didn't announce this.  Maybe it's a bug.  Maybe it's a bug.  But they noticed this with the latest Google app beta.  The version number is gone.  It seems like an unusual bug.  It seems like maybe that was more intentional.  And that's the Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was too late.  I tried to add another word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You did.  Damn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was searching to find anything to put in there.  Chrome 104, significant security update now here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You guys like to torture me.  Yes, we do.  Well played, Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well played, sir.  Can I ask for one story from your part of the change log?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Because it pissed me off.  You missed a lot of stories.  Yeah, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the biggest thing that happened is Netflix, line 55, now deciding to sue the  Bridgerton musical people.  You put that in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I put this in here because I thought this was annoying.  So George Lucas for a long time was famously litigious about fanfic.  And I think he learned his lesson and decided, no, you know what?  This is really good for the Star Wars franchise to let people create their own.  It's for the legacy.  Yeah, knockoffs and stuff.  So you remember we talked about the Bridgerton musical, which was was it his start on  TikTok?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Barlow and Bear, Abigail Barlow and Emily Bear.  They won a Grammy, I might add.  Right.  For the unofficial and they even say it in the name unofficial Bridgerton musical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They asked to do it and were told we're not going to officially say, OK, but we're not  going to stop you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Netflix has now filed a lawsuit because they did a concert where they sold tickets

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and Netflix said, whoa, you're making money on this.  Well, yeah, they're also promoting this stupid show that nobody should want to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, everybody watches it.  But that is really dumb.  It's really dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's really dumb.  Netflix and people aren't liking you very much these days.  Netflix, you know, and they're leaving you.  And this attitude is part of the reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On July 26th, not so long ago, the duo staged a sold out performance at the Kennedy Center  in New York featuring the National Symphony Orchestra and a collection of Broadway guest  stars.  OK, maybe Chris, this might be going a little far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you should torture aunt with some of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tickets range between twenty nine dollars and one hundred forty nine dollars, including  VIP upgrades.  Netflix put its foot down after repeated objections demanding an end to these for-profit  performances.  OK, you know what?  Now my tune has changed a little bit because that's a big deal.  They take their charge and big money for tickets.  Of course, they wrote the music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They wrote the music and it's a tribute to it.  And all they're taking is the characters.  They could have done the exact same thing and used different character names.  Sure, it wouldn't be valuable.  So, you know, Bridgerton has a point.  Do you think they'll have a defense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's fair use.  Fair use as parity.  It's transformative.  Well, yes, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's part of what the story says is that there's case law on both sides.  As Larry Lessig says, fair use is just the right to hire a lawyer.  And there are some cases where parity is seen as sufficient and it's transformative.  And hey, they're making fun of Bridgerton as OK.  Or others would say, no, you relied on the value of their brand they created.  All I'm trying to argue here is I think Netflix would have been smart to say,  love it, delighted, here's the deal.  Give us 10% of what you earn.  We'll never sue you.  We'll be happy.  And that's that.  But no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think really it's going to come down to whether a judge or if it's jury trial,  whether a jury believes that this hurts Bridgerton, that it costs Netflix,  that people don't watch Bridgerton because of this.  That's ridiculous.  And I think that the judge and jury both will think, no, this promotes it,  makes you money, it does not hurt you.  So this is fair use.  This is a transformative use of this.  And I think any reasonable judge or jury would feel that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we want to also have Ant watch the whole thing and give us a review.  That's what we need.  Yeah.  Our new theater critic, Ant Pruitt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Give me a few minutes to write my letter of resignation.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, this is actually going to end up being a very interesting story.  Warner Brothers made a $90 million movie about Batgirl.  Oh yeah.  I heard about this.  Big deal starring a well-known actor.  In fact, a lot of well-known actors were in this.  Apparently they finished it or all but finished it.  But in the sneaks, audiences, I guess, didn't like it.  They decided not only were they it was originally made for HBO Max,  not going to release it on streaming, they were never going to ever, ever release it.  And now, of course, a lot of people are saying, but wait, you know,  one guy tweeted, I have a yearly subscription to Premiere Pro.  Can I just give it to me?  I'll finish the edit.  It was directed by Ms. Marvel's directors, Adil El Arby and Bilal Fallah.  It featured Leslie Grace.  It had a lot of big names in this movie.  And they finished it.  Spent $90 million.  Going to write it all off.  Also, Scoob Holiday Haunt.  They're going to write that one off too.  Which is, I guess, a Scooby-Doo movie.  Wow.  Kind of a shocker.  You don't hear about that happening very often.  Line 61 I put in others.  Have you covered, you know, the media industry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there's the famous, most famous one.  I put it in line 61, some others.  The most famous one is Jerry Lewis's Clown in a Concentration Camp movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, there's good reason that was never released.  In fact, Jerry Lewis sued many, many people to keep it from ever surfacing people who claimed they had a copy of the movie or of the script.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's Louis C.K.  I love you, daddy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, we know why that got.  We know why that's not.  Yeah.  Cobra Gator.  I've never heard of that.  I think that should have been killed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Empires of the Deep, $130 million underwater 3D fantasy starring Olga Kurylenko.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Queen of the Mermaids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Blackbird.  Michael Flatley of Lord of the Dance.  Oh, no, this should die.  And a spy thriller.  Oh, my.  What, the Irish dances his way through the movie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a little bizarre.  But no, I think this would have done back.  You know what?  People want to see it.  And I think that.  Yeah.  How bad could it be?  Shot in Glasgow over four months at the start of the year.  According to insiders, the whole thing is so terrible.  The studio would rather lock it away than let anyone see it.  And this is a studio that released DC League of Super Pets, writes the Guardian.  So it really has to stink.  I suspect somebody, some fans.  I don't know.  I just I can't think this is the last we've seen of that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It took years to cool off.  Yeah, maybe.  Wow.  I mean, but they had some big names in this movie.  Let me see if I could find the this the cast.  The Leslie Grace was in the movie In the Heights.  Michael Keaton was in it.  Batman.  J.K. Simmons Oscar award winning J.K.  Simmons is Commissioner Gordon and the villain.  And I really wanted to see this was the newly plump Brendan Fraser as the villain  Firefly.  I really wanted to see that.  Well, have you seen the latest?  You know, Brendan Fraser used to be kind of hunky guy.  Right.  But, you know, like all of us, he's he's he's got a little older and he's not quite  like the guy he was in Tarzan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So or George.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't happen to all of us except Ant.  Yeah, it happened to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I wasn't going to go there, but I'll go anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leave me out of this.  Old fat man.  I'm quite fine at actually there's another according to variety.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The real reason taxes.  Oh, taxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is this like the what's the what's the movie where they want to lose money?  Yeah, the producers, the producers.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Even before David Zaslav took the reins of the newly formed Warner Brothers Discovery  as CEO this spring, he made a no-see movie.  He made a no secret of reversing his predecessor's strategy and committing to releasing first  run feature films and theaters.  Remember, they were putting them on HBO Max, not theaters.  Right.  Batgirl, which was going to be direct to streaming.  Spending the money to expand the scope of Batgirl for theaters, plus the 30 to 50 million  dollars needed to market domestically, the tens of millions more needed for global roll  out could have taken that 90 million dollar investment and doubled it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's risk.  That's a lot of risk, especially if the movie ain't great.  Wow.  But you could just push it out, you know, on YouTube or something.  All right.  That's interesting.  That's a little insight into the movie business.  All right.  Let's take a break.  I think we got everything.  Yeah, take it in a lot.  Anything else you want to see?  Let me holler.  Give me a holler.  We hit quite a bit.  We're going to get your picks of the week, gentlemen, in just a little bit.  Our show today brought to you by 8 Sleep.  Oh, I love my 8 Sleep.  Oh, I love this.  Good sleep is the ultimate game changer.  My good friend used to call it nature's gentle nurse.  And 8 Sleep makes a mattress or what we have at home, the Pod Pro cover,  because we like our mattress, goes over our mattress, the ultimate sleep machine.  For a long time, you know, we had electric blanket, warms you up at night.  Then we tried electric mattress pad.  I liked that.  But the problem is it only went in one direction.  8 Sleep goes up and down.  You can add the Pod Pro cover to any mattress and start sleeping as cool as 55 degrees.  What's the temperature right now in beautiful New Jersey?  Is it almost 100 degrees?  Wouldn't you love to have a nice, cool, refreshing bed to get into?  And then in the winter, it can go as high as 110 degrees.  But even better, 8 Sleep AI automatically monitors the room temperature you're tossing and turning,  how you're sleeping, and then modifies the temperature to give you the optimal temperature for what your body needs.  It starts warm, generally, this is for me for sure, starts warm, cools off.  As you go into a deeper and deeper sleep, you sleep better with a cool bed.  And then I have mine set to wake me up in the morning by gently warming.  Clinical data shows 8 Sleep users experience up to 19% increase in recovery,  up to 32% improvement in sleep quality, and up to 34% more deep sleep.  Deep sleep is the most important sleep of all.  Cleans your brain out, gets the prions out of your brain.  And the deep sleep is nice because as it cools you down, you go deeper and deeper.  It's great.  It can decrease the risk of heart disease, lower blood pressure, even reduce the risk of Alzheimer's.  30% of Americans struggle with sleep.  You don't have to.  Now, Lisa has a completely different plan.  She likes it warmer than I do, but that's all right because our PodPro cover has two sides.  I have my temperature, she has hers, and mine is adjusted automatically, as is hers.  Recently, 8 Sleep launched the next generation of the Pod.  This is the new one, the Pod 3.  Even more accurate sleep and health tracking, double the amount of sensors.  And I can look at the app every morning and see how I slept and adjust the temperatures or adjust it for me.  I just love my 8 Sleep and my PodPro cover.  It's not magic, but it sure feels like it.  It's so awesome.  I want you to try it.  Go to 8sleep.com slash twig, E-I-G-H-T, sleep.com slash twig.  Start sleeping cool this summer.  And I know a lot of you, we got another heat wave coming, will really appreciate getting in bed and having it be cool and refreshing.  It's so amazing.  It's so amazing that it's cool or hot.  It depends what the temperature in the room is, what you're looking for.  You'll save $150 to check out on the PodPro cover.  You get the new Pod 3 cover.  8 Sleep currently ships within the U.S., Canada, and U.K.  And they just added select countries in the E.U. and Australia.  Yeah, if you've been listening to this and you're saying, oh, I want that 8 Sleep, you can.  8sleep.com slash twig.  We are fans.  Lisa and I love our 8 Sleep.  E-I-G-H-T, the number 8 spelled out, sleep.com slash twig.  We thank them so much for supporting this week in Google.  And you support us, by the way, as with all our sponsors, by using those special URLs.  That way they know you saw it here.  8sleep.com slash twig.  I just love it.  I'm serious.  I love it.  It was Kim and Rose told me about it.  And then Amy Webb got one.  She loves it.  Finally, I said, all right, all right.  And about eight months ago we got it.  And I just, you know, got us through the winter.  Now it's getting us through the summer.  8sleep.com slash twig.  And let's see here.  I don't have Stacey to pick on.  So I guess I'll start with you, Jeff Jarvis.

Transcript:  All right.  Well, so before we were on the air, Leo was taking around his Pixel 6 with a new Gizmo.  Yeah, I was doing a little tour of the studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The TriCaster.  NDI.  And in his tour, he showed a whiteboard.  Yes.  And we've had since 2008.  So there's a wonderful little story here from the Boston Globe.  How does it kind of make me not get it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Please do not erase a treasured whiteboard at Boston's Children's Hospital.  And they've left it up kind of like ours for 15 years.  15 years.  We've moved ours twice now.  It wasn't the old cottage.  Then the brick house and now here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Even my signature is on it.  It's in the Boston Globe Hospital.  It was a doctor who was working on problems, Judah Folkman, this hospital's former chief of surgery,  and pioneer in the field of cancer research.  So he was keeping the whiteboard to keep his thoughts.  And people would come by and see it.  It was so valued that they put like yours, they put plexiglass over it now.  And it sits there as a legacy.  I have, as you know, a whole bunch of whiteboards here I use.  When I finished the manuscript for the Gutenberg Parenthesis,  I finally decided because where I do all my thinking and I had like seven whiteboards where I outlined it different times,  different titles, different chapters, all kinds of things.  And then I erased them all.  I love whiteboards, but you shouldn't have erased them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should save them.  My wife would kill me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She would absolutely kill me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why we don't have Shakespeare's whiteboards because his wife Anne Hathaway made a race them all.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I thought that was charming and fitting with the show.  The other thing to mention is that werewolf erotica is now a job.  Wait, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So if you don't want to make your living on social media and you don't want to sell used books,  you can write werewolf erotica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's a whole category.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a whole category.  People are being hired.  They're outlined and you know what's going to happen and to write this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've got to find some werewolf erotica that I can read right now.  I mean, maybe if I just Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I really hate to see your search history.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What the heck?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do it for the show.  I take it for the show.  Let's see.  Web novels are a 3.7 billion dollar business in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Vicious entered inside his modernly beautiful room,  which was decorated with chocolatey and white color interior.  That is where he saw his beautiful brunette girlfriend sitting with her back against the headboard  of the king sized bed in a sexy bright red colored lingerie.  That's badly written.  The top of the lingerie was barely covering her big bosom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was Leo editing.  I can't read the rest of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A thin strap was straining against her milky white skin,  turning her soft skin a light shade of red as it tried to hold the cloth together to her back.  Upon seeing him enter the room, she straightened and got on her knees and hands on the bed.  Obviously, this is not an English speaker who wrote this.  Facing him, giving him a clear view of the valley between her boobs and what she had to offer.  Vicious's lips dried in thirst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They dried in thirst?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  His tongue came out to lick the dryness off,  but he knew that the thirst she had ignited in him could only be quenched by, well, you know.  GPT-3 could do a better job.  This, I think, might have been written by GPT-3.  It might have been.  Wow.  On her knees and hands.  This is just the first paragraphs of Taken by the Wolves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it will soon be a musical that you can watch.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good grief.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  How about, you want to read another one?  Oh, you've got some.  Oh, the Diamond Club.  Yeah, no, no.  There's no werewolves in that.  This is called, He Takes His Mate, The Alpha's Howl Number One.  The Pax Alpha claims Jenna, but before he accepts her as his mate, she must pass a test.  A raw primal encounter with his subordinates that's sure to leave her sore and strained and gasping for more.  Okay.  So you can make money writing this stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, somebody is.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently.  There's workshops, there's apps.  Oh yeah, oh yeah.  In China, web novels are a $3.7 billion business.  I doubt they have Werewolf Erotica in China.  Those are from China.  Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They do.  Really?  I think it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The platform, Sumback by Tencent or TikTok's Parent Bite Dance.  Okay, you're right.  Dream, Good Novel, Web Novel, and Fizzo.  These are the apps.  So you actually get the app.  And then you can get the, inside the app, they get the Werewolf Erotica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guarantee you people are training GPT-3 to do this right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  Just remember garbage in, garbage out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, how good a Werewolf Erotica novel are you expecting, Ant?  I don't care how good the in is, the out is still a Werewolf Erotica novel.  So the expectations are low here, Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let us get to Ant Pruitt's much more, much less salacious picks of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How in the heck do I follow that?  Good grief.  I want to give a shout out to him.  I saw this.  Holy cow.  He has beaten my personal best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is for a squat.  How many, how many plates does he have on there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is a total of 455 pounds.  Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And he's squatted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're kidding me.  Me.  I love it that there's about eight guys around watching this in awe and cheering.  How does he squat 485 pounds?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He works hard and he has good genes.  Oh my golly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How much does he weigh, Ant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the thing.  I told him after that I need him to slow down just a touch because he still isn't gaining as much weight as I'd like for him to gain.  And that can be pretty tough on his knees.  So I told him I don't want him doing more than 475 in squats.  Well, that's about time.  Until he gets over 200 pounds.  Right now he's still at about 170.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that is more than your personal best.  Wow.  I bet you can bench more than you can though still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, for now I still can, but he's improved on that as well.  So I think he did 265 yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now Lisa told me about this.  She kicked in a little bit and maybe we can get even a – well, it looks like you're doing all right.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then the next thing is last week it was a pretty good day and then I got some bad news from the coach of our track team.  The field house was broken into so a lot of stuff was stolen.  And I was pretty pissed because he pays for a lot of that stuff.  And I said, are you doing a fundraiser?  And he was like, I don't know how to do any of that.  And such a nice man.  I've been coaching there forever.  And I said, well, I'll start a fundraiser for you.  And so I tweeted it out.  I said, I want to do this fundraiser to help coach out.  And he needed about a thousand bucks.  And dude, we've clearly gotten that thousand dollars.  And I said, I put an update in there.  I said, well, I was wanting to mention this fundraiser on the show to the listeners.  But apparently my Twitter feed is –  That's all you needed.  That's all you needed.  Antpruit.com slash help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I bet you can use a little bit more, right?  You doubled your goal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anything extra could be help because there's always incidentals and stuff that, you know,  especially when they have to travel and –  Maybe they'll buy the team ice cream or something like that.  Stuff like that.  So if you want to help, if you got $2, I'd appreciate it.  Just go to Antpruit.com slash help.  I'm going to keep it up until Sunday.  Then I'm going to take it down and withdraw it and give him the money so he can do something with it.  Very nice.  Thank you to everybody who contributed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the internet is a nice place.  It is.  It's a good thing.  It is.  Things like this happen because some people like Ant make it happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I really appreciate that.  Lastly, I want to give a shout out to Ms. Nichelle Nichols, the late Nichelle Nichols.  There's a video with her speaking about her meeting Dr. Martin Luther King.  It's at the 7th and 32nd.  I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You ready to hear it?  Yes, please.  This is, of course, Lieutenant Uhura from Star Trek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just looked at him.  He said, for the first time on television, we will be seen as we should be seen every day.  As intelligent, quality, beautiful people who can sing, dance, but who can go into space.  Who can be lawyers, who can be teachers, who can be professors, who are in this day.  And yet you don't see it on television until now.  And he went on.  So many of the things, perhaps some of the things he said, but I could say nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She wanted to quit.  She felt it was an undignified role.  She was a Broadway performer.  She wanted to go back to Broadway.  But Dr. King said, no, as you can hear, she said, no, we need to show that we can go into space.  That we'll be here.  We'll be there in the future.  And I think that's absolutely true.  She did it with such dignity.  Such a great message.  Such a great message.  It would have been nice to have an even bigger role for her on Star Trek.  And you know what's great is that the new Strange New Worlds Star Trek, Lieutenant Uhura does have a much larger role.  That's great.  They kind of give it more to do, which is fantastic.  The young.  Pardon me?  She's a cadet.  She's a cadet.  That's right.  This is early days.  It's a prequel.  And the young Spock and Captain Kirk's brother is on the Enterprise as well, along with Captain Pike.  Very nice.  And that's really nice.  I knew that that story, but I hadn't seen her talking about it.  So it's really nice to have that video.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of our listeners sent that to me because I mentioned it on Twitter.  And one of our listeners sent that.  And I was like, yeah, this is the one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  From METVLegends.org, Archive of American Television, Michelle Nichols talking about why she stuck around on Star Trek.  Thank you, Ant Pruitt.  Hands on photography.  What's coming up on Hop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this week I'm going to talk about Instagram a little bit, but I'm not going to rant and yell or anything like that.  Just going to talk about Instagram a little bit.  So make sure you tune in to it.  TV slash H O P.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Ant is very busy also as manager of our Club Twit community.  You do such a good job coming up August 18th.  Alex Lindsay from Mac Break Weekly with an ask me rescheduled.  Yeah.  And then our book club.  And by the way, you could join us too, Jeff.  I decided to kick in because we did Termination Shock last last time.  It was so much fun.  I'm going to come back for this one.  Stacey's Book Club with Ant Pruitt, Stacey Higginbotham.  I'll be there.  You should be there too.  Clara and the Sun is our book by Nobel Prize winning author Ishiguro.  I don't know how to say the name.  Yeah.  I think it's Ishiguro.  It's a really great book.  I'm really enjoying it.  And it'll be a lot of fun to talk about it.  That's coming up August 25th.  If you're not member of Club Twit, you should be.  I know.  And if you don't.  I want to say something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Last week we had our members fireside chat where I randomly picked out some of our Club  Twit members.  And I've gotten some really great feedback about that.  And join the club, y'all.  That was so much fun to sit to get to know these three members even more.  And we just had candid conversation on a Thursday morning here in California.  It's just totally worth the seven bucks a month.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I agree.  You get ad free versions of all the show.  We thought that would be the big selling point.  You don't have any ads, which means no tracking.  Turns out this Discord is really one of the sweet spots here.  You're doing a great job with it.  I love hanging out in there.  Every show has a Discord chat going during the show.  This is the one for Twig.  It's on right now.  But we also have conversations about a lot of other geeky topics.  So it's not just the shows.  We've got people talking about autos and books and coding and hacking and ham radio and philosophy and sci-fi and sports and space.  And we even had a Twit Cruise channel in there.  So as we were talking about earlier, Discord has become for many of us the preferred social network because you make it of the people you care about.  You want to be part of.  And if the Twit family is, and I think it's a wonderful family, is maybe the people you'd like to hang out with, you should check out Club Twit.  There's also a Twit Plus feed.  There are shows we do in Club Twit that we don't yet offer publicly.  As they grow and build an audience, we will.  Among them, the brand new Hands on Windows, Paul Thurotte's Windows show, which is now only episode one.  It's just starting.  There's the untitled Linux show, Stacey's Book Club, the GizFizz.  More content coming all the time because that's how we launched this week in space.  We launched it for the Club first.  And then as it grew in size and we could get advertisers, we were able to make it available for everybody.  So members of the club really are supporting what we're doing to grow a Twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tick tock corner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We could have a tick tock corner if you want.  Or a Gutenberg show?  You could have a good, you want a Gutenberg show?  We'll do a Gutenberg show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or Torture Ant with musicals?  There you go.  Geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Musicals for Ant to listen to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is Ant saying, I'm in charge of the club.  It's not a democracy, Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not happening.  Seven dollars a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Two things real quick, sir.  This week I was on the Untitled Linux show with Mr. Jonathan and Jeff.  And it was a lot of fun.  It's a great show.  Not that Linux nerd is as you are or any of our other listeners, but it was a lot of fun.  And that's only available in Club Twit.  And secondly, Mr. Jarvis, I really need to get you and Mr. Doc Searles together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be a great event.  Doc's wonderful.  I worship Doc.  Yeah, I think that's a great idea.  Yeah, I'm all for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what might be fun too is if we could get his co-author from Clue Train, David Weinberger.  He's a dear friend and a wonderful guy.  And I'd love to see the two of them interact from the old days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, we should do.  And if we do that, I will do a reading of the Clue Train Manifesto.  We could just put it in a chapter a day for a couple of weeks.  It'd be really fun.  It has the best opening paragraph ever.  Yeah, I would love to do that.  Anyway, if you're interested in Club Twit, twit.tv slash club twit.  Every Club Twit show or ad free versions of the shows are also they're all available individually.  If you only want that show, for instance, Hands on Windows for $2.99.  But all of that's at twit.tv slash club twit.  There's also yearly and corporate memberships.  Twit.tv slash club twit.  Mr. Jeff Jarvis is the director of the Town Night Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  Thank you, Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you, gentlemen.  It was a fun night.  Buzzmachine.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder where this is.  Yeah, we don't need a whole lot of people to do this show.  Just the three of us.  We do Twit and I'm hoping Stacey will be back next week.  I think it was like there was a scheduling conflict.  I think she's not ill.  She was just scheduling conflicts.  She had a driver's kit somewhere.  But I think she'll be back next week.  If God willing, if the creek's good.  Let's see.  What is it?  If the good Lord willing, the creeks don't rise.  The creek don't rise.  Stacey, I'm back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So says my grandmother.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The good Lord willing and the creek don't rise.  Stacey, Jeff and Ant next week.  Make a date.  2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern, 2100 UTC.  Live.twit.tv has a live audio or video stream.  We also have a great chat room open to all.  IRC.twit.tv.  You can get the shows afterwards by going to the website.  Twit.tv slash twig.  There's a YouTube channel, of course, for this week in Google.  We also, of course, offer it as a podcast, which means you can subscribe  and your favorite podcast player and get it automatically the minute it's available.  If you are a person listening after the fact and you want to join the conversation,  you say, well, the chats are all live.  Don't worry.  We have a fabulous forum at twit.community.  That's open to all.  And it's a really great place to hang.  We also have.  Yep.  And we all.  I know, Ant, you're in there all the time.  And we also have twit.social, which is our mastodon instance.  And that's a great conversation, really great conversation.  So all of the both of those are free.  And I do have to approve you because we want to keep the spammers out.  But stop by twit.social or twit.community or both and tell me which show you like the best.  Because spammers.  So funny.  In fact, I should just see if I have some people trying to get in because spammers,  for some reason, they don't make much effort to hide their spamminess.  So.  Both of these are OK.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm going to add both of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One's Dan Patterson, who was on Sunday.  So thank you, Dan.  And another one.  That social.  Yeah.  But occasionally it'll be like to tell people about my cryptocurrency scam.  At least they're honest, right?  But I don't approve them.  I'm sorry.  Twit.social, twit.community.  Thank you, everybody, for being here.  Have a wonderful week.  We'll see you next time.  With this cat right here on This Week in Google.  Bye bye.  Don't miss all about Android every week.  We talk about the latest news, hardware, apps, and now all the developer goodness happening in the Android ecosystem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm Jason Howell, also joined by Ron Richards, Florence Ion and our newest co-host on the panel,  Wen Tudow, who brings her developer chops.  Really great.  We also invite people from all over the Android ecosystem to talk about this mobile platform we love so much.  Join us every Tuesday, all about Android, on twit.tv.
