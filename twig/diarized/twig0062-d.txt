It's time for Twig This Week in Google to show the covers.  Google and I must underscore the cloud, cloud computing in general.  We don't spend a lot of time talking about that because Google is swamping the news these  days.  They're just doing so much.  Jeff Harvis is here from his office at the City University of New York in New York.  Hey, Jeff.  Hey, there.  Good to see you.  BuzzMachine.com and the author of the book What Would Google Do?  And also of a review in the Huffington Post that we will talk about in just a bit.  Also with us, Gina Trapani from her office in San Diego, California.  Hi, Gina.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Hey, how are you?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Gina blogs at SmarterWear.org and also is doing a really nice new series at Fast Company.  In fact, we have to let Gina go in about an hour so she can go out and do more on her  Work Smart series, FastCompany.com slash Work Smart.  Thank you for being here.  So Gina, you're going to be a little left out of this conversation.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I haven't seen the social network yet.  Everyone's seen it.  No, everyone has not.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It doesn't even open until Friday.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It feels like all my peers have seen it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I went to a screening that Mashable did in the city because I felt like I had  to see it as soon as possible because I know everybody's going to be talking about it.  And I take it, Jeff, you saw a screening somewhere.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I used what little cloud I have and went to Sony and said, get me in please.  And they did.  Why did you feel like you had to see it so early?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  To talk about it on Twig.  Thank you, Jeff.  Me too.  That's my story.  And I'm sticking.  No, I was just curious.  Now, I have to say, I read the book by Ben Masryk, Accidental Billionaires.  We interviewed Ben and Dana Bernetti, who's one of the producers of the movie for Trigger  Street about a year ago when they started the movie.  I had read the Aaron Sorkin script that was circulating on the internet and turns out  to have actually been the actual script, very close to the shooting script.  So I think I knew too much.  Jeff, what did you think of the movie?  You wrote about it in the Huffington Post.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think it's the revenge on the revenge of the nerds.  I was disappointed in it a lot because what I said in my review is that there was no why  there.  It didn't care about what Facebook is.  It wanted to look at nitty gritty of one relationship and gave no motive for why Mark Zuckerberg  does what he does, which I think matters.  So if he's so determined and dogged about doing what he does, well, why?  Well, all they present really is that he either wants to get laid or wants to get into the  exclusive club he couldn't get into.  And that's as deep as they go, which I think is very, very shallow.  And Sorkin has been quoted saying that he doesn't even use Facebook, doesn't care about  it.  He doesn't care about the facts.  He wants to tell a story.  Well, fine, then record it at Schmarberg, not Harvard.  Use somebody else.  And so I think that it was very, very shallow.  And I think what it was in essence was an attack on geeks and an attack on entrepreneurs  and an attack on the people who are changing their world.  And it's more what I see every day and constantly of people who are being disrupted, who don't  like it, who want to lash back.  So what they want to do is demonize Google or Gates or now Zuckerberg.  And that's what they in essence try to do, I thought.  The other characters were often cartoonish.  The Winkleby, as Zuckerberg calls them, are properly cartoonish, as is Larry Summers,  the president.  Oh, man, is he a cartoon?  Yeah.  I think that's Sorkin's populism getting away with him, wanting to make fun of rich people  and intellectuals.  And Eduardo Saverin is the victim in this.  But in terms of harsh business terms, I think that maybe he just didn't fit a CEO.  I've met him once and, you know, nice guy, but he was trying to put tacky network ads  on Facebook and Zuckerberg was trying to do something bigger.  Sean Parker is presented as a drugged out party boy and you'd think that Aaron Sorkin,  given his history, would be a little more empathetic to him.  And in the end, I think that what disturbed me was that it was trying to just attack us.  It was trying to take those of us who see value in the internet and try to dismiss that  value and dismiss one of its architects.  And I think it was, in that sense, lazy.  It didn't try to dig into what Zuckerberg truly is or why he does what he does, because  it didn't understand what he has done.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The book was based on basically one person's story, Eduardo's story.  And Ben Mesrick, who's written other books like this, fictionalizes conversations, fictionalizes  action.  What is left out of the movie is, and something that, by the way, Mark Zuckerberg was very,  and his publicists were very quick to point out when Mark was on Oprah, is that Mark has  a girlfriend, has had the same girlfriend since that time.  So motive number one to get laid is bogus.  And in fact, the movie ends, I don't think I'm spoiling anything with a very poignant  scene about the missed opportunity with a girl that's not only fictional, it has to  be fictional because Mark had a girlfriend.  A lot of what the movie says is the premise for Mark doing this, is his jilting by this  girl and his, it's just funny.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's made up, in the discussion on Huffington Post, where I cross-posted the review, most  people are saying to me, hey, it's not a documentary.  It's not even true.  That's the problem.  It's not even true.  It uses real names.  Citizen Kane changed the name and went with that license there.  There's license taken, but as you say, Leo, it's not even true.  And it goes so far in, I think, attacking him.  A few people said that they thought that he came off well because they were kind of, yeah,  the geek wins.  But I don't think that's Sorkin's attitude at all.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's interesting.  I did not, in fact, you call it the anti-social movie.  I did not, in fact, take it personally, as you seem to have.  I just thought, to be honest, and David Envy in The New Yorker said, not only is this film  brilliant, he said it's Aaron Sorkin's best script, I thought it was a crappy movie.  I was kind of puzzled because everybody's been raving about this movie, including The  New Yorker.  And so what I thought is, oh, well, maybe I know too much.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, we know too much.  We're too close.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Maybe somebody coming in here, like my wife, who knows nothing except that there's such  a thing as Facebook and it's not even on.  Maybe she'll love the movie.  But I think there's missing stuff.  There's some structural things that I have a problem with.  For instance, it intercuts between depositions and the action, depositions, action, and you  never get a chance to watch the story build.  You never get involved in the story because you keep getting pulled back to a deposition.  I have to say, I did not think it was as negative about Mark Zuckerberg as everybody's thought.  Mark is painted as a cipher.  You don't really know what's going on in his head.  Jesse Eisenberg does a great job of kind of lip twitching, like something's going on.  But we don't know what.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Part of that, don't you think that it was rather an effort to make him look rather aspergery?  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think that if there was anything that you get negative about Mark in here is that he  is anti-social, is that he doesn't understand the rules.  He can't understand, for instance, why a woman wouldn't like the notion of being compared  to a farm animal.  It's just like, but it was a joke.  And so as a result, I think it's not negative.  It just comes off that he's just clueless.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But again, I think you're right, though.  It's what it doesn't say about him.  It doesn't get.  And, you know, I hardly know Mark Zuckerberg.  I've been, you know, with, I've met him four or five times.  But in just that alone, he's not...  He's not that bad.  No, he has charm.  He tells jokes.  He laughs.  He smiles.  He acts human.  And that's the thing about his portrayal here by Sorkin and Eisenberg and the director is  that he becomes rather unhuman, kind of a machine man.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you think this is an indictment of all geeks, that we're all a little bit like that?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yes.  I think it's these damn geeks are taking over the world and they're screwing it up.  And all they're enabling is for people to do trite stuff and get drunk and get laid  and look how they're ruining the world.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And they're fundamentally heartless.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yes.  They have no heart.  They have no soul.  They don't know how to interact.  And they're just exploiting us because, you know, they think that relationships are something  to exploit.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It seems to be that in this movie that Zuckerberg is surrounded by this swirling world of people  who don't understand what he's up to, don't understand what he's doing, and in many cases  end up getting taken advantage of, but almost by not by omission, not commission.  It doesn't really seem like Mark's doing anything.  It's just happening.  Like when Eduardo gets fired, it's Sean Parker who really is the heavy in that scene.  And then Sean Parker almost at the same time gets busted for a coke and gets forced out.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  In the story, though, it didn't happen that way.  That was at the party for the site.  It was actually somewhere else that had happened.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was a party for their millions of users.  In the movie.  There's also the problem, which is always a problem with computer movies, is that there's  nothing inherently dramatic about typing.  When they do the best they can, when he's actually creating Facebook for the first time,  they interpose it with the blog postings, which is how that happened in the book as  well.  That adds some drama.  But there's this moment, which I think is supposed to be a pivotal scene in the movie  when they go live.  Yes.  And it's like, hmm.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And that's like, oh, we took the password off.  Yeah.  It's like you press the button, you hit the command and now it's live.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I'm of the opinion that this movie, if it were about schmobook.com or Harvard Connection,  it would be terrible because it only succeeds because of what you bring to it that you know  about the Facebook.  So the only thrill is that's the Facebook that just went live.  Yeah.  Without that, it's like, hmm, boy, that was dramatic.  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I mean, the funny thing about all the deposition scenes is that only lawyering could make coding  look interesting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, they're horrible.  I have to say, I do not think this is a good movie.  The more I think about it, the less impressed I am.  And the only excuse I can think of for why people like David Denby, who I really respect,  liked it is because they're seeing it as a work of fiction.  They don't really know the truth.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It sounds like I'm going to hate this.  Well, I hope.  I want you to see it.  I really want to hear what you think.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I hope you won't be influenced by this.  I do too.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I do.  I do want to see it.  I mean, what stinks for Mark is that this is the thing.  This is the story that people are just going to assume is mostly true.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He's making this huge PR effort with $100 million to Newark, appearing on Oprah, that  puff piece, edited video, which starts with him kissing his real girlfriend.  And you know, Kara Swisher on Twitter said something interesting.  She said, we tried to get Mark to come with us to the premiere.  She said it would have been such an opportunity for him to say, well, it's an interesting  movie, but it has nothing to do with what really happened and to show himself not to  be that person.  I guess he just really doesn't want to see it no matter what.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  On Oprah, he said, hey, it's a movie.  It's fun.  I mean, I know that my life isn't that dramatic, but it's a good story.  I mean, he did kind of say that.  And he made the point to say that he didn't make that announcement on Oprah because the  movie was opening.  Oprah actually said that Mark wanted to make that New York schools contribution anonymously  and that she had to egg him on to do it publicly.  And I have to tell you, I kind of buy that.  He's a shy nerd.  I kind of buy that he wanted to make that contribution.  Then you're the only one, Gina.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I think it's very possible.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's very possible, but nobody in the world believes that or thinks that.  And that isn't going to stick.  It's three days before the movie comes out.  Come on.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And we now know that when I visited Zuckerberg to interview him for the next book and I said  on the show that there was this countdown clock and it's had 45 days.  That was to this Friday.  Oh, it's to the movie.  So they were very aware.  They're conscious of it.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're kidding.  That was the con and they didn't tell you it was the.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, no, he just they're going to release it.  Maybe they're going to release things on Friday.  That's fine.  But it was after I was on the show and I said, I don't know what it is.  God bless.  As always, someone in the show will follow up and they counted up on the calendar.  They said, you know, Dorky.  It's one.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wow.  That's very interesting.  Now, maybe they do have a you know, if this if they are doing a counter PR initiative,  October 1 would be a very good day to make a big announcement that maybe could get some  headlines.  Yeah.  Especially if it's a positive thing.  Yeah.  Right.  And what could they announce?  A phone?  I don't know.  What could they announce?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They're not they're not buying TechCrunch.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We got a lot to talk.  There's a lot of news to talk about.  I did want to lead with this because it is opening on Friday.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I got one question for you, Leo.  Yeah.  The the the victims besides, you know, Eduardo Saverin, his co-founder was in the view of  the movie screwed out of some equity his job and his status as co-founder and fine.  I think that, you know, there's some point to that.  The other ones, of course, are the Winklevies, the Winklevoss twins, as Zuckerberg calls  them.  And that, you know, everyone knows the story that this was their idea, supposedly, and  he took it and ran.  That's what strikes me is just most specious about the movie, because the idea and its  and its genesis is fairly obvious.  There's other things.  The world is about execution.  It's not about ideas.  And I think this is kind of an old copyright mentality versus an entrepreneurial mentality.  And that's part of what the movie also doesn't understand.  So the Winklevies didn't, to my mind, get screwed.  And they got a sixty five million dollar settlement reportedly, though they're now trying to go  back for more.  And in a different world, they would be the villains and they should be the villains.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There is a moment in the movie where Mark does.  There's quite an impassioned speech in one of these depositions.  It's actually the best speech in the movie.  Yes.  Where Mark says, you know, these guys.  I wish I could remember it, but it essentially says I'm the smartest guy in the room.  If you think these guys could come up with a Facebook and he does point to he says Friendster

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  there was another social networking already existed.  I worked up one.  Yeah.  I mean, way before 2004, I had this argument this week.  It was like, no, these guys don't.  Social networking existed.  He executed.  He got the users.  There were plenty of other sites that did the same thing.  Profiles, friends.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think it's in the trailer that a piece of that speech where he says if they could have  invented the Facebook, why didn't they?  And that's I mean, that's absolutely true.  So in some sense, maybe there is some defense of Mark and against the Vinkelvai.  They don't come off that good.  I got to say nobody.  Nobody in this movie comes off very well.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's the other thing.  You know, there is no hero.  It's all dark.  It's this whole world of the geek and the entrepreneur and the rich is presented as  a dark, depressing, inhuman, unpleasant, nasty world.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I've always thought Aaron Sorkin was pretty good with his female characters.  Women in this movie are not treated well.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm going to hate this movie.  And the Ivy League, I would like to point out.  And the Ivy League.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, the Ivy League is even worse.  We don't sue.  We're men of Harvard, says the Vinkelvass at one point.  And then Larry Summers.  Oh, he had some just despicable lines.  He comes off as the most pompous buffoon.  Oh, comedic.  At one point he says to his assistant who's sitting in the room, Louise, punch me in the  face.  I'm about to fall asleep here.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He's practically Thurston Howell III in this movie.  Oh, yes.  Yeah.  And that's the most made up scene in a sense of all, except for the girlfriend stuff.  They had no way in that.  But, Gene, I'd be curious whether you think that the way that women come off badly is  because Sorkin is not treated well or because that's part of his indictment of the geeks.  That they mistreat women.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  The women in this, there's only, there's one sympathetic lawyer.  Every other woman in this is a bimbo, a slut, somebody who's out to meet a rich Harvard  fellow.  Oh, boy.  A groupie.  It's actually, I think it's actually a pretty reprehensible movie.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You're getting madder as we go through.  I am now that I think about it.  It just lost a star.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Another star off.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I love Aaron Sorkin.  I love David Fincher, although Fincher's not exactly kind to women either.  But I think he's a great filmmaker.  I think something went badly wrong with this.  And maybe it is polemic.  Maybe you're right, Jeff.  This is anti-geek polemic.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I don't think, looking at the comments on HuffPost, I don't think that's the way, and  then granted, that's people who are online.  You know, they should be closer to this.  I don't think that's the way it's going to go.  I think that there is a hostility to not just Facebook, but also to the change these people  have brought us.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I'm hostile to Facebook.  So I was, I guess, the natural, but I'm not hostile to geeks.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I mean, it's very true to the book, by the way.  I mean, if you're going to bring the book to life, I guess...  It's just not true to life, but that's okay.  Right.  Yeah, Ben does not write, he writes fictionalized history.  What's the box office prediction?  I think that despite all the great reviews, this is going to tank, because I think fundamentally  most people, even if they're on...  Well, the first two weekends will be strong.  I think it'll die very quickly after, because I think word of mouth will be bad.  I think people will go because they're on Facebook, because there's a half a billion  users, and the promotion for this has been phenomenal.  But I think ultimately it's not a good movie, and I think people are going to come out of  it scratching their heads.  Go ahead, Gina.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I was going to say, I mean, I think that, you know, there's so many Facebook users,  and then there's some media coverage about Facebook's privacy settings and all the things  that, you know, all the ways that Facebook is potentially evil.  So I think there are people who are just like, I want to know more about this.  You know, what really happened?  How did this happen?  And then they're going to believe that the story is mostly right.  They're happy to keep it up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and that's why I think some people, I think it may have more appeal than it does  to me, because I know the story.  If you didn't know the story, it might be very dramatic.  You know, oh, they flipped the switch.  Well, how's it, how, oh, you think anybody will use it?  Will they make any money?  You know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They're at Brown University now?  Yeah.  Oh, they're, they're spreading.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, I love the just a little bit of self promotion.  I launched the ThinkUp beta this week, the first beta.  So it's kind of like some level of stability, good installer, all this stuff.  And so I was talking to my mom and she was like, how's it going?  I was like, well, you know, I launched this new product and she was kind of like, what  does that mean?  And I said, well, you know, I write a blog post that says that this thing is now available.  And she's like, and you know, and I was like, right.  And then he's kind of wait and see what happens.  And I've got this really cool chart that shows you that people looked at it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, they actually did miss a, they didn't miss a bet where they could have shown the  numbers going up.  You know, they could have.  They missed, they missed some, they missed some obvious opportunities.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  These guys don't know what they're not geeks.  I mean, Sorkin doesn't use Facebook.  The lead, I don't know, I don't know what his name is.  The, the lead guy plays Zuck says that he doesn't use Facebook.  I feel like there's a lot of people who, you know, just don't use the product and don't  have a good sense of it.  Maybe that's a good thing, but I think in a lot of ways it's a bad thing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think it's intellectually dishonest of them.  I mean, you're going to try to present some vision of this world and its creator and you  purposely choose not to understand what he's done.  That shows the greatest disrespect of all for the creation of geeks and entrepreneurs  and all of Silicon Valley.  Mark Harris in New York magazine in his profile of Sorkin on this said that this was a well  aimed speed spitball at new media by old media.  Oh boy.  That's interesting.  I think he's right to an extent.  I think that there's, there's something to that.  But I said it wasn't just, it wasn't from new media.  It was from neo new media.  I think we see the creation of what I called a young curmudgeon's club, which is, which  is now Sorkin, Nick Carr.  I think that Chris Anderson from Wired now deserves membership for killing the web.  I love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gladwell?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Gladwell, right this week.  We're going to talk about his New Yorker article, yep.  Rowan, the editor of Wired UK, who talked about proudly why he never uses Facebook in  his position is just absurd.  You're getting more is off.  I mean, you know, the list goes on and on and on of these people who are, who I think  aren't so much old media, I think resist the change brought on.  The young curmudgeon's club doesn't want to give the internet credit for the change.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  My daughter says that there's a hipster anti-internet movement going on that people, even her age,  these hipsters, it's cool to be, oh, I don't do that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Didn't Miley Cyrus kind of start that there for a while?  She did, didn't she?  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know if I'd call her a hipster.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I wouldn't call her a hipster either, but I definitely, right, there's this kind of  group of young people who say like, oh, like, I'm not going to waste my time like that.  Interesting.  Go outside.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I had, you know, and it's really true.  I mean, you know, there's a lot of times a movie's made to make money.  That's what they're saying in the chat room.  But Aaron Sorkin and David Fincher are almost always write movies that are political, that  make a strong political point.  And so I think that it's completely fair for you to ascribe a motive to them.  That is anti-Facebook and anti-geek.  I think that's completely fair.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's very interesting.  As I said, it's the revenge on the revenge of the nerds.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I bet by Friday we're going to have people, our listeners, who are going to be coming  in and screaming at least.  Oh, yeah.  We'll see.  I didn't put it in writing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm going to wait, but I think I will write, I think I should write a review of it because  I, but I, I don't, you know, I hate to write a review before the movie comes out because  I don't want to poison people's point of view.  I'd like to hear what you think.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I was the same way except that, you know, of course, you're a real journalist.  That's what...  So the reviews were at all the major press and I hate being left that far behind and  I wanted to get it up before this show.  So that's why I did it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, no, it's appropriate for you to do it.  You come, you know, you come from an actual reviewer background.  I'm just some schlub.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I saw somebody at Huffington Post said, oh, well, this from a TV critic.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you know about film?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Sorkin was there.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  I love air.  I mean, I got to say, I love, I love Fight Club.  I love West Wing.  I was prepared to love this.  Studio 60?  Studio 60 was my favorite show of all time.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  But I'm in TV, remember?  But see, that was a love letter.  There's really interest.  That was a love letter to TV.  To media.  Yeah, you're right.  Old media.  Old media.  That's why I liked it.  It was a total love letter to old media.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I looked up Sorkin at the time.  Bloggers went after the show like crazy and I looked up and Sorkin at the time smashed  the news.  And said that all voices oughtn't to be equal.

Transcript:  Wait a minute.  In Studio 60, there's a very big moment where one of the actors is very influenced by a  blogger.  That's right.  And the script, oh, that's some jerk in a pajamas.  In fact, it's a big plot point in one of the episodes come to think of it.  Yeah, that's right.  He, okay, his true color's coming out.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, he doesn't.  So this is, he's got the archive here of the stain for this technology created world.  Very interesting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're watching This Week in Google.  Jeff Jarvis is here from BuzzMachine.com, which I think is down a little bit right now.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think it's up again now.  I was just panicking over that and was going to ask Gina to reboot me.  It's probably our fault.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We probably sent a few people there to read your review.  Gina Trapani is also here.  Her site never goes down.  SmarterWear.org.  Not for lack of interest because it's a robust.  Actually, I think we brought it down once, didn't we?  You did bring it down once.  We did.  We did.  We're good at that.  The Twin Army is powerful.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But I don't want the Twin Army to say, no, we're not going to go see that movie because  we want to know what you think.  Oh, no, we definitely want to hear what you think.  Absolutely.  I don't want to scare people away from this.  Hey, it's time to talk a little bit about our friends at Citrix and the great product  that I use to help friends and family.  It's called GoToAssist.

Thank you so much for their support of this week in Google.  All right, enough movie reviews.  I don't want to bore our lovely audience.  They haven't seen the movie yet.  But I do think it's germane because of this anti-geek bias, which I really frankly did  not pick up on initially.  Maybe I'm just more sensitive, Leo.  No, I think you're absolutely right now that I think about it.  There was something bugged me about it.  I knew I didn't like the movie.  Now I realize it's because it was trashing my people.  Don't trash my people, man.  So the federal government, we talked about this on Security Now today.  I'd like to get your opinions on this one.  The federal government is back.  The FBI once again wants internet encryption providers, people like Skype, people like  Google, people who provide encryption solutions, to have a government available back door so  that should they get a subpoena, they can tell the government what really happened.  The Obama administration asked for this law.  They say they will pursue it next year.  And already the EFF and many groups who are promoting freedom on the net are up in arms  over this one.  Any thought?  That's a terrible idea.  It's a thank you very much.  We've seen it before.  It's a terrible idea.  And the courts have ruled against it.  It violates First Amendment rights and it violates our ability to pursue privacy.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like we're going to encrypt this thing, but we have this back door for someone  who has the rights to see it.  Just the government, just in case.  Just in case.  Yeah.  Don't worry.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You could trust us.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, you can trust us.  That's it.  Just a little back door.  Don't worry about it.  We're good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I understand the FBI's frustration because they used to be able to tap any phone.  And now if you're a bad guy, Garry Kasparov, who was former chess champion of the world,  I told Amber this in an interview.  He said when he's dealing with the Russian, because he was kind of a dissident, he ran  for president in Russia.  And he said, I use Skype because I know that my calls cannot be monitored by the Russian  government.  Oh.  You know, I think what happened is the US government looked at Dubai saying, hey, Blackberry,  you got to unencrypt.  And Blackberry said, OK.  I looked at India.  I said, Blackberry, we can't read these messages.  You got to give us the keys.  And Blackberry said, OK.  And they said, hey, we want that too.  We don't want just want it from Ram.  We want it from everybody.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I've.  I'll get in trouble for this, but I'm conflicted here.  I agree with you.  And let me say, make this clear in the bottom line.  I think it's a bad idea.  I think it's the wrong thing.  But I also go back to my, you know, post 9-11 victim war blogging days.  And I want government enabled indeed to catch and stop terrorists.  So I believe in that.  But then I find this scary and abhorrent.  And so my problem is, I don't know where the line properly is.  I can't I can't draw that line.  I'll give you some ammunition, Jeff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All of this encryption already exists and cannot be pulled back.  So if a bad guy wishes to use encryption that's strong, that the government has never back  door to, they can.  If you are writing products outside the US, you make them strong.  If you, you know, so the bad guys aren't thwarted by this.  What it really happens is you and me don't have secure conversations anymore.  If you're a terrorist, either you're not using encryption at all, or if you're sophisticated  enough to be using encryption, you just take the extra trouble to use PGP or something  that's going to work that the government can't break.  Period.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And there'll be ways around.  I think you're right.  So it's already there anyway.  So the horse has left the barn.  Have mainstream services used by mainstream people.  You open up.  Thank you, Leo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I needed that.  I know you need some ammunition.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I just thought I'd give you two.  The other the other part of I think this piece of legislation is the notion of a blacklist  too, which scares me even more that for government to be able to shut down a site.  Can't use that.  Can't blight that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is the this is actually this is a second one.  This is an anti-piracy thing where the DNS would be modified.  Blacklist sites that are violating copyright.  And this one is really reprehensible.  That's truly disgusting.  Yeah, it would put us as a second make us a second class citizen instantly in the world,  the Internet world.  It would again be ineffective.  It's basically censorship.  Blacklist are essentially censorship.  And somebody pointed out if this law had been in effect in at the turn of the century, we  piano rolls would not have been invented.  VCR would not have been invented.  So many technologies that have changed the world for the good wouldn't be here because  current copyright holders would use tools like this to prevent them from succeeding.  It's the Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act, which is actually not a  good acronym, Kawaiika.  It would allow the Attorney General and the Department of Justice to break the Internet,  according to the EFF, one domain at a time by requiring Internet service providers, domain  registrars, DNS providers and others to block Internet users from reaching certain websites.  Chillingly, the law also allows the Justice Department to create a blacklist of sites,  quote, dedicated to infringing activities that ISPs and others would be encouraged to  block.  So somebody comes along and says, you know, this twig show, they keep putting clips from  The Daily Show in.  We really would like to encourage you to keep your users from seeing it.  And it's done.  You can't get to us.  We'd have to hand out the IP address on street corners.  Enter this number.  We're still here.  You just can't find us.  All right.  Just thought I'd bring up those two exciting things.  Let's see.  Did any of you get the Google China warning?  We talked about this on Twitter this week.  I think it was Veronica Belmont who buzzed.  I didn't.  This red warning from Google to Gmail users.  Not everybody.  Warning.  We believe your account was recently accessed from China.  The idea being, I guess, to let you know the Chinese hackers have been trying to get into  your account or getting into your account.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The way that's worded, though, could also mean you have a cousin there.  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  In fact, yeah.  Right.  This is a Gmail feature where it lets you know if two people.  So you know at the bottom of your Gmail, it tells you if you're logged in someplace else  and what the IP address is.  They do some sort of they check to see where that other location is.  And if you're logged in from two very different locations or from very far away, if there's  a new activity, it alerts you.  Which is a fantastic feature.  So that's what it seems like this red message is about.  I mean, this is specific to Chinese hackers, right?  This is this is just the Gmail feature kind of in action.  But why did this?  Why did this get triggered?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's what's weird.  It is that feature, but it's particularly highlighting China.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  So this is so several people have had this.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  From China.  Yeah.  Recently.  Yeah.  And only China.  And in a big red banner, not a thing at the bottom of the page.  Well, I guess you do.  You would get an alert, don't you?  If somebody's been doing that, I think I got.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I don't know if this is related to that or this is something special that Google's  doing just because they don't like China.  I don't know.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So Veronica got this.  What does she do?  Did she like instantly change her?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't think she got it.  I think somebody emailed her saying I got it.  Oh, I see.  A number of people have tweeted it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's wacky.  I would change.  I would change all my passwords.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think that's actually not a bad thing, but I don't know if they should just focus on  China.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Pick some.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Although most hacking does seem to come from China.  When I look at my logs and there are people trying to break SSH, it's almost always brute  force attacks from Chinese IP addresses.  Whether that's a hacker finds it easy to compromise a Chinese machine to use it as a route and  maybe the guy sitting next door, I don't know.  Right?  Right.  It's true.  You don't trust the IP address.  That's meaningless.  Unless it's some guy at a Chinese university who couldn't care less if you know it's him.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right.  AOL buys not one, not two, but three new properties.  They buy Five Min, which is a video property that has five minute clips.  They say hundreds of thousands of them.  They buy the parent company of Brizly, which isn't it ex-Googlers?  I think it is.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's Jason Schellin's Ving Labs.  Jason Schellin worked on Blogger.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Blogger, right?  Good guy.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  Very good guy.  Jason's great.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, good for him because frankly with the new Twitter, I think it was about time to  sell Brizly.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Plus, I remember Jason was going to go to some other company and then something kind  of went awry and then he started this and God bless him.  He also worked on Reader, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes, he did.  Google Reader.  I think it was at Supernova.  Jeff, you and I were at this.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think that one of the kind of head guys at AOL was on stage and said, you know, I  noticed most of you are using TweetDeck.  Yeah.  So the Brizly acquisition doesn't surprise me.  It's a very well known company.  It's a very well known company.  It's a very well known company.  It's a very well known company.  It's a very well known company.  So it's not so the Brizly acquisition doesn't surprise me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Brizly is kind of interesting because it is a web-based.  It's a client, but it's not a standalone client.  It's just a web page.  And I have to say with the new.  I mean, added Foursquare.  It has Facebook.  It has other things besides just your single Twitter account.  So I guess it has some utility beyond what the new Twitter page does.  But the new to me, it looked like the new Twitter page kind of made Brizly a little  less attractive.  I use Brizly and I stopped because I like the new Twitter page.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The irony to me is it also goes back to the ICQ roots that I like saying about AOL and  it's not Tim Armstrong's fault.  He's trying to fix this now.  But AOL asked what business they were in and came up with the wrong answer.  They said, we're in showbiz and we're Merge with Time Warner.  And the truth is they were Facebook and Twitter before, you know, while Mark Zuckerberg was  still learning to eat.  They had all the tools necessary to enable this kind of communication.  And you know, they understood chat.  They understood people coming together to communicate.  They understood content creation and they ignored all of that and thought they were  in the dial up business.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They blew it for sure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  According to Read Write Web, the team is not, Brizly will not survive or isn't particularly  the reason they bought it.  They wanted the team, the engineers, the brains to work on AOL's social stream product, Lifestream.  Have you used Lifestream?  No.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No.  Apparently nobody else has.  Yeah, I do remember that AOL person mentioning Lifestream and everyone was kind of like,  what?  Huh?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Huh?  What?  It's iPhone, Android, Mac and PC.  All your social network updates in one place.  It's been around for over a year.  About five million people use it, which is nothing.  But I might use it now.  I got to look at it.  I tell you, it looks like it combines all these things.  I'm going to look at it.  How many of these are there now?  I'm sorry, Jada, what did you say?  No, I was saying like how many of these?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I said this Tweetdeck and Seesmix.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Hey, Arأ?  Oh.  Well, no, no, it's circular right now.  It's allunone after

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  all.  Oh.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, anyway, yes, there are a couple of these.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yep.  But the big acquisition is tech crunch.  When GigaOM published this story, I thought, oh, this is just wishful thinking for Moe  Malek.  I thought that can't possibly and it happened.  Mike Harrington invited an AOL executive on stage at Disrupt and said, so, in fact, I  think he signed the papers.  Yes.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Didn't he give the audience the opportunity to veto but to boo the deal?  And they didn't.  Peter Shoman.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think it was a $40 million deal that Mike was not going to scotch no matter what the  audience had to say.  That's the rumor.  Anywhere from $25 to $40 million for tech crunch.  And I presume it all going, mostly going to the pocket of Mike Harrington.  You got to wonder though, there was a great joy of tech geek culture cartoon, which an  executive at AOL is going, how soon before I can get rid of this guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's driving me crazy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Mike said, this will affect our coverage of AOL.  We won't be able to write any positive AOL stories anymore.  It's a nice spin on it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, I mean, AOL inquired Weblogs Inc. and Engadget.  They run Engadget.  Yep.  And Engadget is still really good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You'd barely know it was an AOL property.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Jason sold out way too soon.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, Jason.  Jason is not happy.  We're talking about Jason Kalakannis, who's been tweeting basically death threats ever  since this happened.  I've never seen anybody.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Probably because they split up their event business, I think, so that Arrington could  sell this clean, you know, nice and cleanly.  And so, yeah, he tweeted to Arrington, you want my bank transfer numbers?  Sorry, Jason.  Hey, it's business.  Hey, Mr. Savarin, it's business.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Boy, that is one reason to see this movie.  The way they get Eduardo Savarin out of Facebook, it kind of rang true for me.  I could see that happening.  Yeah.  That part, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I guess Mike and Kalakannis used to do TechCrunch 50, TC50.  They had a kind of public blow up.  In fact, I talked to Jason shortly after that.  He said, Mike just disappeared.  I had to finish the...  Mike just disappeared.  And he's been calling Mike...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's the funny thing though, Leo, it's so redundant to use those two names and say  blow up.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Of course.  I know, I mean, these two were just like...  Who haven't they had a blow up with?  It's like a three-week circus.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He even made me the nicest person on the internet blow up.  He did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He found Leo's fuse.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He lit my fuse.  In fact, both of them have kind of pissed me off.  Oh, probably.  Yeah.  I'm not working with people who make me angry anymore.  It's just bad for my blood pressure.  And the two of them are peas in a pod in that respect.  They both can get you going.  And here's the funny thing, I have a lot of respect for both of them.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They're smart.  And I'm very glad for Arrington.  I think that he...  I was talking to my students this week and Rafa Ali was coming into my class and I said  he was the journalist who became the accidental entrepreneur and Arrington was the entrepreneur  who became the accidental journalist.  And he went through his rough periods and was very Arrington, but by God, he built an  amazing thing.  Everybody reads it.  Everybody reads it.  You have to read it.  You bet.  And his event that I went to was really good.  And yeah, he can be difficult, but that's probably why he is where he is.  And he did good for you, Mike.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Big stars always have big egos.  I mean, it's just the way it is sometimes.  And I'm sure...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Where Sorkin makes the movie about TechCrunch.  Now, see, that's a movie I'd go see.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know Perez Hilton, but I can imagine he might have a little bit of an emotional  temperature.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think the Perez movie would be great.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That I'd see.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anyway...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Perez is a character though.  Does this change how TechCrunch covers the news?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't think it has to.  I mean, I think, you know, in Gadget, like I said, it's still good.  I think that...  I don't know.  I think Arrington will go so far out of his way to prove that it won't.  Yeah, maybe.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  As long as Mike's there, he's going to be throwing spitbots at AOL.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think so.  Yeah.  And I give him that.  I give him credit for that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He has to though at this point.  He can't not.  Yeah.  We have another big story, a couple of big stories that we're going to get to.  Amazon's kind of going, gunning for Android in the marketplace.  We'll talk about that in just a little bit.  We are talking about Google in the cloud.  And then this week on Google with Gina and Jeff and me and Carbonite.  Carbonite is my favorite backup solution.  Everybody ought to know about Carbonite.  It is online backup done right.  And why do you need online offsite backup?  Well, it's absolutely critical to any backup solution is the ability to backup away from  where the originals are so that if the worst happens, fire, flood, tornado, earthquake,  or just bad guys breaking in, that your data is somewhere else safe offsite.  You got to have it.  I think any good backup also should be automatic because who remembers, oh, I got a backup  on Sunday.  No, you should happen all the time.  So that's what happens.  Carbonite runs on a PC or Mac, runs in the background.  By the way, very transparent for the new Carbonite 4 on Windows.  It's so lightweight.  You don't know it's there.  But whenever you're online and not doing anything, it's going here's some more data, here's some  more data.  It uses your broadband connection to upload using 128-bit SSL.  So you can even do it at an open access spot to the Carbonite servers where it is, of course,  multiple backups there as well.  You can also encrypt it, AES 256, which the government has no backdoor to, by the way.  And you, in fact, are the only person with the key.  That's also possible.  So you can have absolute privacy of your data.  But whenever you need it back, whether it's for fire, flood, or human error, oops, I trashed  that file, you just go online.  And this is the neatest thing about the Carbonite.  You can go online on any computer and there's your data.  So you don't have to install Carbonite on that machine.  You don't have to do anything.  That data is there.  It's always available on any computer.  Even they even have a free iPhone app and a BlackBerry app.  Same thing.  You always get your data, check it to make sure it's there.  This is what you should have for backup.  I want you to try it free for two weeks.  You don't even need a credit card.  Just go to carbonite.com and enter the offer code TWIG.  T-W-I-G.  Please use TWIG.  I know people a lot of times forget and they use TWIT because that's, you know, we're all  TWIT.  No, please use TWIG because otherwise Carbonite is going to say, well, you know, nobody listens  to that TWIG show.  Carbonite.com offer code TWIG two weeks free.  And by the way, if you do like it and you say, I think I'm going to buy this, use TWIG  when you check out and you'll get two months free.  It's less than 55 bucks a year for every bit of data, all that personal stuff on your internal  drive.  That's a good deal.  Carbonite.com.  Backup done.  Right.  Amazon says we are going to launch our own app store from Android.  The story from TechCrunch this week.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Pretty interesting.  It's like they're going to launch like the Apple iTunes, you know, the curated version  right of the Android market.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's something we've been asking for, isn't it?  Yeah, I think it's a great thing for Android, isn't it?  I guess.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think so.  There's some extra restrictions on developers, but developers have a choice of where they  want to list their app.  So you know, hey, if it does well, I guess my question is what is going to be like the  consumer?  You know, why is a consumer going to use the Android or the Amazon market over the Android  market?  I mean, I guess if they're on Amazon already or.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well I'll use it if I feel like it's vetted.  I mean, we all complain about the fact that there's 1800 wallpaper apps.  You do a search on the Android marketplace.  It's hard to find what you're looking for because there's so much crap and a lot of  the developers use popular names.  Like if you search for Angry Birds, you'll find 20 things that aren't Angry Birds.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, yeah.  And the other thing that Amazon, the other problem that Amazon can solve is the payment  problem.  There are certain, you know, the Android marketplace doesn't take certain credit cards.  It doesn't take Amix.  If you're buying, you know, an international app, there's like restrictions.  So I wonder if Amazon will be able to let you buy apps maybe that are more difficult  to buy.  I think Tasker and I have my Amix set up and it doesn't take American Express.  I had to set up another credit card and I said, oh, screw it.  I'm not going to go through all this right now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Although the Google payment, which is the normal means in the marketplace, works fine  if you have a Google account.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, yeah, I don't know.  I got to figure out why that's not set up because I definitely have one of those Google  checkouts.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It might be international.  It's not international.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, Tasker's an international app.  So that was it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  For each now and this, I think, and TechCrunch mentions is, I think it does kind of imply  that Amazon's going to do an Android based tablet.  So it would make a lot of sense if you're making the hardware.  That's why Verizon is doing the vCast Android store because they're selling the hardware.  So it makes sense to have a kind of, you know, it's on my, it's on this, it's on this  DroidX.  There's, you know, you go to the standard market application and there is a Verizon  tab of vetted.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, so it's a, I see.  So it's a separate tab.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it is in this, in this, in this case, it's a separate tab.  So in fact, it takes the place of on a stock Android install of the downloads tab, which  is kind of annoying.  That's hidden in the menu.  You hit the Verizon tab.  It's not just Verizon apps.  Skype's in there.  I mean, there's, it's approved apps, right?  Bing is in there.  So most of them are from Verizon, but not Bustamove, not Rhapsody.  So these are things that Verizon is presumably vetted.  There's Kindle for Android.  This is you.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Who would, whom would you trust more to curate quality apps?  Verizon or Amazon?  Amazon, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Now I am, according to TechCrunch, Amazon's going to take a chunk.  They will pay a royalty equal to the greater of 70% of the purchase price or 20% of the  list price of the purchase date.  I guess the list price is you could have a list price on other app stores and then have  a discounted price on Amazon.  I guess that's the point.  Yeah.  There's a $99 developer fee.  So I don't know why you would pay that if I guess because you want to be in the store,  right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You just want to be in the store.  Yeah.  So that puts up that just that little barrier that's like you've got to be serious about  that.  That eliminates the wallpapers.  It eliminates the wallpapers.  Exactly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It says, and this is I hope not true, that there's going to be DRM on it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, well, perhaps.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The only work on devices they approve.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I hope that's not the case.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that's not the case, too.  That's crappy.  And there's this other caveat that if your app is available on other platforms, you have  to make sure to update it at the same time on Amazon store that you do in any other store.  It's fair.  I just don't know how easy that will be for if there's an approval process.  Oh, I guess if there's an approval process on Amazon side, but if everyone's got a store  and you've got to submit your app to all the different places and wait for approval.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's to encourage you to use maybe just the marketplace in Amazon, not do a vcast  marketplace Amazon.  That's probably what that is.  Maybe.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Maybe.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Free apps are allowed.  That's interesting.  And it's US only.  Amazon says, we quote, we have the sole discretion to determine all features and operations of  this program and to set the retail and to set the retail price and other terms on which  we sell apps.  So this is like books.  They're saying, we'll tell you what to charge.  Yeah.  Isn't that interesting?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, the other rumor TechCrunch had was of an Amazon tablet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  So that makes sense, right?  Tablet and store should go together.  Right.  That does make sense.  Why?  I guess it does.  I guess Amazon's emboldened by the success of the Kindle.  I never could understand why they wanted to be in the hardware business.  You got something?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, you sell an Android tablet with the Kindle app installed on it, where you can  purchase books.  It's just the way more tricked out Kindle.  If you want the Kindle with the touch screen and the color, you get the Android tablet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Have we talked about that great Kindle ad where the guy sits next to the beautiful woman?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I love that ad.  I feel like they nailed the two things that the Kindle does better so well, the E Ink  and the price so well.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes, I can read it in the sun and it's $130 and you're never getting to date me, big boy.  Go away with your shiny iPad.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I paid more for my sunglasses.  Yes.  I love that line.  It's so perfectly done.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It kind of says it all, doesn't it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yep.  Well, you know, Schmidt, when you talked to TechCrunch this week, I think positioned the  war in a new way as edge versus edge.  That's to say that he said, oh, the device doesn't matter.  The device is dumb.  The device is meaningless.  It's the cloud that matters.  And of course, Apple says, oh, the cloud, big deal.  Everybody has a cloud.  We have the devices.  And Amazon is in an interesting position where they're kind of trying to play both now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We are the cloud and we make the hardware.  Google TV makes an early public appearance.  This is the Sony TV.  They're going to make an announcement in a couple of days, but apparently, according  to some Gadget, yeah, and Gadget, it showed up at a Best Buy at the press event at the  Best Buy in New York.  It's an NSX 46 GT1 model.  And it has I'll show you it has little apps at the bottom of it.  I see TNT, YouTube and Farmville.  Just what I want.  Farmville on my TV.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  America activity goes right down.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Farmville really, really?  Oh, dear.  Well, I guess you can't stop.  Yeah.  Well, here's CNN, TBS.  So, you know, I thought it was very interesting that Hulu Plus is is going to show up on the  new Roku box.  Yeah.  I think these boxes are, you know, this is going to give Google TV and Apple TV run for  its money now.  Yeah, heating up.  Things are heating up.  Yeah, I like that competition.  Good thing.  Yeah, my Apple TV is in Alaska.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What?  My Apple TV is in Alaska.  And why?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You ordered one.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, it's Alaska coming to you.  It's not.  It didn't go to Alaska.  It's on its way.  Yeah, I ordered one, too, although I ordered it later, so I don't get it for a while.  I'd be very curious.  I don't like the idea of a streaming only device, although I use the Roku like crazy.  So there, I guess I do like that idea.  All right, we're going to take another break and come back with our because we got to we  got to let you go to work, Gina.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  She's going to work smart.  No more hanging out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No more hanging out.  We're going to get Gina's tip.  We're going to get Jeff's number.  And I have a tool of the week, which I tried and was not impressed by.  But I'm going to tell you about it anyway.  It's overpriced and didn't work.  But other than that, it's great.  Just like the movie.  And don't go see that sucky antisocial movie, the Antisocial Network.  Let's let's talk a little bit.  This actually is a new sponsor and it's kind of a little different thing for us.  This guy's a friend of mine.  His name is Tom Johnson.  I met him six years ago and he he wrote what eventually became Microsoft's hosted exchange  services.  It was a company called FrontBridge, sold it to Microsoft, got it, you know, said, I'm  going to relax a little bit now.  And but he said, but you know, spam is such a nasty thing.  I'm going to write the ultimate spam solution.  And now this is not a this is not a client side solution.  This is not an application.  This is really not for an individual.  Most of us are using Gmail.  Gmail does a very credible job at spam.  This is for either a company that wants to host its own mail, doesn't want to trust its  mail to Gmail or some outside service wants to run its own mail servers or and I think  a lot of us are in this category.  I am people who have their own servers.  I use leoville.com.  I know Gina, you have your own servers.  K. Shepezer has his own servers.  I've been using mail route on my leoville.com for six years.  And Tom, every once in a while, send me my stats in the last 12 months.  Now this is what's cool about mail route.  If you go to mail route dot info, by the way, you can sign up 10 percent discount for life.  You just you know, you don't even have to use our name or anything.  Just go to mail route dot info.  That's a special page for twit listeners, twig listeners.  And I guess but again, you have to be able to change your MX record.  That's how it works.  But the nice thing is it takes it takes three seconds.  So if you were running your own server or you're an IT department or whatever, you change  your MX record.  So the mail instead of coming to your server first, it goes to your leoville.  Mike is leoville.com.  The MX record says no, send that to mail route, goes to mail route.  I think of it as sewage treatment plant.  It gets rid of all the garbage and then comes back to my server.  Let me tell you how many messages did not go through my server because of this last  12 months.  I was sent three million seven hundred ninety three thousand seven hundred thirty eight  messages in one year of the three point seven million messages I was sent.  Three point six million were spam.  96.5% of the traffic that went to leoville.com never arrived because of mail route.  And by the way, zero false positives.  Tom is a stickler for this.  You don't miss any critical mail.  You just don't get the junk.  Last month at a three hundred forty two thousand messages sent to my leoville account, ninety  six point eight percent were spam.  And I never saw it.  I want you to try mail route right now.  Just go to mail route dot info to find out more.  If you sign up there, you'll get 10% off for life.  Ninety nine point nine nine nine percent uptime for message processing.  And that's nice because even if your server goes down, leoville goes down all the time,  I crash it.  I don't lose any mail because they do something called mail bagging.  They spool it out.  They hold on to it.  And when my server comes back, they slowly send them send the mail on.  So I never miss any mail.  It's really easy to set up as long as you can change the MX record.  You could be running within minutes.  You could sign up right on the website.  No long term contract prices start as low as two dollars per user per month.  The more users, more seats, the more boxes you have, the cheaper it gets.  Outbound services can be added for an additional 50 cents per user per month.  So you have to worry about your own mail getting black hold.  And it's month to month.  There's no long term contract.  Tom says we don't lock you in because we know you're going to want to stay here for life.  I've been with him for six years and I am just so happy with mail route.  If you need to run your own mail servers, if you want privacy, if you run servers for  family and friends, that's what I do.  MailRoute.info.  Do you run your own mail servers, Gina?  You use Gmail for everything.  I don't use Gmail for everything.  Yeah.  This is not for you because if you use Gmail, you're very happy with the spam filtering.  I think mail route's better.  But it actually what happens for my mail is it ends up at Gmail now.  I used to use fast mail.  It goes to Gmail now.  I really don't see spam because everything is double filtered.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's amazing.  Those numbers are astounding.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Can you believe that?  98.8% of my email is spam.  It's crazy.  I mean, real spam.  If you look at my, I should show you my mail store.  And never a false positive.  mailroute.info.  Tom Johnson is the nicest guy in the world.  I love him.  Old friend.  He'll treat you right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm getting nostalgia for John.  I get no spam, Devorah.  I know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Every time he said that, I just...  Because I actually had a good solution.  I should have been telling you about this for years.  I apologize for not telling you about this before.  mailroute.info.  All right.  Time for Gina's tip of the week.  Gina?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This is actually for Gmail users.  One of the things that defines Gmail is that it automatically groups all your mail into  conversation view.  Everything's a thread.  You don't see an individual message for each reply.  And for years, since Gmail launched, people have said, is there any way to turn that off?  I hate it.  I hate it.  I don't want that.  People hate it.  They finally are launching a way, they're adding a setting where you can turn off conversation  view.  I was shocked by this because I felt like they were so adamant about the fact that this  was the way that you did email.  But I feel like now they feel like five years has passed and people know and now you have  the choice.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is one message and now they're all stacked up.  I can't figure it out.  I don't understand it.  It's too complicated.  So how do I turn it off, Gina?  Tell me.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So in your Gmail settings, this is a brand new setting.  They're rolling this out over the next few days.  So you might not have it yet.  I actually don't have it yet.  But in your settings, there is a conversation view, a brand new conversation view section  where you can say, you can turn conversation view off, which means that when you look at  have a message with 12 replies that will show up as 12 entries in your inbox.  It won't be all grouped into one conversation.  So what I mean, a lot of re re re or forward forward forward down your box, but some people  prefer that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's how most male clients work.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's how most male clients work.  And at this point, I'm totally acclimated to the conversation view.  They really kind of convinced me.  It's amazing that people are still real vocal about the fact that they don't want things  grouped and now you have the choice.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's watch because I'll turn it off and I'll go, oh, yeah, now I understand.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  For new Gmail switchers like you, Leo, you have you do have the choice.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm the one that's good.  I can't.  I what?  Where?  Huh?  It confuses me.  I'm easily confused, obviously.  Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I've got a number.  I mentioned one thing first, if I just may real quickly, that a pioneering blogger named  Hossein Dirakshin, otherwise known as Hoder, who variously was credited or not credited  for helping start the incredible Iranian blogosphere, was sentenced to 19 and a half years in Iranian  prison this week for things that he has said on his blog.  And so it's one of us folks.  If you go to even Zuckerman is suggesting that we pressure the Canadian government to  pressure Iran.  So I just wanted to mention that Hoder is an odd duck.  He changes opinions a lot.  He had some very strange opinions toward the end, but he's still a blogger who who lack  of free speech is in prison.  So I just wanted to mention that.  Now the number.  One million is the number and I'll use it twice.  One is that Google just announced that they are funding a company called Shweeb to the  one million dollars for suspended plastic cycling pods on a monorail.  That's useful, don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Shweeb.  Shweeb.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, there's the adolescent Leo comes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, come on.  Tell me that's not the first thing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  And so it's the damndest thing.  I can't imagine there'll be bicycle powered tracks that may be safer than the what's the  thing the guy died on this week.  The trolley that the Jesus I'm being an idiot.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, the guy who drove his Segway off the cliff.  Segway off.  Yeah.  So maybe this is safer than a Segway.  That must have been a suicide, right?  No, he brought the company.  It was an accident.  It was an accident?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  Not good for Segway sales.  He was testing the new one.  Yeah, he went off the cliff.  Oops.  Yeah, oops.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I feel terrible laughing.  I shouldn't laugh either.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But boy, I thought I just I didn't read it closely and I thought, oh, well, he must have  driven off the cliff.  It was an accident.  It was an accident.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a happy, nice guy who just bought the company.  And then I'm so sorry.  That's terrible.  Yeah.  Well, I'm just full of joy at the end of the show.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How do you drive a Segway off a cliff?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I could do it.  I guess.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm clumsy enough.  I'd do it.  Don't go near cliffs on your Segway.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  OK.  Oh, have you driven one, Gina?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I have not.  I have not.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I've actually managed to fall off a Segway.  I'm like I'm like George Stanzo.  I love the Segway.  I think you would be able to do a layout.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But I was taught me how.  So that's you know, I got a lesson from a master.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So the other use of one million real quick is that Vinod Koshla was at TechCrunch Disrupt  and told a story that's been around, but he confirmed it that Excite's George Bell rejected  buying Google for one million dollars.  Koshla talked Larry and Sergey down to $750, and Excite still rejected that.  Current market cap $167 billion.  Excite dead.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And where's Krause these days?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think the aliens got him.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  Joe Krause, the guy started Excite.  How much money?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  One million and then talked out.  I can't believe that Koshla was going to talk him down, but talked him down to $750,000  and Excite still rejected it.  Too expensive.  Talked him down.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I give you $49.95 and a hot dog.  So my pick is something that Adam, is it Dashis?  How do you say Adam's name?  Dachis in Lifehacker?  Oh, that's a good question.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think it is Dachis.  D-A-C-H-I-S.  Dachis.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Dachis.  Wrote about and promptly brought the site to its knees.  But it's a great idea.  It's called Rainmaker and they have an announcement on their site.  I went there immediately after I read the Lifehacker article to sign up and all I got  was an Apache error message every time I tried.  Thank you for your interest in Rainmaker.  We're experiencing very high traffic at the moment that is slowing our sinks.  Trust that we are working around the clock to fix the issue.  Well if it gets fixed, this is a great idea.  It ties all of your social networks into your Google contacts.  So you can sign in.  Let me just see if it's working now.  Let me just sign in with my Gmail here.  It is not cheap in the long run.  Grant access.  Okay.  Now what I'll do is I'll give my Facebook and Twitter.  Yeah.  That's what I thought.  It's the price of fame.  It's the price of getting life hacked.  That's what it is.  But it's a really great idea.  It pulls your data, contact data from Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter.  Combines.  Now my phone does a little bit of that, but this is a little bit smarter than the phone  for doing this.  And I'm very impressed.  However, I got to tell you, it is not without a price.  If you look at the pricing, there is a free version, they call it Drizzle, that you get  $10 per raindrop.  $25 to start.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Lock that metaphor.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, it gets worse.  If you pay $9, you get the sprinkle.  And you get 100 raindrops a month.  A shower is $2.50 a month for $20 a month.  So it's a little pricey.  Basically, they call it CRM for Google Contacts.  And I have to agree.  If your contact list is really important to you, this is a very nice way of combining  contacts from all of the social networks.  Not updating them automatically, updating the phone numbers, updating birthdays, all  the stuff that you need, who's connected to who.  I think it's kind of a neat idea.  And I look forward to it working someday.  I've probably now put another nail in the coffin of Rainmakers.  Don't try it now.  Don't try it yet.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, the Rainmakers' admins are just like, oh, God.  Not again.  They're crying.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That was, by the way, one of the great moments from the Facebook movie when Zuckerberg said,  we never go down.  And of course, last week, as I watched it, they went down.  Go down.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, he was mad at Eduardo because Eduardo closed the...  I know I shouldn't.  Spoiler alert, but doesn't everybody know this?  Maybe not.  Anyway, I won't say it.  The other thing that is a great moment for geeks is when they bring the Harvard network  down.  Yeah.  And that's actually pretty neat.  There's a couple of moments that you will like, Gina, like geek moments.  Like when his buddy comes in and he's creating Face Smash, which predated Facebook.  Was it Eduardo?  Maybe it was Eduardo.  He says, Eduardo, what is the ELO rating algorithm that you were telling me about?  And he writes it in marker on the window and then Zuck implements it into his system.  It's kind of cool.  There's some geek coding moments that I liked.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  All right.  All right.  I'm going to see it.  I'm going to see it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'll let you know what I think.  Tell us how wrong we were, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Say how great a movie it is.  This is nice, Jeff, to review a movie before it comes out because nobody can gain, say,  anything.  They don't learn.  Oh, they have been.  They have been.  Really?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's not a documentary, man.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, that's true.  It isn't.  Not even close.  We're going to let Gina and Jeff go because Gina has a date with a fast company, fast  company.com slash work smart for Gina's great new video feature on getting things done.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm off to do a shoot, but I'll be back for the full 90 minutes next year.  Next year.  Next year.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's the Freudian slip if I ever heard one.  Gina Trapani is at smarterware.org and of course, as I said, fast company.com slash  work smart.  Jeff Jarvis, the author of What Would Google Do?  He also blogs at buzzmachine.com, which is now backup so you can read his pan of the  Facebook movie.  We will end today.  I'll let you guys go with, I don't think we'll play all 10 minutes, but the weirdest Google  ad or what?  I don't know.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Pizza.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's, it's, I don't even know why.  I don't even know why.  Thanks everybody, we'll see you next time on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Say you're in Chicago and you're really hungry.  Pizza.  See?  I just got all the pizza places nearby.  Your phone knows where you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pizza.  Pizza.  Pizza.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For 10 minutes.  Pizza.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't understand what's happening here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why is he doing this?  Pizza.  Pizza.  For 10 minutes.  Pizza.  Pizza.  I actually feel sorry for the guy.  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Pizza.  Is this their response to the Bing ad?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Maybe that's what it is.  Schmidt said it had big worries that maybe this is, maybe that's what it is.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Pizza.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Pizza.  I missed the dog the first time.  I like that.  Pizza.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pizza.  But I don't understand why.  Pizza.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Pizza.  They're saying this is a loop.  Pizza.  Maybe it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pizza.  Pizza.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Pizza.  Thank you everybody.  See you next time on This Week in...  Pizza.  Pizza.
