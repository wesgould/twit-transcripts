Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Happy leap day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Happy leap day, the 29th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not wearing blue and yellow today, but.  Where did that come from?  The leap day Williams 30 Rock.  Yes.  Disappointment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that show aired a few days ago and already blue and yellow is it.  It's like become like it's in stone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Any minute I'm going to sprout gills and you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And 10 years from now, people wear blue and yellow and they won't know why.  Actually, it'll be 12 years from now.  They won't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was an excellent cultural commentary on absurd holiday figures and rituals and customs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I missed it.  I didn't see it and I still know about it.  It's really fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Jeff Jarvis is also here, the author of What Would Google Do?  His newest book is called Public Parts.  He blogs at BuzzMachine.com and teaches journalism at the City University of New York.  Hello Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I have a new venture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ah, I downloaded mine, but I haven't had a chance to read it.  This is a little bitty book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a Kindle single, only a buck, folks.  I want number 12 on the Kindle single list.  Just like you guys got me up higher in the debate over privacy.  Come on, Twig Nation.  Come on.  It's only 99 cents.  So what's in this book?  It argues that it's not a book.  It's just a neat book.  It's just 6000 words.  It argues that Gutenberg was the original technology entrepreneur, that he went through  all the same challenges that a technology entrepreneur goes through today, solving technology problems,  developing in secret.  And then later he became more open source, putting together a team, finding capital,  finding customers.  And he was done in, in the end, by his cash flow and his cap table.  But even so, he obviously disrupted the world in a way that we all hope to do today.  And I think he's the patron saint of Silicon Valley.  And that's what I argue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  That sounds great.  Six thousand words.  Six thousand words.  And it's selling all right, it sounds like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's no more than a typical Twig rant from me.  So is it a profit deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  I mean, I'll make, you know.  It's all profit, I guess, isn't it?  It doesn't cost you anything.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, you know, Kindle single was actually very easy to deal with.  They said last week, okay, we'll go with it.  Within a week, it was copyedited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, so you have to get them, who is they?  Amazon?  Amazon.  And do they do the copy?  Copy.  Oh, okay.  And do they do the copy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did the copy editing and they created the cover.  And that was it.  It was very easy, very pleasant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they take what percentage?  They take 30 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just like Apple?  Yeah.  Neat-o.  Well, you sent me a coupon, so I can't say I bought it.  But maybe I'll just buy another one.  I can't though, because I've turned off third party cookies and I can't log in.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Damn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, Jeff.  Is this your first self-published?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I wanted to learn how.  It also says to people, whenever people say, well, you're against paywalls, Jarvis.  You think Kindle has no value.  Well, I'll sell you this too.  You know, I want to learn about it.  I want to try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look, we're all going to have paywalls soon and I hope you enjoy them.  That's all I could say.  I'm referring to an earlier conversation, which was not recorded and had nothing to  do with coffee, so don't get all excited.  It's the world of first parties only.  I am sad that I did not go to Barcelona for many reasons.  But Mobile World Congress has been amazing, including a keynote from our fearless leader,  Eric Schmidt.  I can't remember him.  He doesn't usually do keynotes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He does mobile.  He did a technology and mobile event in Germany some time ago.  He does them on these kinds of industry events, which would surprise you, but he does do them  occasionally.  It was good, I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was very good.  Now, according to Steven Shanklin, writing for CNET, he says the summary of Eric's speech  is with the Internet, the weak will be made strong unless dictators try to keep too much  control.  Is that a fair?  I didn't watch it.  Is that a fair synopsis?  Well, it's not a synopsis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He obviously showed off Android and everything else.  But yeah, I think morally it's a synopsis.  It says, beware people.  It's the same discussion we don't want to have again that we were just having about  regulation of things like cookies and third parties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can talk.  I'm just not going to say a word.  I'm over the end.  My bottom is still sore.  I don't want to hear more spanking, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want to know anymore about that.  So he was warning against regulation today that you think has this impact that in fact  has another impact.  And so yeah, I think that that was the moral message here.  But he was really also being terrible.  You know, he's a technology optimist even more than I am talking about self-driving  cars and how it's going to save unbelievable numbers of lives and how robotics will make  a difference and how more data will be helpful in our lives.  And this goes to the conversation we were having before the show started that it is  up to, Gina was saying, up to media and advertising to show the benefit of cookies.  And it's up to, I think, technology companies like Google to show the benefit of what they  do in creating new technology.  And if they don't, people are going to continue to be scared of it.  I'm not sure that extolling a highly optimistic, some would say utopian future is necessarily  going to be credible with everybody who's scared.  But I still think it's worthwhile saying if you if you tamp down here, folks, this is  what you may give up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it's funny, I used to be afraid for the net because of big companies, net  neutrality and companies like Comcast and other stakeholders trying to give the record  industry, the movie industry trying to kill the net because they saw it as a threat to  their business model.  Now I realize what's going to kill the net.  It's its users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow.  I'm stunned.  You thought you were in trouble before?  I am stunned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I mean, really, I truly believe that this knee-jerk terror over tracking is going to  yeah, no, I think it's going to really be a problem because it just makes it impossible  to create the free stuff that we create.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amy, you brought it up, Leo, that's pretty clear here.  Yes, I agree.  Absolutely. I think that's the danger is that we're getting into a moral panic over  technology and we're acting as if it's big companies doing it.  And yes, some of them are.  Yes, they do boneheaded things.  But we have to be concerned about the unintended consequences of the impact on the tools  that we so love and depend upon and the freedom that that brings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think my issue is I don't think people understand technology pretty much at all.  Most people, people watch this show do, but most people do not understand technology at  all. And so this is so complicated of a subject that even we who do have a difficult  time explaining it and understanding it, I despair of normal people getting it.  And the easy headline, the easy takeaway is Google tracked you on the iPhone and that's  it done. That's all you need to say.  And that's forever in people's minds. And it's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, one of the most amazing, I think, not amazing, one of the things that really fits  in with that argument and what Eric Schmidt said was that he basically said, I'm trying  to find it here before some other earlier.  Technology will disappear.  It will just be there, which is part of the view.  So we don't have to know about it.  It's underneath everything.  But when you're afraid of technology, when it seems mysterious, when you don't know what  it does, that's perhaps the wrong way to go.  Because then people get more frightened of what they don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Now, Gina's of the opinion that the media companies like this is what Eric Schmidt  did, but, you know, he's preaching to the converted when he's standing on a stage at  Mobile World Congress.  But you think, Gina, that if that Eric needs to do more of this, that everybody needs to  explain this. And is that going to solve it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I think being clear about what you're doing, what the what the benefits of  shared and aggregate data is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can't be because it's too it's too complicated and technical a subject.  People don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff's book, Public Parts, straight up plug.  I mean, he's doing the good work of saying, hey, these are these are the benefits of  living publicly, putting your data out there, sharing data.  I think things like Flickr defaulting to public tools that default to public and the  benefit that we get out of those things.  I think it's important to tell those stories, to counteract the moral panic stories.  I think Google, with their privacy policy consolidation, which goes into effect  tomorrow, is in a really good position to say, look at this huge suite of products that  we have and now that we can share data, you've agreed to let us share behavioral data  between them. Look at the value we can provide you.  Right. So they're in a really good position to show that.  And I do think I do think it's about telling telling a better story.  I think that it's in the media company's best interest to just be transparent and upfront  about the fact that if they're offering free content, you know, you're the product, not  them. You know, this this idea that if you use free service, then you're handing over  your information and we're providing value.  It's a fair trade. I mean, I think that there are a lot of people who aren't  technologists who look at free services, look at like Facebook and think, how is this  free? How is this company worth so much money?  And it's free. You know, why do I get to use this thing for free?  We have to stop telling the free story and just be honest.  It isn't free.  You give your information and they provide a communication service.  And that and that is a and it's a really it's a fair trade and it's beneficial in a lot  of ways. So I just and you know, this is what we do on the show.  This is what Jeff did with his book. And I have more hope about it, Leo.  It sounds like you've had a rough week that we can turn this around and that we can  tell the story and in a way that's not overly technical, but just be more upfront  about the idea that if you're not paying for a service, then you are then you are the  product. Maybe that's not such a great way to put it.  But just just get people used to the idea that sharing your information, if you share  your information, then you get these benefits and then you get to use these tools.  If you don't want to share information, then you don't get to use the tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not going to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People want Facebook.  They want it for free. They have no idea that it costs money.  They don't understand the server costs money.  They have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think there's some uneasiness about it.  I think this is where the moral panic comes from.  You know, like there's some uneasiness with people who don't understand technology or  like they love Facebook.  They don't really understand why it's free.  You know, they're going to see these stories about the IPO and gazillions of dollars.  It's going to involve. And it's sort of I think it's just this like big mystery to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  folks. Well, and then what happens because of the moral panic is the thing that Google  did, which I agree was wrong on iOS, is because of the moral panic, because Google  considered saying, well, we want this information and realized that people would  say, you know, they would be freaked out.  So the engineer in them said, well, we're really not doing anything bad.  We're just going to set this plus one button.  So let's just do it. And I think what you're going to see is two things will happen.  So there's going to be this moral panic.  Companies will try to sneak more because you can't I'm telling you, you can't say, hey,  we just want to track you for advertising purposes to give you a free service.  People go, what the hell with that?  It's like if, you know, look at this doesn't affect us.  Twitter doesn't use third party tracking cookies.  It literally does not affect us.  But if somebody started, if everybody started using ad blockers, that would affect us.  Right. So I could think in my head of that.  People just everybody uses ad blockers.  You say, but wait a minute, it's a free service.  You use ad blockers. We can't do it.  People say, well, you know, figure out a way because we're going to use it and we're  going to use ad blockers. And then the companies do figure out a way.  They sneak around. Then government gets into it.  And now we're really in trouble.  Right. And I think that's exactly what's happening kind of right now.  Anyway, moving on. At one point, Google considered having its own currency.  By the way, Facebook's already doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Is it Facebook doing this?  Yes. They've got those kind of those cards.  I see them in like not the same way Google was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google was going to do like a Bitcoin, a peer to peer money currency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Eric said the reason that the reason the reason they chose not to was not because  of technology or logistics, it was because it's illegal and governments fear it  because they wouldn't have control.  And people could just have exchange on their own and governments don't like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And governments hate that idea.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can we just take a moment and say how cool would a Google Bitcoin be?  How cool would a Google Bitcoin be?  Would be cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were going to call them Google bucks.  Your Google bucks. I think they should have called them googs or something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But now I should warn everybody that if Google did that, it would be to make money.  Just so you understand, they didn't do it.  They didn't. They didn't. They wanted to do it not because they were nice people,  but because they wanted to make some money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Damn.  You need a vacation. Damn them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I show you a nice video from Barcelona?  Please cheer me up. Here's mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look, they do it outside, which is kind of cool.  Or is it the Android booth?  So some of it's outside, some of it's inside, I guess.  There's a robot, cheery little robot.  How could that be bad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it gets better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're making, they're making all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Flushy androids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, we want, we want.  Smoothies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's ice cream sandwiches, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You see, this is exactly how they subvert you.  I just want to warn you.  This is how I got into the cold.  They make you think they're nice people with fuzzy little robots,  and then they make money off of you.  They're greedy capitalists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow, Leo really is.  Man, softly. This is not fun to Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's start singing the international, Leo.  What if I, I got to find the ice cream sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, a bunch of commies.  No, no, there's ice cream sandwiches in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow. Where about jelly beans?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there was a jelly bean photo in a private meeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I really regret not going this year, because this is, this is,  this is clearly where this is where the rubber meets the road in technology is.  And I think next year we'll have to be at Mobile World Congress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that was that was Eric's main point, too, is that we're just at the point where,  you know, two billion people are on are connected to the Internet.  There are seven billion people in the world.  There's so much growth to go.  They're going to come on through what we now would call smartphones,  but we'll call something else and, you know, an Android in every pocket.  And that's where he's headed. And it's about connectivity.  Yes. And then making money as a result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, of course, it's Jason Sparrow, who's head of mobile sales, sales folks,  who said that I cannot take you to today.  He said that a billion people will be using mobile as their number one  way to get online by 2012.  Primary method this year, a billion people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's just a change.  Mobile mobile is just mobile where we're always going to be mobile.  It's the future. Where we are. It's connected.  But here's the other problem. It's going to know where you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's and I think that that really is a big issue with mobile  is that these things really are spy devices.  They've got GPS built in.  I mean, tracking cookies is like so 1990.  This stuff, this stuff really knows exactly where you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And people like, you know, where you ate pizza, Dennis Crowley had on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, Denz is talking to Mobile World Congress,  the guy who started Foursquare, he wants to do a new Foursquare  that lights up a map wherever you are.  You look at this map and it shows all the things that Foursquare recommends,  all the places your friends have been.  In fact, they've got an NFC chip now that instead of checking in.  And this actually is going to be critical to the success of Foursquare.  You just tap your phone against the NFC thing and it says, I'm here.  And if we could just get everybody to do that,  then we could really make some money.  But seriously, this is the benefit you get from all that tracking,  is that now you know where your friends have been, what places they like.  But there's tracking involved.  So I wonder if this sudden  it feels like puritanism, the sudden puritanical privacy  concern is going to just kind of make all this stuff shrivel up.  I mean, you need there's a trade, you get some benefits from this.  And mobile is absolutely critical in all of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hate I hate to plug and make money because of it.  But that's exactly why I wrote the book.  That's exactly what I fear, that it's not about the privacy is important  and it's worthy and it needs protection and we all have it.  And there's nothing wrong with it.  But it is being used as a guise to come in and regulate the technology.  Same as piracy, security, decency,  civilization, in the case of Sarkozy.  These are all guises of why governments are trying to come in and regulate the net.  And we're falling into a trap, people.  We're falling into a terrible trap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina, Gina goes, I'm on a show with two crazy men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I, Jeff and I have have different, you know,  Jeff really is like he's slowly changing my mind from week to week.  I just I feel that I need to represent the technologists.  And these aren't people that don't understand what's going on.  I mean, this is our audience.  If you look what's going on in the chat room, this is our audience.  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.  People that know what's up. Yeah.  That feel really wary about these things.  And I my default setting is to feel wary about these things.  And I think that comes from two things.  I'm a woman and I've had a crazy guy sending me crazy emails for three, three or four years.  So Google's not a person right now.  I understand. I understand.  This is a human using tools.  I'm just saying that before I broadcast where I am, I think of this crazy guy.  Right. I understand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think that that's part of this is that biologically, we conflate  a reader that's scanning your email with a human being reading your email.  It isn't really reading your email.  What Google's doing, right.  But we conflate that because biologically, that's all we understand.  Right. And even technologists conflate that.  I mean, you're a technologist. Yes, that's true.  And you use the word read my email.  I'm not reading your email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there are people who run those servers and there are people who set up the security  around those servers. So there's always the issue of not not only unintentional data leaks.  So I opt into Google Latitude and it's kind of automatically, you know, and I opt into it  automatically broadcasting my location.  You know, that's something that why didn't you worry about that when you were using email

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  for the last 10 years, sending it through multiple anonymous servers, unencrypted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think about email like sending a postcard.  Any any server that it goes through, I just assume that it can be, you know, that there's  a copy made and that it can be published.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is not new.  No, this is not.  Use the Internet and you're in effect in public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If what you're worried about is malicious spying.  And actually, Google's done the work of the angels by putting HTTPS on all of that traffic.  So, in fact, only Google can read your email, not anybody in the middle.  Only that bad engineer, only that guy, code monkey at Google can read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When I feel victimized on the net, it's because of people.  It's because of dorks.  Idiots, a-holes, people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. But did you guys saw the New York Times article about how Target can can build up  a profile of consumers?  And so so I feel uncomfortable with the idea that Target knows that I'm pregnant before  my parents do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, fascinating story there, because that was not the headline that the New York  Times used on its very well thought out.  I think he was nine months writing that piece and it got very little traffic.  But when the was it the Washington Post, Jeff, who was it that republished it with that  headline?  It was Forbes.  They got all the traffic.  They got all the traffic.  This guy did this really wonderful article and all the traffic went to the sensational  headline, not the actual article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, that's just unfortunate.  But it underscores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, there's a reason I brought that up.  It underscores that there's a sensationalism there.  The truth is that that people like Target do it all the time and they do it without the  Internet. They do it in a variety of ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, through your club card, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Your club card. They track when you call them for help, they because you have a Target  ID and they're aggregating every bit of information every time you identify yourself to  them of every kind of activity.  And it's been happening long before the Internet.  Marketers have always done this.  I can remember very well.  Twenty five years ago, a guy there was a great book.  In fact, I should try to find this book where they just showed everything they know about  you from where you live, you know, from your zip code.  I could tell you what magazines you subscribe to because people flock in the same group.  It's not hard to get all this information without tracking cookies or anything else.  And it's been done for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have I told on Axiom, if I told this in the show before, if you have taught me, you can  go to Axiom today and you can request and pay for the names and addresses of it.  I'll really creep you out here.  Yeah, I can find women single 20 to 35 within two miles of my house who are college  educated, who are at least this much.  I can get their names and addresses not because of the Internet, but because of free  Internet databases that exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we go back to use and harm versus technology and gathering.  Right. The use here is if you use that to become a masher.  Well, that's the problem.  The harm is what could go wrong.  But the fact that this data exists has been there for ages.  Why? Why are we suddenly in this moral panic?  Because we're scared of technology as a society, which is because we just we want we want

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  control. So when you got your diagnosis, you said you were public about it.  But you said that you were not public about it until you had spoken to Jake about it,  your son. Right.  Yes.  How would you have felt?  I mean, so your doctor knew.  I mean, there were there were certain your medical records.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Definitely. I wanted that control.  Yes, absolutely.  And if no one should lose that control, I don't think anyone should be forced out of  the cancer closet.  Absolutely not.  Right.  What I argue instead is, A, if one is generous enough and I believe it is an act of  generosity to be open about it, benefits come.  B, I completely agree that apart from the obvious cases that are legislative of our  societal behavior of employment and insurance and apart from our own stigmas, there's no  actual harm.  There shouldn't be a harm in society of saying you're sick.  There shouldn't be.  There shouldn't be.  There shouldn't be. Right.  So what I'm arguing is if we're going to examine ourselves as a society, if we're going  to fear things, I think we should fear the fact that we have a stigma against people who  are sick. It's medieval.  And that's what we should be examining and changing in society.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true. That's true.  But right now, if you're if you're a woman who has a career and you're trying to get  pregnant, you know, that's something you try to hide because you don't want people to  know that because I can affect your career.  If you're high school and you're gay, that's something you want to try to hide because  there's a stigma.  So, excuse me, so we do have to separate technology from society.  What I'm saying is that there are totally legitimate reasons why you want to keep things  private. And I think that the idea that there's technology that people don't really quite  understand that that could mean that they don't have control over protecting those things  about their lives, you know, that can affect them in a bad way is what freaks people out.  But I understand it's important to separate those things.  I think it's really I'm really grateful that you wrote the book.  I am out of the closet because I believe that it benefits people to be public about things  that are are pretty I mean, to me is private.  But but but I think you have to acknowledge, like the fear around this kind of automatic  I do data sharing and what where that comes from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what Leo is saying, I think, Gina, is that is that we also have to not be carried  away with that fear when it is a fear that is that it says I'm uncomfortable or I'm  creeped or things like that, that we have to deal with the specific harm and the balance  that we are making, especially when that balance affects technologies in more ways than we  will admit right now. And this is what Eric Schmidt was saying.  Watch out, folks. You're going down a road.  And he said in a few years, you're going to regret it.  You're going to regret that you let government come in and control the technology, the actual  technology and how it operates because of the present fear.  That's the issue. I'm trying to find here.  I quoted a blog today that was a guy named Panta.  And I'm not going to fight right away.  You see, I get that.  He talked about how. Yeah, here it is that that we we are.  That we have a weird view of privacy now and that we've got to look differently at it.  We have a broken idea of privacy, he argues.  And it's gay bar gay dog, hyphen gay hyphen bar dot com.  And it's a wonderful post about this.  And at the end, you know, he says that if Galileo had kept his ideas secret, then, you  know, because he had fear, what would have happened?  Where would he be if no homosexual ever out of themselves stepping into the public light  in endangering not only their social status, but also drawing a lot of hate rejection their  way? People would probably still claim that being gay was a normal or abnormal.  Privacy is not your brave protector.  It is. It's an invisibility potion, he says.  It means that nobody can see you, your ideas, your thoughts, your feelings.  It not only means that you could not be heard, it also means that your voice, your words,  your actions cannot give courage, inspiration and hope to so many people on this planet  who might need it. You have every right to privacy.  Nobody should be forced to say something that they want to keep secret.  But the privacy based on hidden by default approach is a danger to us as a society.  I think it's very well said.  And that's the moral of what I'm trying to say.  Privacy is important.  I will not force you up, but let's also recognize the benefit of having the courage  and the benefit not to be.  And the main reason we choose to be so scared and hold in is because we're scared of the  unknown.  Well, Galileo was right to be scared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He was almost burned at stake.  Yeah, he was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Jeff, you and I agree a lot more than it seems.  But these conversations are always extremely very useful to me to help.  As I said on Twitter, to help kind of take you.  Obviously, I'm not doing it for the sake of the public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not doing a good job of getting, you know, I'm serious of getting into this  conversation and places like policy centers and places like that, that that there's a  steamroller going on here.  And I haven't figured out how to stand in front of it in a way that doesn't just say  after because because I'm not grappling with the kinds of fears and concerns you're  talking about very well.  And I know that.  And I'm somewhat at with and try to find that bridge that says, but hold on, folks.  Yeah, I understand this, but there's also that.  And I have another job of it.  So it's very useful for me, too, to have these conversations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you've done a pretty good job in the book.  I think more people have to read the book.  I think that's the moral of the story.  More money.  Listen, I'm a full on capitalist.  I have apps in the app store.  I charge money.  I used to be a hippie commie now complete capitalist.  So I'm all for it.  By Jeff's book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff, I'm sorry, not Jeff.  Andy Rubin writing in the global Google mobile blog or the global mobile blog says that  eight hundred fifty thousand new Android devices are activated every single day.  The total number of Android devices, I don't know if I buy this, but this is what he says  in the world are three hundred million.  Holy cow.  Four hundred fifty thousand apps.  A billion app downloads happening every month.  Now, remember, Apple's about to cross twenty five billion, but I think Android's pretty  darn close and growing very, very quickly.  There are a hundred plus Android devices on display at Mobile World Congress.  Oh, is that good or bad?  Isn't that interesting?  He says there are eight hundred plus devices have launched every single day.  Plus devices have launched since Android came out.  A hundred of them are new at Mobile World Congress today.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's doing well.  Andrew is doing OK.  He's doing well.  That's a good question, though, whether or not all those devices is is a is a good thing.  It very much is like a paradox of choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google must feel so they want to they're now going to release their own tablet as if we  didn't have enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we don't have the right one yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we don't.  We don't have the right one.  Well, really isn't a good Android tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Will a Google tablet change that?  I I don't think the Galaxy Nexus, for instance, is the best Google phone out there right  now, is it?  No.  And it's a pure Google experience.  I don't think it's even close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Eileen, Eileen, that's your cue.  Come on in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, she agrees with me.  It's just I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She doesn't even use the Nexus.  No.  What's the best if I would get a phone right now?  It might be HTC One.  Well, that's not available yet.  That's in April.  But if I were to get a phone today, I would probably go with the Droid Razer Max.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because you want battery life.  I want battery life.  It's awesome.  That's what's different between her and me.  She is all about battery life.  I'm all about screen size.  And the point is we have a choice.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I can you get old young lady.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You'll have the same problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We don't want a big screen.  But see, I don't care about battery life because I have five now count them five  batteries for this thing and I keep them all charged.  I keep them in my pocket.  I keep my glove compartment.  I keep them in this.  And if I need more juice, I just put in a new battery and I get it.  You know, you get about eight hours or nine hours.  So it's not like I'm.  Have you talked to your shrink about this?  We know he said it.  Yes, I did.  As a matter of this morning, he said, can I borrow one?  Because my phone is that I do wish they'd standardize on the batteries.  So that would be that would save me money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We actually had a really good conversation about the word choice in the Android.  Apple calls it fragmentation.  Right.  And versus somebody wrote us a letter saying, please stop using the word  fragmentation, please start using the word choice.  Made a long conversation about this on our last episode, which controlling

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  companies like media companies call it fragmentation.  Consumers call it choice.  Interesting.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There really needs to be a website though, like a single serving website.  That's like, what is the best Android phone right now dot com?  And it's like, I want better battery life and then just gives the answer.  I want a bigger screen.  You know, because honestly, I couldn't answer that question.  I mean, I'm so glad I have a little Hylene.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Check boxes.  Well, that's what all about Android is all about.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did we show the video from the Best Buy Saturday Night Live video?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Verizon one, we did show that.  We did show this.  You mean the Verizon one, Jeff?  We showed that a few weeks ago.  Yeah.  Oh Verizon.  That's why our show got pulled down two weeks ago.  So, I hate YouTube fashion.  Anybody who thinks I'm a Google shill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just talk to them about YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, or a bunch of other things.  Anyway, I don't think I, to be honest, I don't know why Google's making a tablet.  I guess they feel that just as with the phone, they may need to make reference  implementations.  Yeah.  Show the way.  Yeah.  There are, according to Andy Rubin, 12 million Android tablets sold.  I find that extraordinarily hard to believe.  And it's the case, 8 million of them must be Kindle fires.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But he's not, I don't think he's counting Kindle fires in that.  Cause it's not an Android brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It can't be.  What did you guys think of the, of the Asus Pad phone?  I didn't see that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that is one of my picks.  Oh, it's really amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, is that okay?  No, go for it, Jeff.  You should talk about it.  I love this.  I love this concept.  It's phenomenal.  It's an amazing video.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, I'll go to the Asus.  It's a 4.3 inch smartphone.  Yes.  So not super big.  That's on the biggish side.  Um, however, it converts to a 10.1 inch pad phone station.  So you dock it.  You dock it.  Now, how is this different from the Atrix?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you dock it into the tablet.  It powers the tablet and then you can actually dock the tablet into a keyboard.  So you've got all three.  Wow.  So it's a running ice cream sandwich and it's actually got a pretty  vanilla skin on the phone itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So really it's like a babushka doll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But even better, the stylus that comes with it becomes your, your  handset becomes your receiver.  So, so you are, so you get a, you could buy a stylus and then you  could use the stylus to say hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stick the stylus in your ear.  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You use it.  It's like the world's thinnest little phone.  Yes.  It's hard to feel very masculine when talking with it, but.  So wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hello.  This thing, this thing sounds insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're saying that the stylus, this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a bigger stylus.  Hello.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When it's docked into the tablet, because you can't answer the phone, right?  Oh, if it's docked in the tablet.  So, well, but we got a stylus for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can I get a little rubber band or something to strap it to my head?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it like a Bluetooth like ear thing?  Is there a little?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a real stylus.  I got to find a picture here.  That's just bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you know what?  This is exactly what we're talking about that Asus because Android's free and  it's open can develop the craziest wackiest stuff.  And this is good for everybody.  This is wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wish Steve Jobs is alive just to hear what he would have to say about this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, he'd hate it.  It's got everything he doesn't want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He would despise this thing.  That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what?  There's this is a we live in a world where there's room for Steve Jobs and Andy  Rubin, and I think that that's what we want.  That's called choice, not fragmentation.  No matter what Apple wants us to call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just love to know what word he would choose.  Appalling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Crap.  What I love about this is that you also saw there's the thumb drive sized  Linux box, right?  Yeah, the Raspberry Pi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  So a lot of interest in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pi 5, Bluetooth, all this stuff.  Right.  So there's a new view here that you carry the computer power around.  You can plug it into lots of different things.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think what it's saying really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's the CEO and he's using the stylus now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What it's saying really is that all the innovation, all the excitement is  happening in mobile, that your mobile phone is your computer.  And so it makes perfect sense if your mobile phone is your computer to give  you give you ways to make it work with a keyboard and a bigger screen and all  that stuff.  You know, there are a number of people have done kind of just random  experimentation using a Bluetooth keyboard, HDMI out of almost any Android  phone into a 27 inch screen.  And you're, you know, so I think where Google really needs to go is with  Android and make it more of a compatible desktop operating system.  And I, is that what ice cream sandwich is that what jelly bean is that where  they're going?  Is it, is it something that we're where Windows eight is going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is where it is where Microsoft's going.  Absolutely brought to the desktop before Google did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was, that was of course the big story this morning as Microsoft put out  its consumer preview of Windows eight.  I did not get up at six in the morning to watch.  But if anybody watched Steven Sinovsky, well, you know, we'll talk about  tomorrow Windows weekly, but I think this is, I think this is all exciting.  This is, this is what you want.  You want let a million flowers bloom.  Many will be failures as the, who was it?  The Samsung guy at mobile work Congress a couple of days ago said, well, yeah,  the tablets that's not been so good.  They didn't sell so well.  That's great.  That's fine.  And Samsung's a big enough company that they can take the hit and try something  else that I think the note and all indications are the notes going to be a  big runaway hit for them.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's where they're trying to focus at this point.  Cause it's a phablet.  Well, yeah.  And they also introduced a 10.1 version of that as well.  That I don't get.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How is that different than a, than a galaxy note?  That I mean, a galaxy tab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there it does.  It does a few things different.  There's going to be split screen so you could see a browse and then also take  some notes.  I mean, they're, they're positioning a little bit different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  3.7 million.  Okay.  Moving on.  I don't want to do any numbers.  No more numbers.  Just in case Jeff has dibs did.  No, they're fine.  And actually, uh, I guess Andy took down the tweet that you wanted.  Yeah, it's not there anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Party tweet down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me see.  Cause, uh, it says, sorry, that page doesn't exist, but maybe that's just a  bad link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  Cause how can you kill a tweet?  You can't kill a tweet.  Yeah, you can.  You can't believe it.  Are you kidding?  Just ask Rupert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fun Android party in Barcelona last night.  Thanks to everyone who joined into Timo Moss, Calvin Harris and Goldie  rocks for the grooves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's wrong with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought it was going to be something more salacious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I just wanted to say he was having fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's good.  He's having fun.  Hey, you know what?  You go to Barcelona and you don't have fun.  There's something wrong with you.  Uh, Barcelona, the parties though, started like three in the morning.  You're supposed to, you're supposed to go home after a long day, take a nap, eat  at 10 and go out at midnight.  Right.  I think that's how it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh man.  I'm too old for that.  Like part of me, that sounds really fun.  And most of me is like, Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why they live on paella.  Uh, I am excited about this HTC one.  They have three models, the X, S and R it's a quad core 1.5 gig.  I'm sorry.  There's two of them.  So if you get the AT&T, forget I said quad core.  Unfortunately, the, the AT&T will be merely dual 1.5 gigahertz snap  dragons, but that's because of the Tegra, the LTE chip set and the Tegra  don't go together, but the Tegra three will be in the U, the universal version.  So you'll probably want to get that unless you want AT&T LTE.  This is right.  You need a spreadsheet because if you want AT&T LTE, you can't get quad core  because this will be a 720p 4.7 inch screen.  So it's kind of somewhere in between a phablet and a phone.  It's a phonablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You need a little glossary of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, it will have a sense 4.0, which looks pretty sweet.  So this is, this is going to be an ice cream sandwich phone with, with  the new HTC sense on top of it.  Uh, looks pretty good from what I saw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looked great.  We got the beats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's got the beats.  We got the beats.  Can somebody get me my Ting phone?  Is there anybody around?  I want to show off this Ting phone.  Is there, and there's nobody here.  Oh, it's, it's in the drawer.  I keep my phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It will take an hour to find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just bring me all the phones.  It's in the drawer in the left.  It's a, I don't even know how you're going to know which is which.  Anyway.  Oh my God.  This is a new, actually a new advertiser, uh, doing Android phones.  They're very excited.  We'll talk about that in a second.  It let's see what else, uh, the, the, uh, uh, wah, wah way.  That's how you say it, right?  Wah way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ascend D quad the fastest phone in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I put it in here because it seemed impressive and quad core is the buzz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Quad quad quad quad core.  Um, but see, this is, uh, also 720 P everything's 720 P, except now we're  going to see 10 ADP is next.  You're going to, there are phones are going to be 10 ADP.  Get ready for that.  Um, so, but what is the D quad is the internal processing power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot of the first impressions I've read have been pretty, uh, look how,  the reviewer's look how ugly it is.  It's too sick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It looks like the fastest phone in the world, doesn't it?  It looks like it was painted with beige paint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People seem to, people who saw it seem to be impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the only reason anybody who's impressed by speed will be impressed.  But the point is there are a hundred new handsets, Android  and sets at mobile world Congress.  What was the projector built in?  Yeah.  The Samsung Pico projector built into the top.  So you do your PowerPoint from your phone.  Uh, and of course, and this is where I think they made a mistake.  Nokia announced a phone with 41 megapixels in its camera, but it's, it's 41.  I didn't make a mistake there.  That's the actual 41.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's running Symbian, but it's running Symbian, not even Symbian,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  not even Symbian 60, it's running an old version of Symbian.  And I think that what they said is, well, we've been developing this phone for five  years.  That's what we had five years ago.  So it's not going to be, it's going to be a very strange phone.  It's also thick.  It's got to be, it's clumsy.  And when you take the picture, it shrinks it down to eight megapixels or five  megapixels in order to get it looking good.  So in order for it to fit on the phones, yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Memory.  It's actually, you know, it's a bigger chip than a most point and shoot cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it is, you know, and there's some merit to the, it should be a nice camera.  I don't know who would buy it, but I guess somebody's serious about camera  Isn't there some sort of point with megapixels where the more that you have, it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  doesn't matter as much.  I thought it was around 10 or 12.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's a, that's a complicated long conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, probably not for Twig, but I thought that at the point at which  here's the issue, really the chip size is what really matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you have two choices.  As a chip gets bigger, you can either get the pixels bigger and have them receive  more light and be more accurate, or you could increase the size of the chips.  Increase the resolution, which is what Nokia did.  But the problem is now you're beyond the refraction limit of the lens, especially  a little lens like that.  So you're not going to have a very crisp image.  So they knew that, you know, you wouldn't ever take a 41 megapixel  besides the size would be huge.  So what they do is they shoot 41 megapixels and then they squeeze it down and that  handles all the refraction issues and so forth.  And so you get a good eight megapixel.  It's very, very crazy.  So AT&T decided that they're going to have, let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is, this is, this is a little bit complicated, but, but if you explain this,  because I read it and I don't understand it.  Here's the deal.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Basically they're double dipping is the deal.  Yeah, they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what happens is Google is paying for the bandwidth to get to the internet.  You're paying for the bandwidth to get from the internet.  Right.  Right.  And now AT&T says, well, we're going to create this new thing.  It's like an 800 number call.  So we can convince you it's free.  And what it really is, is the worst violation of net neutrality.  You can imagine, because what it says is you can, a, a, a, a app maker,  developer can buy the privilege of your app's bandwidth, not counting  toward the user's bandwidth cap.  So you can use this product with impunity.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what, what AT&T gets paid a third time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you didn't just pay to the developer, right.  Or the developer control, right.  Whoever controls the app.  Right.  And, and so it's fairly evil because they're trying to convince you,  oh, this just makes it free.  Now you don't have to worry when you're using that app.  You're not worrying about your cap that we don't really admit to you that we have.  But isn't that good for consumers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, because what it says is now this is a free app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, because what it says is now this is, this is, this is the exact violation of  net neutrality.  That means that only apps that have the money to pay for this privilege will get  this kind of coverage and the rest of the apps will more and more and more will be  discriminated against as they say, oh, sorry, you're not using one of the special  apps, you're using one of the crappy apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So for instance, we couldn't afford to do this.  So, and we wouldn't want to do this.  It's stupid.  So, uh, sorry, if you watch Twitter, it's going to go against your, you  know, a hundred kilobit bandwidth cap or whatever it is, but you could watch,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you could watch if you'd prefer AOL.  They, they wouldn't charge you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't it?  Horrible.  I'm telling you the world's going to hell.  I got, there was a fight with somebody on

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  May I show you a photo of an ice cream sandwich?  Oh, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you had one, I would take it.  That would cheer me up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have those at Google I.  Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yeah, maybe they will.  And what else were they going to have?  All those glasses that we can wear and see what's going on for real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They might have some jelly beans, Android glasses and ice cream sandwiches.  I am so there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would love to see some research on how much this iOS debacle has  hurt Google's reputation.  And I wonder if, you know, Google has been historically a very good brand,  but I wonder if that brand is getting tarnished by all of this information.  You know,  do you think real people, in other words, are paying attention?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think real people know about this.  They don't care about the third party cookie thing, about the, the I-frame.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think it's starting to spread.  I think you see it on TV.  I see, I see these supposed tech reports on supposed TV news and you know,  wow, watch out, they're tracking you.  And then, you know, the anchor comes back and says, well, that's mighty creepy,  Sally. Yes, it is.  You know, it's happy.  It's at the level of happy talk now.  And this becomes the accepted narrative.  And you have a place like the Wall Street FN Journal doing this.  And, you know,  listen, the actual reporters are doing this.  I'm not, I'm not  besmirching their ethics in this whatsoever.  But I think that they're falling into a company line here  where Rupert Murdoch hates Google.  And it comes out with his arguments that Google is a pirate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As Kara Swisher pointed out,  Julia Angwin is not doing Rupert Murdoch's bidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I'm saying. No, she's not.  But, but, but the higher ups are happy to promote this.  I watched a scene in Davos.  I wrote about it and I didn't put it up,  but because it just seemed kind of old and inside baseball.  But it's relevant where the top digital editor from  Wall Street Journal was at the Google briefing at Davos.  And he just started channeling Murdoch about piracy.  Well, go look up a movie.  And Eric Schmidt just went into it and said, well, why don't we look up  Mission Impossible, since that's what Rupert had complained about.  And it was just parroting exactly what Murdoch was saying in Twitter and elsewhere.  And it was a top editor of the paper doing it.  So, yes, the attitude does seep through.  Now, I'm not even questioning that he doesn't actually believe it.  But there is a company line there and it's a company that there is.  The report is out today that Chase Carey, C.O.O., I think it is, of News Corp.  floated the idea today.  I've been saying this since last July of News Corp.  spitting off its newspapers.  Only 20 percent of their, I think it's profit,  maybe it's revenue, is revenue, I think, is newspaper oriented.  It is an entertainment company.  It is a paid content company.  That's what News Corp is.  And so he doesn't really care about the ad business anymore.  And that's part of the reason he's shooting spitballs at it.  Sorry. I absolutely agree.  I, I, I, Julia is a wonderful person. I respect her. She's smart.  She's not by any means doing this, but I think it's falling into,  you know, out of out of orders from on top.  It's too subtle for that.  It does seem to happen. It's somewhat self-serving.  Oh, very, very.  And the path here is Murdoch himself  trying to slam Google at every opportunity.  So back to your question, Leo, you get enough of that happening  from companies like this being read and repeated by Happy Talk,  Bozo's and TV and newspapers.  Then it does have an impact on the brand and on discourse  around large technology companies being after you. Right.  And that's going to affect all of us geeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it already has, because the Wall Street Journal no longer lets you  read the entire story from Google.  The first click free program has moved on.  I noticed this too.  This is an article by Danny Sullivan in Search Engine Land  that when you look up or try to read that Wall Street Journal story about the  Google work around on the Safari privacy settings,  you didn't get the whole story.  And it used to be if you get through Google News, you click and we get the whole story.  No, you have to you have to pay for it.  You have to log in and pay for it.  And apparently  this is something that's been going on for a while.  Vice president of corporate communications for the Wall Street Journal says  as a strategy, we hold back a few of our top stories by not having the full story  crawled, which limits selected articles from being available via first click free.  We've been doing this since last summer.  I did kind of notice it as a strategy to encourage subscriptions.  I couldn't figure it out because sometimes it would work, sometimes not.  Now, I have a Wall Street Journal subscription, so  I was forced to remember my password and log in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I just click away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you do? I just click away.  I'm like, oh, oh, I guess I won't read that.  I'll read somebody else's paraphrase of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep. I mean, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the London Sunday Times still has my two pounds.  That was such a it was such a nightmare process to buy  because I was trying to read the story that they wrote that really now you you want to  you want a good example of this,  Jeff, the London Sunday Times, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch,  published a story on Sunday, which made me very suspicious, saying that  everybody, Facebook, Google,  Twitter, everybody,  all the apps on your on your Android phone  were uploading everything that you knew to their servers.  All your texts, all your texts, texts.  They were listening to your YouTube was turning the camera on and watching you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And Facebook is about it.  Leo, you're right, is that it got quoted, but you couldn't read the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Couldn't read. I tried to pay the two pounds and I couldn't figure out.  I had a feeling when I read it.  Oh, you know what? This is not any research or this is them looking at the  permissions in the app saying, well, they ask for permission.  YouTube asked for permission to use your camera.  So they must be using your camera.  And that's the story, I think.  But I couldn't find and I tried to pay the two pounds and I couldn't.  And I never. So finally, Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Send these people the oatmeal comic, the Game of Thrones.  I mean, you use Game of Thrones as the example, but it works for everything.  Someone in the chat room asked if I click away from the New York Times  after the first 20 freebies, I actually pay for the Times.  I have a subscription to the Times, so I don't have a subscription to the journal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I I not only pay for the Times and the journal.  Apparently, I now pay for the London Sunday Times.  I don't know how long this two pound charge is going to continue.  But Facebook had a response, which essentially confirmed what I thought,  which is, no, we were we were doing a test with some people,  but we do ask for these permissions.  The Facebook Android app does not.  Read your text messages, except in a very limited case  where people were informed ahead of time, this is a beta test of  some software we were trying in the messenger.  It was News Corp again.  And it was. I mean, that one was really well,  the best case you could say, well, that was just trawling for clicks. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Worst case, it was part of the.  Here's here's how I know this happens.  The insidious part about a mogul company is not that the mogul  ever tells anyone what to do.  He doesn't have to. The underlings try to please the mogul.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We always knew what Paul Allen wanted.  I mean, the only time when I when I worked at News Corp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tom Merritt knows where his bread is buttered.  Let me tell you.  You won't hear a kind word about Apple in this show.  I'm sorry.  See, now people are going to believe that they are there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. And Tom is going to confirm it because he goes, I can't say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Tom will say, intentionally say the opposite of what I think,  just to get a picky vote, which is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When I was TV critic, a TV guide owned by News Corp,  I actually was never told anything.  I was given far more interference at timing.  And I actually use this as an antidote to defend Murdoch  when he bought the Wall Street Journal and defend his lack of editorial control.  The one time I was told anything was that  Rupert was a big fan of Moesha.  Honestly, God. And if you don't like Moesha, Jeff, it's OK.  But you better be prepared to defend that decision.  Really? I'm serious. Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is a best story.  I that makes me really happy.  And Jeff, if there's anyone who could defend his his dislike for Moesha,  you are the guy.  I think you actually thought it was cute. It was fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was when I was, whew, Moesha's OK.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I can't log into the New York Times,  so I'm just going to skip this next story.  They use cookies, Leo. They use cookies.  I've apparently forgotten my password.  I was going to read a story from the New York Times about Google's  new privacy policy, which, as you mentioned,  Gina goes into effect tomorrow and may be a violation of EU rules.  But apparently I don't have my password.  I must have exceeded the number of clicks because I've never had this before.  They won't let me in.  I hate paywalls.  But kids, get ready, because that's all you're going to get.  That's all you're going to get soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You brought it on yourselves, people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me let me take a break and make some money, because God knows we're not.  We only have a limited amount of time to do that,  and then it's going to be all over.  Go ahead, skip this ad.  I don't care. Damn kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you skip this ad, you might miss the baby polar bear later.  Just want to lighten things up.  OK, here we go.  Give Eileen a raise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do not skip this ad.  There's baby polar bears ahead.  They actually did this on Live with Kelly today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They said, stay tuned.  Coming up, leaping animals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stay tuned. Coming up, baby polar bear digging.  Where'd you get that? That's good.  Well, you got to thank Veronica Belmont for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, look at how cute.  Now, it gets even better a little later on, right after this ad.  Actually, we talk, we bitch all the time about how cell phone companies work.  And, you know, I keep saying, if somebody would do it right, they would kill.  Well, it makes sense.  The folks from Two Cows, same folks at Dohover and Elliot Noss, a great guy,  had the same thought.  He thought we could do a new mobile service.  What we're going to do, it's based on Sprint.  They offer 4G phones, Android phones through Sprint.  It's called Ting.  This sounds like I'm joking, but I'm not.  Ting.com slash twig.  Ting.com slash twing.  Twig. Oh, ah, oh, ah, ah.  Bing, bang, willow, wallow, ting, tang.  This is an amazing new way to get your cell phone service because it's Sprint.  Now, of course, you're going to have the same coverage map as Sprint does,  same 4G, but they have a pricing model that is unique.  So what they've got is they've got, let me show you the whole thing here.  They've got this account dashboard that at any time you log into your Ting account  and you could see exactly how much data,  how many minutes and how many texts you're using.  They bill megabytes, minutes and texts separately.  You, when you sign up, you say, I want this plan.  I'm going to have this many phones.  Actually, I could show you this.  Let me go here. You could say, I could say I want this many phones.  So I'm going to say, let's say I have a family plan for phones.  That's the base price of twenty four dollars a month.  And then, oh, this is for you to enter in your own.  Let me let me go to the plans here.  This you could, this is also a nice pricing,  pricing thing where you enter in your current price.  So then you say how many phones you want and you say,  do you want extra small, small, medium or larger, extra larger XXL plan?  Choose whatever plan you think you're going to use for minutes,  for messages and for megabytes, you know, any just.  But here's the beauty part.  If you don't use it all, they give you a refund.  They don't give you rollover minutes.  They give you your money back every month.  You're automatically credited the difference at the end of the month.  If you use more, you're billed at this rate, not some inflated crazy rate.  So really, this is just a suggestion.  You know, pick what you think you're going to use,  because that way you can figure out what it's going to cost.  This would be sixty nine dollars for a thousand minutes, a hundred messages.  A gigabyte. But let's say, oh, no, I'm going to use a gigabyte  and I'm going to do a thousand messages, but I'm not going to do that many minutes.  There you go. Ninety two dollars a month for four phones, four phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if I use less, I I get a credit back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's pretty crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's crazy. They're Canadian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does that help?  This is a U.S.  This is a U.S. company, but they're from Canada.  And I think that's the issue there.  They just don't get that profit thing.  There are no penalties.  There are no premium prices for extra data.  4G phones. This is the Ting phone I'm using.  It's a nice HTC phone slider.  This is a slider, but you don't have to.  They have all kinds of phones.  They're there.  This if you've been looking for a better data plan, a better plan on your phone.  In fact, this is so cool.  Like, here's a tweet from somebody a couple of days ago.  My Ting phone bill was twenty two dollars last month.  That's a hundred dollars less than AT&T was.  A new a new customer family of four.  For actual usage across the four phones, 2387 minutes.  Wow, he must have teenagers.  Four thousand, 227 messages and 429 megabytes of data.  That's a lot.  All of that 244 on Ting.  I'm sorry. That was on AT&T was 244.  On Ting was one hundred three dollars a month.  Business, too, by the way, you get as many.  You know, this could be for your whole business.  A marketing firm in Boston says we plugged in six of us together.  We got twelve thousand dollars to savings a year.  So there's a no wait customer support line, same as hover.  Eight a.m. to eight p.m. Eastern Standard Time email support.  They've got blogging. They got Twitter.  They're really, you know, they're a bunch of geeks, very social media focused.  Look at this is a really nice phone, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then they have data access.  They have like data devices as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. So this is a data device.  This is Android two, three on a HTC phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've got a Nova Telmify twenty two hundred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't have like the oh, you mean like the the Mifide cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, they got two of them.  They don't have the latest, greatest phones like they don't have the note.  And that's you know what? That's not their fault.  That's that's a carrier lock in, unfortunately.  But they have the San Jose, the LG Optimus, the Samsung Transform.  Now, when you get the form of the phone,  this is the HTC detail, it's a little more expensive  because because you're not getting the subsidy, but it's less than a full price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I just get a SIM from them if I have the phone.  Uh huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Prices range from one hundred four dollars to five hundred forty four dollars  to purchase a phone. You buy it right on the website.  So just go to Ting dot com slash twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they're not SIM. They're they're sprint.  They're sprint. That's right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ting dot com slash twig.  You'll save fifty dollars on your device right off the front.  So we do have a special deal for you.  Ting dot com slash twig.  Tell your friends, I think these guys deserve to be rewarded.  When I when Elliott showed me this,  I've known about this for six months when he showed it to me, I said,  get your ass kicked by AT&T and everybody else.  We're going to try to run you out of town.  He said, no, we're all we're already up and running.  This is this is awesome. Right.  This is support them.  Support them for doing it right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What this does, you know, what's what's any model,  if you worry about what big corporations are going to do with the internet  and we should worry about that, you should.  There's a few answers.  Yes. To have open source competitors. Right.  So so the fact that Firefox exists  is what enables Chrome to resist by pressure,  but also means that IE didn't take over the world.  And the fact that Ting can come along and say, you know,  you can do a phone company right, bozos, that puts the pressure on otherwise.  And that's what we have to do.  The entrepreneurial technologists have to create this countervailing  pressure to the idiots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way. Yeah, agreed.  No early termination fee.  You're month to month. You cancel at any time. Wow.  No additional charge for tethering or hot spotting.  All the phones do it.  Oh, that's great.  Three way calling free caller ID free tethering picture  and video messaging free voicemail free.  So this is a really this is a remarkable service.  And for businesses would be a really good choice to have multiple phones.  Ting dot com slash twig.  And just, you know, look at the plans to the savings calculator.  You get an idea.  You know, Elliott's a great guy.  He's he's one of those guys that you meet that you go.  He wants to change the world.  You know, just really exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just love it. And yeah, just back on the polar bear watch.  Oh, is that live?  I it's they said it was live.  I'm not quite sure. I just kind of explore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw somebody come along and club it over the head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I promise to bring it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we things have gone in the show so far.  I wouldn't be surprised if I saw a polar bear clubbing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is no. This is explore.org.  These are live webcams and polar bears.  Panda. Oh, wait a minute.  They got pandas, giant pandas, baby.  Look at the look at the live cams on the Panda Reserve.  These are all live cams. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what's better, the polar bears or the pay only what you use phone plans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know. I know.  I hope you didn't skip the ad because you might have missed something really good.  Oh, the panda bears are sleeping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, there's one eating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look at little little. Oh, this this looks like the San Diego's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It shoots and leaves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Yashin and Lulun.  I was that was so cool to see those up close.  And they're so cute with their little potbellies,  but don't get close because they'll eat your face off.  OK, thank you for this little break.  I feel much, much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, if you know, if you ever feel down, I will go back to our friendly polar bear.  OK, you got your baby polar bear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're welcome. Baby polar bear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just say polar bear. OK, OK. I'll bring it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you wish you were in Kansas City?  Everything's up to date in Kansas City.  They've got fiber running a gigabit speeds.  Here is a depressing video of Google installing high speed fiber optic.  Actually, this is an ad. Skip that.  I always skip an ad.  You know, there's too many ads on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You skipping the ad? What? You robber.  Here's the polar bear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do as I say, not as I do. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wish you could see the face now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it's cute. Oh, poor bear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's going to turn around.  We're going to see a Coke ad on the side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A service will offer download speeds up to 100 times faster than those.  This is from the BBC News.  That's why there was a little ad because they really got to monetize.  Living online in Kansas City.  Gigabit per second.  Anyway, you can go to watch this at BBC.co.uk.  Wouldn't that be nice to have something like that?  I don't know why they're making modem sounds.  That's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wondered that too when I was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What modem? No, there's no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It used to be maybe that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't don't you notice more as a real thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. We're not going to watch this because we didn't watch the ad  and we don't want to be pirates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Eric Schmidt said the people people actually kind of them  said they want to move to Kansas City just because of this.  And somebody in the audience said, I want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of course, this is the best thing that we've tried.  You know, we lobbied Petaluma lobbied every town in the country  tried to get this because they knew if you get it, you're suddenly like  the place to live.  All right. So what do you think?  This has been a little little battle going on on the Internet over Google Plus.  Comscore and others say that Google Plus visitors are not it's not  it's been Comscore said an average of three minutes a month on the site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's isn't that bogus statistically, because that's that's all the lucky  lose who came in the proper statistical should be how many.  It may be a bad number.  How many people come back regularly?  And for those, how many how much time do they spend?  What they're averaging in is dead accounts who came in and said,  I'll try this. Leo said to a lot of them, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Facebook has the on the average about seven hours.  Six to seven hours every month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it was another Wall Street Journal story going after Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just saying there's been a lot of them out there.  Tons, tons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, when you sign up for a Google account now as a fresh,  brand new user, you automatically get a Google Plus account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, sort of. You do not.  The first thing they do is they push you to Google Plus.  They push you to Google Plus.  They make a profile, be a plus or it's very it's a very hard sell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a very hard sell. So OK.  So so these numbers are could be bad just because they're pushing.  If I want a Gmail account  and I wind up with a Google Plus account, but I just use Gmail.  I mean, I'm essentially considered a Google Plus user who abandoned my account  when that's not Google kind of did this themselves a little bit.  And then you're right.  She didn't make a Google Plus account because they have such high signups.  They're going to have a lot of dead users.  Well, let me let me create an account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, create a new Google account.  Your Google account is more than just Gmail.  Take it all with you. Share a little work in the future.  So, you know, they push their products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So Google Plus visitors spend an hour.  So a visitor, I guess, is someone who has been to plus Google dot com.  I mean, there's no doubt that Facebook has higher usage.  But my my view on Google Plus is kind of skewed.  I mean, to me, it's still a very active and delightful like nerd salon.  But I don't you know, I think for regular people,  you know, they're not seeing their friends and family on Google Plus yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm spending, though, a lot more time on Google Plus than I do on Facebook.  I'm more in conversations there. Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I've been seeing, Jeff, you've been a lot more active.  Google Plus, I get kind of hot and cold about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do, too. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I get I get really hot about it.  I'm like, this is great. The conversations are great.  But it feels like compared to Twitter, it feels like a lot of work  because the posts are so much, you know, media and because the conversations  going so much longer.  I just feel like it's much more of a time commitment where with Twitter,  I just can kind of quickly scan and kind of get more out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look at this. This is when you sign up, you check.  They have a box to check.  Google may use my account information to personalize plus ones on contents  and ads on non-Google websites.  So that's what they were doing on iOS.  So maybe you agreed to it and you just didn't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but Gina would say I'll speak for you here.  They still do something to get around the app.  Yeah. Yeah, I was like, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't. I screwed up on the I hate captures.  Oh, the capture. I can't read that.  What is that? Would you guys help me?  What is that cure?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cure, I got O, O, N, D, S, C, I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you're good. No. Yeah.  I said an iron. I can't tell if that's an N or an R.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And are an iron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  L place, place sound again.  You listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I give up. Prove you're not a robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I said it like this. Omen.  This is the devil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google, you prove you're not a robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You prove you're you are a robot.  You're a Python script and you're asking me to prove a human.  Crying out loud.  Oh, and now my browser's functionality is turned off.  Please turn it on.  Polar bear. Look at this. Look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google's just doing a constant train test on the whole world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, anyway, you don't have to go sign up for a whole.  I was just wondering if by the way, this is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look at what Google recommends as a setting under accept cookies,  select only from sites you navigate to.  They're recommending.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're recommending first party cookies only. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't that interesting, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, they own all their properties, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's somebody pointed out, you know, all they had to do  is make that double the thing is it came from double click.  If they had merely made it come from Google,  they wouldn't have had to do any work around at all.  It's very strange. It's all over the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It has New York Times cookies and it has double the cookies.  A double cookies, I assume, are considered third party cookies.  I'm very confused. Yes, they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We go again. Based on those are third party.  They're both frozen and so I've got cookies turned on and it still won't let me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do the tip number and tool. How's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Eileen is our savior this week.  She's keeping moving along.  So impressed. Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina. Gina, what's your tip of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tip of the week is a really simple one.  A new change in Gmail.  Thanks to HTML 5 and Chrome Gmail, you can set Gmail to be your default  email handler, which means that next time you go to Gmail,  I just got it a couple of days ago.  It'll say across the top, do you want Gmail to be the default?  Your default email handler?  If you say yes, anytime you see an email address linked on any web page,  you'll click on it and it'll launch Gmail instead of launching mail  or your crazy Windows client.  So basically lets you use Gmail as kind of your default default client.  It amazes me that it's 2012 and this is like a really exciting new thing.  But it is. It's always been a pain.  I've kind of trained myself to copy and paste links into Gmail.  But now you just click them and you can do the same.  And there's instructions for setting Gmail to be your mail handler in Firefox  and Internet Explorer as well.  But it works kind of right out very smoothly out of the box in Chrome.  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cool, cool, cool.  Jeff, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My number of the week.  Well, Eric Schmidt said in his speech, and I'm glad we didn't get to this earlier,  but I'll get Leo fired up again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  More stuff Schmidt says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google products are blocked in 25 of the 125 countries in which Google does business.  Wow. The scarier one that he said that now 40 nations censor the net  up from four a decade ago.  Holy cow.  This is the trajectory we're on.  I wrote a post this week that you should read to the tune of Pink Floyd saying to leave our net alone.  And the basic thing that's going wrong here, the basic thing going wrong here is that there is a growing  presumption of regulation that the Internet's broken.  It ain't broken. It's what Eric Schmidt said too.  It's not broken. So don't fix it, please.  Leave our net alone.  We don't need no regulation.  Hmm. Yes.  Internet is not broken.  And that's the fundamental thing we've got to get across to people is that that's what is allowing this push to  regulate under the guises of piracy, privacy, security, decency, indecency, pedophilia and citizen and civilization.  Yes.  ...all around the world and upper governmental organizations like the EU and the UN.  A Wall Street Journal thing we mentioned last week is this talk about,  well, maybe we should go ahead and start regulating so we don't have the UN do it.  No, it ain't broken. Don't fix it.  Cool.  That was an excuse, a number as an excuse for a rant.  From a strange pink man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm fixed in more ways than you know.  Yes, you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is Maps GL something new?  Do you know, Gina, if that's something new?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought I'd been around for a while.  So it's using Web GL to turn your Google Maps into these incredible 3D,  45 degree fly ins and stuff like that.  And John came and said, have you seen this?  It's really cool.  So I thought in honor of John, I think we've seen it before.  Yeah, it's been around for a while.  But still, it's new.  Well, anyway, in that case, forget it.  Forget I even mentioned it.  I like Web GL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll just show an ad blocker, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Should I show Collusion?  All that trash.  All right.  It's a Firefox tool, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want to recommend it, though, based on our earlier conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm just going to show you how open-minded I am.  This is a Lifehacker article.  Collusion for Firefox shows you who's...  I'll see.  But now Google won't let me see this either.  Who's tracking you on the Web in real time?  Chrome says, no, I'm sorry, Leo.  You can't read that.  Here's a polar bear.  Anyway, I'm going to wrap it up because I got nothing more to say.
