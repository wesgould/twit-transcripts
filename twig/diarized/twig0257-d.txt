I'm Twitch News Director Mike Elgin filling in for Leo this week.  We have the usual cast of characters, Jeff Jarvis, the professor of journalism at the City University of New York,  and he's coming in from the said City University of New York, right?  Are you calling me a character?  Yes.  Hey.  And this is a very character building show, so I don't blame you.  Jeff is the author of Public Parts, What Would Google Do, and Gutenberg, The Geek, three very awesome books,  which I loved reading. And he blogs at buzzmachine.com and everyone should go and read that blog all the time  because it's really great.  And also Gina Trapani, the creator of thinkup.com, host of Twits all about Android,  and founding editor of Lifehacker. And Gina, Lifehacker, you had an interesting inspiration for that name, didn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did. I did. This guy named Danny came up with this phrase called Lifehacks,  and he did a talk back in like 2004, and we just loved the idea, and we launched a site based on it.  So I kind of owe him a big part of my career.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Danny O'Brien. And in related news, we have Danny O'Brien on the show today,  here to talk about a really interesting article he wrote this week.  Thank you so much for joining us, Danny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No problem at all. Oh, my goodness, I'm compressing beautifully here.  But this is what I look like in real life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We like that hostage video kind of vibe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know, exactly. I should hold up a newspaper that you can't actually make the date out on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, anybody who watches this and doesn't want to remember it, you have the right to forget it.  And that's our topic today.  We want to bring you on because you wrote an article, Danny,  called Rights That Are Being Forgotten, a play on the European Union's right to be forgotten ruling.  And you and Jillian York wrote this really interesting piece  that talked about some of the other things that are being sacrificed  in the quest for privacy in Europe under this ruling.  And we'd like to talk about it with you for a few minutes if you like.  Now, it's your day off, and I appreciate you coming on today and joining us on your day off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's totally fine. I like talking about this sort of stuff on my day off as well.  So we wrote the piece because I think this is one of those examples  where there are considerations about privacy and considerations about free speech.  And sometimes they butt against one another.  And our concern with the way that the right to be forgotten has been interpreted  in the CCJ decision and by Google, because I think Google's had a lot of leeway  in how it might implement this stuff, has meant that the right of free expression  has been kind of missed.  And I think that's going to become a bigger problem as more and more companies  feel they have to adopt protocols to take into account this decision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, you talked about three victims of this ruling,  and I'd like to go through them if you don't mind.  The first one was that the first victim you said of this ruling is Google's implementation  of the ECJs, the European Court of Justice's decision, which is transparency under censorship.  What did you mean by that?  How is transparency under censorship being victimized here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let's go back a million or so years to 2001.  And Google in its early idealistic phases was bumping into some of its first challenges  as a big search engine.  And that was people in the US coming along and demanding that content be taken down,  or in particular, links be taken down.  And one of the most controversial of those cases was the Church of Scientology,  which up until then had already attracted quite a reputation on the Internet  as being an organization big enough and concerned enough to demand that content be removed.  So Google was trying to work out how to deal with these takedowns,  and it set what I thought was an interesting precedent for big companies  in that Google took down the content because they were legally obliged to do so in the United States.  But they put a little message at the bottom saying,  you've typed in this search term and we've had to remove some of the results  and click here to find out more.  And you click there and you went to Chilling Effects,  a great site that EFF supports,  that actually lists the court orders and the DMCA takedown requests  that led to this removal.  So you could get an idea of why things were being censored,  who was doing it, and what the extent was.  Something was missing that you knew it was missing.  Google has done a similar thing with the implementation of this European Court of Justice requirement,  but they've skipped on this.  Actually, what they do is they put that notice at the bottom of search results in Europe,  but they put it for everything that looks like a name.  So if you type Danny O'Brien into google.co.uk,  there will be a little message saying,  oh, something might have been removed from this search.  And in fact, that's not the case.  I mean, I haven't put a request, neither have the 1500 other Danny O'Brien's in the world.  It's just that Google has placed that in every single name request.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So as Donald Rumsfeld would say,  it used to be known unknown, and now it's an unknown unknown.  And that's a real problem.  Now, if you're just joining us, we're talking with Danny O'Brien,  who's a technology journalist and civil liberties activist.  He's also the international director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  Why do you suppose Google is doing that?  Is it because they want to get more publicity for the fact that they're being forced to do this,  or is it just hard to do a warning for the specific search results,  or do they just want to not antagonize the European authorities?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so this has been the subject of a lot of press interest.  There's been an open question whether Google is implementing this,  some people have said in sort of a deliberately clumsy way,  in order to increase opposition to it.  Or alternatively, they're implementing it in the only way that they know how,  and the ruling is as bad as that, and there's nothing they can do about it.  I don't have any particular insight into which one this plays out.  I mean, I don't see Google as being pure as the driven snow in a lot of these cases.  They have their own motivations.  And as, you know, working at the EFF, one thing I know is if you have your civil liberties decided  by a big fight between the courts and a large corporation,  it's really not your civil liberties that are being decided.  What's being decided is the intent and motives of these companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Personally, and I don't know if you agree, Jeff and Gina,  but I would love to see those big black bars as if somebody came in there with a Sharpie  or something like that, and just so it'd be super obvious  and really just mar the appearance of the entire search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But of course, the problem with that is, and Danny, I agree with you on this,  I've spoken about this on the show, and in fact, when I wrote my book, Public Parts,  a couple years ago, I attacked this whole notion,  started by Vivian Redding of the European Commission,  of this right to be forgotten,  and have raised a flag about the danger to speech that this raises.  And now it's only proving to be the case.  And last week we talked about Guardian and BBC's stories being taken down,  and then since then they went back up.  I don't think Google is being cynical in this,  but Google is absolutely stuck with a terrible ruling where there's no good way to do this.  The irony of it is that many Europeans don't want Google to have more power  and the court only gave Google more power,  and more power Google doesn't want in this case.  But the Streisand effect irony of this is that if they said specifically,  this is exactly what we took down,  then of course they're going to get taken to court saying,  well you've just countermanded the point of the ruling,  and pointed to what was taken down.  Google's in a no win situation here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean there's a lot of mind reading going on here.  Google says that it's trying to anticipate objections like that,  and build a system that works that way.  Well, if you're in a situation where you're having to mind read the court,  the best thing to do is actually go to the courts and find out.  There are 29 data protection authorities in the EU,  and we're in this curious position where Google has jumped in  and started implementing this before the authorities have even said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, not in this group, Danny, this was an unappealable decision.  It was a final decision by the highest court,  and Google had really no choice but to get going.  There's no appeal back to lower authorities separately.  The court said this is a decision, that's it,  there is no appeal, there is no choice, you have to do this.  The only appeal that's going to come now is through legislators.  And we have the Justice Minister of the UK saying today  that there is no right to be forgotten,  and I think we're going to see this fought out at different levels.  But Google, I disagree, Google was stuck with having to go and enforce something.  And you also said in your piece that Bing is the alternative.  As far as I understand the ruling, this was not specific to Google,  this is Bing and Yahoo and other search engines  that they've got to deal with the same thing,  Google is just the first doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I was going to say I don't want to get into like dueling EU scholarship,  but why not, let's do it.  So it is true that this is a court of last appeal, as it were.  However, it doesn't quite work in the same way  as the Supreme Court in the United States.  What's happening here is that a lower court has gone up  to the European Court of Justice and asked it a bunch of questions.  And the European Court of Justice has given an answer to those questions.  Now everything else begins to sort of roll out.  The lower court will make a decision based on that answer  and data protection authorities and search engines like Google  and like Bing will work out how to implement that.  But it's not just a crack of lightning and everything changes  and my concern is really that like I actually want to hold  the data protection authorities to account  because one of the things that we're profoundly worried about  is that the entire regulatory space here is all about protecting privacy,  which means that publishers like the Guardian, like the BBC,  don't really have an obvious way of appealing this  without going and begging Google to put this back.  And as you've said...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well in fact there was no requirement that Google had to even notify them.  I was delighted that Google notified the Guardian and the BBC of this  and yes some may say that was a cynical act to get the PR,  but whatever, there was among the 70,000 take down requests that were there,  there was one, four or five for the Guardian, one for the BBC,  and they got notified, which means that they then did have the appeal  of going to Google on the court of public opinion and Google did change.  We didn't even know how that was going to work out,  whether Google was going to notify anyone that their free speech rights  had just been affected by this FACACTA ruling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Danny O'Brien, that was your second victim,  which is the victim of the implementation of fairness.  And you said that Google in fact did go to the people with,  as you said, as a bully pulpit, the press essentially,  which raises the question, yes, the press could sort of get Google to make a change,  but can people who don't buy digital ink by the barrel do that?  Is it fair that the press has one set of rules  and that the little people have a different set?  And that was one of your points.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's interesting the nitty gritty of this particular case.  I mean one thing, and I cut the paragraph out of our essay  just because it was getting huge,  is that in fact the way that Google notifies people,  and Jeff's absolutely right, it's great that they're doing this  and they didn't have to do this,  is through their Google Webmaster Tools system.  So basically if you use Google Analytics and you sign up to their service,  you now get a little message when Google is removing links  because of a privacy takedown request.  This is weird in that it now means that you have to sign up to a Google service  in order to find out whether your content is being removed,  but the other part of this is that what is the appeal process here?  It turns out that when Google put back some news items,  it actually put back I think one news item  that was due to them making a mistake.  So it's not actually a sort of legal challenge that we're seeing here.  It's just Google, as will inevitably be the case,  making an error in its internal system.  We deal with terrible problems with the DMCA copyright takedowns  and Google's and other companies' implementation  of their legal requirements under that,  and at least the DMCA system has a legal method  for someone to appeal this decision.  Danny, let me ask you about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because in a way I was happy but unhappy  that Google turned around and put some of the items back up  for whatever reason.  Because what I would like to see happen  is for the likes of The Guardian and the BBC  to bring their own free speech complaints, suits,  that their rights have been impinged by this  and that we fight that out in that case.  I don't know enough about European law and the structure  and how that goes there,  so I will concede defeat on any EU scholarship immediately to you.  But what would it take,  could you imagine a case going for whether it's The Guardian  or whether it's blogger Joe Schmo  or being able to then have a complaint  of their civil rights being violated,  and how would they bring that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What potentially could happen  is that we're actually in the middle of reforming  the data protection laws in Europe,  and it's at a fairly late stage.  So conceivably they could add something to that  which would add a sort of right to appeal.  But we're in, as everyone says,  incredibly uncharted territories here  because there's never really been this face-off  between privacy and free speech  within the data protection system like this.  And just very quickly,  it didn't have to be this way.  The Advocate General,  who's sort of the research wing, as it were,  of the European Court of Justice,  published his report before the final decision  and said what actually I think everybody,  including Google, thought this decision was going to play out,  which is the Court saying that Google  can't wriggle out of data protection requirements in Europe,  but a free expression right trumps the requirement  to sort of delete this data from the search index.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Indeed, Danny, I think you're right.  I was brought to speak for travel, not for pay,  to Google's privacy all hands in Mountain View  about a day and a half after this decision came out.  And as I said on the show previously,  they were gobsmacked.  They did not expect this to come.  But my European friends,  when I was in Berlin a few weeks later,  said, oh, well, they should have expected this to come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.  What I think everybody expected,  and again, I've been speaking to people,  is that Google had somewhat aggressively challenged  the idea that they were susceptible  to any European data protection requirements  because they said that Google's search index  is done out of Mountain View  and then Google's Spain department just deals with ads.  And I don't think that was ever going to fly.  And I think what happened is they aggressively challenged  said that in the courts.  And when this decision came down,  a lot of people were so happy  about Google actually being obliged  to comply with European law  that they didn't realize this really counterintuitive decision  that the ECJ had to act on the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Danny O'Brien, your third victim in your article  and final victim was Europe's privacy law itself.  You pointed out that,  and you made a really interesting argument about censorship  and that any small step down the road of censorship  causes information to essentially route around that censorship,  forcing those who want to censor information  to have ever more repressive forms of censorship,  and then you go down into the wormhole  of totalitarian dictatorship or something like that.  But this is clearly a step toward censorship, right?  And that's the part of this  that to me came kind of out of nowhere  that Europe would not only take a big step,  what I think is a big step toward censorship,  did it in such a clumsy way,  did it in a way that seemed to be an available way.  You can't just, you know,  it would have been an entirely different proposition  for them to go and have the articles removed  from the Guardian website, for example.  Right.  And so this was kind of a weasel-y way,  in my opinion, a kind of a weasel-y way  for them to get a similar effect.  But as you pointed out,  it's a step toward of censorship  in an otherwise generally free society.  What's next, do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the reason why we said that  was because I'm really used to speaking to governments  who have in their eyes  a perfectly reasonable reason  to try and censor and block content online.  I mean, when we deal with,  as we often do at the EFF,  with the copyright industry,  they'll say, you know,  that we have an whole industry hanging on this  piracy is rampant.  And therefore, we need to use this censorship tool  to prevent our industries collapsing.  Same thing when I talk to the Thai government  and they say, you know,  we're in an environment where  the country is being riven by civil unrest.  We have to block and censor political speech.  And the same thing is happening here.  And all you can say in all of these cases is,  look, this isn't going to work.  And when you discover that it isn't going to work,  you're going to double down, right?  And this is what we saw with the copyright industry.  And this is what we see in any country  that tries to control what its people see.  And the problem with that is,  is you end up with this ridiculous situation  where you have incredible fines  changing the entire Internet infrastructure  to comply with censorship requirements.  And it still doesn't work.  Essentially everything that's being removed  from Google's index is still out there.  And I and any other person who knows how to put together  a script could write you a program that would find it.  And in fact, of course, we've just highlighted  what is seen as being valuable content by doing that.  So it's not going away.  And you can't half censor.  Half censoring is like being in a prison cell  and you can't half censor.  Half censoring is like being half pregnant.  It just doesn't work.  And then we just go down the slippery slope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right.  Well, Danny O'Brien is a technology journalist  and civil liberties activist at the EFF  and also the international director of said EFF.  Thank you so much for coming on this week in Google  and telling us and discussing your article with us.  Thanks, Danny.  Keep on beating the dump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you, Brett.  Thank you, Danny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, man.  Don't send any cease and desist letters to Gina  about Lifehacker, okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like the last guy on Earth.  I'm the last person who can do that, unfortunately.  Exactly.  So Gina.  Bye.  Thanks, Danny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're the best.  Thanks again, Danny.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, in just a sec, we're going to talk about more instances.  I think the theme of the show is probably going to be  the overwhelming and growing power of companies  like Google and other technology giants,  especially cloud-based giants.  And we're going to talk about that in a sec.  But first, I want to tell you about our sponsor today,  which is Nature Box.  I have a box of Nature right here.  And the Nature Box is an awesome subscription healthy snack service  that is fantastic for a whole bunch of ways.  And it's kind of a Google-y business model.  And I'll tell you why in just a sec.  But first, I want to tell you about some of these snacks  that they have.  I was eating this before the show,  and we couldn't start the show until I finished chewing.  It's really delicious stuff.  Basically, Nature Box snacks have zero trans fats,  zero high fructose corn syrup.  Leo says fructose.  I say fructose.  It doesn't matter.  You're right.  Am I right?  Okay, good.  Tell Leo that next time when he's back from vacation.  Fructose.  Let's hear it for fructose.  And also nothing artificial.  If you're going to snack on something healthy,  one of the reasons people eat unhealthy snacks  is they shop at the store when they're hungry.  And then when you're hungry,  you see potato chips and all this other stuff,  and you buy junk food,  and then it's in the house,  and then you get hungry,  and then you eat junk.  With Nature Box,  they'll always make sure you have healthy snacks,  very convenient right there in your house.  What they do is they send great tasting snacks  right to your door  with free shipping anywhere in the United States.  You just go to the site and click on the continue button  to choose between three subscription options,  then place your order.  Once you're a member,  yeah, this is a membership snack service,  you can select which snacks you like in your monthly box.  Now, this is the googly part of all this.  Google has a tendency to be very experimental.  They throw all kinds of stuff against the wall  to see what sticks.  They throw lots of products out there,  and the ones that don't really work,  they pull back.  The ones that do work,  they build into gigantic services like Gmail  and these other things.  And that's what Nature Box does as well.  You can keep trying different services.  The ones you like,  you can go on the website  and say, I want to keep getting those,  but keep surprising me with new ones.  They have more than 100 delicious, healthy choices  that you can choose from,  and you can also select by dietary needs.  So if you're a vegan,  if you don't want soy,  if you're gluten-conscience,  if you're lactose intolerant,  you don't want nuts,  you have a nut allergy,  something like that,  and you can also choose non-GMO.  Whatever it is,  you can just simply select that on the website  and they'll only show you the products  that suit your dietary needs.  You can also select by taste.  Savory, sweet, or spicy.  I love them all,  but your mileage may vary.  So the next time you get cranky and hungry  and are ready to eat anything,  don't eat anything.  Eat nature box snacks.  They have guilt-free snacks  like coconut date energy bites,  Santa Fe corn sticks,  pear praline crunch.  I haven't tried that one.  I'm going to have to try that one.  That sounds good.  We've got them around the office here all the time.  And people talk about this as like,  maybe I can get this for myself.  I can get a subscription for myself.  If you've got a kid in college,  this is a great option to make sure  that they get healthy snacks  that just keep on coming.  And I know a lot of Silicon Valley startups  that use the word healthy snacks  are Silicon Valley startups  that use Nature Box.  Because otherwise somebody has to go to Costco  and buy a bunch of junk food.  This way it just comes to the office  and it's office snacks for everybody.  And again, they are healthy  and so you don't have this ever-growing,  unhealthy staff.  So to get 50% off your first box,  go to naturebox.com slash twit.  Stay full, stay strong.  Go to naturebox.com slash twit.  And we thank Nature Box  for their support of this week in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And let me thank, let me thank twit  for having sent us boxes of this stuff.  My favorite so far from what I got  are the kettle kernels.  I'm going to throw them all.  The peppery pistachio  and dried pineapple.  Those are, those are to die for.  These are-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got a lot of points  when that box arrived at our house.  I was like, oh, yeah, all right.  All that time you spent talking  in your computer, worth it.  Because we got these snacks.  Unbelievable.  Look at this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sweet blueberry almonds.  Blueberry almonds.  Blueberry almonds.  I've never even heard of that before.  They look fantastic.  So do I have to give these back?  Can I keep this whole box?  Okay.  What else is in there?  Is there anything else in there?  Yeah, let's see.  Let's see here.  We have roasted garlic pumpkin seeds.  Oh, I do that.  Cranberry almond bites.  These are basically,  this is like,  yeah, this is like where you eat a lot of stuff,  but you're really not eating that much.  Grapefruit.  And yeah, pruning pumpkin seeds.  Where have you looked at that one?  Yeah, I've never even seen any of these.  There's so many different flavors.  I actually don't tell anyone,  but I actually have a couple of bags  of these kind of like fig,  they're fig bars.  One is blueberry, one is fig.  And they're just so good.  Each one is individually wrapped.  Really good.  Really enjoy that.  Well, back to the show.  Now, you may have heard about  Vinod Khosla's fireside chat with Sergey and Larry,  the founders of Google.  And it was a really interesting conversation.  It lasted about 45 minutes.  And they talked about a whole bunch of things.  Some of them were actually kind of funny,  which is that in the very early days  of Google, when Sergey and Larry  and two other people were the grad students  who collectively made up the whole of Google,  they were actually offered  an acquisition proposition  by Vinod Khosla himself.  And at the time, he was, I guess, advising Excite.  If you recall, if you've been around long enough,  you remember Excite was a major search engine,  I guess, in 1999.  In this conversation, they disagreed  about the amount that was offered.  Khosla said that they offered $350,000 to buy Google,  if you can imagine.  And the Google founders remember it  being over a million.  Either way, the acquisition didn't happen,  and I think everyone in the conversation  agreed that that was a good thing  because now, of course, Google makes  tens of billions of dollars a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you imagine if Google had died with Excite?  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What a different world.  I wonder how many startups have died

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in an acquisition,  how many startups that would have been  destined for greatness otherwise.  That we'll never know about, ever,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  because they were killed in an acquisition.  And in fact, that's one of the things  that I worry about.  Some of these serial acquisition-type companies  like Yahoo, they're constantly acquiring companies.  Then they make you forget them,  and then four or five years later,  they announce that they're closing it,  and you're like,  I kind of remember that site from years ago,  and it just seems so unnecessary.  You never know if there's going to be  some brilliant ideas in there.  But the Google founders had some interesting ideas  that they talked about,  and they generally expressed their dissatisfaction  with the pace of society,  with the fact that people work  as hard as they do,  and spend as much time as they do with computers  given what they get back from those computers.  And so it was a really interesting conversation.  I don't know if you guys had any  additional thoughts about this.  There were some aspects of it  that were controversial, for example.  Sergey Brin expressed a comfort level  with robots taking over your job  that some press outlets took umbrage at.  But his point was that,  if we have more automation and more robots doing things,  then we can all do things that are more enjoyable.  I thought it was ironic

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that they were suggesting a four-day work week  to help solve the employment issues.  And as you said just a minute ago,  they think we're working too much.  But who are the hardest people  working people you know?  Googlers.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're there constantly.  Right.  They have four-day work days, some of them.  It's a brutal place to work.  And of course,  they give free food and beverages  to all their employees,  and they have dry cleaning and massages  and all that stuff  so that people never have to leave the Googleplex.  I guess they could start right there at home.  It was an interesting conversation.  And toward the end of the interview,  they talked about society and that sort of thing.  This is one of the themes of this show,  I think we're going to find out,  which is that Google is such a powerful company,  and when they say things like this,  people tend to freak out.  And probably, maybe they should  because Google has so much power.  And that's where we get to our next story,  which is that there was an article in Salon  suggesting that Google  and some of the other big tech giants  be nationalized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is my nominee.  I put it up there.  This is my nominee for the dumbest article of the decade.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the author of this article...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What it says is that we should nationalize Google  because it's too powerful.  And Amazon because it's too powerful.  And by the way,  they got started with government's help  on the Internet,  so we own it anyway.  To which my response is,  then nationalize Tang  because it started in NASA.  It's just,  what didn't start with government help  is that that's the point of society.  Is that we have this help out there.  It's just,  I feel a little ashamed of myself  putting it up because it is clickbait,  but I just wanted to have the chance to say...  Yeah.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So let's actually talk about that.  And so do you support the continued  ownership by the government  of the U.S. Postal Service, for example?  Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I end up doing a lot of work on that topic  because I help a friend of mine named John Callan.  In the past, I helped him organize a conference  called Postal Vision 2020.  And it's not really owned by the government.  And indeed, no.  I would say that  the primary benefit of the Postal Service  is it gives a everywhere delivery guarantee,  but that could be handled through a subsidy  as phone services handle through a subsidy  to remote areas.  And so it's never going to happen.  They're never going to get rid of it  because there's too many votes there.  But no, I think that's the way it is.  I don't think we should be in the Postal Service business anymore.  And indeed,  when we had the Postmaster General  at this event a year ago,  he said that the primary job  of the Postal Service now is an ad delivery medium.  So the Postal Service  basically competes with our business right here.  And that's not the job of the U.S. government.  One of his arguments

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  is that the big tech companies,  including Google through YouTube  was singled out,  but also Amazon and others,  they abuse their power.  And because they abuse their power,  they need to be nationalized.  I can't say it with a straight face either.  But do we agree that there's a lot of abuse of power  at least and that something more  needs to be done regarding their abuse of power?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So let's hand it over to the people who run the NSA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that'll work.  There's a big left-right,  there's always a left-right component to this.  In general,  people on the left  tend to trust government more than private companies  and on the right, vice versa.  I'm a Hillary Clinton Democrat,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and I think it's full of crap.  I've said enough, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  I agree with you.  This seems crazy.  I think there are issues  that we discuss on this show quite a bit  about some of the things  that these big companies do,  wielding their power,  but I don't think this is the solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the biggest flaw in his argument,  frankly,  is that, I guess the Uber  argument that he's making  is that the public square,  this is so important, the stuff we do online,  it's replaced what we used to do  in meat space,  and the public square where we discuss all these things  is privatized.  The problem with his argument is that  there are a million public squares.  It's not that Google's public square  is the only public square,  that Facebook is the only place  where people can have conversations.  There are a gazillion places  where people can have conversations.  Of course, one of the reasons that these companies  are so aggressive in doing all these things  that he's saying is that they are freaked out  that they could be wiped out, wiped off the mat,  go out of business.  They all feel like they're 18 months away  from complete obsolescence.  In fact, that's true unless they continuously  reinvent themselves.  I think that's one of the reasons  that his argument is completely flawed.  But it's an interesting one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's no God-given law that says your company  has to live forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was the argument  that Microsoft made in the 90s  when they were being pursued for antitrust,  for bundling Internet Explorer with Windows.  They said, hey,  it'd be so easy, we're not a monopoly,  Windows is not a monopoly,  simply because we're just a few months away  from everybody just erasing Windows  and moving to Linux or whatever.  In terms of the browser,  the reason everybody uses our browser  is because it's the best browser.  If somebody else made a better browser,  we would decline in market share,  and that's exactly what happened.  Several other companies made better browsers  and Microsoft went right to the bottom.  It's understandable.  It's a Darwinian world in technology.  The giants are giants  and are still around because they've reinvented themselves  because they've been aggressive  about changing users, about changing law,  about changing society,  and doing all these things.  I've actually argued  in a column before that  the wireless carrier should be nationalized  and in exchange  we should privatize the post office  so that it's a swap,  so we don't have a trend in one direction or the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I did that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  simply because of the way pricing works  with wireless carriers  and because many of the incentives  tend toward having worse service  and you can't tell what you're paying for.  You get this monthly contract.  Is this a good thing, bad thing, whatever.  Anyway, that's another issue unto itself.  I'm not generally in favor of privatization  but I thought that was an interesting column  because of the theme  of all this power that these companies have.  It was really an interesting column  because of the theme  of all this power that these companies have.  It was really an interesting column  because it was really an interesting piece  in the sense that it captured  the type of panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've got to disagree with you.  I think it was an incredibly laughable piece.  It made no sense.  It got its facts wrong, by the way,  about Google penetration,  but that to the side, there was no logic to it.  I think that  it's the kind of Luddite talk  that we have now is, oh my god,  these people are scaring us, let's try to stop them.  But that's why it was interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it captured the Luddite sensibility  that's rising.  I didn't think it was a good piece  from a communist point of view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know you did. I know we agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it captured the thing that is happening  in our society that's just  so toxic about  especially in San Francisco  when people are tearing Google Glass up people's faces.  It's an encapsulation of techno panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's an encapsulation of techno panic.  Of all the fears around it.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we need a subset of this, which is what I call  Euro techno panic.  This is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is America. This is Yankee techno panic.  We've all got our little variants.  So like the soccer friendly,  wooden shoe wearing, never mind.  All right.  Gina, if the trumpets  and the timpanis are ready, I think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think we need... Mike, I think you and I can go home.  Looks like the change log is so long today.  The show is just headed over to Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So much change to log.  That's really impressive. Why don't we go ahead and launch into the...  The Google change log.  Take it away, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. We got a couple of really cool things this week in the change log.  Google Now, always changing, always getting smarter.  A couple of new functions here.  First, everybody knows how to use Google Now to set a reminder.  First, everybody knows how to use Google Now to set a reminder.  First, everybody knows how to use Google Now to set a reminder.  You know, remind me at 2 o'clock to get ready for my meeting.  Remind me on Tuesday to meet with whoever.  Well, now you can set up occasional reminders.  So you can say to Google Now,  remind me to take out the garbage occasionally.  And it's not clear exactly what occasionally means.  And it's not clear exactly what occasionally means.  It just means that every once in a while...  How dirty are you?  Yeah, Google will nudge you about taking out the trash.  I don't like this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You don't like this one? It's too ambiguous for you?  No, I don't want to do my chores.  It's one of my best excuses I forgot.  I don't need this kind of help.  No more.  No more excuses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't had a chance to test this out.  I don't know what occasionally means.  So I don't know. Maybe that's a good thing.  But it'll be interesting.  I would love to know if Google is doing any sort of AI  on take out the trash  and then making occasionally, you know,  every few days or what.  Also new, coming soon to Google Now, apparently.  This is more of a leak or a rumor,  but it seems totally legit.  Voice controls for me,  I don't know if Google is doing that.  It's totally legit.  Voice controls for media playback.  So you can say, okay Google, play the next song.  This dovetails really nicely into Android Auto.  It seems like the kind of voice command  you'd want particularly in your car.  So you can do play next song, stop music.  And when you do, okay play next song,  Google Now will also pop up a button.  This hasn't rolled out yet,  but there's a video and it looks like it probably still will.  So good, nice stuff going on in Google Now as always.  Speaking of Google,  I'm going to go ahead and say  Google Now as always.  Speaking of voice,  I didn't realize that you could do this,  but this is a pretty neat little trick.  You can correct Google's voice search interpretation  by saying, no, I said.  So if I say,  If only this worked on children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you say, okay Google,  tell me about This Week in Google,  and it takes me to This Week in Boggle.  I can say, okay Google,  no, I said,  Google, and it will actually  correct the word that it  screwed up, and I'm sure it's using  some smarts to do that, and rerun the search.  So you're seeing some of this  kind of conversational functionality  that we've seen, you know,  what's the weather like in Santa Monica,  and how do I get there, and Google  kind of associating the object  from one search to the next  in this, so try it out.  It's a little, it's less satisfying  than just being able to say, no, I said.  You actually have to say, okay Google,  no, I said. So it takes a little bit longer,  but also kind of fun.  So if Google necessarily starts to try that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, Jeanette. Have you guys been using voice  with your watch at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have, yeah. I've been using it a lot.  My watch, the battery actually died for the first time today,  so I'm not wearing it right now,  but yeah, I've been using it all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not, listen, it's not hearing me very well.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I use Google, I use voice search so much  that my one year old now points to my watch  and says Google.  Really?  Yes, yes.  Which is crazy, kind of scary  and cool at the same time.  Wow.  I mean, I don't, out in public,  I don't love saying, okay Google, into my watch.  I swipe over, you know, I just tap and swipe.  But yeah,  it does a pretty good job of interpretation.  Jeff, it doesn't hear you,  or. It gets the wrong words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It gets the wrong words.  So I was outside on the street today when I did it,  I was sending an SMS back, I was meeting somebody in a car,  and I said,  almost there, and it said,  fear.  And I said,  one minute, and it said 15 minutes.  Now how the hell it got 15 out of one,  I don't know.  So it's getting those misinterpretations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It sounded like it was arguing with you.  Yeah, what? 15 minutes, I'm not ready in one minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I said one minute.  I was walking through the streets and I find Jarvis going,  no, I said,  in a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff, you need to move to a quieter place, maybe.  Yeah, well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's like Petaluma next to your oven.  There you go.  I love that,  Gina, that Edda thinks that  your watch is Google.  Mommy, why are you talking to Google so much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google, yeah, she pronounces Google more clearly  than she pronounces grandma.  Like she has a hard time saying grandma.  She says Gaga for grandma, but Google she knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Grandma, you are replaced by a robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She's going to get Lady Gaga playing on your phone  if she's asking for grandma with that thing.  It's true, she is.  But isn't that an interesting image  where this child is growing up in a world  where some of her first memories  are going to be talking to a wristwatch  and that's normal.  This is the normal world that she lives in.  Future babies.  Future babies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Future babies, they are here.  Yeah, she sees me  talking to my watch and she just  wants to touch my watch.  I actually installed an app that locks my watch  so that she can play with it without  ordering me a car or something.  Accidentally.  Because she sees me  playing with it and she wants to touch it  and she wants to put it on and she says Google.  It's the whole thing.  It's amazing to watch actually.  She's just mimicking right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Once this shows up, you'll know where it came from.  I'll know why.  But in fact, on Tech News Today this morning  we talked about a new product  from LG called the KizOn  which is a children's  smartwatch of sorts. It's essentially a  cell phone wristwatch that does  GPS tracking so parents can track  where their kids are. But it has ten  pre-programmed numbers. They push the button  and they call the parents.  Or the parents can call the child  and even if the child doesn't answer  after about ten rings it answers automatically.  It has other features,  waterproof and so on.  It looks like you can also tag and release your kids.  Can you put that on a teenager?  A teenager probably wouldn't wear it.  It's very very  childy looking.  Very Fisher Price-esque  in its appearance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's funny about that is  young people don't  talk on the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But text messaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, text messaging is my phone.  No. Reddit hate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what else you got Gina?  What else we got here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google Drive is getting  a brand new interface redesign.  I actually got this. It's rolling out slowly.  You'll know if you got it if you go to  drive.google.com and you'll get  a little prompt  that says try the new  web experience. It's just  really nice kind of overhaul.  A new default view uses a thumbnail grid  instead of a list.  You can see file details from the whole screen.  You've got desktop style selection tools  including click and drag  and control modifiers or drag and drop.  It's just it feels Google Drive  makes Google Drive feel a lot more like a desktop app.  So again, this is rolling out slowly.  You might not have it. It looks like Chad.  Is that you Chad? It looks like Chad's got it there.  I don't have it.  Just screenshots.  It looks really nice. I'm digging it.  What else we have? Oh, speaking of Google Drive  the  Gmail app for  Android phones and tablets.  Just got a new insert Google Drive  file command.  This is on Android. You got the Gmail app.  You've got a compose window open.  You go to insert a file  into your email.  You can select from Google Drive.  If the file isn't shared  with the person you're sending it to  I always have this problem where I send people links  to a Google Drive document and they don't have rights  and can you set the rights and blah blah blah.  Well this new insert from Drive feature  will let you know if the person  doesn't have rights and let you change  the sharing settings.  So really easy way to send files  and not just directly from Drive. You can do that  directly from Gmail now.  I have not gotten that update yet  but that update is rolling out to Gmail  on Android now.  An update to the official Chromecast  app for Android  now has been updated to allow  streaming your device's entire screen  to your home.  So excited about this. This is such  a cool new feature.  So basically you're in your Chromecast app.  If you flip out the hamburger menu  like Chad's showing on the screen there  there's an option to cast screen.  This new feature  is limited to certain devices right now.  The Nexus 4, the Nexus 5, the Nexus 7  2013, the Nexus 10  the Samsung Galaxy S4, S5  Note 3, Note 10  HTC One M7 which made me very  sad because I have the M8.  LG Pro 2, the LG 2, and the LG 3  I think they're rolling this out  I'm not sure why actually they're rolling this out  to certain devices first  there must be some hardware dependencies going on  here. But yeah really neat  way to show off what's going on on your phone  on your Chromecast  cast a screen. Isn't that related

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to what we saw at I.O.  where you could show your Android screen  onto a TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah exactly that's right.  So that's what it does it just casts a screen  you can show off what's going on  this is the first step exactly.  And that update is also rolling out  with the Chromecast app for Android right now.  And finally this got me  really excited because this is an Android Wear thing  there's a new update to the Google camera  app for Android that allows  you to use your watch  as a remote shutter.  Yeah this is really cool and I got  to try this out. This is such a neat use  of Android Wear. So the way that it works  is you got your phone which is connected of course  to your watch through Bluetooth  you initiate  the camera app you launch the camera app  and a card shows up on your watch  that says you know tap here  for remote shutter. It counts down  3, 2, 1 and then you see  a preview of the device on your screen.  So really really  really cool way to take remote photos  with your phone. My only nitpick  I mean this would be an amazing  selfie function  if you could preview  the viewfinder on your watch  before you take the image you can't  you only see the image on your watch  after you take the image but  still really neat use of  Android Wear as a remote shutter  for those of you considering  jumping into Android Wear early. Really fun.  And that's a game also rolling out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Before you hit  it. While you're on Android Wear  have you guys discovered any great new Android Wear  apps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well there's actually a Flappy Bird  clone that now exists on  Android Wear called Flopsy Droid  and it's as bad as it  sounds there's a little Android robot  that flies around but no I haven't seen a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  good one. I've got a good  calculator. Really?  Oh very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well Baby Time is the one that I use  to lock my device so that  my child can't you know  SMS China. Jason how did you get that one?  Yeah Jason I'm sure I knew  Jason would go for that one.  And I installed Flopsy Droid which I am  sorry to say as I said last night on all that Android  is very playable.  Much more playable  than I wish that it was. Oh look at that.  Wow. That's my calculator.  Very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You just you know numbers around.  Calculator. Very nice.  Here come the apps man this is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is really exciting. I want better looking  faces. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You'd think that would be the first thing that would come before  Flopsy Droid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well Flopsy Droid  was a third party developer  who did it and actually  it never occurred to me that  I would want to play games on the watch. It was actually kind of  a neat proof of concept.  I didn't think that a game would be playable  on a screen that small and yet there it is.  Sort of the beauty of Flappy Bird

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and you can probably play that while you're holding  your baby right. You're sort of holding the baby like  this and you can kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh man I got to show her Flopsy Droid.  I haven't shown her Flopsy Droid yet.  Well I'm in big trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Alright so. And that's all I got for the change log.  Alright wonderful. That is the Google change log.  So we got a couple of stories here  about people complaining  about Google search  and Google's sort of internal  processes for dealing with errors and problems.  One of which appeared  on Wired.  Wired.com by Kevin Paulson is called  How Google Map Hackers Can Destroy  a Business at Will.  And according to this article  there was a Serbian  restaurant that Google  misreported the hours of operations  for in the Washington DC area.  This is a restaurant  by the way that serves lion meat.  I have to check that out if they ever  come back. But anyway the misreported hours  caused according to the owner of this  restaurant caused them to go out of business.  And it said that they  weren't open on the weekends and so on.  And so the Serbian  crown restaurant sort  of declined into  poverty and  obsolescence because Google misreported  the hours.  Is this just somebody whining their business  went out of business for  reasons like they serve lion meat for example?  Instead of meat  that the general population wants to eat?  Or  is this legitimate that Google has way  too much power and they have the ability to crush  businesses with their little errors?  What do you think Jeff?  Or Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm confused. I thought that as a local  business listing that you would control  or that you could update  your business listing. Is that not true?  Do you need to submit it to Google and wait for them to  I don't understand why these folks could  just update the hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't either.  I was under that impression as well.  Maybe  this wasn't possible. In his case for some  reason we don't know about.  But that was my impression as well.  That you could just go in there and maybe there was a dispute.  Maybe the other Serbian restaurant  across town was changing their results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The story is not very complete in answering  those pretty obvious questions.  What I find  interesting in this  is that it's not as if  I don't know how to put this.  The guy as I understand didn't pay for the service.  He's just saying Google listed me wrong.  And he built the business apparently  on the back of Google existing.  And so do you then  have some right  to be listed correctly?  Is it a violation of your rights if you're listed  incorrectly if somebody makes a mistake?  If a newspaper, I guess the analogy  would be if a newspaper runs  an ad and puts  the ad in the wrong time for your show.  Then you get to sue the newspaper  at least for the money back for your ad or the business loss.  If the newspaper puts in a free listing  the show starts at 8 when it starts at 7.  Do you have a case against them?  Newspapers screw it up.  Well gee, the only way we're going to get  people to watch our show that way.  Well that's true and the newspaper screwed up  and that's too bad.  But I'm not sure there's a basis for suit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You mentioned  listing a show  on at the wrong time.  The other story that falls in this category  is that Dinesh D'Souza's  new film called America  was confused  on Google's listings with his previous  movie called something or other  using the word America.  And as a result  of that the database showed that  the movie wasn't playing in theaters when in fact  it was because his old movie wasn't playing  in theaters. And so he  turned the screws on Google  in the court of public opinion  and said that essentially that  Google and you guys  are going to laugh at this. Google is a left-leaning  organization that was deliberately  doing this to  prevent his right-leaning  movie from being  popular  or something like that. Yeah, big

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  giant Google sat down and said  you know we want to stop that  Dinesh D'Souza's What's His Name's movie.  Let's bring all of our huge and  vast power behind  stopping it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course that's ridiculous.  That is of course ridiculous.  But I do try in these cases  to kind of  I don't know be empathetic to the  person, you know the less powerful party.  So it looks like in this case with this  particular lion meets  this fellow  immigrated from the US from Northern Italy  you know he's 74 years old.  He doesn't own a computer.  He'd heard of the internet but didn't really know  much about Google and didn't use  Google didn't realize that this  was happening.  But and I guess his accountant called Google  and tried to change the listing. I called  them. How do you call Google?  Eventually he hired  an internet consultant to get it fixed.  But by that time his business was  in a nosedive. He decided that this was  Google's fault and  hence the suit. So this is sort of just like  you know lack of awareness  going on here.  But you know for a filmmaker  or for someone who makes something listen Jeff's  an author I'm an author. I mean you know  when you make something or you make a site particularly  or an app I mean in a lot of ways  Google is the way that people find you and  it is frustrating and I've been in this position  it is frustrating when Google's snippets  or search results or whatever show  something that you know is untrue  or out of date or misleading  and you know that whole  process there really isn't a process  that I think is going to appeal to that right? I mean all you can do is kind of go in  and try to tweak your  copy and get more links and like hope for the best  and you know while there's  like a whole industry of SEO people trying  to you know get high on the search results  I do feel for the  folks who have a legitimate case  of like hey you got this wrong  your algorithm is wrong and I'm one of the  casualties  but is that Google's responsibility?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No?  It's hard to say. In the case of the D'Souza  I don't know how common this is  but in his case you know Google  did make an error and I think he seized on the  opportunity to get a whole lot of attention  Was that an error though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or the problem  is that you know if  you're named John Smith  it's going to be hard to be found on Google  and if you really want to be found  then you've got to go through a whole bunch of steps  to say no I'm the John Smith  you really care about.  America as a title of a  show, we're not trying to defend Google  here, I don't know what  it's the same as the guy with the  which by the way I think serving lime meat is a nasty  thing and I'm not sure that I'm  happy with him anyway  but  we don't know enough to know  people just say it's all Google's fault  maybe it is, maybe Google messed up  and maybe it's impossible to get to Google  and that's an issue for Google. However  it is a behemoth  and there are just ways you have  to deal with this. It's like  a new DMV and you've got to deal with the rules  and you've got to deal with the factor and we don't know enough to know  who is in the wrong in this case  but I certainly don't think there was a conspiracy  to get rid of either party

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Neither do I. It falls into the category  of when organizations  tech companies have so much power  and right now they probably have what 80%  of the search engine  traffic market share  whatever you want to call it. In the United States  What if they had 99%  It's an interesting question  but let's move on from that whole issue  because it's a total bummer  all these stories  we've talked about so far. Let's talk about something really awesome  which is that  NASA is using Project Tango  as robot eyes  for these little soccer ball sized  robots that are going to do EVAs  on the space station  and this is scheduled  to blast off  day after tomorrow on Friday  to go up to the space station  and these newly  Project Tango oriented  robots are going to be put into  immediate use. Now if you're unfamiliar with  Project Tango, this is an experimental  project  that builds  3D mapping into  a smartphone. They also have a tablet version  that they're working on but essentially  it has special hardware and software  that enables  you to do all kinds of cool interactive things  app developers will be able to do all kinds of amazing things  but NASA is going to use it  they bolted it on this robot  they've integrated it electronically  so now the Project Tango phones  are actually controlling the little  CO2 jets where these  circular robots fly around in zero  G's they're going to  be able to do all kinds of  things. So now  the robots are going to be able to do  all kinds of cool interactive things  so now the robots are going to be able to fly around in zero G's  they're going to deploy them out  the chute of the space station  and they're going to fly around on the exterior  mapping the exterior  of the space station  sounds really really cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this is awesome  this is just awesome  how cool is this  I just love this  in an attempt to make the robots smarter  used to astronauts, engineers at NASA's Ames research centers  and cheap smartphones at the space station

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  we live in an amazing world

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  where NASA is heading over  to Best Buy  to equip their robots  with some extra smarts  to map the space station  that's incredible

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it really is  what's also incredible is the fact  that this technology is moving so quickly  into a usable form  when I first heard about this technology  I thought, okay, you know  2020 we're going to start seeing something like this  I believe it's LG  I could be getting this wrong  but I think LG is actually going to ship  a consumer tablet  later this year or next year  I'm sorry I don't have the facts  we reported on tech news today some time ago  but it's actually going to be a commercially available consumer product  that can map an indoor space  like this  and I think that there's got to be some kind of partnership with Google  where they want the public  and the developers to know that this is going to be out there  and so for people to create  this sort of technology  and obviously games are going to be a killer  on this thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  definitely

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and the applications  every time you see one of these things  and you wonder what's behind it with Google  so my first presumption is they can map a room  I think we talked on the show about  wow, would this be amazing for a blind person  to know what's what in a room  and I kind of never thought of that idea  of how do you deal with something  that's in space where you really don't know  you have no bearings at all  and it can start to virtually map  what it's going to go deal with  how phenomenal

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  yeah, it's absolutely incredible  I love this technology  I love the fact that  usually NASA  they're awesome but usually it takes them a long time  to get stuff implemented  here they are with a very prototypical thing  that pretty much we heard about  very recently  and they're already deploying it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well of course then  because NASA is doing it  we should nationalize LG  and Best Buy

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and Google  and Tang  and any store that's on a public street

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  was Tang ever nationalized  that was always private I think  anyway, that didn't really work out the way they thought

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to bake Tang in your oven  but we're getting off on another time

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tang flavored bread  recently with  grape seeds, grape seed flour  and regular flour together  that was interesting but I haven't thought about Tang  how did it taste?  it tasted great, it didn't taste that different actually  the color was different, it was slightly brownish purple  which was interesting, there were pinot grape seeds  it had a slightly  different flavor but it was  it worked out fine and it was interesting  anyway, when you're in the wine country  that's the kind of crazy thing you get inspired to do  because they have that stuff for sale  so let's do our tip, tool and number  of the week  Gina, why don't we start with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yes, so I think my tip  I think was last week was how to get to the  old Google Maps, well  this week I've got a tip for something that only works  in the new Google Maps  you can, and I didn't know this and this is thanks to  Gizmodo, you can measure distance  distances  just kind of doodle on a map  if you want, in the new Google  map, the new Google maps were  you know, in any location and you write  you right click, is that correct  yeah, right click  your starting point and you choose  measure distance  you can just start drawing  lines on the map and Google will  tell you what the distance is from one line to the  other so you can see how far things as the crow  flies or any sort of  route that you want to take or you know, you can just  draw something cool  on the map just for fun  really, really neat  and when you drop, you can drop as many points as you  want when you draw  and you can, you know  click and drag any point  to adjust it as well to get the  adjusted distances

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that is cool  that is really cool, that's also great for  setting up a route  for running and jogging, that sort of thing  yeah, definitely

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  nice job, nice job Chad, Chad did like  as the crow flies, it looks like from twit to  in and out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wanted to know how far it would be  for a drone, yeah  and then if the drone needed to be  carried back, because it probably won't have power  there we go

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  or for running, if you calculate the distance  and then you figure out the number of calories burned  by running and then match that against the calories  in the burger, you could decide  whether you could like zero it out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  this works really well, I mean there's  also, if you grab  the starting position, you can drag it around  and you can see that it has a cool animation  yeah, this is really neat  this is a cool feature  very neat, demo Chad

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  somebody did that for a living

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  how fun, that's cool  I got to try that  I've never done that before, so I'm going to do  mine very quickly and then we'll  end with Jeff's spectacular  number of the week, first I have two things  I have a tool of the week  and a toy of the week, the tool of the week  came to me right at the last minute  Patrick told me about it, it's a new twit  it's a fan created chrome app  that shows you the live twit stream  it's the same thing you get on live.twit.tv  but it shows it to you as a chrome app  and it's on top of your other windows  so as you're working, as you're moving windows around  it will always stay on top so you can  watch the twit network, because of course there is nothing more

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  important than watching twit  so it should always be atop everything else

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  bravo, that's exactly right  that's exactly right, so check that out  you can also, you can find that by the way  at twit.tv slash apps  there is a section called laptop or desktop  and it's the last item  yeah, look at all those apps  those are all twit related apps  and it shows you which ones  show you live, which ones show you recorded  and so on, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  not one of those is made by twit I believe  right, every one of those is made by fans

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  pretty sure that's correct

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that's phenomenal

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  nationalize them all  nationalize them, never stop watching twit  but my actual item  my actual item is what I'm calling  toy of the week  so we all went to google I.O. they gave us these things  which are, this is a google  cardboard, this is a  open source project that gives you  3D in an app in your phone  you put the phone inside  you look at it like a view finder, it shows you  3D, there's several apps that came with it  and other people are creating more apps  it's a really cool project, unfortunately  if you didn't go to google I.O. you didn't get one  and we've talked in  previous shows about companies like  dodo, which makes  cases like this is my  ipad case, they make really  nice cases among other things  but dodo actually immediately went on sale  and said that they were going to be selling  cardboard versions of this, but the wait is  4-6 weeks, so if you're impatient  there's a quicker way to get your hands on  one of these and that is something called the  unofficial cardboard  unofficial cardboard is the name of the product  that they're selling, it's $29.99  and they will send you something that looks  a lot like the one that google gave out  at google I.O. it has a couple of lenses in  a magnetic controller, a rubber band  and a basically  it's a cardboard view finder thing  it'll come fully assembled or you can also  choose to get the unassembled version

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  oh it was too much fun watching  Gina assemble it, you want to go to that fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  yeah, get the unassembled version  and of course this works with  most android phones, if you go to the  unofficial cardboard site or several  other sites that talk about google cardboard  they'll tell you which phones these work with and which  they don't, most major android phones  works great with moto x for example  and this is just a really fun  and really cheap, $30 and you have like  3D  and not only 3D but it's motion controlled 3D  you have to experience it  and at these prices  I highly recommend it, so that is my  toy of the week, and Jeff  you have a number

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a couple, I just want to mention before we get  started that our dear twig friend  Matt Cutts is after 15  years at Google said, well it's one of those very  Matt moments, he just announced that he's taking  a few months off to be with his wife and  do what he wants to do and I think we wanted  to give a salute to our dear friend  Matt and I can't think of anybody who deserves  a break more and we expect  him to come back soon, yeah absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it's funny, the post that we see on the screen here  was really funny, he's like, no really  I just wanted to spend some time with my family  everybody says, you know, when there's  some problem they're going to spend time with their family, no really  he just wants to spend some time with his family

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  he's the one guy I believe  alright, couple quick numbers, real quick  Google cloud storage is going to  offer 2 terabytes of storage  per year free to its customers, point of that  being that the cost of storage is heading toward  zero rapidly, 2 terabytes for  nothing is phenomenal, second  number, 35.6 million  tweets about the Germany-Brazil  game in the World Cup, most popular  for a sports game ever  but the number of the week I wanted to do was this one  Google just spent  600 million dollars on real estate  just in Mountain View  and that also speaks to the value  of real estate in Mountain View, I probably got him  two sheds, but  that amazes me  and the amount of space that Google needs  it almost makes me wonder about whether  given all the hell Google is getting because of  the buses in San Francisco, I'm  I started fantasizing after I read this  of Google condos  so imagine you start to really  live in the company store, what would  Google apartments be like?  Wouldn't that be the coolest thing? Wouldn't you work for them just so you could  live in one? They're not doing that with this real estate  but I wish they would, I wish they'd build  and then you can imagine the sitcom about  living with Google all day long  there'd be  probably no garbage, there'd be robots

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you'd have slides instead  of stairs, you'd sleep in a pod

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I sort of imagined a Roomba  with Project Tango tablet  kind of mounted to it, just constantly  indexing your stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah, don't you want this?  Self-driving, flying

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  cars to go from  so one of the things that I started fantasizing  about because apparently according to this article  Google is interested in building  buildings that are taller than  what's allowed by Mountain View law  and they're working on changing those laws  and I personally think that Silicon Valley ought to have  lots of skyscrapers  I think that the value of real estate is so high  there's so many people who want to live there  earthquake technology is so good  these days that you can build all kinds of  tall buildings and why not?  These communities  used to be lovely  orchard farming communities  nowadays for the most part there are a bunch  of strip malls and track housing  Silicon Valley is not  a pretty place  it's okay  but it's not something that's  precious and needs to be preserved  I'd rather see the Jetsons city of the future  erected in Mountain View

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and you support some more residential  outside of San Francisco and then  do you deflate some of the issues there  you support more offices down there  is that an issue?  I think it has some opportunity  so Google just keeps growing and growing  I also think there's something too  we're very happy to have a large Google office  and I think the part of the answer for Google  and all of the San Francisco fight  is also to have more people  elsewhere than the Valley

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  yeah that's true as well  and of course Apple is really up the ante  with their spaceship campus which is well underway now  the construction is happening  the circular floor plan has already been built  and when that thing is done  it's supposed to be done next year I don't believe it  I think it will probably be done 2016, 2017  something like that  but when it's done it's going to be amazing  and I think that Google is going to want to step it up  and have a spectacular campus  to match it  right now Google probably has the coolest campus  in the Valley  the Google plaques they have big dinosaur statues  it's a really cool place to be  but when Apple's spaceship goes live  I think Google is going to want to step it up  and I hope the city of Mountain View  lets them build whatever they want  I'd be curious to see what they do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and by the way Apple to it's credit  it's swag store is open to the public  and I think they have an escort in there  Facebook you have to get an escort in  I think these companies are all missing a beat  not having public swag stores

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so I want to go to the wall

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apple knows how to do retail that's for sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they do secrecy but they also do retail  and that's the difference

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  their campus is actually going to let them up the secrecy  because right now there are all these leaks  that are caused by people taking pictures of the banners  that they put up at Moscone in San Francisco  before they do an event  future events are going to take place on the campus  underground  and that will also enable them  to have events that are unscheduled  right now you have to book Moscone  like two years in advance or something like that  in the future they'll be able to basically  put out a press release and say we're announcing something  at 2 o'clock and of course the Silicon Valley  press will come rushing in and they'll announce  and surprise us  that's a huge amount of floor space to just have in case  underground parking  that's going to be a really cool campus  everybody focuses in on the fact  that there's a big gigantic circular building  with these crazy opening and closing  windows and stuff like that  the coolest stuff is this kind of underground  they have a whole underground freeway  under this thing so it's going to be  a really great campus  well that is twig  I want to thank everyone  for coming on this show today  and joining us today Jeff Jarvis  professional of journalism at the City University of New York  author of Public Parts What Would Google Do  and Gutenberg the Geek  and Jeff blogs at BuzzMachine.com  thank you so much Jeff  and thanks for sprinting into your office  I think you had to break into your office with a crowbar right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No I had to break into the network with a crowbar  but that's another story

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and Gina Cipani creator of ThinkUp.com  host of Twits all about Android  and the founding editor of Life Hacker  and we got a little bit of Life Hacker trivia today  that was cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we did, we did thank you so much Mike  this was a lot of fun  thank you for covering while Leo's been out

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
