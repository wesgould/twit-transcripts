And we are here today with kind of an unusual situation.  Jeff Jarvis is in studio with us.  And he looks, he's got normal flesh colored skin.  Why do you look so pink?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not pink slime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're the same exact color I am.  I don't know what it is.  Your flesh looks completely normal.  Anyway, it's great to have you.  We have the same hair.  You know, it's not even that.  In fact, because of the advanced age of this panel,  we will be taking bathroom breaks every 60 minutes  on the show today.  Just so you know.  Guaranteed.  Also with us, and I'm actually thrilled to get him,  because Gina Trepeni had to cancel at the last minute,  take some time off.  But with us right now, Kevin Marks filling in for her.  And it's actually a big deal,  because he is, as you know, an employee of Salesforce.  And he's at their big, and I mean big conference,  Dreamforce going on in San Francisco right now.  Thank you for joining us, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thanks for inviting me.  Yes, this is huge.  There are, I think, 86,000 people registered at Dreamforce.  Wow.  And we've taken over all of Moscone  and Moscow and the streets in between in a bunch of hotels.  It feels like, you know,  South by Southwest walking around between venues.  It's pretty huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The South by Southwest of CRM, which is a...  Not quite as hip a crowd.  So what, you know, I should probably ask,  what does Salesforce do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We do business automation software.  Originally it was CRM, Custom Relationship Management.  And we've broadened that out into helping businesses  contact their customers,  the customers contact their businesses,  and running a lot of business process stuff.  So some of the stuff launched here was HR automation  as well with the stuff we bought from Ripple,  that's now work.com.  We launched Salesforce Identity,  which is a single sign-on with Salesforce  in multiple applications.  And we launched Salesforce Touch,  which is HTML5 based mobile app development for sales.  So we're plugging lots of other bits and pieces in.  Basically, the point of all this,  and Mark spent two and a half hours  explaining a lot of this this morning,  is to let the businesses get in contact with their customers  and get in contact with each other members of the business,  wherever they happen to be, through the web, hosted.  You know, their information has been asked  and it's accessible from anywhere,  with APIs and with open HTML5 apps  that they're plugging to that as well.  So there's a lot of bits to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's appropriate for the show because it is-  It's all cloud.  It's all cloud, it's all cloud.  The great evangelist of the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We've been on the cloud for a while ago  with the cloudiest company of all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The cloudiest company of them all.  And Mark Benioff, you mentioned Mark,  Mark Benioff, the CEO and founder of Salesforce,  considered quite a visionary in-  And one hell of a salesman too.  And yeah, and really a character, I guess.  I haven't met him, but we should get him.  I'd love if you could help us get him sometime  on one of our shows, maybe Triangulation.  He'd be so fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I interviewed him once for a charity event.  I was the last minute.  Luckily the audience didn't know  it was supposed to be Jimmy Kimmel interviewing him  and they got me.  But he's a fascinating character.  And plus he does a lot of charitable stuff.  Jeff Jarvis comes right before Kimmel in the photo.  It's actually perfect, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, well, and just so if you're just tuning in  and Kevin is in the lobby at Moscone Center  where he's on wifi.  And so the sound and the video may not be perfect,  but you know, Kevin likes to live dangerously  and do the show from the outside world.  So I think-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's made up today of about four pixels, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but we know what he looks like, so it's okay.  Squint when you look at him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I could try being, I could try 4G instead,  but that makes-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, let's stay there.  Let's stay there.  Hey, though, I have to say something about 4G.  The iPhone 5 was announced this past week.  It's coming out on Friday and it is an LTE phone.  And it's been really interesting to,  Verizon has LTE here.  I'm sure you have the choice of AT&T and Verizon in New York.  San Francisco has both too.  It is so fast right now.  And I've been told it used to be faster,  but I got 23 megabits down  and something like 18 megabits up.  Now how much will that degrade with-  On my Razer Max HD?  Well, and that's the question is,  what's gonna happen when,  I think the last count we're saying,  four million new iPhone users  suddenly swamped the network.  It's gonna be very interesting.  They're not all on the Verizon or AT&T,  but say a million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's a good point though.  When the phone came out, everybody swamped one network.  That's our memory.  Now they're-  So now they'll be swapping three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It should be much nicer.  Much better for all.  Well, no, cause they're selling a lot more phones.  Sorry.  They sold twice as many phones as past weekend,  you know, on launch weekend,  as they did with the iPhone 4S.  Twice as many phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One of your staffers was telling me earlier  about a Jimmy Kimmel routine.  I didn't see it.  Speaking of the Kimmel.  Went out and showed people-  Oh, he was showing them an iPhone 4S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Convincible is the 5.  And saying it's the new iPhone.  And they were fine.  They said, oh, well here, I'll show it.  We could show it.  I suppose we'll get, we could play a little bit of it here.  First look at the iPhone 5 from the Jimmy Kimmel show.  Are you getting audio for me?  Am I muted?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I believe your YouTube app is-  And those bastards.  It's almost as if the new iPhone  somehow ruins the old iPhone, but it doesn't.  It's all in your head.  In fact, we set a camera out on the street today.  It's all in your head.  We told people outside to check out the new iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple's line is, it just works.  Which is unavailable in the phone market.  Jimmy's line is, it's all in your head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Say that to a fan boy and see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The new iPhone 4S that everyone has.  And well, here's how that experiment played out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  First look, iPhone 5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The new iPhone 5 just came out today.  We wanted to take a look at it.  Wait a minute, more important.  Wait a minute, more important.  We got a pause.  Breaking news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We now have the first clovers.  Thank you, Matt.  So they do have decaf clover.  Cheers.  Cheers.  Matt, did you make it in 90 seconds?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I tried.  It was painful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He ran the whole, come here, Matt.  He ran the whole way.  By the way, this is the only guy who dresses to work here.  What's your last name?  Kinkle.  Matt Kinkle.  I don't even know.  He's our intern and he's done a great job.  But thank you.  This is a Malawi single bean.  Did the barista say anything?  Do you say anything about,  you like anything I should know about this before I try it?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nothing notable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very hot though.  Nothing notable.  They say that.  They say you should wait, Kevin, drink.  They say you should wait 90 seconds before you try it.  Really, Leo, you owe Matt a tie.  Oh, that's good.  Oh, I think we spilled a little on your green tie.  I'm sorry.  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thanks, Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what?  That's actually quite good.  That is pretty good.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  You could drink it without cream and sugar.  Do you want some?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Should we get you some?  No, no, no, I'm fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, I'm a real man.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, we don't need to run the rest  of the Jimmy Kimmel video.  You get the idea.  People were astounded by the iPhone 4S.  And we're in a kind of,  in an Android world, we're kind of in a similar boat here  because this is the new Kindle HD,  the seven inch Kindle HD, which I just got the other day.  And if you put it next to say a Nexus 7  or even the original Kindle Fire,  it's kind of hard to tell the difference  between one and the other.  I know you're a big Nexus 7 fan.  I'm now a huge Nexus 7 fan.  You know, here's the deal.  They're the same price.  So you'd be crazy not to get a Nexus 7.  It's running Jelly Bean, pure Jelly Bean instead of this.  It has all the Google apps.  It has the Google apps.  You'd be crazy not to get this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I use Kindle like crazy on my Nexus 7.  It works beautifully.  And they're making a big deal about the Dolby dual speaker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here, I'll play you some audio.  In fact, I've got my, this is my book on tape running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The heavy losses in bomber command.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it's good on voice.  I guess I'll play a movie and you can see.  It's not super amazingly brilliant sound.  Here's Iron Man 2.  We'll play that.  This is, by the way, if you're an Amazon Prime,  this is a free from the Amazon streaming.  This is how you irritate everybody on the airplane.  I kind of like is the X-ray feature.  So you can, as you're watching the movie,  if it's not irritating enough  that you got all the controls there,  as you're watching the movie,  you can press the X-ray feature  and learn more about Mickey Rourke.  I want to know what's wrong with this.  What a bad actor he is.  I want to know what's wrong with his fingernails.  That's what I want.  So it's a little dark.  You can kind of, let me zip it ahead a little bit here.  But you hear the sound.  It's not, it's not gonna, it's not gonna.  How does, this is a silly question.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Over 10 years curating that text writer.  I needed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, there's only.  But it's enough to watch it.  Yeah, it's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I watched five episodes of Downton Abbey on this thing.  Yeah, and if you're listening to headphones,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  which you should be doing,  it will undoubtedly sound as good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was next to a guy on the plane  who was using a small tablet a few weeks ago,  and he was playing the game full volume up  with no headphones.  That's annoying.  Not allowed.  Sorry.  So show me a book.  Yeah, you want to see a book?  All right.  The Kindle on this looks good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I would say this is, you know,  Oh, but do you have WhisperSync on there?  Do you have that new audio video WhisperSync feature?  That's a nice, I have to show you this.  This is kind of a nice feature.  So I'm reading an Agatha Christie novel,  the mysterious, by the way, in order to promote this,  Amazon is giving away 20 public domain books,  including, you know, David Copperfield and this.  This is an Agatha Christie,  the mysterious of Phelous Stiles.  But watch, this is kind of cool.  By the way, when you get the Kindle book for free,  you go to Audible, you get the Audible book for free.  So it's 20 Audible books, classics, Ethan Frome,  Huckleberry Finn, stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which should be the way it works anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, these are public domain.  But they're using good readers.  And here's the audio.  I don't know if you're gonna be able to hear this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Stiles case has now somewhat subsided.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What it does is it's highlighting the text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have been asked both by my friend,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now this isn't the-  That's an important deal.  That's an important deal for students.  I'm on the board of Learning Ally,  the former recording for the blind and dyslexic.  And they spent a lot of money  to arrange just that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is phenomenal.  That's a big deal.  It highlights it.  It also does whisper sync between audio and text.  So you can listen in the car,  then get home and start reading on the Kindle.  And you'll jump to where you were on the Kindle.  You can listen on a variety of devices.  And okay, so here's the pros on this device.  It's easy.  So I think somebody who's focused on content consumption  in the Amazon world is gonna be thrilled  because you don't even have to log into your Amazon account.  When you get it, it's already associated  with your account.  It's got big icons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I watched my daughter trying to help my mother-in-law  with a new iPad.  Perfect for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's great for consuming Amazon content.  Of course it has the store.  Amazon's very much in your face on this.  So, I mean, that might be a negative,  but if you're an Amazon lover  and you're getting a lot of content from Amazon, it's great.  It's decently fast, but it's not as fast as a Nexus 7  or an iPad.  So the real issue is this was a great choice at 200 bucks  when nothing was 200 bucks.  But now you can get the Nexus 7.  Which is just really amazing.  And I think for anybody who listens to this show,  certainly the Nexus 7's a no-brainer.  But for somebody who is not a geek,  who just wants to consume content,  I actually think this is not a horrid choice.  Yeah, it's got a big bezel.  You know, the irony is that the Nexus 7

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  really should have cellular service in it.  Right, well it will, I'm sure.  It will, as you showed when you opened it up.  So it doesn't make much sense without it,  whereas that's fine without it.  Right.  You'll load it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you can, by the way, the next version, the 8.9 inch,  will have a $50 a year version of 3G.  But it'll only be 250 megabytes a month.  Buy the Nexus 7, unless you're somebody  who just is gonna consume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Buy the Nexus 7 for yourself,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and buy that for your grandmother.  Yeah, this is for grandma.  Yeah.  Kevin Marks is, I've been vamping  because Kevin, we dropped out Kevin Marks.  He was so jealous he had to run to the Starbucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We used to have one of those machines  at Google when I was there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Of course you would, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And building 45, and it makes very nice coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It does.  I mean, it's brewed coffee, it's not espresso.  I'm kind of a fan of the espresso drink.  So let's talk, gosh, there's so much to talk about.  And we just mentioned Twitter briefly.  Because what the hell?  First they close off the app ecosystem.  They basically say to developers, thanks, move along here.  We'll take care of the third party stuff.  Then now they just remove third party image services  from their app.  So if you're TwitPick or YFrog or Twitvid, bye bye.  See you later.  Now the newest thing that they've done  is they've replaced the app on iOS,  what was at least a decent app,  when they bought it from Tweety, with a piece of crap.  I haven't seen it yet.  Everybody is just very upset.  There's no links, you can't click links in it.  The only way to see the content of a tweet  is to open the tweet individually  and then you can see more.  It wastes space.  I don't have an iOS device here so I can't show you.  Well go ahead, have you updated Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We can update it while we're talking.  I got one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, what do you think Kevin?  Have you played with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it was the next time.  What it feels like is it feels like the Android app.  And the iPad app was better.  Right.  It had that multiple page thing  where you could keep putting things across  and that would work, that's all gone.  Now it behaves much more like the Android app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, here comes the iPad.  Here comes the iPad.  So yeah, it does look like the,  in fact it's exactly like the Android version of the app.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But except that they,  oh, close it, hang on.  Except that they open tweets in line now.  So if you click a tweet, it'll expand in line.  And if there's one that has a link in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here's some links.  Radio View has got a YouTube link in order to go to it.  Now once I open it, I've got the video here.  Which then that's the whole point of this.  They don't want you to go anywhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They want you to watch everything on Twitter.  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so everything opens in line like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you know, I was talking to somebody on Twitter this week  and they said, well, don't you want to have  the kind of best experience?  And that that's why Twitter is making all these dictates  about what's right.  Except Twitter isn't necessarily giving us  the best experience. This isn't the best experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the problem.  Look at this, when you go into this realm,  look at all this wasted space here.  This is all stuff they could have, you know.  Yeah.  It occurred to me this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twitter is like a brother-in-law  that you can't quite figure out.  You like, you love your sister,  you figure she's got to see something in him  and you've had some fun at Thanksgiving,  but he keeps on doing weird stuff.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know?  Well, this isn't weird.  That's the problem is this is completely understandable  if you think, well, what Twitter wants to do  is close off the third party ecosystem  and make sure everybody consumes the ads  that go along with Twitter.  The problem is, what's sad about this is  they've taken what was a great UI, Tweety,  and they have basically taken all the goodness out of it  and replaced it with a crappy UI.  And it feels to me like it's a cynical move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The problem is they're not saying enough.  And I urged, we'll see if this happens,  but I urged Twitter to bring Dick Costello to our show.  Yes.  He's speaking with the...  That's it on that, I guess.  Well, no.  Well, no, they need to be able to say more.  He's going to speak at the online news association.  He could win us over.  He could explain this.  He really could.  He's a comedian.  He could work with humor.  But what I said was that, all right,  they make an argument that you want this button  on every tweet, and then they stop there.  What they should do is go on and say, and here's why.  Here's the rationale behind it.  Or even if they say, we know you liked that,  but here's why we had to change it,  here's how it affects our business.  I think they've got to communicate more.  And they communicated so little.  In the early days, there was a lot of,  A, turmoil, and B, they weren't sure what the hell they were.  But if they now have a vision,  then I think that Dick and company have to communicate that  to users and developers,  and then we might understand better.  Then we might get it.  And I understand they've got to be a business.  The same as a newspaper that says,  we've got to cut back to three days a week  so we can survive.  You don't like it, but you get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John Gruber writes, they threw away Lauren Brichter.  He wrote, Tweety, groundbreaking UI.  Replace it with a timeline where you can't tap anything.  URLs, usernames, hashtags, images.  Instead, you have to open the tweet first.  I can't remember the last time I saw a Twitter client  in which you couldn't tap URLs from the timeline.  Josh Tepolsky says, let me be perfectly clear.  The previous Twitter for iPad was one of the apps  you used to show off the iPad.  It was awesome.  Not anymore.  And so I, and I'm sure everybody else,  in fact, O'Malek asked, maybe everybody at Twitter too,  now we're using Tweetbot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For as long as we can.  When is the moment gonna come when they are gonna cut off?  Is that gonna happen?  It has to.  That's the next, that's the issue.  They're gonna just shut off at some point.  That's gonna be a nuclear winner,  but they're gonna just say no more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How far can you push the bottom line  before you actually have the negative impact  of losing users?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  And it happened too in the case where they had to hand over  the tweets for the Occupy Wall Street.  And they fought hard not to do that.  They fought hard to say that it's our stuff.  They went the right way.  But the thing that finally pushed them over  was when the court demanded their financial statements  and threatened to fine.  So I get the economics of it, but it's still economics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do the 140 million users of whom all but two million  are completely normal people  even know this is happening or care?  No.  400 million daily tweets,  that means a few hundred thousand of us are complaining.  Yes.  And the rest are going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  But I think that doesn't,  doesn't that have some impact potentially on Twitter  and things like trying to draw great staff?  Oh yeah, that's for sure.  If you started selling out and advertising crap,  some of these people would start looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you think of that, Kevin?  I mean, you're a programmer, you know technology,  you know tech people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do think it's a shame.  I mean, I was at the XXO,  XOXO conference up in Portland this weekend  and some of the original Twitter guys were there  and Blaine was there and Rabble was there.  And they were looking sad about this as well  and looking at what can we do to build an open version  of this and is that something we can actually achieve?  There was definitely a lot of that saw in the air there.  And I think that, yeah,  I think the thing about what you said was, you know,  significant, I think,  remember they went on the launch dispersion.  So they are pushing this out for a mainstream audience  who are apparently not tweeting much.  My worry is the things that we find annoying about this  are the same things that these celebrities,  that all these people are signing up to Twitter  to join in with, to listen to, will find annoying.  And if they're not careful, they're gonna end up,  it will stop being the place where the famous people  banter with each other as well.  And then-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not just famous people, Kevin, but also brands, right?  If a brand wants to promote something,  a media brand wants to promote something  and they want that link to cause traffic  to go to their site, if that starts dropping,  they're gonna not see Twitter as a good way  to promote themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, but I, you know, that's true.  I mean, the, I was thinking more about, you know,  a lot of what makes Twitter Twitter  is that the conversation, the banter,  the fact that you can have a random conversation  with anyone, including famous people,  when they said they would sometimes, you know,  retweet you or whatever.  And that is, that's the draw of it.  But there are things they've done that made that harder.  So some of the stuff they've done  is supposed to make that better.  But they, you know, some, what I find is that the,  the sort of back and forth stuff that used to be easy  is not as easy with this.  So I'm still using custom clients  and when I'm using those things are fine.  But, you know, definitely I'll be using this one a lot less  but this is something I'd use some of the time.  Normally I'm using Echo phone on the Mac  or I usually use the Twitter client on the Android.  But I've got my own hacked thing  that turns tweets into notifications on Android.  So that, and so they end up looking like that,  even if you can see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's interesting.  That becomes your Twitter timeline is your notifications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, so it's not all every notification,  every tweet that I get,  get notifications is somewhat filtered.  I want filters on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The ones you want.  Where'd you get that?  Did you write that yourself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I forked, there's an open source thing called NanoTweeter  that was written three years ago  and I forked it a little bit so that it did the newer updates.  That's it's open sources up on-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is why, by the way, everyone should learn to code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I need to clean it up and actually hand it out properly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I swear, if you're in high school now or college  and you're not learning how to write code, basic code,  you're not literate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was it Estonia, I think, that decreed  that all elementary school children will now learn to code?  I hope so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was the theme of the MIT Introduction to Programming  book, which is now available online, by the way.  And I'll give you the URL in a second.  I think it's s-i-c-p.org.  They say in the intro, this is a course for everybody,  not for computer scientists, because basic literacy  requires understanding how this stuff works.  I don't know if that's, I think that's,  unfortunately that's not me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's the case, but it also is a way to think.  It's one of the former heads of research said at Google  at an event I went to in New York,  is you want to think algorithmically.  You don't necessarily just want to code,  you want to think in that kind of logic.  Exactly, or at least understand that.  And it wouldn't be that, you know,  compared to the cost of going to the moon,  how many moon shots would we enable?  How much innovation would we enable  if we trained every school child to code?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that nuts, Kevin?  I mean...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it makes sense to teach people to do it.  Logic.  And AAU in the chat just pointed to karnacademy.org slash CS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's lots of places to learn.  There's Udacity, there's Coursera,  which just added 33 new universities.  I mean, there's lots of places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just wrote a post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The catch one's good because it's, you know,  that's where people are already learning maths and physics  and they've built a very nice interactive editor there.  I don't know if you played with that,  but they've got a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At Khan Academy, really?  Very nice.  Code Academy.  Code Academy.  No, Khan Academy.  Not Khan, Code Academy.  No, no, Khan.  Khan Academy?  They have an error?  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, have a play with it.  He showed it off at Disrupt last week,  for last week, but he launched it before then.  Oops, and we'll launch that browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow, that's neat.  Good for him.  Saw Khan is a man.  We've got to get him on one of our shows here.  So they have a code thing now too.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just wrote a post for the Nieman Lab,  which is a really, really good site  that covers my wonky world of journalism,  and I'm trying to outline what I think  is the future of training journalists.  And we've learned that the classroom  is a rotten place to teach technology.  Tools.  I agree.  Right, because everybody's at different spots,  different ambitions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't teach programming by lecture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, so what we need to do is A,  research the outcomes that are needed  to know what to do in your career,  and then B, curate the stuff that's already out there,  like Khan Academy and all this great stuff on YouTube.  And another story I think in here is that YouTube  is doing a grant of money to the best YouTube educators.  So it's gonna get better and better and better.  Then universities and schools can still add value.  We had tutoring and certification and context.  Absolutely, one-on-one is valuable, but.  But the basics of how to learn this tool,  you learn online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love Robert, getting back to our Twitter story,  and then we'll get, actually,  I wanna cover this code thing too,  but Robert X. Cringely writing in InfoWorld says,  "'You know that bluebird Twitter uses as its mascot?'  Turns out it's really a stool pigeon.  We reported last week that a judge had ordered Twitter,  Judge Matthew Sciarrino Jr. had ordered Twitter  to hand over private information about Malcolm Harris,  he's the Occupy Wall Street protester,  and in fact said, if you don't do it,  you're gonna have to give me  your private financial statements Twitter  so that I can come up with a large enough fine to sting you.'  So now it's not merely his public tweets,  which I understand, the judge says,  look, you shout it out an open window, it's public now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As some are still arguing that that only depends  if someone was listening and the whole world wasn't listening,  but I agree with the judge on that, to that extent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And by the way, it's a $250 fine that Harris is facing.  They demanded more than three months worth  of Harris's tweets, which Harris said is,  "'The legal equivalent of busting a party with loud noise  and demanding my phone records for three and a half months  to see if I helped plan it.'  Not a bad point.  I don't know if they're asking for more than just that.  It sounds like they're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Both are standing up on a matter of principle  and precedent here, which is vital.  And again, Twitter, the irony.  The Twitter cave.  So Twitter at the one point,  AMAC fought for what was right here for a long time  and argued that this is our stuff.  Yet at the same time, now you have a company  that just announced today, Gnip,  Gnip.  Gnip.  And have the firehose.  They have the firehose, and now they're gonna offer  the entire history of tweets.  Going back to 2006?  Yes.  We didn't know that Twitter had that stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because we can only go back a few thousand tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But go back to the principle that Twitter argued  in this case is that the tweets are owned by the user.  Then can I have them, please?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Gnip doesn't give that for free, by the way.  You have to pay for that access.  Oh no.  Full historical, I mean, when Gina comes back next week,  I'm gonna ask her about this,  this is something of great use to her and think up.  Full historical access to the Twitter firehose,  available exclusively from Gnip.  This is the one and only, to my knowledge, company  that Twitter did license the firehose to from day one.  Of course, they don't say what the price is.  You have to contact them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have a salesperson contact you.  Salesman will call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, Tellen did the first year.  Have you seen that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, old, tellen.io slash old tweets.  And you can search for yourself and see what you said  in your original tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So did they buy it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, Well, Tellen crawled it.  Oh, he crawled it.  Okay.  He sniped every ID number to try and find the right ones  that actually had tweets on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if I do Leo Laporte,  this will show every tweet I've ever done?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, this only starts in 2006 to 2007.  It's the first year of Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is 2007.  So intro, these are actually people speaking to me.  Huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just read all the Twitters for Leo Laporte and I, Justine.  Not sure why I did it.  My head hurts and I have to poo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This thing will go nowhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is from February 2007.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Huh.  I thought there was a way to see all of your own,  but maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stalking Leo Laporte.  So these are people talking about me.  I wonder if maybe because I didn't tweet much,  Jimmy Wales says something to me.  Look at that, I even knew Jimmy Wales in those days.  He was actually talking to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, he's talking to me as well.  Oh, that's it.  If you didn't, no.  I thought there was a way to click on a user and get the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe do I have to put at Leo Laporte?  No, but then that would just get the ads.  Yeah.  He has a syntax here somewhere.  But that's very interesting.  So he's been crawling it all this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, he wrote a bot that would go,  basically he was doing it by user ID, status ID.  So he started a command that went up and wrote some code  to work out where they actually were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  User ID colon dollar sign screen name.  See if I knew how to, oh, you don't need the dollar sign.  There we go.  And then-  Oh, there you go.  Then you got one of them, yeah.  No, no, no, maybe I do need a dollar sign.  Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's all right.  User ID colon Kevin Marks.  I just did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It did work, huh?  Were you on then or was it one of the times you quit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Probably was one of the times.  I don't know how far back it goes.  There's Kevin Marks.  His first tweet, ladies and gentlemen, Kevin Marks,  December 11th, 2006, sneezing and heading for bed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kevin wouldn't shake my hand yesterday  because he had the egg you again.  Oh my God.  I'm gonna do something here, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow, this is kind of, so that's,  but this is, that's not illicit, right?  He's been scraping him and saved him in his own database.  Yes.  The judge should have just used that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, this is 2006, 2006 to 2007.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ah, so, okay, so he must not be the time period  when I was tweeting.  It was interesting, actually,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  when he first put this up, a bunch of people went through  and found the first ant replies  and the first hashtags and all that stuff.  It's quite fun for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow, that's very cool.  It is cool.  I wonder if he can find the Donald Trump tweets.  Apparently, what's the headline that you wrote?  I love this.  Twitter's become a haven for celebrities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a medium for moguls,  unfiltered to make fools of themselves.  So Donald Trump goes after poor Kate Middleton  and basically just says, it's your fault, honey.  She shouldn't have taken her top off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But she didn't know there were paparazzi  with long lenses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, long lenses.  Twitter's been amusing this week.  We were joking before the show  about the amazing Jesus Wife hashtag  that's there because a fragment of a document was found  that makes reference to Jesus' wife.  My favorite moment of this week  was seeing the Muslim rage hashtag.  Newsweek had a rather outrageous cover  arguing that there was Muslim rage,  which was just was slamming billions of people  as if they all thought the same.  Then they asked, hey, come and talk about our cover  hashtag Muslim rage.  The beautiful part was that people took it over,  especially Muslims.  Good.  So for example, women saying,  I'm having a great hair day and no one can see it.  Muslim rage.  And the humor and the humanity of it was just magnificent.  So to have that and Jesus' wife in the same week  showing humor around religion is kind of a wonderful thing.  That's the great thing about the hashtag,  which by the way, Twitter didn't invent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The shawarma guy wraps my sandwich too tightly  so I have to rip off little pieces of paper bit by bit.  Muslim rage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is great.  So there's a wired threat level blog has a compilation of,  it says comedy ensues as Twitter users hijack  Newsweek's Muslim rage hashtag.  This is what Twitter was made for.  This is exactly what they were for.  I think.  Yes.  This is a great use of Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's what I'm saying is banter.  It's like being collectively silly and it's wonderful.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's more than that.  And also it brought a humanity  and that I think we desperately need now.  And it became a counterpoint to Newsweek.  I argued in Newsweek at one point that,  on Twitter at one point, that Newsweek was acting  like a troll, was doing exactly what trolls do,  which I talked about, you know,  and towards the video that was out there.  It was trying to incite a reaction and did it to do that  and got the reaction.  Zeynep Tufekci, who I quoted last week on the show,  TechSoc on Twitter, said,  no Jarvis is a difference here.  She's very, very smart and catches me up.  And said a troll is someone you don't know.  A troll is some anonymous bozo.  Right.  Newsweek has a power.  So their behavior is trollish.  They have much more power than a troll.  What do you call it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sensationalism?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You were interviewing that chap from the Daily Beast  yesterday whose name I've, has escaped me.  And he said, yeah, we do do that on purpose pretty much.  Didn't he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's the same state in the blog world.  I don't know what you call it in a magazine cover,  but it's the same.  Yellow journalism.  Yellow journalism.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sensationalism.  Yeah.  And it's as old as newspapers.  As Mr. Hurst.  Yes.  That's right.  Who invented that and created a war.  Let's take a break.  I'm sure we have to.  Yes.  We need to calm down and drink some more  of this clover coffee.  I'm already buzzing on the Malawi stuff.  And it's good.  And you know, it doesn't,  and this is another, apparently another selling point  of this, and by the way, they didn't buy ads.  If they did, I would happily accept their money,  but they haven't paid me a penny for this.  In fact, we paid them for this.  But one of the selling points, supposedly,  of the machine, the clover machine that we got here  at the local Starbucks is that the coffee stays fresh longer.  It's so far so good.  And so far so good.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Drinking decaf.  I said, it's sad.  Blame my cardiologist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really?  I think everybody says coffee's good for you now.  It's the caffeine and it's the-  You should have him read more.  Read more of those sensationalist trade press.  We're brought to you today by our friends at Stamps.com.  Disintermediating the United States Postal Service,  one consumer at a time,  with the happy cooperation of the US Postal Service.  They love Stamps.com.  Why go to the post office  when you could print postage yourself, right?  This is legal.  I'm not talking counterfeiting.  I'm talking using your computer, your printer,  no special ink, no postage meter, just Stamps.com.  And it's not just the stamp.  It's not just the postage.

You could take addresses out of QuickBooks, for instance,  print your invoices,  print the envelopes with the postage on them.  Looks more professional.  It works great.  If you're an Amazon or eBay seller,  it'll take the data from there  so you don't have to cut and paste  or type your own mailing labels.  I know people actually keep IBM Selectrics around  so they can type on envelopes.  Yes.  Yes.  Right?  You don't have to do that.  Stamps.com, they'll do the whole thing for you.  These modern printers today, they could do anything.  I want you to try Stamps.com now.  We've got a special offer for you.  If you go to Stamps.com,  postage only a click away,  you see special offer, $80 value.  You might be tempted to go,  oh yeah, I'll take it.  No, stop.

We love those.  In fact, we got two of them because we love them so much.  The $5 supply kit, the four-week trial,  a no-risk trial offer for you and worth $110  if you go to Stamps.com and use the offer code TWIG  for this week in Google.  TWIG really is,  if you don't want to go to the post office,  I don't know anybody who wants to go to the post office,  this is a great solution for you.  Stamps.com for a small business,  a business like ours is the best.  And we thank them for their support this week in Google.  Failure is a feature, says The Verge.  Google gobbles up startups to stay sharp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's almost a TLDR from The Verge.  It's very, very long,  but it's actually a good piece on looking at their...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What does, I see TLDR.  What does that mean?  TLDR?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  It means too long, didn't read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Too long, didn't read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The great thing about it is the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I see that all the time.  I never knew what I meant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Proper punctuation is TL, semicolon.  Semicolon, rather.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  DR.  Too long, semicolon, didn't read.  Yeah.  And when are you supposed to use that?  You need a rubber, do any of the rubbers stand up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Reddit, I think it started.  I think it was on Reddit where people went and said,  you link to it and they come back and say,  no, I'm not bothering you.  Too long, didn't read.  You can tell me to read it, I'm not going to.  It's the new insouciance.  But this is TL, but read.  TLBR.  TLBR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So what is the thesis?  Cause that's too long, I didn't read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I saw lollipops and that's it.  Basically just recounting the various startups  that Google has bought and saying that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it started with the most recent acquisition  of Snapseed, which I am very unhappy about.  Ah, do tell.  And I know Trey Ratcliffe wrote a little bit about it,  but he's too problematic and he likes the Google folks  too much to be honest.  So here's the problem, Nick Software,  which is the company they bought,  is really a fantastic company that makes plugins  for Lightroom, Photoshop and Aperture  that are used not only by pros everywhere.  Every time we interviewed a pro on Twitphoto,  they'd say, oh, I love SilverFX  or one of the other Nip plugins.  But a lot of amateurs like me use it  and it really is very valuable.  It seems to me the case that they bought it  not because of that, but because of their app, Snapseed,  which is an iOS app, which I imagine Google wants.  It's a very nice, easy to use photo filter app.  And they need their Instagram answer.  It's a consumer app.  And I think, yeah, exactly, I would imagine  they'll fold this into Picasa, maybe even  into other Google apps.  And I'm really fear for the future of the Nick plugins,  which are really, really great.  And I suspect that that has nothing to do  with why Google acquired them.  So it may even be an acquire, one of those hires  where you get these guys.  And that's one of the things that bugs me  about these big companies.  Facebook does it all the time.  Google does it too.  They buy companies for the people  and they shut down the products.  Drop.io, which was Sam Lesson's fantastic, useful tool.  That was Facebook, right?  Was bought by Facebook and sales immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, Jaikoo is the Google one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, and you know me, I love Jaikoo.  I thought Jaikoo was so much better than Twitter.  And obviously I was wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a nice chart, lower in the story, Chad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We don't know.  At the time they bought it,  they had about the same number of users,  but they took all the engineers off it  and got them working on mobile apps  and brought Uri to Mountain View  to try and explain social to them, which.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Didn't work, and now Uri's doing his own thing.  Yeah.  Yeah, and they open sourced Jaikoo,  but I think it's too late now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was too late and it was also,  it was another iteration of Jaikoo.  So yeah, they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You need critical mass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  They ported Jaikoo to App Engine,  which mostly Andy did that,  and then they open sourced that, yeah.  But I think then they actually shut down  the hosted version as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a great, if it's too long,  didn't read Ben Cooper's article,  at least there's a great infographic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  With a nice little.  Yes.  So when Larry Page took over as CEO,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  his first move was to restructure the company  into seven groups, Search, YouTube,  Chrome and Apps, GeoCommerce, Mobile, Social, and Ads.  And they show how all the app acquisitions,  going back to 2001,  are funneled into those seven different groups  where everything went.  I suppose Jaikoo's in here somewhere.  There's so many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jaikoo's bottom row, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bottom row, Jaikoo, there it is.  2007, went into social.  It's kind of depressing, frankly.  I don't even like looking at it.  And I'm sure, but for people like Yuri,  that's great, they got a few, they got some cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the new exit strategy.  Yeah, this is the exit strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think that that's bad for innovation.  I think that companies that are saying,  let's build something so that Yahoo or Google will buy us.  Now Yahoo's gonna be the one with the deep pockets.  2.4 billion going into Yahoo's pockets.  Not so deep.  No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not all going in their pockets.  Uh-oh, what happened?  Marissa changed and she was going to keep it as a war chest,  and then various investors went after her,  so she's returning most of that to the investors.  3.x billion.  I was really hoping to get a little bit of that.  Yeah.  She's keeping, I think, 400 million.  Is that enough? Is that enough?  No, I want more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought if she had 2.4 billion,  she'd give me 10% at least.  Oh, that's too bad.  It is, isn't it?  Speaking of Marissa Meyer,  I was a little perturbed by the fact  that everybody used the headline,  Marissa Meyer buys iPhone 5s for employees.  She didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The headline should be,  Marissa Meyer bought everything  but BlackBerrys for employees, right?  Yes.  She said, you have a choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nokia did a headline which is,  Marissa Meyer buys whatever their model number is  for all employees.  The Lumia 920.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a better headline.  Talk about sensationalism and link bait.  That's the link bait.  She didn't buy iPhone 5s for everybody.  She offered them iPhone 5s, Galaxy S3s,  HTC One's, Lumia 920s, as you said,  everything but the BlackBerry  they had been giving their employees.  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh well, I'm sorry.  Got me on a little low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the acquisition thing,  that was another thing at XOXO conference.  They had a bunch of people  who built websites a long time ago,  just get up and talk, Matt Howey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Chris Paul of 4chan.  And that was interesting.  But they were both saying,  we built this thing, we wanna keep it running.  They also both said,  the amount of revenue we're getting from the advertising  is going down rapidly  because everyone's switching to mobile  and then we don't get paid for ads on mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they had the Facebook problem before Facebook had it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  And Chris Paul said he's actually losing money  on 4chan at the moment,  which I suppose is not surprising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're not gonna make much advertising  from people on 4chan.  They were running ad blockers.  How did he ever make money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Moot also said, I'm not in it for the money.  This is a hobby, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly, yeah.  And he's making money from Canvas,  which he's got venture funding for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Canvas is an interesting,  is actually a very interesting product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's quite cute.  It's image remix.  It's kind of like, what's the other one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mixel.  Mixel, right?  Mixel, yeah, Koi Vans.  Which also got shut down and pivoted.  Everybody's dying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But this was interesting.  People saying building things and keeping them going.  And that's a challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is part of the problem at 4chan,  and this is actually something, Jermaine, to me,  is Mark M. in the chat room saying ads on 4chan  where 90% of the users use ad block.  Is that a problem?  Is it gonna be difficult to make money  if you appeal to an intelligent, tech-literate audience?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it is.  Jenny Jordan had a tussle with her users this week  via Twitter. Redesign on Boing Boing.  On Boing Boing, and people saying, use ad block.  And she said, if I may use this language,  she said, okay, if you're gonna use the ad block software,  okay, just don't be a dick about it,  because that's how we make our living.  That's how we provide this.  But how can you not be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're using it, you are being a dick.  I think so too.  If I go to Boing Boing, there's an ad for a festival,  state farm, American Apparel.  This was one of the first federated media sites.  And if you love Boing Boing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's the point?  What are you proving by saying,  oh, I can't see an ad, it's an ugly thing?  It's ridiculous.  And now this gets me going, Leo.  It is kind of ugly in the news.  But now we have the fact that Google has to go along.  So it's gonna now include a do not track option.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so let's talk about that.  We talked about that on security now.  Do not track, which is, and it's a web stand.  I'm actually glad we have you on Kevin Marx,  because Kevin Marx is an expert on standards on the web  and a strong proponent of open standards.  And the Apache Foundation made an interesting decision.  So there is apparently a standard set for do not track.  This is a setting in the browser.  There are three choices in the browser.  It can be unset, which is, by the way,  according to the standard, the default.  Am I not right?  That's what it's supposed to be.  And then if you set it, then you're saying,  I wish to make sure that ad companies  do not use tracking cookies on me.  And if you say, okay, go ahead.  Please do track.  So you can have unset, do not track, or do track.  The default, according to the open standard, is unset.  Right, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Apache Foundation has decided to ignore the setting  in Internet Explorer 10, the next version of IE,  because Microsoft, when you choose automatic settings,  not when you customize it,  but when you choose automatic settings,  turns do not track on, deciding for its users,  probably correctly so,  that if they only knew what tracking cookies were,  they would block them.  I know, you hate it when I say that.  Just as Apple decided third-party cookies  would be wrong on a normal spot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Only if you express it in a certain way.  If you want to starve your friends at Boing Boing,  that's another matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and this is related to that point,  which is why we're bringing it up.  So the folks at Apache said,  because there's a standard and the standard is unset,  we are going to ignore the setting.  It needs to be explicitly set by users  for us to pay attention to it.  Kevin, is that the right answer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's kind of an arms race, and that's the problem.  The problem is, part of this is,  Microsoft is doing this, partly as a way to poke at Google,  I'm almost convinced.  Just to say, aha, we can turn off track,  and that will hurt Google,  and we're the biggest browser, or we were.  And there's a bit of that going on there, almost certainly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Google had, until this week,  not had a do not track option in Chrome,  although they say now it's going to be coming by the end of the year.  They're going to add one, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which is really reasonable.  It's a standard, it makes some sense, people don't know that.  The challenge is explaining to the user what this is,  and that's a problem.  And it's like the EU cookie directive.  There's now a directive, you have to explain that you're using cookies.  So every time you go to a British website,  there's this little thing in the corner saying,  hi, we're using cookies.  Click here to have us explain cookies to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dismiss. You're dismissed now, Jeeves, in Santa's, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, and I think, in my opinion, part of the issue is that the word  tracking cookie is unnecessarily inflammatory.  These are ad customization cookies.  And if you said to people, I wish somebody would do a poll,  I wish Gallup would do a poll saying,  how do you feel about ad customization?  Would you prefer to have customized ads or not, yes or no?  And then say, how do you feel about tracking cookies?  Would you prefer to have tracking cookies on or off?  It would be the exact opposite result,  even though technically that's the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Part of what we have to do here is look at Microsoft's motives.  Microsoft and News Corp, I would argue,  have pretty much given up on the ad business  and they're pulling the ladder up after them.  And they're trying to turn this into an advantage.  They've been bad at selling ads.  News Corp is going to be on a paywall.  Since we can't do it, let's screw everybody else.  And let's also make it seem as if this is a benefit we're giving you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you think Microsoft's pushing this notion that tracking cookies are bad?  Yeah, absolutely.  You know, go ask our chat room because I get an argument  every time I say what I just said.  They say, no, they're spying on us.  What do you say, Kevin?  The voice of reason, ladies and gentlemen.  Jeff and I are kind of polar opposites.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, not exactly.  You could be reasonable if you try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's complicated.  I mean, that's the thing.  There's a whole bunch of this stuff that...  The thing that's actually surprising to me is how big the web pages are.  My machine was slowing down the other day.  I noticed the memory was full.  So I killed the biggest processes, which happened to be Chrome browser  processes, and I had 250 megs of RAM used up for one TechCrunch page.  Oh, please.  What is all that memory for?  Because there's so much cruft on there for all the different advertising  and tracking bits and pieces and embedded other bits of sites and blah, blah, blah  going on.  There is something very odd when the average web page is bigger than a bitmap  of it in memory.  That's just weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's right.  And I think it was a discipline we all had to learn.  We made web pages early on.  I remember early in my days of running sites, the pages got bigger and bigger  and bigger, and the traffic went down and down and down.  And now with speed being what it is, you lose a discipline.  So I agree with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't it like putting an ad blocker into a browser and turning it on by default?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Exactly what it is.  It's a little bit like that, yeah.  Because the ads become worthless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, OK, there is an issue on that.  And I think this is also a dirty little secret is that ad customization doesn't  work.  Look what happens on Facebook where they know everything about you  and the ads are complete crap.  Well, that's because they're not.  No, that's a sales problem.  That's because they didn't sell it.  I think you make the case that, yeah, advertisers want tracking cookies,  but not because it actually helps them anyway.  Well, no, I'll put it another way, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm dealing with one site I know that is local and it has a lot of out-of-market traffic.  So I asked him, I said, well, what's the differential in value here?  It's huge, right?  It's 25 times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.  It's the same.  Clear Channel blocks international listeners.  But it's radio streams.  They can't monetize them and they consume resources.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's simple.  You start with, well, I said at Dreamforce yesterday that to help with big data,  what media needs right now is small data.  You need to start with the first knowledge about you.  Are you part of their audience or not?  And that's tracking, right?  That says, I've set a cookie that says I know where you live so that I can give you local content  and local advertising and benefit from it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But isn't it legitimate also to have a concern that these tracking cookies are used  in much more nefarious ways?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Open your mouth.  Let's see the transmitter.  No.  I mean, what nefarious...  It's like the other middle of the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the chat room just said they're aggregating data about my web use over many years  and I don't know what the end is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the tricky bit is that when you're using an ad network,  the works are more than one site, then it's tracking your behavior across sites.  Right.  And that is the thing that makes people slightly nervous because you've embedded iFrame  that's got the ad in it.  That's the third party cookie issue.  I said there's a third party cookie.  But it's also anonymized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's anonymized.  Yeah, but who cares if it's anonymized because they know enough about me  that they don't need my name.  That's the least of it.  But again, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So imagine the dark room where they're using all this data.  Have you heard of a single case, a single case?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'll give you the one that's the canonical case,  the insurance company who through aggregated data realizes I eat a lot of Tim Hortons  and Dunkin' Donuts and refuses me insurance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But no, no, no, wait, wait.  They can't do that from cookies because it doesn't tie to your name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, but that's easy enough because it's not really anonymous  because one site I logged into and that information was shared with other...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That data is then not tracked with the rest of the data.  So when a double-click cookie comes along, it's not tying to Axiom in that data.  It has the data of certain online web behavior, but it doesn't tie to your name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK.  So why does Google capitulate then and turn this on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because they had agreed to be part of a standard  and thus standard you referenced.  They were not going to have it at all.  Right.  And I would actually support that.  But they put it in there.  And I also support that.  It's a choice.  It's fine.  And I suspect they'll bury the choice, which is fine.  And here's what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  From now on or in a year or so, every time you go to somewhere like Boing Boing,  it's going to say, I see you're not using tracking cookies.  I'm sorry you can't read this site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wish someone would.  I wish they'd say there's a price to doing what they do.  Now, some people will say, OK, fine, charge me.  Yeah, but how well that works.  It's very expensive.  You can't and people won't pay.  No, they won't pay.  But I think some sites should say this is the condition.  And in fact, Leo, it happens.  For the New York Times users, data, you are required to accept cookies.  It is a requirement to use the site.  Because if not, you can't use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am starting to see that.  You don't use cookies.  You can't use our site.  They don't mention that tracking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's really not because they're trying to track you.  It's because that's the way the web operates.  They need that to operate.  The New York Times needs it to be able to handle the registration structure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  And the other case for this, and this is something that we've been showing off a lot  Dreamforce is helping companies get in touch with their customers.  So one of the things that we do customer relationship management.  So that is companies keeping records of you so that they know what you bought and what  you're trying to buy.  And when you make a complaint, they can talk back to you.  And they're tracking me.  We're tracking you.  Yeah, we've got a giant database full of you.  Oh, it's for other people.  And part of what we're trying to do with this stuff at the moment is actually when you  complain about something on Twitter, help them actually connect that back to a customer  record so that they can say, oh, yeah, you did get the bad one.  Here's a better one or whatever.  So there's a lot of stuff with this.  And like any other tool, it's like, are you using this to do good or to do harm?  And part of the point of the other thing, the big push we've had here has been business  is social.  You need to be out on the social networks, pay attention to your customers, part of this  world where this is going on.  And you need to not behave like a dick there.  You need to actually go out there and be good to your customers and not do bad things.  And when they complain about you, don't bitch at them.  And this seems like obvious stuff, but it's very new to a lot of companies that they can  have that direct relationship and that also in the same thing, remarks in a private room  can go public.  If you misbehave, that can spread around the web too.  So the big punch of this is finding some tools to do this, but at the same time explaining  to people that you should behave in a way that relates well to your customers with this  stuff, not use it as a way to attack them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that is the key point.  And I talked about that yesterday at Dreamforce where our business should be about relationships  and delivering value in return for that.  And the example I've used in the show before is people in Germany, even Germany doesn't  complain about Google priority inbox because they get value back.  And just asking somebody for their name as a condition of coming in or their phone number  or whatever.  Yeah, I wouldn't do it either.  I don't like it either.  But if I get value back, Google knowing where I am so it can give me targeted information  is a perfect structure.  We did screw that up in our industry.  We didn't explain that well enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, and it's done.  And unfortunately, what if now, I know we can try to fight the good fight and convince  people otherwise, but what if people actually finally just say no, and don't track us,  that ad model collapses?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Then I think I really think it's a nuclear winner.  I think you get to the point where, no, there's going to be some solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's going to be some solution.  Well, here's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the thing is that the ad model is also collapsing because of mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  And that's happening faster.  Right.  That was the stuff I was getting from these guys was Matt Hulhey said that Metafilter  had gone, you know, you can see it going up incrementally.  It's over 30% mobile readers now.  It's going to go across 50% this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we've got pressure from two sides now.  Yes, we do.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We need other ways to support these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, what happens is, and the chat room is excoriating me for good reason.  I'll confess.  I went a little strong there.  But what does happen here, unquestionably, is if the ad support for media goes away,  you will have less content or more paywalls.  You'll just have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think paywalls don't work in so many cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They don't because of scarcity and abundance and all that.  Now, what I would argue, the way that I've been arguing media ought to go is to build  relationships with people.  But that relationship requires knowing you and knowing something about you and being  able to act positively on that.  But yeah, I think that the problem I have is not that individuals will turn on, do not  track choices or will use ad blockers.  It's going to be small numbers.  The problem is things like what Microsoft is doing and what the EU is doing and making  it the default.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've been able to safely ignore ad blockers because it's such a tiny percentage.  Now, unfortunately, it hits tech sites where tech literate people are disproportionately.  It's why 4chan doesn't make money, frankly, or Metafilter or any of these.  And it's a problem on Boing Boing because they have a literate audience.  And so now fortunately, the Boing Boing audience you probably can talk to in a way that you  can't probably do a 4chan audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But those people are turning on ad blockers by default to all sites they go to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then that's the problem is that if do not track becomes the default, even if it's a  you know, and this is why I'm sure that the standards body said no, it can't be a default.  It has to be unset is the default.  If it becomes the default, most people not knowing what they're setting will just choose  it.  Well, the other model is you.  The other model is.  And that's what I'm saying is that people are going to have to find other models.  I'm fortunate.  I stumbled into this model.  It wasn't that I thought five, ten, actually seven years ago.  Oh, we're going to have problems with privacy and tracking cookies.  So I better have a model.  I did know the pipe a wall was going to work because we tried it.  Right.  So we figured out a way of doing niche broadcasting.  We know our audience only because we're such a narrow niche.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you can't get over the ad.  You could fast forward.  But but but the truth is, people fast forward the ads all the time.  But they know busy even so.  People know that stamps dot com, for example, and Ford are sponsors of this show.  We do everything we can to make sure they know that.  And so when those companies go out and see the effectiveness of their advertising and  are they getting unedited recall from their consumers, I'm betting everything that they're  they're fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People know this.  But frankly, these are personalized ads.  We just don't have to do tracking cookies.  We just know what the audience we know our audience.  I mean, but that's lucky.  I mean, that's your luck, which is why I'm interested in this, because we serve and we  are doing banner ads now, which I think will be impacted by this.  Right.  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  You may get remnant ads because they don't know who to target.  Right.  Certainly banner ads are strongly targeted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But we sell them direct.  So they're not.  We're not.  Yeah.  Okay.  So that's different.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, that's the third thing.  Remnant ads are a terrible experience.  Right.  Dancing monkey ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't want those.  That's why when I go to Boing Boing and look at Boing Boing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The payment for them is going down as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looks like, frankly, it doesn't look like ads that are targeted to a Boing Boing audience.  It looks like ads that are remnant ads.  Maybe they aren't, but Socks, eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the eBay is probably just to throw in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, don't they use...  They use FM.  FM, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Federated, you see, I was in Federated for a while and they're smart, good people.  I guess these are tailored.  These are tailored.  But what Federated needed was volume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the good watches and home decor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's all appropriate.  Game, Edgeworld, the game.  They're doing ads in the stream as well, as you can see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And chewing tobacco or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chewing tobacco, really?  No, really?  Snuff, snuff.  Snuff?  No.  Well, that's because they have a younger audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You wouldn't run a snuff ad.  No, I would not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe it's a steampunk thing.  I can see snuff and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's because they have a young audience and it's hard if you're a snuff.  Put yourself in the shoes of the snuff manufacturers.  Yeah.  It's not an easy audience to get to.  Because they're not watching TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The other thing Kevin brought up earlier.  They come to us all the time.  Your snuff box is over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, actually we're going to do that because what I'm going to do is you'll never  see an ad for snuff, but you'll notice as people walk around the studio, they all have  little round cans in their pockets.  It's a very subtle form of advertising we're going to deploy.  And they're snort, snorflin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they're going, chh, chh.  The other impact of this, Kevin mentioned, is that in the EU you're starting to see sites  where it's giving you that tick box.  And they haven't even gotten into the full regulations that Vivian Redding is proposing  that will really become irritating where you'll constantly see this need to say, okay, okay,  okay, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the evil of all of this?  Here's a chart.  This must be from you.  You like infographics.  It says on extreme tech, the technological death match.  Amazon, Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It actually was kind of an interesting one, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Google and Microsoft face off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This chart and then the one on the next page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So these are the products.  This is in January 2007.  This is in January 2007.  Of who was in what business.  It was Apple was in phone, Mac, iTunes, movies, music, browser, OS, and iOS.  And Microsoft was in a few of those.  Google was in none of those.  Fascinating how little Google was at that time.  Yeah.  And that's all changed, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go down to the next page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no.  You got to go to the next silly page.  Aw, next page.  We hate that, don't we?  Got to get some more ad loads here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They were calling it good movies, sir.  Were they in movies back then?  Now look, it's all green.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's Ryan with Google video.  They just weren't doing very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good job of it.  Phone, they got the Nexus.  The tablet, they got the Nexus 7.  The computer, they've got Chromebooks.  Books they've got Play.  The movies and Play and music and Play and browser and Chrome and OS.  Yeah, look at that.  Pretty amazing.  Is that is now is that testimony to these to the brilliance of Apple five years ago  and everybody's following along?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The argument in this piece is that it is because of mobile.  Mobile brought all of this on that with mobile you have to have these things.  Right.  Mobile changes a lot, doesn't it?  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're seeing this change in the ad model.  The success of these companies is really hanging by a thread because of mobile.  It changes the business that you're in.  Yep.  Yep.  Who is the winner if you presume that?  Is Google the winner?  Apple's the winner only because they made the early mobile platform that dominated.  But Apple doesn't really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're not going to continue to hold that.  Apple has a structure to sell you stuff.  Google has a structure to give you ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you know what's missing in that thing is maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, which is really important because one of the stories in here is that Amazon is going  back into maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's talk about maps.  We're going to take a break and we're going to talk about maps because the IOS 6 came  out today and already I'm hearing the noise about the maps.  We'll talk about that in just a second.  But first word from Ford.  You see we have ads.  Thank you, Lord.  I got a mortgage on this studio.  I got to pay.  Social.Ford.com.  Ford has a great social website designed for Ford lovers, Ford owners.  There's something about Ford.  I don't know.  I guess maybe it's true for other manufacturers.  I don't know.  But there's something about Ford.  I know this because I'm a Mustang owner.  Where you just you got this.  This becomes kind of part of your life.  And if you're that kind of person, if you're a Ford family, you got to visit social.Ford.com.  It's a site for you.  First of all, a lot of Ford news.  For instance, they just announced today the new Fusions.  The first 47-47-47 car, 47 miles per gallon highway city and combined, the new Fusion,  there'll be a plug-in hybrid, a regular hybrid.  I cannot wait.  I cannot wait.  So that's the kind of information you'll get.  But you also have articles on a lot of other subjects.  You see all the subjects here, including technology.  I have a little article in here, an interview I did with Jim Buczkowski.  He's one of their lead technologists.  But you can read.  I mean, it's really fun to read about the Ford technology story.  This is a company that is one of the original industrial giants in the U.S. that has embraced  consumer electronics and technology and everything they do.  Images and videos from Ford owners.  Great ideas, too.  This is their suggestion box.  Your ideas and you can vote on others' suggestions.  Post your own ideas.  Grab a badge while you're in there.  Social.Ford.com.  It's a new site for Ford owners and wannabe Ford owners.  And do check out that new Fusion.  It'll be at a Ford dealer near you soon.  I just sent a note to Lisa, saying, can I trade in my Mustang?  I really want this new Fusion, this plug-in hybrid that looks really...  I don't know what I really want.  Social.Ford.com.  I have a little bit of a problem.  You want the latest thing.  I just have a car, Jones.  Do you buy this one or lease this one?  The Mustang I bought.  I own it outright.  So I could trade it in.  You could trade it in.  Lisa won't let me.  Oh, well fine.  She says, no, no, no, no, no.  So...  No, no, no, no, no.  Let me down.  It's a company car, so she could drive it.  She could drive it.  Let's talk about...  What was it?  It was something exciting and new and different, and you started this.  And I can't remember now what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maps.  Maps.  Kevin started it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maps.  He starts all these things.  IOS 6 dumps Google Maps.  A few of the tame press, and Apple really has its tame press score, are saying how great  Maps is.  Almost everybody else is saying, oh no.  This is a big loss for Apple.  First of all, why does Apple dump Google Maps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's more complicated than that.  The thing is that the old Maps app was written by Apple using Google's API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  Okay.  So it was not a Google app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To be really clear, it wasn't a Google app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that true of the YouTube app as well?  It was an Apple app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was true of the YouTube app as well.  They were an Apple app, and they were done in the early days of iOS before anybody else  had the SDK.  Remember, they shipped with these.  And when Eric was on the board, there was a partnership going on.  And the thing is, those apps have not been touched much since.  And they didn't pick up all the features that Google Maps has got since.  Like turn by turn.  Like turn by turn, like bicycle turn by turn, which is my new favorite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But why couldn't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why couldn't they?  They could.  They just didn't.  They think they decided not to work with Google in that way anymore.  Now, they had a huge fight previously.  This was 2009, maybe, where they blocked Google from putting apps in the store.  They wouldn't let Google put in Latitude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or Google Voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google Voice and the FCC had a poke at them, and there was a whole bunch of disclosure  about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I forgot about that.  Remember, they asked for a letter from Apple.  What the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you know, Vic Gundotra was a huge fan of iOS and wanted to ship lots of apps on  that.  And after that, Apple refused to put the stores.  They were like, well, OK, we're going to do Android first for everything.  And we'll do iOS as needed, but only if Apple will let us do it.  And so they didn't, because of that spat.  And what has happened is that the iOS Maps app has been not keeping up with the Android  one.  But anyone who's used both, that's obvious.  There are a lot of iOS-only people who...  So now we've got an Apple-created version where they've replaced Google Maps with Maps  they've licensed from, I think it's TomTom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  TomTom only, and that's part of the problem, is TomTom's just getting into this business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And OpenStreetMap as well, I think.  They've got a mixture of stuff in there.  But it is not as mature as the Maps that Google Maps has got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's missing transit, it's missing bikes, it's missing Street View.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's what Kevin's speaking to, is the value of having...  This goes back to tracking, right?  OK, if I can't track you, at least I can know where you're going, where you are, where you  live, where you go every day, what you look for, and that has huge value coming forward.  It's an enormous thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's useful, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's...  So are you saying this is an information grab by Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Amazon.  Amazon, too, is going to start its own maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amazon has licensed Nokia Maps.  By the way, the Nokia Maps are quite good.  They're kind of the underdog.  People don't know about them, but Nokia bought one of the...  There's Navtech and Telnav, and I think they bought Navtech, right?  One of the two big mapping companies, bigger than TomTom.  TomTom's only now getting into that business.  So Nokia has great data.  They've been working on this for some time.  They've got great software.  So Amazon's licensing and has an API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  So you're right, it's an information grab, but it's also a new Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The only reason Amazon would want to do that is so that they can...  We just lost Kevin, we'll get him back.  Is so that they can track you?  Not just track you, but to know...  To know where you are and serve you ads that are...  Right, don't forget what Amazon's going to do.  And this is part of the story, too.  This is what everybody's trying to do with local.  Yes.  Yes, mobile.  They're saying, well, okay.  It tells you something about you.  If you're going to be mobile, we're going to lose all this revenue because you're going  mobile.  What can we do to monetize?  Ah, we know where you are.  Here's the other thing with Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Amazon is going to...  Right now in California, it's going to start charging sales tax.  In New Jersey, it's going to do the same.  And so what they're saying is it's going to differentiate itself by same day delivery,  by fast delivery.  Right.  Well, knowing where you are when you order something, being able to enable that to get  you something to you wherever you are is going to be a differentiator.  And maps are going to tell you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it is a grab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  A data grab.  Yeah.  But it's...  See, this is the...  I don't want to get back in this tracking cookies thing.  But that's the point, isn't it?  Is that ultimately, unless people could find another way to make money...  Right.  Right.  I don't know, making shoes...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, one of the odd things going on in media is events, right?  And the economist and the FT and local blogs like Brooklyn Brownstoner make their living  out of having events.  And that's another way to do this now.  And it's not a very good way.  Amazon events or Google events is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know, not going to work.  Right?  I mean, I'm not saying like 4chan or for Twitter.  Well, Twitter.  Yeah.  I mean, TechCrunch does very well on events.  Everybody says, why don't you do events?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could go to New York and hold an event.  You probably wouldn't do this knowing you because you're just too...  I'm lazy.  ... too pushy.  Well, that.  But you probably wouldn't charge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you could charge the door.  You could pay for the trip.  Everybody...  Everybody's told me we should do this.  But I just...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Someday, maybe.  In the summer, you can come and you can use my campus.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  I'll come over to New York.  So, TechCrunch, speaking of TechCrunch, says, if I were Google...  This is Drew Olanoff.  I love Drew.  I wouldn't release a map app for six months.  Google has already released a YouTube app.  They've already responded.  They said, okay, fine.  You're going to take out YouTube.  That was a crappy app.  Anyway, the new YouTube app is much, much better.  It's modern, uses the API.  Very Google-pussy.  I have to think that somebody at the Googleplex is currently, right now, writing a better  maps app for iOS that would probably be better.  But what Drew is saying is, let Google be a little bit petulant.  Say, all right, you don't want to work with us.  This is a quote.  He says, let consumers experience what a really bad map experience is like.  Let them get angry at their beloved Apple.  Let Apple explain why their map app isn't up to snuff yet, and that it takes time and  talent to make something absolutely wonderful.  Let the consumers ask Apple why they kicked the experience.  I think this is missing the boat because I don't think that's really what happened.  It was just time.  Google wasn't cooperating after the snafu.  Apple said, look, we've got to do this.  Maybe it's going to be suboptimal.  I don't think it's bad, but I think it's going to be suboptimal for, say, a few months, a  year.  I don't know how long it will take.  But at some point, won't they be as good as Google Maps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  Look at what Google is investing in Maps.  It's a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, in fact, it was really interesting because the New York Times had an article about Google's  back end the week before this happened.  It was clearly placed by Google saying, hey, you really should do an article on how hard  we work on Maps because they're really good and there's a reason why an Apple can't do  this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the other thing, Data Grab, as you said, is one thing Marissa Meyer always bragged  about was how many data points had been added to their maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not just that Google's been collecting this data and using this data for years.  There's a lot of massaging going on behind the scenes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And even Street View, which we should mention did a wonderful thing right here in this very  place.  I'll show you that.  That's my tool of the week.  So Street View collects data in other ways.  I don't actually use Street View that much.  I don't use the pictures, but it's there as another source of data that Google has invested  in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, DeForek always says he loves it because when he arrives using Google Maps,  he has a picture of the building and says, this is where you're going.  He's an old guy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  He needs that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I don't use that feature, but I trust a dress.  We're still getting Kevin back on here.  I haven't used iOS 6 yet.  I haven't used the maps yet.  I'll try it when I get home tonight.  And so I think the jury's still out.  People got to drive around a lot and try it.  But there's definitely things missing.  It is going to hurt, I think, a little bit.  Unless you're...  The problem is most people who use iOS use it exclusively.  So they don't have...  I mean, we're unusual.  They don't have an experience of what they might be missing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what's happening to me, Leo?  The Nexus 7 is what drives me to go ahead and switch my phone to Android.  Interesting.  Because I'm getting experience here that the iPhone to me is clumsy now.  And it doesn't have the integrated experience with the Google apps that I use regularly.  I use Docs, or pardon me, Drive.  I use Gmail.  I use all this stuff and Maps.  So, being stuck by Amazon or Apple, either one, to have to use their stuff and not be  able to use the things I actually use, this is spoiling me.  This is a kind of lost leader for me to drive me into Android more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's interesting.  But I'm weird.  I don't know.  I think a lot of people bought that 7 because it was so cheap.  That's another reason why Google should just give it away because it is a Trojan horse.  Yeah, it really is.  Google Plus.  Okay, I'm just going to get in trouble.  I'm going to say it, but go ahead.  Google Plus has 400 million registered users, 100 million monthly active users.  Hi there.  Hey, Kevin Marks.  Welcome back.  We just changed the subject.  We were talking about Maps.  Sorry we missed your input there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now he's on to Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Time waits for no man.  So now he's going to get in trouble.  Or Marks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, one more thing that ties back to the other fuss about alternative Android versions.  So part of the reason...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah, we can talk about the Alibaba story.  Oh yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Or Ioun or whatever it was.  Okay.  So, just to give you an update, I think most people know the story, but Google said to  a... it was Acer, right?  Who was it?  Oh no, I've got to find it.  The AliYoun OS, which was a highly hacked Android.  Google said that is not going to be Android.  It's not Android enough.  It's incompatible.  So we're not going to countenance it.  Well, you can do it if you want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can do it if you want to, but then you're not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You ain't getting Google Apps and you're not in the Android Open Handset Alliance.  You're not an official...  You're not certified.  ...certified Android.  And they canceled the phone.  But the company itself, Alibaba, said, we respect and understand our partner's decision  to postpone the introduction of the phone.  We're dismayed by the impact this dispute has had on our partner.  They're talking about Acer.  Alibaba is a Chinese company.  Acer officials said that Acer will continue to communicate with Google.  It still wants to launch the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does this have anything to do too that it's in China and there are things that the Chinese  government, for example, wants to put on phones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot of people say Google's evil in not allowing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, Google's still allowing it.  You can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're just saying that.  We won't put it Android on.  You can't put Android on it.  Yeah.  So, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So there's the setup, Kevin.  Go ahead.  So part of the point of this is Google uses Android to refer to two things at once, which  is really confusing.  It's the open source project that is the core thing that you can build the phones on, run  all that.  And there's a bunch of apps which you only get if you pay up for the rights put with  Google on your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So as an example, I have here the Kindle Fire HD.  That's running on an Android base, but it doesn't say Android.  It doesn't have any Google apps.  It's not approved official Android.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you can't use the Android logo unless you do that with Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Google didn't say to Amazon, oh, you can't do that.  No, it's part of Open Hand Set Alliance.  It's allowed to do that.  It's open source software.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  So I read about this way back in July, January 2011, explaining that there are these two  parts and expecting people to start building a replacement with Google parts.  And Amazon was the first one to do it, the second one after Barnes and Noble.  But they were actually, they built a sort of a suite of apps that runs on top of Android  that replaces those Google apps.  And they haven't replaced all of them yet.  There are some missing.  They don't have a great email client.  And they didn't have maps.  So Amazon this week announced that they're starting to make maps for their devices too.  So that's interesting.  What I expected was to see more of these.  And I think some of these Chinese ones are like that.  They take the Android operating system, but they put their own apps on top of it that  are part of the experience.  Now, Jeff, you said before that you think that the Google ecosystem is a big part of  the Android experience and part of the reason you want it.  Yes.  And that's been broadly true.  So when you get a phone that's missing those, you feel like you've got bits missing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Amazon's not a member of the Open Handset Alliance.  So there's no stick with which to punish them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wonder whether Google regrets making it open source.  But I think that there's other advantages to them.  Correct me if I'm wrong here, Kevin.  At some point they do want more people developing on the platform.  If there are apps that run on Android, even on rogue Android installations, it helps the  Android ecosystem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's what Andy Rubin, who's in charge of Android at Google, said on Google+.  We agree that the Alian OS is not part of the Android ecosystem and you are under no  requirement to be compatible.  However, the fact is Alian uses the Android runtime framework and tools and your app store  contains Android apps, including pirated Google apps.  So there's really no disputing that Alian is based on the Android platform and takes  advantage of all the hard work that's gone into the platform by the Open Handset Alliance.  If you want to benefit from the Android ecosystem, then make the choice to be compatible.  It's easy, free, we'll even help you out.  But if you don't want to be compatible, then don't expect help from the OHA members that  are working to support and build a unified Android ecosystem.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That seems fair.  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this is it.  But the confusion about those two different levels of Android is partly of Google's own  making.  Yeah.  Last year at Dreamforce, Mark Benioff interviewed Eric Schmidt about this and Schmidt was very  explicit that this apps bundle and the store and all those things was the carrot they used  to keep these people in line.  He was basically saying that.  He said this is our way to keep this system converged.  And there are ones that are built on Android that aren't doing that.  As Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amazon is a member of OHA and Google has never said word one about that.  That's fine.  But if you're going to be a member of OHA as Acer is, then you have to abide by those  rules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That seems sensible.  Not to go back too far, but is that a model for Twitter in a way?  Could Twitter have been built in a similar way to say, all right, there's part of this  stuff here.  Wouldn't that have been great?  Wouldn't it have been great?  They said, okay, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hmm.  Interesting idea.  Is there precedent in the open source world for anything like this before?  Is that how Java is managed?  Is anything managed like this?  Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Somewhat.  Yeah, Java is a bit like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  MySQL.  MySQL is like this, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What they have there is they tend to have one license.  They do a dual license.  And they have extra rights over it.  Everyone else gets GPL.  They get to do other things too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's how you prevent incompatible forks from kind of polluting the stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  But they're still available.  When Oracle took over MySQL, it's now been forked two or three times.  Significantly, there are significant working forks of MySQL that behave differently and  have different maintainers.  That was because they weren't happy with Oracle's stewardship of it.  That ability was still there.  We haven't seen as much of that with Android.  Partly because it's modular.  But it's not clear how different Amazon's version is.  It certainly runs apps that are built for that version of Android.  I haven't had the new ones to test stuff on yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can tell it's Android if you look at the settings and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you can install Android APKs on it.  You can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, there's even the checkbox that says you're going to allow installing of third-party apps.  So it's very compatible, right?  More so probably than this Allian was.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yeah, that was it.  Part of the rules for getting with Google is there's a list of compliance stuff you have to do  that defines a release of Android.  So there's a compatibility definition document.  Right?  And they have different, they define a different one for each one.  And so that says that the device has to have certain characteristics for it to be classified  as an Android of that iteration.  So the Android 1.6 definition required it to be a phone.  It had to have telephone APIs.  Android 2.1 didn't say that.  But it did say you have to have a camera.  So there was a set of rules like that.  Interesting.  They said you can't be conformant unless you have these things.  So they're trying to converge the platform so that you can write an app and you know  that the phone stuff will be there or you know that the camera will be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's so much to talk about today.  I got so many more things.  We started talking about Google+, 400 million signups.  Yeah, you were going to be a smartass, weren't you?  Yeah, but I won't now.  I'll be nice.  Go ahead.  There's no time to be snarky.  And 100 million active users.  It seems to me there's four people on there, but I could be wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they're all mad at you right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They all hate me.  But I said the same thing about Buzz and everybody on Buzz said, no, Buzz is live and vital.  And then that was it.  So Google+, Google+, will never go away because Google is basically saying, no, no, there's  no such thing as Google+.  It's Google, period.  And when you sign up for Google, that's part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Drew wrote a good piece that it's the socialization of Google as a whole.  And I think that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's not a place people, it's not a destination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it doesn't really want to be.  But it is.  I'm telling you, it's the best conversations I have.  It beats them on my blog.  I'm not denying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think Google's missing the, Google's misinforming when they're talking about all  these numbers, because it's not like there's 400 million people, you know, or even 100.  They say 100 million visit every month.  I don't know where they're visiting.  But it just, it doesn't, it's not.  Yeah, it's.  I'm sorry.  It's like.  That's not what's going on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not a destination.  It's not a destination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As long as we're talking about misrepresenting, there were all the articles that Google threatening,  you know, the verge said, Acer cancels phone launch in response to threats from Google.  It's really easy to write a headline that really misrepresents the thrust of what's going on.  There schmucks my colleagues.  And so, you know, it's just, it's just not, it's misrepresenting it to say that the Google  Plus is a social network.  It's Google.  It's Google.  Exactly.  Wilson.  Not a destination.  It's just Google.  Samsung responding to the iPhone 5 with a new ad.  Inflammatory is the word.  Inflammatory is a little strong.  It's not inflammatory.  It's just an ad saying this is what they do.  This is what we do.  The irony, actually, if you look at the Samsung Galaxy 3 ad, because it's basically spec sheet  head to head.  And I use a Galaxy 3 and I have no idea what three quarters of these terms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like a shampoo.  The only shampoo with smart stay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It could be that could be in a shampoo.  It could be right.  Right.  The Galaxy S3 now with smart stay, S beam, share shot, group cast, direct call, smart

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  alert, tilt to zoom, palm swipe capture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That sounds dirty.  I know what half of these are, but come on.  It doesn't really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, as an ad, it's ridiculous because you don't use them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't know what they are.  Right.  The next big things already here.  It's a bad ad.  Yeah.  Although it's OK.  This is inflammatory.  It doesn't take a genius.  That's a little inflammatory.  Fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's trolling that bad genius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  It doesn't take a genius to use our phone.  Hey, if you see Will Ferrell, Owen Wilson or Vince Vaughn wandering around the Google plex, that's because they're wandering around the Googleplex.  They're they're filming a new movie there.  It should be funny.  Internship.  You know, I give up on should be funny after seeing the campaign, which should have been  funny.  Yeah, there's a lot of those.  In every respect, it should have been funny.  I don't know what's wrong with the movie industry.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Will Ferrell movies, especially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they should be funny.  But they're not.  Often they're not.  Not always.  No.  Anchorman 2, I'm sure, will be a laugh riot.  Back to the mines we go.  They should just call it back to the mine.  And apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the plot is that they're that they're middle aged or nearly and they've lost their job.  So they become interns at Google, like there's any chance that would happen.  But what the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  BJ Novak's in it.  Also from the office.  John Goodman.  I bet you John Goodman will play the role of Larry Page.  Who would play Larry Page?  I think I think here's we haven't seen Larry in a while.  He lost his voice.  I think here's the plot point.  He's actually been in hiding eating ho ho's and he's gained 400 pounds and he looks like  John Goodman.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like that.  See, I should be writing this movie.  Vince Vaughn is writing it.  Vince is very funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's amazing that we actually wanted to do a sitcom.  Unfortunately, I don't have the talent to do it around kind of startup world.  Maybe we haven't seen it.  We haven't seen it.  You know, the closest we have, of course, is Big Bang Theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then there's the reality show that Mark Zuckerberg's sister Randy is doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, right, right.  And and there is Shark Tank, which I think is really amazing.  It's actually great.  But but it's a it's a funny world.  Right. Google is filled with funny people.  No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I saw I saw an absolutely brilliant movie at the weekend.  What did you see?  Indie Game the movie.  Have you seen that?  No.  What's it about?  It's a documentary about independent game developers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now that I'd like to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Get it.  It's up.  It's up on their site.  Indie Game the movie dot com that you can buy it directly from them.  You can also buy it from iTunes and stuff.  And it was completely beautifully done.  It gets the experience of programming and building things and the pressures of releasing  what that feels like.  And then it's a beautiful piece of weather.  This is a trailer up on YouTube.  Pretty $10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, see, this is a good model.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they also they kick started funded the production of it.  They will say that a separate Kickstarter to put it into theatrical distribution,  which they did themselves.  But they went to Sundance and won and they turned down the distribution deals they were  getting because they were going to take too long.  And they did its tour of a tour is in the US themselves by calling up them and booking  them and then telling people to go and see it.  And they're selling it online through this.  This is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the same thing happened, by the way, with this American life has a movie  out right now and they got their audience, they mobilize their audience to demand that  go to theaters.  You know, we want our MTV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Forget the theater charge $10.  Exactly.  Watch it on the Web.  You own it forever.  Stream it anytime.  Download any format.  Ten bucks.  It's cheaper than going to a movie and you own it.  I think this is great.  Every movie should do this.  Forget it.  You know, just forget it.  Just do this from now on.  Everybody's got a home theater.  They can watch it on a nice screen.  Not everybody, but many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you get the 1080p.  It looks fine.  It's awesome.  Great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's a future.  Now, it's good they didn't distribute the Muhammad movie that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's a brilliant film as well.  You know, it was really moving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not a brilliant film.  This Muhammad film clip was Google right.  The White House.  By the way, this is where the Muslim rage is coming from.  Right.  Is this really bizarre, poorly dubbed.  Cheesy as cheesy can be.  Cheesy movie, which everybody agrees is stupid.  However, highly offensive to some Muslims.  The White House requested Google pull it down.  YouTube said no.  Were they right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think so.  They did pull it down in Libya and Egypt and I think one or two other countries after that.  India.  Indonesia.  And I don't like that precedent at all.  I think it puts Google in a very bad position.  I'm sure they don't like it either because the next time they don't take something down, they're going to say, well, you took that down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they were saying, okay, we took it down responding to local law as opposed to political pressure.  No, that's not really the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think they were demanding.  I think they took it down because of the pressure of what was happening.  And they kind of said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they said we restricted access to it where it's illegal.  India, Indonesia, Libya and Egypt.  Oh, wait a minute.  No, I'm sorry.  I parsed that wrong.  We restricted access to it in countries where it is illegal, such as India and Indonesia, comma, as well as in Libya and Egypt, given the very sensitive situations.  So they did it there for understandable reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it does set a precedent and it puts them in a difficult position.  I'm glad to see how many people have stood up for Google here and said that we don't want them to be the censor and the nanny.  If you know, I've had a lot of discussions about this online where people say, well, but you shouldn't take it down, isn't irresponsible?  Well, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy that if I don't like speech and I riot over that speech, I then censor that speech in the future because then things like this will happen.  You can't get into that trap.  Very difficult, isn't it?  We just saw that in France, something just happened.  A Charlie Hebdo magazine is called a satire magazine.  Put up some cartoons of Mohammed.  So there we go again.  So the French government is asking them to take them down.  And the problem here is not the speech.  The problem here is people trying to stop speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  So the other thing, Salman Rushdie's biography came out this week.  And there was a very good start the week on Radio 4 interview with him and talking about it and what happened and what it meant and the things that he tried to do.  And that was, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And not only is the flat loss still out on him, but they've increased the reward now or somebody offered a greater amount of money for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The thing that he said now is that publishers wouldn't touch the book, a book that did that because the censorship is now happening.  And that's the thing that's most worrying.  It's not that he's obviously worried about people trying to kill him, but he's very worried about the fact that that freedom to publish is not there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sometimes that is spare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But we do have YouTube and Kickstarter and so things that we can publish things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why I was so happy, honestly, with hashtag Muslim rage and hashtag Jesus wife, because it shows there's a lot of reasonable people in the world.  And we can talk about our Muslims and Christians.  Amen, brother.  Exactly.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just hope that we don't blow the place up before we figure this all out.  Yeah.  I think that's anything else we want to hit.  Boy, there's so many stories.  I don't want to miss any biggies, but I think we've got we got the Vince Vaughn Owen Wilson Will Ferrell story.  And that was the only one I really cared about Google fiber adding Turner channels.  So it's expanding, expanding, expanding.  What was it?  It was 90 percent of all the city, all the areas in Kansas City that could get Google fiber did in fact raise it up.  Yep.  Wow.  Which is great.  That's so great.  It really is.  And I only wish we had it here.  Yeah.  All right.  You know, I think I don't know if we're going to get Kevin Marks back, but if we don't, he just gave us a pretty good pick.  Indie.  Game.  What was it?  Indie.  Game.  Indie.  Indie.  Not like the race.  Indie game.  The movie dot com.  That's a good pick.  Nine ninety nine.  I'm going to buy it right after the show.  So, Leo, are you going to start producing movies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe it could be kind of cool.  Right.  Should we do start up dot com with the movie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Right.  Which was I still have the T-shirt from the failed startup from a Gov works.  And I remember that they used to come into our offices and try to pitch us and they were all full of hubris.  And I told them to go low.  And thank goodness.  And it's a hilarious.  It was going to be a movie about a startup being wonderful.  It was going to be a movie about a startup being a failure.  Right.  Well, you never know, do you?  You don't know.  But you have, I think the Twitter brand.  You know what's interesting about this indie game?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They also have it on Steam and iTunes.  So they're very smart.  Whoever's doing this, they've got it.  Steam, I didn't know Steam delivered content as well as games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, the other thing you get to too is there's a lot more moves towards serial content.  Right.  So there's a startup.  No, that's what I've wanted to do.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think you could add up to a movie.  I want to get somebody, a great scream writer, somebody like the guy who wrote The Wire or something like that, to write a serial where there's at the end of every show, it's like, no.  Oh, and that's how you can get people back every week.  Right.  We could do that here.  Tweet the movie.  As long as George Clooney plays me, I'm happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And not John Goodman.  Not John Goodman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We know you wouldn't like that.  Not John Goodman.  Leo Leporte has been in his office for 48 days eating ho-hos.  I need carbs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So would you like to give us a number?  I think you have like 30 numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  None of them are great, by the way.  They're all great.  It's hard to imagine.  I like the first one.  Shouldn't.  So Marissa Meyer reportedly gave 30 minutes notice.  To Google.  To Google.  I am out of here.  And Yahoo insisted upon it because they didn't want Google to come back and offer her the  island of Rhodesia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it was Yahoo who said, OK, we will hire you, but you can only tell Google 30 minutes  before you walk out the door.  Yeah.  So I kind of like that.  12.30 PM, July 16th.  That's when she dropped the Q bomb.  I quit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What do you think the reaction was?  When I quit Entertainment Weekly, I know full well that the executives at Time Inc. were  very happy about it.  I think I said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that what do you think?  I think that everybody was very sad.  Oh, Marissa, we wish you the best.  You've been great.  We've loved working with you.  We had nothing.  We had nothing for you.  Yeah.  I mean, it's obvious.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So the other number you have to mention this week is 47 percent.  But that speaks for itself.  And if I may give a tip, I'm not going to say anything.  Are you in trouble for that, too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  We try to stay apolitical here.  Oh, OK.  All right.  You know, the reason is I am just a horrible liberal.  Yeah, you're a gushy heart.  I am a bleeding heart liberal atheist.  And much of our audience is exactly polar opposites.  So we have agreed, I and they, not to talk about it.  And that way we get along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I could start in here, but I won't.  I won't.  I also have a tip is that the twenty five dollar credit for buying a Nexus seven ends  the end of the month.  So if you're going to buy one, folks, now's the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a movie credit and Google Play.  Google Play.  So get one now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't spent that yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I haven't either, actually.  Isn't that funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I actually watched five episodes of Downton Abbey and the Flight on the Way Out.  Such a good show.  It actually is.  It actually is.  Oh, it's the first episode.  I was going to kill you.  See, I forget you're a TV critic.  First episode of the first episode, I was getting mad at the British class system.  I was getting really Kevin defend your country.  Defend your landsman here.  I was getting so angry at the structure.  I know it is.  I know.  That's the dramatic tension downstairs.  I know.  I know.  But there's a there's a there's a there's just a tolerance of this inanity.  Makes me feel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's the thing.  Even though the thing would have been to make the upper class people evil, but they're not.  They just like oblivious.  Oblivious.  Yes, yes, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you know what?  That's the point of the show, because there's a progress through the show towards.  And I'm really glad I read a book.  It's how World War One changes that class system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I read a great book called The Institutional Revolution a few months ago and explained  the economic basis of the aristocracy of not working.  It was hostage capital that if the monarch needed to trust someone, that someone had  to invest everything in that lifestyle.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because if they you know, they didn't they didn't know how to make or do anything.  Precisely.  And they were hostage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And if you sent your daughter to court to marry or work as a lady in waiting, if you  messed up, you ain't going to see her again.  And so you had this notion of hostage capital, which is really very interesting.  So, you know, this this illogic of the aristocracy, it's incredibly, incredibly illogical.  And that book explained it well.  So that helped actually with watching Downton Abbey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I let you get over the anger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But as an American, of course, because people now yell at me, you're always yelling like an American, because I am one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're 99 percenter anger.  Or 53 percenter or 47 percenter.  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The greatest thing that came out today is John Stewart.  Just on that, I've had an old video of Romney's mother talking about how they survived on the Dole for a year.  Right.  It was a great moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kevin, we we said your pick could be indie game, the movie.  All right.  So you agree with me.  I didn't want to take the pick out of your hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Yeah.  I think having seen that, that was a wonderful film and anyone who cares about geekery should watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did that once to Eric Clapton.  He beat the crap out of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know.  Apparently, also people have said they use it to explain what they do to their parents.  It's like show this and you'll understand why program do this thing.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was a good movie about cosplay I used to show my mother what I do.  That's another story entirely.  My tool is very simple.  If you go to maps.google.com, we had a great guy named Tertius Carstens out of Houston come here.  Now, Google internal Street View, they don't do it.  They have trusted photographers who do it.  We paid Tertius.  He contacted us and he said, I will do it.  I think it was 800 bucks.  He paid by the number of pictures he takes.  Carstens 360.  Oh, but it was worth it, Jeff.  Oh, it's beautiful.  The hilarious thing is that they pixelated the faces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know, but it looks like you're in the porn business here.  I know.  It's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We got a discount.  I think that the price ranges in that range.  It's by the number of pictures.  Go to maps.google.com.  He uses a normal camera with a very wide angle 8mm lens.  In fact, you can see in some of the images.  So show my screen if you will, whatever your name is.  Chad.  He's in the pictures, actually.  And so if you search for Twit, you'll see our listing in Google Places.  And the key is that there's a look inside.  On the picture there, there's a little Street View guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I used it before coming here so I could know where the men's room was.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We didn't do the basement yet.  So I might get Tertius to come back.  There's a basement?  There's a basement.  And there's a lot of Easter eggs in this.  Cool.  And you've been here, Kevin.  So you know that this is...  And by the way, one of the side benefits we didn't realize is you can read every brick.  So if you bought a brick, you can zoom in on the bricks.  And you can literally...  That's how the high quality...  You can get so much out of this.  So if you will wander into the studio.  I guess I've zoomed out so much now.  Let me zoom in so much.  No.  Click in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you can see the levels with the UI of Street View.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a little disconcerting.  You can read what's on people's desks.  Ooh.  I mean, there's little things going on.  And some of the people appear twice.  Andy Inocco from MacBreak Weekly in Chicago Sun Times is sitting there.  He's actually doing a show with the chat room.  You can see our CEO, Lisa.  Her face is blurred in one picture, but there's one picture where she's not blurred.  Were they messed up?  Well, I don't know if messed up is the right word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They must have some standard about how big the face is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe that's it.  And it turns out, apparently, if the face is on TV, they don't have to blur it.  Because it's already public.  Because it's already public.  So the faces here aren't blurred.  But anyway, if you...  It's really great.  Oh, it's just a really fun thing.  And this is not something Google does for free.  But any business with a Google listing can do this if you contract with an existing...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How large is the pool of authorized botans?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it doesn't look huge.  It's maybe 25 photographers.  I'll put a link, because I don't know the exact link.  But you can see there's his tripod, right?  So he shoots in four directions.  And then there's special stitching software.  Google will stitch it for you, but a good provider does the work ahead of time and then uploads it to Google.  Plus, if you're getting a Google approved provider, it's much faster to get this on.  He got this on the same day that he shot it.  So there I am sitting at my desk.  And you can zoom in on stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They didn't blur your dog's face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, dogs are not private individuals.  They are public.  So there's Ozzy.  You can see how much you can zoom in on it.  So all you have to do is search for Twit on Google Maps and then click the thing.  And you can see everything.  Everything's here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you hide anything beforehand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't think to, because I didn't realize how high resolution it is.  So there is some private stuff in there, which I'll leave for you as an exercise to the reader.  You can read all the titles on the bookshelf.  I mean, this is how good it is.  It's really amazing.  What kind of camera is he using?  I don't even think he was using a high-end Canon.  It was a SLR, but probably a D60 or something like that.  You can read the credit card numbers on my desk and everything.  Yeah, that's good.  I've canceled all those credit cards, so don't worry.  You can see what model TV we're using.  So this is a fun thing to do.  But yeah, a little bit of advice to business owners who do this.  You might want to clear out the personal.  It's really high resolution.  It was a 60D with an 8mm fisheye lens, according to Gene Miola in the chat room.  Yeah, you can go in the kitchen and see Andy stealing snacks and all sorts of things.  Jeff, it's so great to have you here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's wonderful to be here.  I'm thrilled.  And great to meet other staff members here at TWIT HQ.  Yeah, your first time.  And, very importantly, Ozzy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ozzy, the wonder dog.  What are you waving at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have another tip to add.  Just released today, you can actually grab the little Street View guy.  And there are now orange dots around businesses who have also participated in...  Oh, so there's quite a few.  Yeah, yeah.  So now you can see that in the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Going to our local hardware store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, so that's the...  Wow.  And it looks like there's a New Yorker pizza thing right here.  Sal did that, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's my favorite pizza in town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, so there you go.  We can go straight in.  Sal's New Yorker pizza.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at...  Oh, this is actually the jewelry store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so the jeweler did it, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So did he make more business while he was in town?  I hope so.  I don't know if Tershees did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually believe that he's based in Houston, but because he was a fan, he flew up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow, I had no idea that many businesses were doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, and it's actually kind of...  There's a few in Petaluma.  There's a whole bunch if you just...  Is it Bovine Bakery?  Because that's my favorite bakery.  There's one, there's one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So his website is Karsten's, C-A-R-S-T-E-N-S.  That's my apartment.  Wait a minute.  No, no, no.  Go back a little bit.  Oh, sorry.  That's actually my...  Oh, that's the graffiti restaurant.  I live above that bar.  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did they send up?  Right, so graffiti right there.  They do send up, as a matter of fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's cool.  Yeah.  I should do a tour of my apartment.  Right?  Why not?  No, show...  This is his website.  Karsten's, there it is.  Go ahead, show the apartment.  I'll show you.  I can show you.  See that red thing?  Go up.  No, that's not it.  Oh, that's across the street.  Anyway, never mind.  You could probably find my Mustang if you look...  This is his site, karsten's360.com, but there are others that do this as well.  You could search for it.  Wow.  Google Street View Photographers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a type of discussion from earlier, which is that Google is really in the effort  in doing very, very high quality measurement of the world, precisely because this is their  way of making it more useful and making, being able to sell advertising and routing  and business and stuff there.  They're playing a very long game here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, very long game because it doesn't...  I guess what happens is people start to think, hmm, what are they up to?  Right?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the thing is, it's the same thing.  They're providing utility.  So because they're providing utility to you with the mapping, you don't mind the street  view cards that much.  Precisely.  It's a huge utility.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this is...  Well, you just reminded me of something else.  This would be a tour of the week if he actually ships it.  A friend of mine at the XOXO conference made a little iOS app because if you ask for transit  directions, it outsources that to third-party apps.  So he made a little third-party app that opens Google Maps and shows you the transit on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow, that's cool.  But it's not released yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Probably won't get approved by the store because of what it's doing.  But basically, he hooks that.  If you click the directions thing, it says, try and get a local directions app with the  idea that people can build them.  And there are transit apps for a lot of reasons.  And he just said, oh, just pass it over to the web and let Google try.  Wow.  That's quite cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kevin, Marks, thank you so much for joining us.  I hope you're having a great Dreamforce there in San Francisco.  I appreciate you taking time out.  I guess Jeff already did his.  What was your talk on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Media, the changes in media to the guy who handles the media clients there.  And it's really amazing because as I'm arguing not to sell Salesforce, but as I'm arguing,  and they did bring me out, that media companies have to be in the relationship business.  They need a platform to figure that out.  So that's why it made sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think this was a lot of fun.  And thank you both for being here.  I really appreciate it.  We do twig on Wednesday afternoons right after security.  Now that's about one PM Pacific, four PM Eastern time.  Eighteen hundred UTC on twit dot TV.  Do watch live.  It's really nice to see everybody yelling at us in the chat room.  We like that.  Every time.  All I have to say is tracking cookie and Google Plus Google plus Romney.  I don't mean to be controversial.  I'm just a puffy little fuzz ball.  We do.  We do love having you here live.  We actually do read the chat room.  I may flip you off from time to time off camera, but I read it.  And if you can't watch live, we do love it if you download.  In fact, best to subscribe.  If you want to support the show, that helps us out a lot on iTunes or wherever you get your podcasts  or just download on demand versions from twit dot TV slash twig.  Thanks for joining us.  We'll see you next Wednesday.  This weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We'll see you next time.  Bye.
