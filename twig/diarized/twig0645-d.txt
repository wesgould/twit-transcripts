The show we cover the Google verse, the Facebook  verse, the Twitter verse, the media verse. Aunt Pruitt is here from Hands On Photography. Hello,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Aunt. Good to have you back. Hello, Mr. Laporte. Happy New Year to you and this Twig squad.  Did you go anywhere for the holidays? No, sir. I told you I was going to strategically  find myself on the butt groove of my couch and I did it successfully. You did everything you hoped,  lived up to your greatest dreams. It was awesome. I even caught up on that succession show.  I didn't binge it like you all claimed I was doing. I'm here to hear your reviews, sir.  It is such a good show. Oh, good. Oh, it's so good. And I love Roman and his smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm glad we didn't lead you astray, Mr. Pruitt. Oh, it's so good. That, by the way, that baritone is  the Leonard Tao Professor for Journalistic Innovation at the Graduate School of Journalism  at the City University of New York. Buzz Machine.com is his blog at Jeff Jarvis on the Twitter. Hello,  Jeff. Happy New Year to you too. Hello, boss. Happy New Year. Good to see you. Did you do anything or  did you just hunker down? No, I just hunkered down and worked. Happy Omicron. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I tried not to work. Yeah. Tried really hard. You know, I realized if I don't work,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  if I don't do anything, I just sit on the couch, I get really lazy and then I'm too tired to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So I sat on the couch thinking about stuff that I could be doing. Yeah. It was a battle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's counterintuitive. You actually get more tired if you don't do anything than if you do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I struggled with it. I had, I can say that there was one day, maybe two tops that I felt like I was  on vacation. The rest of the time, my mind was just all over the place. Like,  oh, I could be working on this or I could be reading this. And that's a hazard. Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that's not vacation. A hazard of the productive people. Hey, we want to welcome somebody brand  new to our microphones. Stacey Higginbotham is taking the week off. She'll be back next week.  Joining us now, a US lawyer, specialist in international law, civil liberties and the  convergence thereof and tech. She's a contributor at Tech Dirt. Kathy Gallas, welcome to this.  Thank you for having me. So good to have you. Cgcouncil.com. C-O-U-N-S-E-A. I am known to applaud

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kathy's tweets and pieces defending the first amendment and defending good sense. And so I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  delighted you're here, Kathy. Oh, thank you. Would you call yourself- I already get you everywhere  with me. A Section 230 expert. I would indeed call myself a Section 230 expert. Yes, she is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, well, we'll try that. I was doing it before it was cool.  Okay. Yes. Okay. Well, it's great. There's her Twitter feed. Great to have you. I will now follow  you religiously, which means I'll be on my knees as I follow you. She should have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sitting is fine. You can read the tweets while sitting. Okay, good. Thank you. Thank you for

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that dispensation. CES is going on. It's so weird right now to be sitting here with CES going on in  Vegas. It officially began today, although, you know, as always, the weekend brings those special  mini conferences and stuff. There's a lot of stuff. I don't know if there's a whole lot  to say about CES. Aunt, you really wanted to go. We said you may not. You must stay home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you watching? And that was a smart decision. Turns out I've been trying to watch from afar,  but it's been really, really hard between wading through emails from being off, being on vacation  and trying to just sort of pick through what is actually some good meat and good stories.  And virtually no one be in there from the big tech companies. No one be in there. So it's been a  little rough. I've only seen one thing that had me curious and it came just before we came on air.  What was that? Well, Canon, they're still working on stuff in the VR world. So they have their  R5 mirrorless camera. That's not their pro-grade one, but it's one of their more expensive ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the one I got, Henry. I got him the R5, not the R6. No, no, I got the R6. Which one's the  less expensive? The R6 is less than the R5. The R6 is the less expensive. That's the one I got him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the R6 is still nice. Yeah, he just needed a video for TikTok. So I think it's good enough.  Yeah, it'll be perfect for that. But they're doing this whole dual fisheye lens thing. Yes,  we saw that. To the world of VR. And if you have all of that horsepower behind it and they shoot  8K on that camera, it could create some pretty interesting images and maybe something fairly  immersive. But I'm just curious about the implementation. Where is this going to be used

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  beyond the world of real estate sales? Yeah. Alex Lindsay mentioned it when they first announced it  on MacBreak Weekly because he's all into this VR 3D stuff. $2,000 lens that gives you  a 180, I guess 180 degree field of view for your VR productions. I am not a fan. I'm sorry. I'm  trying so hard. It's cool. I keep everybody's talking about augmented reality is the next big

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  thing. I'm just trying so hard. I just. I think AR is the next thing over VR. I'm still battling  with VR. I believe I mentioned on our end of the year show that I think AR is going to be pretty  awesome if someone can just really set it up to where it's not a bunch of security problems and  things like that. Because if you want to walk down the street and say hello to the person coming,  you know who they are because it has a nice little identifier, but we don't want to know their credit  score and things like that showing up above their heads. But I think there's a cool spot for AR if  we can just get it implemented with the right security stuff. This was announced at CES TCL with

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a Chinese television maker announced their second version of their wearable display glasses,  which look kind of like Ray-Bans, but you wouldn't want to walk around because you're not seeing the  world around you. You're seeing two 1080p micro OLED screens. So it's not AR then?  It's more like VR.  No, it's VR. Yeah. The lenses are opaque.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That might make some sense. But then again, if you're just watching screens here,  why not watch screens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's like a 140 inch screen from 13 feet away. Yeah, I'm with you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why?  Why? That's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why? Because these companies are trying to make money on whatever the next thing is and nobody  knows. So they're all just guessing. They're throwing spaghetti.  Speculative, right?  Yeah. I am going to stand by my contention that we already have the most amazing virtual experiences  ever. And it's motion pictures. When you're in a movie theater.  Oh, I thought you were going to say Zoom.  Grandpa?  Grandpa? No, think about this. It's a hundred year old industry, I understand. And they've  perfected it so that when you're in a theater-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They added color. What else did they need?  No, listen to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's true because you used to-  Go ahead, Kathy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. No, let me tell you why you're right.  Thank you. Please go ahead.  It's true because the distance between where we were before and then all of a sudden, voila,  you've got movies. And the distance between where we were when you've got movies to now,  now is negligible. But the real revolution was going from nothing to movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I would submit it's still effective when you're sitting in a theater,  it's darkened, the screens in front of you, the sounds around you.  Movie makers have gotten very, very good at, you feel like you're there. Am I not right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. Sound design is so much bigger now in cinema. And it's part of the reason why I enjoy more  movies now is just because of sound design. Dialogue is another problem, but sound design  just really locks me in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the choice of music to get your- I mean, what is VR about? It's about  tricking your mind into thinking you're having a real experience. And honestly, a good movie,  you don't think I'm sitting with a sticky floor on old beat up cushions-  What kind of theaters do you go to?  With weirdos around me.  Oh man, he sounds like the one that I've been in.  How sticky is that floor?  No, you think you're in Chinatown, Jake, and it's so vivid that you feel like you had an experience.  I think we should not diminish that. That is a very refined technology.  And the problem is you can't sell $1,300 glasses. I mean, you can't make money on the content  except for selling a movie ticket. I mean, you can, obviously. There's an industry all built  around it. But I think the tech- this is a really good example of Silicon Valley  doesn't want to stand still.  Trying too hard, yeah.  Yeah, we can't stand still. We have to do the next thing, whatever it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cathy's point too, is really important too, is if you look at that kind of leaps in creativity,  pardon me, Gutenberg moment coming.  Oh God.  Oh, there it is.  You call me an old camera man. Take your drinks, people. Take your drinks.  From 1450 until 1800, there was basically no advance in the technology. Because what  were you going to do? People did things with it. They invented the novel, the modern novel,  and the essay, and then market for printer plays, and the newspaper.  So there's more to be done visually with what we have. I agree. So yeah, I think VR is  about as meaningless, watch out, and here as NFTs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not the first time they've been talking about- and now we've got VR.  They've been talking about VR before.  Oh yeah.  Like in the 90s.  Every time it's like, it's going to be the thing. It wasn't the thing. I mean, it was interesting,  had some interesting applications, whatever, but it mostly, it never answered the why.  And I think the technology is better, but I think we still haven't answered the why.  And I think if you don't answer the why, nothing's going to happen with this trajectory either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember going to SIGGRAPH in Los Angeles in 1992, wearing a big VR helmet attached to a big  cable attached to a multi-million dollar computer and flying on a pterodactyl.  And it was substantially the same, except for the heavy headset. But it was substantially the same.  And it was a gimmick. It was cool, but I feel like it's still a gimmick. By the way,  Meta thinks maybe it's a gimmick. They have fired 300 developers that were working on a custom  VR-AR operating system, which is ironic. They just renamed themselves Meta.  Just renamed it, yeah.  According to the information, Meta instructed employees to stop working  on an operating system built from scratch for virtual reality headsets.  The XROS project had been in development since 2017. 300 employees working on it.  Now, I don't know if that's what Mark was demonstrating when he did that  famous, now infamous Meta video, which is ironic because the virtual character  looked more like a human being than Mark Zuckerberg did.  But maybe there was something wrong with the OS or it wasn't doing it. But  the company told some staff, according to the information, they'll continue to modify an open  source version of Android to do this. Google's Android, Meta's modified version of Android,  internally known as VROS, not XROS, powers the current Oculus VR headsets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did they also realize that people weren't going to trust them with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No. Are you kidding me?  Mark Zuckerberg has no introspective, no awareness, no insight into how people view  Facebook, do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He gets memos periodically, but I don't think that instinct is necessarily there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's classically tone deaf. Have you seen, Kathy, have you seen the new Netflix movie Don't Look Up?  I have not.  Oh boy.  There is a character in it that's a tech, Mark Zuckerberg, he's the third richest man in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's a cross of various ones, I think. I think there's a little Steve Jobs in him,  Mark Zuckerberg is there, I think Elon Musk.  He's a mix of all of them.  All of the spectrumed folks in the field.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wish I could play a clip from this.  Mark Rylance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You've got a lawyer right here who can defend you, Leo.  I am not your lawyer.  I am a lawyer. I am not your lawyer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's be clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That gum is, she's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's going to say fair use is a defense.  She's going to hire a lawyer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm here more to mock stupid things about the law as opposed to counsel anybody on how to actually  navigate it. I'd rather complain about this is a very dysfunctional conversation because we should  be able to enjoy the culture around us and it's not clear that we actually can and that's a bad  thing that comes at a cost. So the law I do is to inventory that, complain about that and to see if  maybe we can make things better, but that's not a one-on-one represent people. That's a try to fix  it for everybody type. Discussing it and that there's any question about whether we could actually  share an example of what it is we're talking about. Maybe it would be fair use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's a bigger problem because maybe that would be fine. Yeah, you could sort of make a  fair use analysis, but the expression is fair use is the right to hire a lawyer.  You just don't want to have the problem to deal with, but the fact that we're chilled,  we have now abruptly veered off our conversation because of the legal.  It chills to the bone.  If this is the law, it has a cost and the irony is this law is supposed to stimulate creativity  and expression and here it is suppressing it. So I think we've got problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the, I could show a picture I think of Mark Rylance as Peter Isherwell, the tech guru  who says, wait a minute, don't save the earth. Don't destroy that comet. There's materials we  could use. If you haven't seen it, it really is great. And when you see it,  just note that character because he is exactly how I think he's how the world's starting to  think of Silicon Valley. And I think that's actually a bit of a problem for Silicon Valley,  frankly, the out of touch billionaire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did not want to watch it because I saw that it was number one on Netflix and I have a history  of catching things that are number one on Netflix and just, I hated them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, didn't you like the tiger show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, that would be no sir.  It's horrible. But I went ahead and gave it a shot because we made you, I think we made you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  do that, didn't we? We like had a group viewing on a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't seen this movie, but the idea that like, I think the point is trying to make that  humanity can be kind of clueless about reacting to its actual problems. Avenue Q did, I think it's  no, not Avenue Q, Avenue 5. This namespace collision is not good, but Avenue 5 was a  production which they made one season. I don't know if they're making another one.  It starred Hugh Laurie and it was excellent. And it basically predicted the pandemic behavior  before the pandemic behavior was actually getting exhibited with sort of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know that. That's the one where they're in the spaceship. Oh, that's hysterical.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. It was very, very funny and also horrible and awful and just an amazing encapsulation of,  boy, are we dumb as a species.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is now, I think this is a genre, starting with idiocracy.  Wall E to a certain extent was that also with the people in the floating chairs and their big gulps.  Avenue 5, which I liked Avenue 5. There's something about it missed. I don't know exactly  what it was, but it, and obviously HBO did not renew it. And I think don't look up isn't  perfect either, but it is a commentary and it follows in that exact vein of, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Without spoilers, the scene in the airlock, which is kind of like two thirds through the series or  whatever, just the scene in the airlock. It isn't even funny because it's actually so real. Like,  you can turn that off and turn on the news and you've seen the exact same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I stand corrected. Avenue 5 was renewed. So good. I look forward to season two. That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. So the credit of don't look up. They made me quite angry within the first 30 minutes  to an hour of that movie. And I guess they deserve some credit for that. It made me emote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Angry because of the president and her lack of interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. You're just watching that and you're thinking, oh man, this is a total reflection  of the crap that I see. It was a little too close to home. Yeah. And it just, oh, it fired me up  and I almost turned it off. But I said, just, just continue to watch. I just read that that script was

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  written before COVID, which is another thing that's kind of interesting. Crazy, right? It was really,  yeah. Anyway, we don't have to go on and on. I think Avenue 5 was as well, which was the other

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  thing that was a little bit creepy. My favorite part of Avenue 5 is when they lose, they're in a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  giant spaceship. They're out in space. It's a cruise though. And they're all doing yoga and  the ship tilts suddenly and everybody goes, why? To me, I just, I don't know. I enjoyed that.  Let's talk again about- We warned you, Kathy, that we sometimes get off topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A little bit. I was talking about Metta abandoning- I'm just happy that I had culturally relevant

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  knowledge. You were so odd. Yeah. Yes. You fit right in. Metta could revive,  according to the information, XROS or some pieces of it at a later date.  No word why they discontinued it. And it could just be a technical issue. But it seems to me,  a capitulation to say, well, we'll just use Google's Android. That's exactly what they didn't  want to do. That's why they were building this. Right? I mean, at some point you need hardware to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  put it on and maybe they couldn't quite solve that problem. If not technically, maybe just in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  terms of supply. Maybe. I think this is a blue sky thing. I mean, I don't think they expected  to have something next year. This is from the information again. As recently as June, Zuckerberg  touted the importance of the new AR-VR operating system. This is in June and said,  the team is pretty far along at this point. And then six months later, that's it. Never mind.  So I don't know what to read in the tea leaves. In the Apple world, there's a lot of talk about  Apple launching its VR headset at the end of this year for $3,000. A three screen device.  For Cyclops? Even in the rumor, they said, we don't know what the third screen would be.  Oh, God. So they've got two Sony screens, very high resolution, 4K or maybe even 8K screens  where your eyes are. But then they're buying this other OLED screen from Samsung and no one  understands. With the eye on the back of your head? Rear view? I don't know. I don't know.  This is, to me again, this is an example of Silicon Valley saying, we just got to find the  next new thing. And we don't really know what it is. We're going to do this. And I'm less than

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  saying what I'm about. I'm not sure it's actually they're coming up with the next new thing. They're  following each other. I mean, Facebook might even get credit for sort of rebooting the VR stuff,  but then everybody else has to kind of do it. And the buzzwords, everybody's got to do the buzzword,  whatever is the hot buzzword of the time, the cool tech. This isn't actually demonstrating a  whole lot of innovation. It's demonstrating a whole lot of, oh, we must do the cool thing that  everybody thinks is the cool thing. And that's not necessarily a valuable contribution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is ironic that in Silicon Valley, where in theory you honor the mavericks, here's to the  crazy ones. And it's just everybody, what is he doing? What's he doing? Let's do that.  And there's a lot of group thinking that Silicon Valley, speaking of which Samsung has promised  a groundbreaking new TV feature, NFT support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me repeat my previous comment about everybody following the buzzwords.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is like last year when everything was better with a slight coating of blockchain.  Blockchain. Blockchain. Blockchain was the Vegemite of Silicon Valley for a long time.  Yeah, NFT. And then of course, in a related story, Norton, the antivirus company announced  that Norton 360 will now come with a Bitcoin miner.  Shout out to the core doctor of opportunity.  Oh, did we say antivirus?  Yeah, basically, we're going to put our own virus in there. We'll take 15%. But you could make some  money. You could. Already, they're notorious for completely bogging your computer. Now you  can eat your home with it as well. So yeah, it's just one of those jump on the bandwagon things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a question about Norton. Do any of you know their market share? Are people still

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's Norton and McAfee, both of whom are.  Such paragons of virtue.  Paragons of virtue. That's the words I was looking for.  Norton has a 10% market share according to Semanotech. Semanotech. Anyway.  I remember Semantic.  Semanotech. Norton has 10%. Kaspersky has 8%, something like that in the market. So.  But yeah, Norton merged with LifeLock. They were spun off by, you know, Intel owned.  Was it Intel? No, they own McAfee. It's so confusing.  Oh, gosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. They're really.  I'm weird how the tech companies have, the security companies have funny origins, shall we say,  between Mr. McAfee and Kaspersky and Russia and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But, you know, and in fact, I was reading this article that Harry McCracken did some years ago  about Peter Norton. And Norton was in his day. He was no McAfee. He was a legend in his day with  his arm folded in his big fat tie on the box of every. But he sold it a long time ago. He became  an art collector and a philanthropist. Semantek, 13% of the market, Avast 12%, ESET,  one of our sponsors, 11%, WebRoot 8%. Actually, McAfee is down there at 8%.  Silance, Bitdefender, Malwarebytes, Trend Micro. So this is according to Statista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why I was asking because there are so many other options out there that are not going  to beat the crap out of your computer. I just.  While it's doing your job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. There was, you know, I think you have to constantly reassess. I've been saying for some  time you probably don't need an antivirus. Windows comes with one. I've said that too.  Modern operating systems are well locked down. New York Times had an article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just get a Chromebook, people. Get a Chromebook. And these worries are.  You don't need any of it. True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then New York Times had an article this week saying you probably really don't need a VPN either.  Which I thought is time to stop paying for a VPN. We also have VPN sponsors. So  I should be shooting myself in the foot here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not going to go that far, sir. I'm not going to go that far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Depends on what you're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It depends. You know, all of this depends on your threat model. There are definitely  people who should run antiviruses too. If you've got teenage kids using your computer,  you might want to put an antivirus on it. Oh yeah, there's that.  Yeah. Times change. Things move along. I don't know. You know, I don't know what to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I think. Did we just leave entirely CES? Did we do CES?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, this is still CES. That was the Samsung TV. They announced that.  I'm actually waiting. I'm trying to figure out because I mentioned this last week. Scott  Wilkinson, our home theater guy, said there is going to be a big announcement at CES.  Yeah, that's right here. A new TV technology.  And I've been waiting to find out what it is. And the best I can figure is  uh, Sony has announced a new kind of OLED TV with quantum dots, which.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It can only be run by quantum computer on the blockchain to show your NFTs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if it doesn't have Scott Bakula and Dean Stockwell.  I just don't think it's going to be called quantum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a reference. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. You win today. You win today's old TV show reference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am amazed at how hip I appear to be right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am so impressed.  Sony announced the world's first quantum dot OLED TV.  The Bravia XR series. So OLED, we, I think we all agree OLED right now is the best technology out  there. I've been watching down the road for micro LED, which Samsung's been showing.  Um, Sony will also do a micro LED technology, but the QD OLED supposedly is brighter than the  old OLEDs dazzling brightness, deeper blacks, more impressive mid tones.  And if you're impressed by that, you'll love this, the list price.  I don't actually know, but I'm sure it's very expensive.  I guess that's what he's talking about. And I don't, I don't see any other big announcements

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  in TVs, but you know, projector, which is kind of cute. Yeah. They've been projected.  Oh yeah. The short thorough. Yeah, but this is, this is more of a consumer product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Eight 99. Uh, it's kind of cute. It looks like a little can, uh, you know, light, you might shine  on your, the painting of your ancestors on the wall, but in fact, it's a hair light for hair light,  for those of you in the television business. Um, it's the freestyle alter portable small  smart TV projector weighs less than two pounds. Typically these don't have great pictures.  Eight 99, $899, uh, 10 80 P it can play music and includes 360 sound.  And it has a Samsung smart TV platform on it, which means they can spy on you as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yay. Well, anchors anchors version, odd to come from the anchor brand is bigger, but it's 4k.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anchor actually has had a projectors for some, for several years now. So this is these little  portable projectors. I guess this is a category. I guess if you didn't want anybody to know you had  a TV, this would be, you can see there's a market. Oh, don't laugh, Jeff. There are a lot of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know. I've known those people. Having been a former TV critic, people used to all the time  going to be insane. I don't watch TV or I only want to be an idiot box. Yeah. I only watch PBS  unless I'm watching the bachelor. Uh, I always said that. How do you know who Vanna white is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. You don't have any cultural, you know, understanding. How are you going to mention,  you know, uh, Scott Baccala in a conversation. You gotta, you gotta, so I need to send a thank

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you to my parents. Thank you for having a TV in the house and letting me watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Remember the LG rollup TV. This is also a TV designed for people who didn't want anybody to  know they have a TV. It just looks like a credenza, but the TV rolls out of it. Notice the price,  by the way, says inquire to buy. If you have to ask, yeah, it's, I think I asked and it was a  hundred thousand dollars. So it costs a lot to not have a TV. Keep it to appear. You were talking

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  about the Q Q O LED. Yeah. What, what, what gets me is I'm like, how much better can the televisions

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  get now? Cause now who sounds like an old man? Now who sounds like an old man? Yeah. But I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  don't get me wrong. 8k video is beautiful. It, but there's no content, but the delivery  getting that to the masses is not going to happen anytime soon. Um, the TV that you have  in your lovely home is absolutely beautiful. And why, why is there something else out there  even better than that? And can you imagine something being better than what you have in your home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and I used to think that who needs HD. And I was a TV critic for God's sakes. You know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love, I, you know, I sit down in front of the 4k OLED and I just, I love it. It's maybe it's a  little too real, but you really, yours is like ridiculous. Yeah. Like you're watching really  nice. Well, then we have a big projector in the living room. That one's huge. It's a hundred  inches. That's not going to get replaced until I think micro led is the future of that, because  those are little, they're squares. You can make it as big as you want. You just keep attaching them,  but there's some technical issues that they haven't solved yet on the edges and so forth. So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you know, the refresh rates, I see screwed rats is mentioning in the IRC brighter colors, brighter,  richer colors, better processing, better refresh rates. Yeah. Yeah. All of that makes sense. HDR

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is a big jump. I, but yeah, we already have HDR. Yeah. And it looks great. Well, how about H, HDR

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I still have to go back to the question though of why, because it also like whether this is better  also depends on what you're watching. So until quite recently, I was watching TV on like a 20  inch CRT monitor and I was perfectly happy because it could deliver what I wanted in a way that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  whatever I was watching, I could be quantum leap looks great on it, but if you want to watch anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  from the 21st century, I have other tastes and preferences. You know, I'm sure they'll come up later in the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am teasing you. I mean, I'm more likely, yes, to watch sort of a public television type thing and  show me my actors and show me my drama. And like, I don't need to see every pore on their face and I  don't need the special effects because that's not going to wow me. That's going to distract me. That's  not the thing that goes into what I consider an enjoyable content experience. But you're an outlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some exceptions may be. You're an outlier. You just said I was hip. I had all the knowledge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're not the mass market. I take it back. I mean, people are watching sports and action movies.  That's what they want. And what they really, I think what really has driven this is the last two years  where you couldn't go to a movie theater and people want a much more immersive and movie theater style

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sir, the experience at home. Netflix is having people shooting 12k and raw and so forth and it's just  absolutely beautiful, but it's only going to be so much that they can deliver to us over the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you okay. You're a photography guy. I mean, people have said, well,  you know, why do you need more resolution in a camera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The only time I need more resolution is for cropping because there are going to be instances. I want to  take a portrait of someone or some so you wouldn't have you wouldn't say, oh, I need a 41 megapixel

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  image so that I can blow it. I don't know what you blow it up the side of a house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't need to make it bigger. You need it to find the bit that you want to zoom in on. It's more  like a, I don't know what to choose from it. So I'll take the big port, big platter of images and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  then pick what I want to focus on later. I guess that's, this is the theme then of this show is  Silicon Valley has to, it's like a shark. It can't sit still, has to move forward, whether we need

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to or not. And I returned Gutenberg. Watch out. What's interesting is going to happen this episode.  We're all going to leave drunk. What's going to be interesting is not what happens in Silicon Valley.  It's moving past the technology is what people do with it. It becomes interesting. Technology  becomes boring. That's when life becomes interesting. Well, I mean, I keep saying why

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and not just to be like have a catchphrase, but to basically point out that if you're not answering  that question, I think the innovation is just going to slide off. It's not going to be meaningful.  It's not going to find a market. But if you actually try to think about the why and think  about the use case and think about how people interact with their technology, you know, it's  probably better business because you're more likely to be able to mesh with your market because you're  meeting what the market can need or might imagine that it needs. If you can't answer the why, even  as your company in a way that people think is plausible, I don't think your business is going  to be successful no matter how cool it might actually be. Do you think tech companies are doing  a good job of that? I mean, I think there's been moments when they have. I don't think  Silicon Valley on the whole has probably done that very well. I think a lot of times you get people  who are like, I built something that's cool and that the coolness should be able to speak for  itself. I think the companies that are more successful are the ones that engage with their  users, do better design, do better research to basically try to meet who the audience was,  understand the problem they're trying to solve, and have a dynamic kind of discussion with the  with their market to figure out, did it work? Sometimes what happens is the market will take  something and actually invent a new use. And then the company's got to be able to pivot to back that  up. But if you're listening to your customers and you care and you're actually designing for them  and you care about the function and you care about the use and you care about the usability,  those are, you know, it's not a guarantee, but you're much more likely to be successful than a  company that doesn't bother and just focuses on the coolness and the, you know, 4K, 8K, 12K,  whatever stuff all your numbers in. You know, success in technology is more about just making  it flashier. It's got to be more useful. I know this is a really niche population,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but the photography side of things, Canon and Sony, that's exactly what they did. They took a  lot of feedback from the community and slowly started to implement it into the different  products out there, whether it's the less expensive beginner camera all the way up to the pro grade  stuff. They took a lot of heat over the years because they would do some things that were  quite asinine, but it took note of it and put it in place and they have some really,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  really great products now. I do have to point out that I agree with you 100%, Cathy. I think  that that's exactly what tech companies should be focused on. However, they've managed to make a  pretty good success for themselves without necessarily doing that. I don't know. So Apple,  this week Apple hit $3 trillion in market capitalization. No, they went back down a  little bit. But if you look at, there's Microsoft right behind them. This is from the New York Times,  $2.5 trillion. Alphabet at $1.9 trillion. Amazon at $1.7 trillion. Meta, almost a trillion. It's  only when you get down below half a trillion that you get to traditional big money companies like  Disney and JP Morgan. Actually, this was the most amazing stat of all. Apple's $3 trillion market  cap makes it worth more than, oh shoot, I can't. But it was like all the top 10 companies combined.  Here it is. Apple's $3 trillion market cap makes them worth more than Walmart, Disney, Netflix,  Nike, Exxon, Coca-Cola, Comcast, Morgan Stanley, McDonald's, AT&T, Goldman Sachs, Boeing, IBM,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and Ford combined. That's amazing. Add it up. Apple is not the exception to what I said. They're more  proving the rule because one of the things that Apple did and did well and it fueled its success  was to actually care about design. I don't happen to like their design choices, but a lot of people  fell in love with it and they were obviously engaged with UI experience, design, touch, feel,  and things like that. I think the bigger exception is Facebook, which seems incredibly out of touch  with how people actually might be inclined to use their product. They keep making it substantively  and materially worse because they don't seem to really understand why people were drawn to it in  the first place. I think they're the exception, but Apple is not. Although once Apple gets big  and they've got enough capital to do whatever they want, then they can make plenty of mistakes  and it's not really going to matter, but they're also able to become bigger in other spaces because  they've got the capital and they can invest. They can do hardware, they can do software, they can  operate on an IP level, they can operate on a thing level. That just gives them an advantage  in every sector, which can snowball into something as big as you describe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like Apple though has the same quandary that all these other companies do and that's why  they're doing AR as one of their next big pushes. Cars and something because the phone is where

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  movies were when they got Cinescope, Uncle Leo. What more are you going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree. Maybe we're at the end of our peak phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So again, where is the modern novel, the essay, where is Montaigne, where is Cervantes,  where are those creators who use these tools to do things we couldn't have imagined of?  That's what excites me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I agree with you. What happens when technology is new is you focus on the technology, not  on what the technology enables. Then after a while you absorb it, you get used to it.  We're at that stage now with the internet where it's just ubiquitous and everybody accepts it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  there. I think we've got time to go still where we still see the future and the analog of the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody under 25 grew up with the internet every moment of their life. So I think it's now time for  the internet auteurs, the people who are really going to create on top of that. Nevertheless,  Silicon Valley is still looking for the next big thing. Apple can't keep this revenue machine  going. I'm sure they won't be it because that's not historically where these innovations come from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is why they're all going to Mars. But seriously, they ran out of things to do on  earth. So they're looking for what's the thing we can go innovate for and maybe more power to it.  There's some issues with the fortunes and the private funding of whatever. But I'm not going  to look askance at innovation that makes the heavens reachable. I think that's a good thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for humanity to start innovating towards. There's something that makes me really queasy  about Apple being worth $3 trillion. Is that a flaw in me? Certainly there seems to be that  kind of reaction from Congress and the EU. Is it possible for a company to become too  rich, too successful, too wealthy, too powerful? Is that time to start worrying?  According to succession, yes.  They're the Royce star Waco of the real world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But Waco is fading into nothingness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's actually one of the interesting subtexts of succession, isn't it? It's an old media company  to figure out what to do. The old guy that runs the company wants to buy TV stations full speed  ahead. The subtext is his kids who are complete screw ups. All are all saying,  no, we've got to go digital. We've got to get the next big thing. What are you doing, dad?  It's an interesting subtext because they are screw ups.  And he continues to be the top dog in all of this.  So is this a flaw? Let me ask Cathy, because you don't know me. Is this a flaw in my personality  that it bothers me that Apple is this powerful and this rich? That bothers me. I don't think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  any company should get this rich. The framing of this question is interesting.  I have trepidation answering this because I'm afraid of the regulatory response if it turns  out that this is actually icky. But I don't think you're weird to feel icky about it.  I can't say that we shouldn't maybe ask some questions about how did this happen and is this  a good thing and how do we make sure that it's not a bad thing. That's reasonable. But it's hard for  me to be very enthusiastic of like down with this sort of thing because I keep seeing what comes out  of Congress where they want to be down with this sort of thing. And it's some really bad ideas that  don't necessarily fix any of the ickiness and basically make it that like goodbye innovation,  goodbye future capitalism, goodbye future success of any sort of companies. Like they end up  salting the earth for all sorts of other things that we might actually want to have. Like smaller  companies rising up to be successful and be competitors and things like that. So there be  dragons. But the overall instinct that you're articulating of this kind of feels icky, I think  that's a perfectly reasonable thing to feel. Some would say it's kind of anti-American.  We celebrate success. I think our story is competition. Like you want to have the best  win. And the thing that we sort of feel is if they're too big, then you start to worry  that the best isn't winning. But like the lucky is the most privileged or something like that  where it doesn't really feel like we're rewarding the best. We're just rewarding the biggest. And  that doesn't feel good with the American mythology, I don't think. Yeah. Jeff Bezos is a flywheel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that success breeds success and you got this flywheel and pretty soon it doesn't matter if you  innovate or you do good for people or if it's a valuable company, it just doesn't succeed because

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's that big. I mean we don't remember Carnegie because of the railroads. We remember him because  he funded other stuff with his riches. So maybe that was a dysfunctional way to get this other  stuff funded. But it's the thing that we seem to value more than we actually cared about his

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  capitalist or oligopolist practices. I think that's another American mythology because Carnegie  wanted to revitalize his reputation. So he started building a lot of libraries. I don't necessarily

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  redeem the whole how did he go from a robber baron to somebody that we like in history. But I'm noting  that the pivot point of what we remember and appreciate was not him being the capitalist

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but him being the... And that's what Bill Gates is opening as well. Yeah. I think it worked by the  way. I think it's working for Bill because people see him now as he's the guy who got the world

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  vaccinated. It did but I don't think it's working quite as well. I think he's made a couple of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  recent decisions that have undone his PR campaign. Yeah. I don't have a problem with Apple making all  of this money considering that they go about it pretty smart with efficiency and controlling  the whole stack and so forth and just really making their profit margins just so much bigger.  That's business. My problem is the fact that they pay a lot less taxes than regular joes like us.  That's the problem I've always had with these big tech companies. They're able to swindle around

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the system. Yeah. That's a flow with the tax code. That's one thing you can go to Congress  and say, hey, fix that. There should not be... Yeah. But then they lobby against us with their

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  deep pockets and keep things the way that they are. Well, that's one thing you get with $3 trillion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can really use it to improve your fortunes. I mean, I don't mind regulatory responses,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but I don't like reactive ones and I don't like ones that don't understand the problems they're  trying to solve. There's complexity and things are interdependent and nuanced and you really  need to understand what's wrong, why it's wrong, what the interplay is with things that might even  be right before you start trying to fix things. The problem is the icky or something seems,  the more problematic it seems, the more it... It's a visceral response. ...tempts a regulatory  response that is overreactive, not appropriately tailored for the solution and either won't fix it  and or will create a whole bunch of new problems that you didn't bother to anticipate because this  seemed like a really good thing that you could score political points on. I don't mind conversations  about what is wrong. Let's dig into that. It's not like, oh, capitalism, but let's think,  are there things in the tax code? Are there things in the way we do corporate structures?  Are there IP laws? There's a lot of things going on and they're worth a look to figure out are they  accidentally... Even if we thought they were good, are they having some byproducts that aren't good?  Those are fair questions to ask, but then I pull the reins when people are like, well, it's simple.  Let's just do this instead and it's never that simple and you have to be much more careful.  Or else you ruin things that you actually did value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bingo. Bingo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But this is how it works. The conversation starts, people propose things and other people say,  well, that's not good. And we go back and forth. Isn't that part of the process? Is the brainstorming

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in effect? I wouldn't mind the brainstorming, but we tend to have actual and potentially terrible  bills that end up proposed and sometimes get escape velocity where all of a sudden they end  up on the books before you could really think twice about them. So in terms of the process,  I'm all for the brainstorming. I'm all for good hearings. I'm good. Let's make a record where we  really understand what's going on and then figure out what the appropriate regulatory solution would  be. That's fine. The problem is that's not necessarily what we're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe the gridlock in Washington is saving us from that because we haven't accomplished a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  bloody thing in the last couple of years. Well, things do escape. I mean, part of the problem with  the gridlock is then things kind of get through. And sometimes, I mean, yeah, sometimes there's  cynical reasons why a big company is going to push against some of these ideas. And maybe they're  doing it for cynical reasons, but sometimes they're also kind of saving the entire ecosystem. And  they may be doing it for their own selfish purposes, but they may actually be having  selfless purposes, but it doesn't really matter. Sometimes the thing that they want, even if they  want it for themselves, turns out to actually be the right thing. And if we tend to be like,  well, down with big companies, down with big tech, things like that, then we may rob ourselves and  blind ourselves to the fact that doing the opposite of what they're asking for might actually,  it might hurt us if we just reject it out of hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To some degree, probably because of Adam Smith, I feel like our system is, and because of our court  system, our system is based around advocacy and everybody arguing their own best interests.  And then we somehow, if it works, come to some solution that is a good compromise.  I don't know if that's worked in the last few years, but it's worked in the past.  Let me ask you about this, Kathy, because you're probably right on the cusp of this one.  You know, Facebook's been running these ads lately, essentially saying, yeah, you got to fix 230.  They're not acting- I have nothing nice to say about their ad campaign.  I'm trying to figure out who the message is for. Is it for politically active people who watch  football games, who might write to their member of Congress? Is it for Congress? I don't think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's probably very well targeted. It's so dumb. It's dumb for them and it's dumb for  the ecosystem. It makes them a terrible neighbor. But I think the reason that they thought it might  be a good idea, and I don't want to- it isn't a good idea, but the reason they might have thought  so, is there's a certain bit where tech in general, because it's such a regulatory target  at the moment, has sort of a political problem, which is, you know, all these ideas are coming  at them and they're all kind of terrible. But if you just say no, no, no, no, then everyone thinks  you don't look like you care. You don't like your playing. So I think they tried to say,  here's a bone that we're throwing. Look, we're trying to play, blah, blah, blah. So I think  they were trying to look- it's a campaign to make them look like they're not recalcitrant. They  actually care about their impact and stuff like that. And I think it's trying to rehabilitate the  perception that not necessarily the public has, although maybe that a little bit, but that  Congress has about it. They're not popular there. But it's a terrible idea. I don't think they really  understand just how flammable the fire is that they're playing with doing this. What they're  calling for won't help them, will hurt them in ways that I don't think they're quite calculating,  but they're best positioned to weather those regulatory winds and it will devastate the rest  of the ecosystem. So a lot of people look at it very cynically. I don't know if I share it, but  I think it's credible to look at it this way, which is, you know, we think that Facebook might  be too big and has some anti-competitive tendencies. This kind of looks like another  one of those anti-competitive tendencies because it looks like, let's call for regulation that will  obliterate and will be fine. I don't think they will be as fine as they think, but you know,  that might be motivating them and that isn't good either because it will be so devastating to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  ecosystem whether they realize it or not. Right, Kathy? I mean, it's a case of regulatory capture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll be fine and the others won't be. Yeah, I mean, I think it's poor regulatory capture  because I don't think it's effective for them either, but that is a read of it and that is a  plausible read even if it's not actually what's motivating them. I mean, I do think a bit about  the PR and the rehabilitate and trying to look like they're a team player with regulators is  probably the big thing, but the effect of it will be so devastating and oh, what a shame if we happen  to lose our competition. So yeah, maybe the cynicism isn't misplaced. How sick do you get,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  you and Mike Basnik and Jeff Kossoff plus Daphne Keller and Kate Klonek are all my heroes.  The tech crew, okay. Well, and more. Those are the defenders of internet freedoms versus the idiots  about 230. How sick do you get of going over the same territory with people? You know, I have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  be more patient than my personality necessarily accounts for because I think that part of the  problem is there's a lot of political pressure on Congress and I've talked to some people on  the Hill and they're kind of like, look, we get it. We understand that changing section 230 is bad,  but we have all these people who are looking at like, you know, bad stuff that seems to be happening  because the internet enables bad stuff to happen and people are saying do something about it and  they're like, how can we go back to our constituency and not do something? You know,  we need to be able to do something or else we won't get reelected because we look like  we're unresponsive. So I think the key is my goal and I'm happy to be here on this program  because it's kind of is a step towards meeting that end, which is I think we have to talk to  people who are not the experts. I mean, I think people who are in the space, yeah, how sick do  I get the people who should know better and not knowing better? That's really annoying. But regular  people who don't spend their days thinking about law, thinking about tech, you know, they have  political will. This is a democracy. They can choose the laws that regulate them. So how do  you educate them so they can ask for good things? And I think that's the key to talk to lay audiences  for whom there's trusted people that they can believe to say, let me understand this a little  bit better because then when they call their members of Congress, they will ask for things  that are actually more useful than just do something, burn it all down. What do I care?  I hear Section 230 is bad, you might as well get rid of it and how dare you not?  That's not a good position. And so we can back up Congress if ultimately we can change the political  conversation so that we're asking them to give us better laws instead of ruining the good ones

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that we already have. Amen. If I were in government relations at Facebook, I might do exactly what  they're doing, which is to say, pretend you care, show that you care and kind of not worry because  government has a lot of other things to worry about much more important and it doesn't seem  to be very effective at getting anything done anyway. So what's the chance that you get into

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  trouble? You know? I mean, I also, it's a huge company with a ton of people. And one of the things  that I think is not part of our policy discussions enough is how do you steer a big company like that?  You've got a lot of people, you've got a lot of smart people, you've probably got a couple  idiots as well. And how do you steer that where I know there's good people, I know there's  principled people, I know there's people who would really like to direct the company to  be a good corporate citizen. I know there's people who would like them to push for good policy.  There's probably also some cynical people and then there's some people who are well-meaning  and also wrong and they're all there and they're all trying to, you know, they've all got an oar.  But the boat can go in circles. Like how do you actually make that company steer as a coherent ship?  You know, great. You know, you could write PhDs about organizational theory about how do these  companies manage themselves when you've got all this talent and that it's so unwieldy. And so,  you know, Facebook is unique because so much goes to that C-suite where just a couple of people  have a lot of control. And this is not great when they are missing the point. We talked earlier that  we think Mark Zuckerberg really doesn't intuit enough what the effect is of his product in the  space that he's in. But on the other hand, like, you know, maybe that's good when the corporate  structure does know because you've got a single point of contact that can create a coherent voice.  Right now, you've got a really weird hierarchy where you've got a couple people who can actually  make the decisions, but an awful lot of other talent who might want to direct things, but they  may not all agree on which direction they should be directing things either. So I don't entirely  know how we fix it, but we should understand that that's a dynamic. And when we deal with Facebook  to understand what it is that we're dealing with, because it's not necessarily like  the cult of a personality. It's something more complex than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me take a little break. We'll come back. It's so great to have you. Kathy Gellis is with us.  She's an intellectual property. No, you're not really IP law so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do internet law. I think of myself as a free speech lawyer, but that runs the gamut of all  sorts of things that when speech and technology intersect, you got to play with all this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Perfect. Contributor at Tech Dirt. Very glad to have her. It's your website, C G C O U N S E L  Council dot com. Jeff Jarvis also here. Great to have him back. You look less pink than usual.  Did you change your light bulbs? No, I think I got my own version of the lamp.  Looks very good. And of course, Ant Pruitt, who always looks good. He can't not look good. It's  just not way he's built. He's looking more pink with that shirt though. I like the shirt.  I like the shirt. It's good. Our show today brought to you by Our Crowd. This is a really  interesting company doing something I think is very interesting. It's not for everybody.  You have to be an accredited investor to get involved. Our Crowd is a venture capital firm.  They have accredited investors. They've got deal flow. They're looking at a lot of companies.  They specialize in the global private market. These are not companies that have gone public.  They're looking for companies, tech companies that are innovating, driving returns for investors,  companies that might even have big exits, whether it's IPOs or sales. They're looking to get in  early. In other words, from personalized medicine to cyber security to robotics, quantum computing.  You know, in state of the art labs and startup garages and anywhere in between,  Our Crowd is identifying innovators. And then what's great is you get to participate  when the growth potential is earliest, right at the beginning. That's the highest potential  for growth. Our Crowd's accredited investors have already invested over a billion dollars  in growing tech companies. 21 of their portfolio companies are unicorns, over 40 IPOs or sale exits.  It's a really interesting idea. Basically, they're sharing what they know with you and  giving you a chance to participate. What's nice is you can get involved for free. You can sign up at  ourcrowd.com slash twig and kind of get involved in the deal flow. Now, the first thing you're  going to have to do though, is check, go to the site, sign up and input the country you're  investing from. Every country has different rules for being an accredited investor. This is for  somebody who meets those requirements. If you are an accredited investor in your nation,  you can participate in single company deals for as little as $10,000. They have funds too.  You can get into Our Crowd's funds. Those are bigger investments, $50,000. You do have to have  a minimum of $10,000 in order to invest, but you don't have to invest right up front. The whole idea  is you can join Our Crowd. You can look at these new companies, see where they're going. The  investment terms are going to vary depending on where you invest. I'll give you an example. I  don't know if it's, yeah, there it is on the left. BlueTree. This is really interesting. This is a  company that could revolutionize the billion dollar plus total addressable food tech market.  What they have is they've developed a process that reduces the sugar significantly in any natural  liquid without reducing the taste. As somebody who drinks fruit juice, you would say,  that sounds great. Health risks are lowered, but the taste is there. BlueTree has already signed  a five-year, 100 million liter contract with an industry leader, but they're not public yet.  In fact, you probably have never heard their name. They're just getting started, but you can  invest in them today at Our Crowd. I just use that as an example. I just use it as an example.  There's lots of other startups at Our Crowd. Invest in BlueTree or any of their startups or  invest in their funds, O-U-R-C-R-O-W-D.com slash twig. It's free to join, and this is what I would  suggest doing. Go there. See what the requirements are for being an accredited investor because it  every country has their own laws about that. It's really not for somebody just starting out.  There's obviously other things you should do to build your wealth, but this is for somebody who's  looking for diversification, interesting new investment opportunities. Maybe somebody like  you and I who maybe started covering this industry for years, watching these companies exploding.  Boy, I'd like to be in at the beginning of the next one. O-U-R-C-R-O-W-D, OurCrowd.com slash  twig. Join the fastest growing venture capital investment community, OurCrowd.com slash twig.  I love getting an advertiser that's doing something unique. This is a really interesting business.  OurCrowd.com slash twig. Thank you so much for your support of this week in Google Our Crowd.  You, dear listeners and viewers, support us when you use that special address. Make sure you do  that so they know you saw it here. OurCrowd.com slash twig. We don't want them to think Joe Rogan  sent you. Did you see, by the way, it was in the verge yesterday. I said this to Lisa.  This is inside baseball. Nobody cares about this.  But podcasters who are using ... We've always relied on what you just saw, which was a host  read endorsement kind of baked in. But more and more podcasters are doing the programmatic  advertising. We started trying playing with that a little bit. The verge had a long article about  how poorly it's working for people. This is the plan. We've talked about this before. This is what  Spotify is doing. In fact, that's the number one programmatic company. They bought Megaphone,  which we use. It's part of their Spotify span, Spotify ad network. I thought this was an  interesting article, but it's a little inside baseball, so I won't ... Podcasters are letting  software pick their ads. It's already going awry. I love it. Let it go awry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Meanwhile, did you see that NPR is going ... I didn't put this in the rundown, but since we're  inside the baseball diamond right now, they're going to put up a subscriber-only material.  The whole point of public media is it the whole public ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's disappointing. They do what?  They do what? Yeah, sure.  Public radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Jeff.  We're all timers, Kathy.  Jeff, I hate to point you to something that's in the rundown. No, but you should  read the comment that NPR filed before the Copyright Office in the study of the ancillary  right for news publications. You will not like it, given what you just said, that the point of  public broadcasting is that the public can get access to it, and they are pushing for an ancillary  right that would allow, essentially cause a statutory license to exist for any of these  platforms or what I call audience-facilitating services. They were very clear in the testimony,  we don't mean a link text. It's a link text. It's the idea that anybody is aggregating anything  else on the internet to direct audience to these other sites. How dare you do this? How dare you  make money associated with it? That should be ours because we need the money too. NPR came out in  favor of, yes, we should totally have this scheme because we need money too. And I think it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  completely contrary to what's mentioned. What you call a link text, I call it life-suggestion  threat. Yeah, because he likes to say that word. Yes, I do. Kathy, your piece on this, I didn't know  that this discussion was as far along as it was in this country. I thought it was only happening in  Germany and the EU and Canada and Australia, but the lobbying power of old media apparently is  working here too. Why don't you summarize, if I may be so bold since you brought it up,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and I think it's a wonderful piece, your arguments. I mean, our arguments. Our arguments is this is a  terrible idea. Our argument is that this is a completely inappropriate use of copyright.  That the point of copyright is to make sure that the public has access to, puts up walls to that.  And it's economically infeasible, dumb, stupid, cumbersome, costly, and really detrimental to the  financial interests of any smaller publications that exist in the long tail, where any revenue  it's going to collect is going to go to big players and small players aren't going to get a  significant piece of the pie. But meanwhile, the services they depend on to have their expression  reach audiences is not going to be able to get there because the services are going to be  disincentivized to provide the services of directing attention to anybody. You won't get  the services. You won't get the platforms. You'll have fewer choices and you'll just be shouting in  the wind with your own publication because you don't have those intermediating services to help  connect you to audiences because they can't afford to because we decided to pick their pocket for  how dare you actually make money doing us a favor and giving us the audiences we have always said  that we want and needed in order to be viable entities economically. So this is killing the  golden goose on an enormous scale if they actually go forward with it and really detrimental to  anybody smaller who doesn't agree that that's in their financial or expressive best interests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love that you put it this way in your argument is that you think you're doing something good here.  You would think that we at Tech Dirt would like this because oh we want to get paid for our stuff  but in fact you're hurting us and at Tech Dirt, speaking for Tech Dirt, and thus you're hurting  the competition you supposedly want to foster. So the big guys see previous discussions about  regulatory capture are the ones who win and small guys and new guys lose and so we all lose and we  all lose our freedoms and this is just abhorrent that it's gotten this far. I didn't know it.  My blood pressure would be a lot higher if I'd known it. Yeah, ignorance sometimes is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  medically necessary bliss but I mean at the testimony that they had, you know,  on the one hand they're like, well we need another Google. Google has too much power and it's like,  but you don't see that if you do regulatory schemes like this you're salting the earth  and making it impossible to have anybody go into the business of doing anything that's going to  direct attention to any of these sites anywhere. Like you won't get your other Google. You're  going to solve a monopoly power essentially by stoking more monopoly power. Just put it somewhere  else. None of this is logical. None of this is rational. None of this is a good idea. It's  undercooked and really rather greedy and entitled where the common theme was how dare any of these  based on giving us audience if there's any money to be had by sending people to us then that's our  money and we need a piece of it for all of it. But the bad guys this time. Sensible reason to think

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that. Sorry, Kathy. I can't hear you. So I thought, so I apologize. I was not trying to cut you off

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  though I just. Tell me what you were saying about the bad guys. Well, so in the previous prior

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  discussion about Facebook and its campaign to say, oh, we're fine with doing 230. That's regulatory  capture on their staff. The bad guys in this case are big old media. In this case, the platforms  don't want to do this. They don't want to ever be in a position of paying for what we used to call  content. They don't want to be paying for links, but they get forced into it. That's what happened  in Australia where they say, OK, here's back. Sheesh, we will bribe you into not pushing this  law so far that everybody's screwed. And in that case, Facebook did the right thing more than Google  by saying, fine, we'll leave Australia. And so that now it's going to happen in Canada. Now it's  happening in the EU and now it's happening here where it is big old media who never acknowledged  the conflict of interest they have when they cover the Internet, who see the Internet as a  competitor. They went after radio this way. They went after billboards this way. They went after  television this way. And now they're just going after the Internet this way. They always have.  They cash in their political capital to get protectionist legislation passed. And that's  what's happening here. And it's my colleagues in big old media who are screwing you guys, you Leo  too, and you, Kathy and Mike at Tech Dirt, the small and new guys. And thus it affects all of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  our freedoms. Well, it does affect everybody, but I wouldn't necessarily focus on just the big old  incumbents. There is that. I don't want to say that that's wrong, but that's not a complete enough  picture about people jostling for this. Who else? Because you will see some of the smaller ones also  thinking it's a good idea. I mean, this is really what we saw with music copyright where you had a  lot of big incumbent record companies and big incumbent artists who decided this, you know,  having compulsory licenses would be good for them. And they sold the line to all the way down the  spectrum to midsize and smaller where, oh yeah, this is good for you. You need this too. And so a  lot of people who really don't realize the consequences are also calling up and asking for

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  these things. So what about the buzz feeds and the boxes now that they're getting bigger and  they're consolidating? Are they basically just big old guys now or not? I don't know. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this was really depressing. There were, you know, a lot of it also is that people aren't necessarily  advocating directly. They're also advocating via organizations and the organizations are taking  strange lines. Like I do find it weird that, you know, the news media in particular really needs  the first amendment to function and pushing for any sort of law that has an anti first amendment  consequence to it by chilling expression really seems like something they should be very careful  about. And jostling in the copyright space is really not going to pay off for them in the long  run because it turns a lot of barriers to expression. And this seems like the industry  more than any others that should really understand how important it is not to have barriers to  expression if you're going to be able to express yourself. So was this constitutional in the United

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  States? Do you think God knows what the courts we have now? So imagine it's 10 years ago and we had  courts and you had the opportunity to argue it. Do you think that a ancillary copyright in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  U.S. is constitutional? Well, you there's a couple ways to think about it. One, whether this is  consistent with the progress clause itself, I think it's antithetical to promoting the progress  of science and the useful arts. That hasn't necessarily stopped copyright from developing  and hardening and expanding over the years, however. And the second bit is copyright also  exists in tension with the First Amendment, particularly as it starts to put barriers down.  And we've kind of ignored that tension as well. I think it does stand. This is a very naked emperor  and nobody's paying attention to the kind of conflict we're setting up. There's so,  so many people are so enamored with the idea that copyright can give people something that they have  and why would they ever want to let go of it? And it just blinds people to the reality of,  well, what does it mean when that right is so long lasting, impenetrable, unshareable,  taking away from public domain, taking away from fair use, the effects on the internet with the  DMCA and all the prior restraint that that causes. People don't look at the collateral damage because  they've kind of bought into the idea that copyright was something that they could just have and how  dare anybody take it away. But this is a really modern development. It wasn't always like this.  It wasn't supposed to be like this because now all of a sudden copyright is doing the exact opposite  of what it was ever intended to do. It's shutting things down. It's slowing the sharing of ideas  and information. It's shutting down expression and the constitution is kind of built around  the idea that if democracy is going to work, that's not the thing that should be happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It should be the exact opposite. Well, I didn't realize until I started researching my Gutenberg  book how much the origins of copyright in 1710, and you're a legal scholar and I'm not, and I don't  play one on podcasting, but I didn't fully realize how it wasn't the authors who fought for it. It  was the publishers who fought for it so that they had a tradable asset so that they could acquire  the copyright from the author and then they could sell it around and they had an asset that could  grow in value for them. It wasn't to protect authors at all. It was to create a marketplace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it wasn't necessarily to correct authors. So before they had copyright, they had the royal  privilege. I forget how it was called. Yeah, the royal print license where it didn't involve an  author at all, but it basically was, could you print only if the king said so? And he wouldn't  necessarily say so directly, but he would empower about four or five, like the royal stationers  company. They were the people who were allowed, they had the license to print. So they decided  what would be accessible to go into publication, which was incredibly censoring. And as there were  more democratic forces getting more leverage in England, that act kept expiring and eventually  they couldn't renew it. So eventually they cooked up something called the statute of Anne,  which comes out completely differently where it's a statute for learning. And it did put rights in  the hands of authors where there was more of a personal ownership to it. But the idea was  something, it really did shift in terms of its regulatory language and all the packaging around  it, that it was a statute for learning because we recognize the value in people having access to  written information that people can then share. I've heard what you've said before that actually,  this was sort of a cynical calculation by the people who just wanted to sort of make sure they  got leverage under the new system. And this was the new system designed to make publishers  do fine. And it really wasn't about the authors, but it was still in principle, a much better thing  for the public. And it really did sort of increase public discourse. People could go to pubs and talk  about things because they could share their pamphlets with each other. And it really did have a sort of,  if you want democracy, this is the kind of thing you're going to need to have. So people are informed  and able to exchange information. But it was limited. It didn't last forever. The rights were,  you get some exclusive rights, but the public could still do things. And as it was brought to  the United States, it was brought over with the balance of what is what you need just to make sure  you don't have market failure, because we want to make sure that people are still producing  written stuff. But that's all you need. The point of having this whole system is to make sure that  the public gets access to all this knowledge. So if you create a system that takes it away from  the public, you're not doing what you were supposed to do. And it's not the way copyright was  written in the founding days of America at all. It's really divorced from what those principles

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  were at this point. So this is all triggered by a phrase called ancillary copyright, which I think  is probably a term of art that isn't widely known by people in our audience. I don't want  to patronize anybody. If you've been following this, I'm happy. Please patronize me. But  I think Kathy and Jeff know what ancillary copyright means. And now having  read your pleading and listen to you, I understand it better. But we should explain.  This is, by the way, the Copyright Office asking for comment. I think the comments

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  period is over now, right? Today is a deadline for reply comment. So yes, functionally, it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  going to be over. Okay. But they're asking for comment on the behalf of Congress. First of all,  is Congress considering modifying the copyright law in this way? Is that something they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  actively considering right now? Some, yes. Where that is in terms of actually producing a bill,  I don't know if there's the turnaround time to go from this idea to something where we actually  have to vote on it. There may be some amount of time. I mean, more than days. Now's the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to bring it up. There's a letter from People on the Hill asking for this. It's legitimate because  this has happened in Europe. In fact, you quote in your brief, you quote what happened in Spain,  and we've talked about this on the show before, where the Spanish government said, no, no, Google,  you got to pay money to newspapers if you put them in your search results, if you put their  snippets in your search results. Google's response was, fine, no Google News for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think Spain capitulated, as I remember. Only very recently, only in the last few months,  did a new law occur based on different European law that allows Google News to come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this notion of ancillary copyright is essentially saying we want to amend copyright law  so that the newspapers, the publishers have some additional interest in what you do with it. Jeff,  use the phrase link tax, which is sometimes what this boils down to is actually if Tector wants  to write an article about an article in the New York Times, that the New York Times would somehow  share in the revenue. Is that what we're talking about? Is that a fair way to describe it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, they're approaching it more from an aggregation standpoint.  So they're not worried about Tector?  Well, they're not worried about Tector at all, but it's more in a, you know, Google News is  the prototypical example. That's who they're really worried about, the big tech companies.  Because Google News aggregated all these links. Well, they want money.  And so in theory, when Google aggregates, then they can put their advertising up and they can  make money from the advertising as people aggregate. On the other hand, it's then sending people to  these other publications where they may bounce off because there's paywalls. So like, you know,  it's your fault you're not making the money. You're not figuring out how to monetize your  audience very well. And that doesn't mean that you should then go pick Google's pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I understand. I'm just trying to break this down a little bit for  people like me who didn't really follow it.  Happy to do something.  Yeah. So this, what they're considering at this point is what are the rights of these publishers  when it comes to link aggregators like Google? Is there anybody else besides Google really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they're mad at Facebook because people share links on Facebook. And so you get a lot  of traffic from a Facebook link or you can potentially. And Facebook's in theory also  running some algorithms that are going to sort whether things percolate up. So anyway,  Facebook makes money when links appear on its site and how dare Facebook make money  for having a link to my publication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're saying, should we amend copyright law in such a way that the copyright extends  to somebody who links to your content?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're using the idea that they might have copyright in it. So a lot of the study is also  to examine doctrinally whether you even would have a copyright interest in the short bits  that actually do get shared. The title, the link, or maybe a blurb.  The snippets.  Yeah.  The snippets. It's an open question whether doctrinally you would potentially have a  copyright, but let's presume yes. Let's presume yes, you could. Then the next question is,  and what do you get to do with that? Do you have an exclusive right to foreclose somebody from  reusing that in some way?  What constitutes reuse?  What constitutes reuse? This idea that you've scooped up links and aggregated that and now  you're presenting them to a viewer on your page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this a major amendation of copyright laws? Is this a big change?  Would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, it's a barrier. It's sort of, you're supposed to have an interchange of ideas. This is  the point of it. And this is putting up a toll booth on the exchange of ideas. So we haven't seen  that sort of toll booth before. And part of it is because copyright developed in a world where we  didn't have digital mediums. So you had physical scarcity of products and you could attach the  exclusive rights that go into a copyright to the existence of a physical product.  Things do get weird when you start having.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this whole idea of links and snippets is brand new. We've never had this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But two things. There are analogies here. One is when copyright started,  news was not included, not included at all. It was intended for books and longer things and so on.  News was not there. Second, then the Associated Press tried to press what they called a hot news  doctrine. Same as the newspaper industry tried to press this with radio and say, if I report  something, the essence of it is mine for some period of time. And you can't replicate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, you certainly can't just copy that. If Walter Winchell says Lucille Ball is a communist  and the New York Times publishes that the next day, is that they would be liable to-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Under the hot news doctrine, they would have tried to argue that you can't do that.  That's our scoop and you can't republish it.  The newspaper industry had an agreement, the Biltmore Agreement with the radio industry  in the very early days where the radio industry was not allowed to repeat any news item for,  I think it was 12 hours. Interesting.  I own the essence of this. Whereas what copyright always protects is only the treatment of the  information. In a free society, the information itself can never be owned. But now they're trying

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to change it that way.  So that's interesting. So then the actual factual matter is not what's been copyrighted.  Never been copyrighted.  The way you've written it up and presented it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. But there's always tension and copyright where the idea expression dichotomy,  actually they think this is merger, where basically you can't separate the two.  The fact is the fact and there's only so many ways of expressing the fact. The idea,  what Jeff was saying, is like the nonfiction bits of our life are not supposed to be subject to  copyright. Copyright is supposed to be an original work of authorship. So it implies a certain degree  of creativity. How you write your nonfiction facts could qualify for copyright, but not the  facts themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not the facts themselves. Ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. So this is very doctrinally sort of a fraught area because then you get in the question of,  well, copyright is, now we threw in copyright and copyright is making things complicated.  What's the effects of making things complicated? The effects of making things complicated  is we're having some issues exchanging of our ideas now because we don't know, is it copyrightable?  Is it protectable? Does somebody own it? Does somebody not own it? How are we going to have a  usable conversation? The irony and kind of the perverse irony of this push for this ancillary  copyright is, you know, you get like some of the news organizations are talking about how  we need an informed public and the informed public won't be an informed public if we don't  have news businesses in the news business. So you have to make sure the news business is supported,  but they're pushing for it to have a regulatory model that ultimately keeps the public away  from the information that the news business is now producing.  Well said.  So we're going to, I mean-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that was what Spain realized, essentially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They didn't realize it. I basically was, I believe what happened was there was a local  law that was really, really atrocious. Google pulled out, but then I think an EU law superseded  it and the EU law was a little bit more gentle. And so Google came back when the EU law ended  up being the one that was operative. So I don't think Spain actually recanted. It just sort of  became less of an issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it did hurt the publishers in Spain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The kind of the general principle that Google's making money off of our content and we want a  little piece of it. You could argue both ways on that, but your argument really is that it would  be a bad thing for the general discourse and the general flow of information in society.  It just-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wouldn't concede the first point. I mean, I wouldn't concede that.  Like, you know, and I've been thinking about it today, like the internet platforms are being  regarded as parasites in some way that they just suck from us, but it's like, no, they're not  parasites. They're symbiotes. They are giving you what you need. You need an audience or else-  Doesn't the news industry understand that? That it drives traffic?  No, they don't.  Why don't they understand that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because they were adapted to that world. They're never adapted to that world.  They only think of themselves as destinations that sell a product called content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and by the way, at a curiosity, I think Google made a strong argument, we drive traffic,  but our podcast or tech dirt probably can make a much weaker argument that we drive traffic.  We're just a parasite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're not a parasite. I mean, you're like, you know, I sort of, I may never use that again,  because the point I wanted to make is it's a symbiote.  But that's not the way the regular-  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But if I'm not driving traffic, if I'm not driving traffic to the news stories that we're  talking about, I'm not really a symbiote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The point of the news stories is just this, which is conversation in the public domain,  in the public sphere. That is the point of it.  No, that's not the point of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And if you cut that off-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're missing the point entirely. The point of it is to drive traffic to our website so you see our ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, nothing's going to happen with this regulatory scheme because this regulatory scheme  chills the environment. I mean, presumably, how do you get people to come to your website?  Like, you're out there and you need an audience facilitating service to help bring you that  traffic. And if all of a sudden that was audience facilitating service-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But we didn't need it before Google. We were doing just fine before Google.  No, no, no. I mean, newspapers survived in the 40s.  You were in a tiny little shed then.  No, I'm not talking about me. I'm talking about a newspaper. So a newspaper,  I understand they're upset. In the old days, you didn't have Google to drive traffic to  the newspaper. You bought it for a nickel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we're not in the old days. So it's only somewhat helpful to analogize that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But from their point of view, what has happened is the world has changed.  And all of a sudden, there's these people taking my content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Postal Service of the United States made it free, free for newspapers to exchange newspapers  with each other. Copyright was not involved. There were editors called scissors editors  that would cut things out of one paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Talk about the old days. This is Ben Franklin times you're talking about now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It went until the Associated Press. And so that was done as a matter of policy,  of government policy to encourage the public discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I would submit that I don't think the New York Times, maybe in their loftiest ideals,  say we're facilitating public conversation, but most sites, we're facilitating our revenue  by creating content that you will come to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But if everybody they called up said, I'm not going to give you a quote unless you pay me for it.  Yeah. Which is basically what's happening here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's good. There's a good analogy. There's a good analogy. Yeah. You're going to use my  quote to make money in your newspaper. What are you going to give me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This sense of entitlement of if you make money, I should have a piece of it is a really poisonous  one that taken to its logical extent is really bad. And that's an example of it. That would be  bad for the news of like, you can't get a quote. Well, you're going to make money if that goes in  your article and you sell newspapers because of it. There is a quick pro quo. There's a tit for tat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People are sources for a variety of reasons that benefit them. Nobody just says, well,  I'm going to do that. Many just hate being sources because they get misquoted and they get

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  misunderstood. And yeah. Yeah. But I mean, Jeff can speak to this better,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but the journalistic ethics of paying your source are probably a little fraud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, no, it's changing. It's changing for this reason is when it comes to diversity, equity,  and inclusion. You know, if you go to a professor and use their expertise and exploit that expertise  and they get nothing for it, you've exploited them for that purpose. There is a school of thought  that is now arguing that you should share at that level. If you're, if you go on CNN, you get paid,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  or maybe not the individual person, but contributors. I was never a contributor on MSNBC,  so why did you go on and why did you give them the benefit of your expertise? I have a huge ego.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go. I mean, one of the things is it distills the quid pro quo to something that is so  dollars and cents and presume that there's nothing else that you can get from it. And the idea,  we're talking about expression here. So people have interest of being heard, even if there was  no economic upside, people who are expressing themselves want to be heard. And this is an  obstacle to being heard. Then it turns out that normally being heard is a critical first step to  be able to monetize the things that you actually said. And this is also a barrier to that money  actually existing. One of the problems that we have is that online monetization models are not  quite ready for prime time at the moment. Online advertising is creepy, invasive, not particularly  fit for purpose. And so a lot of, I think online periodicals are having some issues,  actually monetizing their stuff. But some can experiment with different sorts of monetization  models and there's things to do. And some of it is not that they're making no money. Like all the  advertising dollars didn't completely dry up. They're just sort of like needing to get reallocated  a little here. And some of this isn't, oh, we're not making money, but it's we're not making all  the money. And that's a completely different policy question. And we're solving for, they're  not making all the money and calling it, oh, but they're not making any money at all. And I think,  you know, just the economics of what problem we're trying to solve are not being well investigated.  And I don't think are part of the study at the moment. And that's key. What are we're presuming  that there's really an economic failure here. And we're not even understanding if that's true.  And if to the extent that's true, what is failing, how, and what would be a much better way of fixing  it if we actually have a problem to fix? Cathy, I'm so glad you're here. He's been trying to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  somebody to agree with him for so long. Bless his heart. No, just teasing. Obviously, obviously,  well done. This is something we care about. But I'm glad you could explain a little bit more for  you. Yeah, brilliantly. Explain it like I'm a fifth grader is basically my motto. Let's take  a little break. It's great to have Cathy Gellis here. You know, there's no insult in that, but  I hope not. We also have Jeff Jarvis. The problem is Jeff's a professor. So what happens sometimes  is it becomes a colloquy, you know, worthy of a graduate school of journalism. And poor aunt and  I are going, I don't know what they're talking. You know what they're talking about? I don't know.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. And I let it run. But my broadcaster instinct is going,  yeah, I know, I can better explain this. You better explain this. I'm so excited about the  and I don't know, I don't want to patronize our smart audience either. Because I think they  probably but it's complicated. And I want to make sure the thing that I think launched it,  which was the two words ancillary copyright, I don't think people understood exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you had just said, life's too short to react. Yeah, that really clarified it a lot. You tried

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to don't get lost in the technical term, because I can't quite explain where that came on. But it's  essentially, we had copyright for a long time. And this is sort of a bolt on that is changing  what we always had in a way that I don't think we're completely anticipating the consequences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's, it's something we talk about all the time, which is the tension between the new and  the old. And, and, you know, I mean, we talk all the time about journalism, and how to serve  how to save journalism. And, you know, whether this is necessary, and yet at the same time,  obviously, it's a technology network. So we kind of are on the side of technology most of the time,  except except when it's me versus Jeff, then I'm the Luddite. And, and Pruitt is also here,  hands on photography, our show today, take a little break, and come back with a lot more.  Our show today brought to you by Cashfly. Actually, when I say brought to you by Cashfly,  it's kind of literally brought to you by Cashfly. Cashfly is our CDN, our content delivery  network. And we've been with them for more than a decade, they solved a big problem. How do we get  you the podcasts in a timely, fast fashion? People were downloading it from our website,  and there were bottlenecks, it was slow. We have listeners all over the world. We really wanted  to be able to get you that content, no matter where you are in the globe instantly. And that's  what Cashfly has been able to do for us for more than 10 years, we are huge fans. Now Cashfly is  something new, which is pretty impressive, delivering video, not just podcasts, but video  with sub one second latency. Now, if you if you've tried doing this, whether it's, you know,  YouTube or zoom, or you know, there's all there's sometimes half a minute, a minute of latency.  If you've tried WebRTC, you know, it's maybe not the most reliable if you've been using it for your  WebSocket live video workflow. How about something that's scalable to millions of users, goes live  and instantly, not days with a sub one second latency, you've got to try Cashfly's ultra low  latency video streaming, it will dramatically increase your sites and application speed for  global audiences. And when I say global, I mean at 50 plus locations all over the globe content is  closer to your customer outperforming local CDNs. It's been huge for us. You could take a load off  your origin servers. If you use an s3 or something similar, you can really reduce those bills,  because Cashfly can help you get a cash hit ratio of 100%  with their storage optimization system. We've talked about that before.  And they're fully managed, by the way, with Cashfly's elite managed packages, you get VIP  treatment 24 seven support response times less than an hour. In most cases, they're going to know  what's going on before you even call them. And they'll be working to fix it before your team  even knows about it. That's how good Cashfly is. And I could say that from direct experience.  So with Cashfly ultra low latency video streaming to deliver video to more than a million concurrent  users, lightning fast gaming, delivering downloads faster with zero lag glitches or outages,  mobile content optimization that offers automatic and simple image optimization. So your site loads  faster on any device and a multi CDN for redundancy and failover, which intelligently balances your  traffic across multiple riders, giving you the shortest routes and mitigating against performance  glitches. No wonder they have a 100% SL a they've had 100% availability in the last 12 months,  on average, 30% faster than other major CDNs, 98% cash hit ratio, 100% availability.  What are you waiting for? Best of all 24 seven 365 priority support. They're always there when  we need them. They'll be there for you too. Look, if you want to know more, we've arranged a special  consultation, bring your current CDN bill if you've got one, your usage trends to twit.cashfly.com.  See if you're overpaying as much as 20%. See what Cashfly can do for you. See how they can optimize  based on your own usage trends. I think you'll be impressed. No hard sales, just information  twit.cashfly.com. We love them and I know you will too. twit.cashfly.com.  We let's let's stay in court for a moment. We've got a council here. Theranos trial is over.  Elizabeth Holmes. You know what's interesting though? And I don't know, maybe I'm reading more  into this. They found her guilty of defrauding investors, but found her innocent of defrauding  normal people with bogus test results. That seems wrong to me. I mean, yeah, so maybe Mark  Andreessen lost a bunch of money. By the way, this market erased this tweet, but thanks to Kosh for  bringing it back. This is from this is from some time ago. I think it was 10 years ago,  Mark said the ongoing veneration of scientific peer review is really questionable in a promotional  promotional tweet for his investment. She didn't go so well. Now, of course, she'll be facing some  possibly I don't know what what the sense will be, but it could be as much as 10, I think 20  years per count. So that's all up to 20. Yeah, it could be it could be bad.  Should we celebrate this? Is this the right answer? I think it is. Yeah. Found guilty of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  four of 11 charges. I'm not celebrating it until she's in there for more than two years. You know,  this this is kind of stuff that I'm used to seeing where the rich continue to get richer or the rich  continue to find a way to weasel out of their punishment. So yeah, I mean, a couple of years,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  if she goes to jail to country club jail anyway, right? Exactly. You know, like this, that's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  punishment. Come on. But I, I, any jail, any loss of liberty is significant deprivation, we shouldn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  be too glib about. Sorry. You want to you want to tackle Leo's question? I've heard an explanation  with your your counsel. Why did you why did the jury go for the charges? You know, the investors

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  got got screwed over, but not the users. Yeah, I don't I don't know the answer to the question.  It's not exactly my type of law. And I didn't follow the trial closely. But basically, one of  the things that might inform it is every charge has elements and different things that you'd have  to prove. And it may just be that could be some of the counts that she was charged on were easier  to prove up than other ones were, which could I don't know if that is the explanation. I have  seen something on Twitter that suggested that might be what happened. And that that what I heard was

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  intent mattered, that it was easier to prove in this case that she was trying to defraud the  investors. It was hard to say that she was for whatever the evidence there was,  explicitly trying to defraud the users of the technology. That could well be for many criminal

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  charges, intent is a really important factor that needs to be proven up. And it may have been easier

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for some of these counts than others. Yeah, three counts of wire fraud against specific investors,  one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, the other charges dropped or not guilty.  Do you think she entered this attempt with a fraudulent intent? Or did it go bad after a while?  Who knows? I guess we don't know. I think the more interesting question was there's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twitter fight happening surrounding a tweet by Benedict Evans, where I think he was taking the  other way. Somebody had tweeted that basically, oh, this is Silicon Valley ethos. And like it  finally got like caught. He's like, no, that wasn't, this isn't Silicon Valley ethos. This  is more particular. And I think there's an open question of whether, to what extent, because we  talked about this earlier with innovators and followers that at a certain point, I think there's  just such a gold rush mentality towards, well, this thing worked. So, let's all have one. And  if that happens, you get a lot of snake oil sales that keep getting offered. And was this a snake  oil sale that went bad? Was it bad in any particular way? Or is this kind of what tends to happen and  only this person got caught? And I don't know the answers to that question, but I do know there's a  lot of snake oil and people probably lose money chasing it. Evans was responding to a tweet by

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Faiz Siddiqui, who tweeted the Elizabeth Holmes case was perhaps the highest profile test of  whether the Silicon Valley ethos taken to the extreme could withstand legal scrutiny. Now she  makes history as the first Silicon Valley CEO to be convicted of a white collar crime, to which  evidence responds, I can't be bothered to go into this again, but no telling lies is not the Silicon  Valley ethos. Tolerance for failure, yes. Bootstrapping, yes. Unrealistic ambition,  yes. Lying, no. This is like claiming that Jason Blair was an indictment of the journalism ethos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, that's fair enough. I think Ben's right. Like Kathy, she's usually right and Ben's usually  right. But I think that there's a desire to say that this exhibits something about all of  Silicon Valley and all of technology. It's Enron. It's a fraudulent company. However it got there,  it ends up being a fraudulent country or Lehman Brothers or whatever that went overboard. And  it's not tied to technology. It's an eternal story. That's why he loves the mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love his subsequent tweet. He says, the interesting Silicon Valley angle  on Theranos is that founders did not really participate in the Silicon Valley system,  but sold quote, Silicon Valley disruption to East Coast investors who didn't know anything about tech  or bio. I think that's probably true. Henry Kissinger was on the board.  George Schultz. Yeah. Right. General Mad Dog Mattis. Yeah. It was all Easterners,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  not Silicon Valley types. Yeah. Which is sort of interesting because they, in theory, should be  sophisticated investors and yet they were defrauded. It's kind of an interesting...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's why they were perfect because they could be fooled, but they had credibility.  Yeah. It's such a mess. Just exactly what you want. Although  Mick Sarajevich also points out Tim Draper, Donald Lucas, Dixon Dahl, all invested in Theranos,  including Larry Ellison. So there was Silicon Valley money. There was Theranos money.  In that as well. So it's fascinating actually. Anyway, it's a great story. If you haven't read  the book, absolutely must read. And I think it's, I think the story, well, it's not quite over because  Sonny gets tried next. Although his strategy might change because it was apparently Holmes'  strategy or Holmes' attorney's strategy to blame Sonny for it. Actually, maybe it'll work even  better now. Sonny can blame her and say, see, I told you, it wasn't my idea. I guess we can do  a little inside baseball. Ben Smith, the esteemed media columnist at the New York Times, leaves the  New York Times to join, is it Justin Smith? Justin Smith. Yep. Who is no relation. No, no.  Has a great track record. Yeah. Aliase Smith and Jones. Great track record. TV reference for you,  Kathy. Yeah, boy, there's an old one. Don't worry about it. I can't remember it. Yeah, no, don't worry.  I got nothing. Yeah. So tell us about Jeff's, Justin Smith. Tell us about his-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Justin, I know and respect greatly. Justin was the guy who brought The Week magazine to the US for  Felix Dennis and did a brilliant and very unusual launch of the magazine. No newsstands, for example.  And he made it work and he gave it a brand and it's really quite amazing. Then he went to the  Atlantic where he brought it back from death. It was at the door, knocking on hell's door,  and he brought it back and made it into the tremendous brand that it is and also started

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Quartz. With some help from COVID, by the way. I think COVID helps Atlantic a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that too, when I think of the Atlantic. But I actually think the Atlantic does too many takes  now, but that's another story. And then Justin went to Bloomberg for the last, I think, eight years,  where he sat directly across from Michael Bloomberg. I went to visit Justin more than once  and the open space directly across from him. And his job was to take the free parts of Bloomberg.  Bloomberg, you know, is the really expensive terminal. That's what Bloomberg loves, the person.  But to take Businessweek, which they bought, and the web and all this stuff and turn it into a  business. And he did. He turned into a major source of revenue. So now he and Ben Smith are going to  start something new. And before we were on the air, Leo and I were comparing notes about a New Yorker  interview with Ben Smith in which, like a sphinx, he said absolutely nothing of value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was actually quite enjoyable. Claire Malone writing in New Yorker, Ben Smith can't say what  his new media venture is. She leads by saying, Ben Smith had 144 unread text messages when we talked  for a sometimes digitally distracted 16 minutes just afternoon yesterday. 15 minutes after we  hung up, he responded to an email I'd sent asking if he'd like to talk. Obviously, very busy, very  busy. I'm very busy. And it was great publicity, but he did not say what he wants to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Except all they're saying is that they see a market in the 200 million college educated English  speaking people around the world and believe there's an opportunity there. What the hell that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have no idea. It means they was going after the New York Times. Well, or they're going to  do it without. And they do it without ancillary copyright. Oh my God, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. This is what we call a callback. Wait, now I'll bring up Scott Bakula.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll find a way. He made a quantum leap into a new form of journalism. Anyway, it's probably  pretty inside baseball, but people who follow all of this are very interested to know. And it is,  in a way, it's interesting to see a couple of people who have done very well for themselves

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  decide to launch into journalism. Well, there is an online angle here too, which is that Ben has been,  Ben, oh, I respect, Ben's gone after me, but nevermind. He's very, very smart. He did great  things with Buzzfeed News. He left Buzzfeed before Buzzfeed went to its back and thus became public.  He had tons of options and had vowed to get rid of those options because it was a conflict of  interest. He was the media critic at the New York Times. Well, many pointed out today that he managed  to leave without having to do that because the Buzzfeed's back went and God knows what his  strike price was on those options. But one presumes he gets to keep the options down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good news. I think the Ninth District Court has ruled that the FCC actually has some  engineering expertise. And in fact, when the FCC says, you know what, we are not going to give  the telcos this six gigahertz spectrum, but we're going to open it up for unlicensed use,  just as we did the Wi-Fi spectrum years and years ago, the DC court said, yeah, you know what,  they can do that. So that's good. We're moving ahead. And this actually impacts Wi-Fi 6E,  which does use the six gigahertz band, but also opens up the band for a lot more interesting uses.  Wi-Fi has been kind of an incredible success story for unlicensed, unregulated spectrum.  AT&T was really pissed. There must be a good reason.  Actually, I've been also enjoying the back and forth between AT&T,  Verizon and the Federal Aviation Administration and the FCC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can't tell who's in the right and wrong on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's another one where the FCC's engineers said, no, 5G, go ahead, do it.  The telcos bought the spectrum. And then the FAA says, well, wait a minute,  that's going to screw up our altimeters. It's going to make aviation dangerous. Stop.  Then the telcos said, no. And then they said, yes, but we're not happy about it. We'll give you a  couple of weeks. Although I like the way they said, no, they said, it's not our responsibility  to make up for the antiquated altimeters used by some manufacturers. They should get better  altimeters. But I don't want a plane to come out of the sky either. So I think again, this is a good  case of where you, you know, the FCC for a few years was perhaps not the best scientific  arbiter or steward of our infrastructure. But I think you can say, you know, I think that the  circuit court was correct when saying, you know, somebody's got to be in charge of this stuff.  They get a lot of engineers. Jessica Rosenworcel, the director of the FAA,  applauded the decision. Decision, she said, or she tweeted, equals more Wi-Fi and more places  and it matters because it comes at a time when being connected is more important than ever.  And I would agree. Let's see. Yesterday, the Blackberry end of an era. Anybody still using

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a Blackberry? Not working. Stop working. Does Roger still exist up there in Canada?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Blackberry pivoted a while ago. They no longer make phones. They now make operating systems.  They bought QNX and make operating systems for cars. But am I misremembering or is this decline

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of Blackberry tied to a really devastating patent decision? Oh, that's interesting. I think most

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  people trace it to the rise of this, of the smartphone, particularly the iPhone. Blackberry  didn't really see that as a threat. And of course it completely put them out of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now I'm really curious. I know there was something and if that thing was as catastrophic  against Blackberry as I seem to remember it being, that is an interesting thing that we  shouldn't overlook when we think about the history of what happened to this technology.  Although now I'm just throwing like random rumors out because I could be misremembering.  Here from 2006 is an article. That's what people tune in for, random speculation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's us. Random speculation are us. I do have a story though from IEEE spectrum in 2006. The story  behind the Blackberry case, a single filing with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in 1991  has caused one of the largest patent disputes in recent memory threatening to sever more than  3 million Blackberry subscribers from their wireless email service. And if I didn't have  to click yes on this cookie announcement, I would be able to read this article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we wonder why the publishers are having issues. Design your website so that they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  readable and people can actually consume your content and then start complaining if you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  still having issues. The DOJ got involved. They warned that disabling Blackberry service would  harm the public. And at this time every member of Congress, I remember I interviewed the chairman  of the FCC, Michael Powell at the time. He had a Blackberry. Everybody relied on Blackberries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember we used to manage to bez Blackberry in a part server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. I love, and that's what went down. By the way, that's what went by yesterday,  was all the Blackberry backend stuff. Again, this is behind a paywall, so I have no idea how

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  this case ended. But I'm assuming that's what you remember. I think you owe the money now

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for even having mentioned it. You know, honestly, if I say IEEE Spectrum, that's a little plug for

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  them. No, no, no, no, no, you've stolen their, it's like taking a picture in the jungle. You've

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  stolen their soul. For more information, subscribe to the IEEE Spectrum and let me know what it says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now you're giving them free publicity, so like, and they're not paying you for the ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I try to always mention not only the journal, but also the author to give the author credit,  too. I always try to do that. Sometimes I forget, but for instance. Without a system of compulsory

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  licenses guiding your behavior on this. Right. Whatever that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly. Yes. There's this guy named Jeff Jarvis. I hope he doesn't mind me invoking his name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I put this in, I think what it is, I put it in here because I think you'd like to make fun of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He thinks this emoji is a whistling emoji. Well, everybody knows it's a kissing emoji.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Only yesterday, YIL, I learned I've been using this again and again and again for whistling  incredibly inappropriately as it turns out. Wow. Seriously? You've been sending people kisses.  Well, I've been, the next tweet there, I searched and I said, oh my God, what have I done? And it  makes no sense. So I think I'm whistling, marking irony, instead I'm kissing. Now, by the way,  in defense of myself, one does pucker up and blow. That's how you whistle. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, some people can whistle through their teeth so they don't have to pucker. For future reference,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I refer you to Emojipedia where you can not only find the emoji, but you can find the Unicode  Consortium's description, the text, because they have a text description of the emojis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is like I need Clippy to explain the emojis to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You look like you're trying to offend somebody using the emoji.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me find...  Wait, somebody call a Micah Sargent.  Here it is. It says kissing face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's whistling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And right next to it, by the way, is the other one, which is face blowing a kiss,  and it has a little heart on it. So I think you, in the court of public opinion, you have failed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I screwed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like the grandma who kept tweeting FML to her daughter who said,  what? Do you know what FML means?  And it was something like, find my life jacket. I don't know.  That's not exactly the story, but it was close enough to get the gist.  LOL, lots of love.  Lots of love.  But it really was laughed out loud.  But that's not dirty. You got to have some...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was a case with a Murdoch executive and a prime minister of England,  where their text became public and LOL was used, and he thought it was lots of love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute, wait a minute. This just in,  a direct reference to the emoji, PGA, kissing face with smiling eyes,  sometimes taken to represent whistling, especially when paired with a musical note.  You needed to pair it with a musical note.  You needed to note, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If it has to come with a user manual, that's not a good emoji. I repeat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It may convey such feelings as surprise, admiration, contempt, or feigned innocence  as a person with hands in pocket, casually whistling after wrongdoing,  as if saying nothing to look at here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I'm also with Jeff. Not only is it not an effectively universal way of communicating an idea,  but it wouldn't also be how I'd illustrate somebody an emoji blowing a kiss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As Sigmund Freud once said, sometimes an eggplant is just an eggplant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's not an emoji.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I believe he said that.  Oh, it is. Obviously, you don't get enough text messages from gentleman callers,  so we won't go into that. Let's play the drums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My ignorance really is blissful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're not missing anything, Kathy. Trust me.  Let's play the music and do our Google change log. Kathy, you can ignore this.  This is just something we do. I don't know why we do it, but we do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Keep the geeks happy because we keep on talking about other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's supposed to be about Google, so here's the part of the show which is actually about Google.  Nine to five Google reports. Google is, just like everybody else,  working on AR smart glasses with a new project. That's really not a change log story, but just  it's appropriate because-  You got rid of it that way. You've managed to get it on the record.  This one's for you, Jeff Jarvis. Google is subject to new tougher supervision by German regulators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like they weren't on their ass already?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They have now officially invoked the five-year surveillance period. If you will be watching.  It was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. The nation's federal cartel office, which probably has a great German name,  which I don't know. The Watchdog can now step in earlier and ban practices it deems anti-competitive.  Google's quote, paramount significance for competition across markets and the fact that  its economic cloud is insufficiently controlled by competition prompted the ruling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not very much fun. It's the Bundeskartell-Opt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bundeskartell-Opt says, we have already started to look into Google's processing  of personal data and to deal with the Google news showcase issue.  There you go. Right there. The Google news showcase issue in more detail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So watch out Google. What is it though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kathy, you may be getting a few trips to Germany coming up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually did a semester of law school in Germany.  So that was fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you speak German?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got to a point where I could function and I won an argument with Deutsche Bahn, but then I  came home and it didn't stick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It didn't stick. But that's good. We should add that to our lower third. What an argument in  Deutsche Bahn. Google has purchased a company called, I don't know how you say it, C-Emplify  for cloud security. All the good names are taken apparently. C-Emp-L-I-F-Y.  500 million schmackers. Half a billion dollars.  So I should probably know what C-Emplify does. Something with security. Something.  Oh, I'm not in the change log section.  You're not even in the change log.  Thank you for that editorial advice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And now the Google, it was all Google. Now the Google change log. Wear OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now even longer than before. Wear OS will soon be able to unlock Chromebooks and Android phones  and tablets from your watch. Actually, that's a feature Apple has on its iPhone. And in this  day and age of masking, it's much needed. I really appreciate it. There it is. There's an  Android watch. You probably have never seen one before, but that's it. Android Automotive is  getting a YouTube app and more control over cars. I'm just going to run right through these.  If you want me to stop, if you've got any interest in any of these stories, just stop me.  Chromecast built in coming to Bose as Google works on headphone auto switching and spatial audio.  That's special. Fast pairing. We actually talked about this on Windows Weekly. This is something  Windows users are excited about. It's kind of like, I think Bluetooth LE.  Fast pairing coming to Google TV, Android TV, and all matter compatible smart home products.  So you know when you open your AirPods and the iPhone says, oh, you want me to pair with those?  It's like that. It's fast. They're also bringing nearby share and fast pair to Windows PCs.  Chrome OS is getting a quick setup via Android ability to reply to phone chat apps.  And this is also for fast pairing. That'll be, oh, that's actually, that's an important one.  You should show that one. The Pixel 6 pause. We actually, I think we scooped this one.  Not based on any info from Google. No, we wouldn't do any reporting on this,  but I read it. I saw it on Reddit. Does that count? Yeah, that counts.  You've aggregated a link. How dare you? I've aggregated a link.  Yeah, it's all ancillary copyright all the way down. The Google Pixel update,  which was supposed to come out in December, didn't. I hypothesized that it was because  the people who did get it early had all sorts of connectivity issues. Google now confirms that.  They say the December update, which has a lot of new features, it's a feature drop plus security  update plus bug fix is going to come out in the next couple of weeks. So it'll fix a whole bunch  of stuff. I got the new Pixel stand and the Pixel stand stuff doesn't work yet either. So,  come on, man. So that's coming. And they confirmed our suspicion that it was really because of  connectivity issues. Google Photos has seemingly, according to 9to5, Google removed the option  to separate video backup over cellular from photo. I don't know what that means.  Whatever that means. Google delists faulty December  20. We already said that. Android 12 January security patch has come out though for some  people at least on the 3A, 4A, 4A, 5G, 5A. Again, you poor Pixel 6 people, you're just going to have  to wait. But the security update will come with everything else all at once. But everybody else  with older Pixel phones is getting that security update. Yeah, we're on Jeff, you and I and Ant2,  we're all Pixel 6 Pro users. We're on the November security update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Yep.  Kathy, what are you carrying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm still wearing Paciently.  Are you Pac?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a Pixel, but not that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  Well, I knew you liked it. I knew you're a Pixel person.  She is quite all right.  But it's not to like a Pixel person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not an iPhone user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. She is quite all right.  Apparently, the 6s will get the update in the next couple of weeks.  And that's the Google change log.  That was nice. That was fast. That was good. I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You did leave out something though regarding the AR developments with Google.  What? Tell me.  It should have been more like they're working on this AR development for now. Because you know,  they just-  Until they stop.  Until they stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see. Do they hire all the Facebook engineers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. There's 300 people looking for somewhere to go.  Jeff, you should save this for your product of the week.  The new Lego Gutenberg printing press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is an appeal. I want everyone to go vote for this.  Oh, this is an idea.  I like this.  Now has 2,525 supporters. Everyone on- If you love me, Twiggers,  go and vote for the Gutenberg Lego press because you know it'll make me happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. They already have a thousand supporters.  Do I have to sign in?  You have to sign in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's compelling. But what's the competition?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Probably a pterodactyl or something. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it might be like that's really great, Jeff, but the other thing, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's your fault. Hey, let's pause-  I thought I liked you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just hypothesizing. I'm just hypothesizing.  You are a lawyer after all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff, when you were a TV critic, did you review Quantum Leap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can't remember. I think I might. What year was that?  Let's go to the TV guides.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Late 80s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to just log into my Lego account while we're rebuilding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have a Lego account.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We're up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, sorry, Jeff. No time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is like Jimmy Kimmel not bringing on Matt Damon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry. We've run out of time, Matt. I should start doing that.  I don't know. What do you pick some of these? I think you added all of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought that Ant might enjoy Occam's Leaf. I put that in there for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Occam's Leaf, the mystery of an iPhone. This is an interesting story.  It's kind of maybe not as good as we thought it was.  Mitch Cohen tweeted, I snapped a photo of a group of people outside today  and my iPhone with its computational photography placed one woman's head with a leaf.  It does look like that because you could see the outline of her head.  You can even see some hair here, but then there's all these leaves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Her flesh-toned face is a leaf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It kind of extends to reason with computational photography.  The iPhone is using all three lenses to compose that picture.  It might have just made a mistake.  In milliseconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In milliseconds, it even hit in the shutter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He reported this on Twitter and then got a bunch of people looking at it.  Here's a crop so you can see the photo. It does look like the iPhone has put a leaf in this woman's face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the Rorschach filter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you see a leaf?  Good call.  He submitted it to Sebastian DeWitt who created the Halide app.  Sebastian said, could you send this original image to me and any images before and after?  This is the subsequent tweet on New Year's Eve which gave us all something to do  instead of Anderson Cooper.  By the way, Andy Cohen, his co-host on that is now apologizing for his drunken outbursts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He says he was over-served.  Bring back Cathy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alleged he was over-served.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you watch it?  At one point, Andy Cohen saying, look at Mayor de Blasio dancing.  He shouldn't be dancing.  He ruined this city.  Get off of my stage.  It was wild.  Did you watch it, Jeff?  As a New Yorker, I think you'd have been...  Not live, no.  Yeah.  Pretty wild.  Anyway, back to the other Cohen, Mitch Cohen.  He says, big news.  I sent at SDW the original image.  He theorized a leaf from a foreground tree obscured the face.  I didn't think anything was in view and the closest tree is a Japanese maple, but he's right.  So he shot another video that he thinks...  I'm still suspicious, but he says this video shows that there's the leaf right there in the  getting in the way, the perspective, and that maybe the leaf was actually in the shot  and the iPhone didn't screw up.  So really, it's a ridiculous...  This is your first conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The iPhone still screwed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is your first conversation about all the consumer technology and can it be better?  In theory, this is better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It caught more detail and yet it lost something at the same time.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It did what it was supposed to do really, really well.  Not what you wanted though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Leo, I think I found two, count them two, spectacular TikToks this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, man.  So I have to apologize in advance to Cathy that somehow we've got this new thing where  we play TikToks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm telling you, you're going to thank me.  You want to do TikTok tea?  The TV reporter's mom's report of her son's temper tantrum.  Watch it through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  TikTok TEA.  Okay.  Let's watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Describe it for your audience on audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So let's put the audio on so we can also hear it.  Very well, baby.  That's the wrong one.  That's the wrong one.  Okay. Is it this one?  I guess we're not going to do TikTok tea.  Is it this one?  No, that's not it.  Well, I just clicked your link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, hell.  It didn't work.  Okay.  So try the TV.  You put this.  I screwed up.  I did.  I screwed up.  Go to the next one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now I want to know.  Don't do those.  No, don't do those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't do those.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The boot one is okay, but don't do that one.  Go to the next one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  TV reporter, moms.  By the way, part of the reason you screwed up is because you're watching TikTok on Twitter.  That is definitely ancillary copyright violation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not helping this salt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do not be watching the TikTok on Twitter.  So this is, I did see this one actually.  She's a, it's kind of sad.  She was a TV news reporter who quit her job to become a mother.  And apparently the job can't quit her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kayla Sullivan reporting live from outside my son's bedroom where he's currently being  detained until nap time is over.  Now this story does involve a minor, so I can't release specifics, but what I can confirm  is my son is a two year old terrorist who held me hostage at the Olive Garden earlier today.  It's important to note the friends I met there do not have children and likely never will.  After witnessing this situation, but authorities believe the proper precautions were taken.  I brought my son's favorite snacks and even risked judgment from other moms by bringing an iPad,  but not even Coca-Cola could have stopped this meltdown.  After several cries demanding quote,  ketchup, ketchup.  A good Samaritan waitress miraculously understood it as the English word ketchup and brought him a bottle.  Unfortunately, my son was later punished after he threw a ketchup covered fork at her.  Not all heroes wear capes, but this one should have worn an apron.  You know, these toddler outbursts are becoming increasingly common  as more and more parents try out the new craze gentle parenting and completely suck at it.  Back to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love it.  You could take that.  That was great.  You could take the woman out of the newsroom, but you can't take the newsroom.  It's also a great mockery of all television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, totally.  And she's got the voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's got it down.  She's, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was so much better than what I thought it was going to be because this just had flashbacks to  when Rudy Giuliani was mayor and he was married to the anchor woman, Donna Hanover,  and his son like made faces and behaved really poorly at a press conference.  And I thought it was going to be that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've actually, I've experienced that myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, Leo, Leo, scroll down one on the pre on the TikTok tea.  I think, I think you did that on purpose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I clicked it.  Watch, watch.  Then scroll down one.  Click on the link.  The link brings me here.  Down one.  Scroll down one more here.  Is this it?  There it is.  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, I give you TikTok tea.  She's got a tea bag.  The tea is in the tea bag.  The tea looks like tea bag looks like a shirt.  She spills the tea.  She's going through all of the tea bags now, sewing them into a mask.  Yeah.  Don't play the music.  I should take the music off.  That's a ancillary copyright violation right there.  She has made herself a TikTok tea bag shirt.  And then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That gets in a hot tub and soaks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my God.  Into tea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wasn't that worth it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wasn't that worth it?  No.  Now we're going to get taken down.  So no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's your fault.  You had the sound up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The mom reporter was much better than that one.  Oh, I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree.  It's the background music.  I think that whoever owns that music is going to be unhappy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think we're saying that the quality of that.  Well, no, that was good.  But the mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't have to suck up.  You don't have to suck up to Jeff.  It's okay.  No, everybody kicks me here.  It's what they do.  Well, you know, Dionne Warwick.  Oh, man.  Dionne Warwick.  I love her.  She's older these days and a little bit salty.  Apparently got into a Twitter battle  with Oreo cookies.  So she tweeted Oreo.  Hello.  Which, by the way, you don't have to do that on Twitter.  I just want to tell our older viewers.  What is your weirdest flavor?  What are y'all doing the most?  The one flavor was fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think if you click on that, she was commenting on a specific flavor.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now.  Wait a minute.  I just mess it up all the time today.  I just get I'm messing up today.  Twitter is not now, by the way, she's changed.  I love this.  Her Twitter profile picture to be her holding a stack of giant Oreos.  So apparently this is going on for a while.  Let me see if I can find the original tweet here.  Where is it?  Give me some direction, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, in that story, it should have been there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it wasn't.  Okay, never mind.  She's I think she's hysterical.  Oh, she's brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She likes to on the Twitter when the pandemic started her.  And I believe it's like her younger niece or somebody told her to just start.  It just started to blow up.  It's so random and so just genuine about everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's actually made her a star again.  She was, of course, famous singer.  Yeah.  She was on I don't know if you saw this Saturday Night Live impressionist that does her.  And she came on the show, which was awesome.  Let me let me see if I can get her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So her bio on on Twitter is just I am not writing a bio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not writing a bio.  Here it is.  Here's the original tweet.  Hello.  What is your weirdest flavor?  Why are you all doing the most?  The one flavor was fine to which Twitter responds.  Well, this is fun.  Oreo respond.  I'm sorry.  Oreo responds.  Well, this is fun.  Hi, everybody.  Is there a thread here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Then she came back and she said she was going to get them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The story.  All right.  Let me click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The story continues because they sent her a very aggressive flavor of Oreos.  What flavor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's like, you know, let's just leave it.  I think that that's the good categorization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  After asking Oreo to stick to the original flavor, they sent me these outrageous items  as a response.  Java chip flavor cream Oreo and Oreo flavored lip balm.  But we know about this because when it was Android Oreo, Jason and he and a company on  All About Android every week would have a new Oreo flavor and we would have the remnants  in our kitchen for days after that because no one wanted to eat Fruit Loop flavored Oreos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was in steam in the carpet from them barfing after the episode.  Oh, man.  What a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What a mess.  She says I will be retaliating in a later date.  And in fact, I think she then went on the Today show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Show.  That's what that's where they gave her the huge Oreos of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so those aren't Photoshop.  Those are real Oreos.  I think that's what the story is.  Dude, that looks so shocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think you cruise past the most important bit, which was that line,  I shall be retaliating at a later date is perfect.  That is the best line.  It's now the mantra for like everybody I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I shall be retaliating at a later date, sir.  Good day, sir.  I said good day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I said good day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  There's your Dionne Warwick update for the week.  Stacey will be back next week and we'll let her talk then about her flick buttons.  Yeah, I thought she was on this week.  She's all over the flick buttons.  She's a big fan of those.  We'll save that.  Anything else from this long list?  Poor Kathy just can't wait to get out of here, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have nothing to say about flick buttons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But Kathy does have a pick of the week.  I'm substituting for Stacey.  I got to come up with something about a flick button.  Get ready.  I want to give a little credit here because I've been worried about Wired magazine.  I think Wired magazine is going to get ready here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I read this and was underwhelmed.  You were underwhelmed.  I was actually happy.  I knew you would be when I read it.  I thought, oh, Jeff's going to love this because Wired traditionally has been techno optimists.  They've been very excited about technology.  That's why they were founded back in the early days of the internet.  Well, practically that is the 30s.  In fact, in this piece, Gideon Litchfield, who's the current editor in chief, writes,  when Wired was founded in 1993, it was the Bible of techno utopianism.  We chronicled and championed inventions that we thought would remake the world.  All they needed to be was released, unleashed.  Our cover featured the brilliant renegade visionary, mostly wealthy white male geeks  who were shaping the future, reshaping human nature, making everyone's life more efficient.  But then like Twit and everything else, the real world impinged and Wired starting to get  pretty negative, right?  It got quite negative, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Under Gideon.  Under Gideon.  I love Gideon.  Gideon's a great guy, brilliant editor, but I was worried about Wired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This tug of war between optimism and pessimism is the reason why I said this feels like an  inflection point in the history of tech, but then that term inflection point falls into  the binary trap.  He doesn't want to do the he said, she said, you know, on the one hand, on the other hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's either one extreme or another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not binary.  We have to reject this zero or one logic.  But that's when I became disappointed because instead of he just basically said, well,  we got to do both.  Which is like, Mom, fine.  Have a point of view, guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's what he comes around to, which is what I'm trying to work on these days, too,  is that pay attention instead to the big problems or I would also say the big opportunities.  And not just the technology.  How is technology being used?  And it is about human beings.  It's not about wires and silicon.  And so it could be interesting to see what he does with this.  We'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He says, we'll be critical, but not cynical, skeptical, but not defeatist.  We won't tell you what to think about the future, but how to think about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a little overboard right there.  Well, that's when I read that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How is, sounds like a publicist.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's what I was saying before.  Like we have problems.  You can't say we don't have problems, but you really need to understand them if you're  going to fix them.  So, you know, good nuance and tearing apart the issues correctly is important.  I don't know if that's what he's promising, but you could read that that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this point I do agree with.  He says our stance is neither optimism nor pessimism, but rather the belief that it's  worth persisting even when things seem hopeless.  He then says, I call it Greta Thunberg optimism.  But whatever the story, you should find something to learn from it.  And ideally the inspiration to make a positive difference yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's, you know, I'm not, I could have been a lot worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He could have said it's all crap.  The whole world's going to hell in a hand basket.  If we just turn off the internet.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, we were always juggling those.  I mean, for the last, you know, seven years, this show has been juggling.  How do we feel about it?  You've always been kind of the take the techno cheerleader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, the freedom, the cheerleader of the freedoms we have there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I've always, as a result, because I kind of agree with you, but as a result,  I've taken the opposite side just to make it a balanced conversation.  They troll me.  Yeah.  Just to troll you.  Well, that's the truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I actually, when I was at Condé, which owns Wired, at one point when mobile phones became big,  I suggested we rename it Unwired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, Wired is a very different magazine from the day it was started by Louis Rosetto.  It was kind of a kooky magazine and intentionally illegible.  That was part of the, you know, the kind of the look and feel of Wired.  It's a very different magazine.  It got to be a glossy tech magazine, which is kind of boring too.  So yeah, good.  Well, thanks for that.  Good.  No, I'm glad, actually glad you brought up.  I actually bookmarked it as well because I thought we should talk about it.  But now let's take a break.  And when we come back, picks of the week, and yes, Kathy has one.  I'm excited.  And no, it doesn't have, there's no Scott Bakula involved at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although it could be actually now that I look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Our picks of the week.  Let's give you the pride of place.  Now you're going to get me in trouble.  Can I play this?  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not your lawyer.  I can't vouch for it.  Oh, great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pass the buck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just like a lawyer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Huey Lewis in the news.  A hundred years from now.  We'll just cut it out.  Which I talk about it.  Do you love Huey Lewis in the news?  Is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do.  This usually comes up in like the first five minutes that people know me,  but you've now known me for two hours.  It's about time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're from this area.  So I'm going to assume this comes from a deep early relationship with Huey in the band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A deep early, but I'm not from this area.  I'm from New Jersey.  But yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Another reason I knew I liked you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  No, I've been a huge fan for most of my life.  Very much so.  Being a fan sort of was a vehicle for growing up.  So it was a big deal for me.  But one of the things that I was thinking about the other day is like,  I do First Amendment law.  I was going to be a journalist.  Have I always had news in my life in some form?  Is this coincidence or is this inevitable?  But I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think the band The News really had much to do with the news actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it was a great name.  And the story goes that they originally going to be Huey Lewis and the American Express,  but then they thought they would get sued.  I wonder why not.  So like on the last minute, they changed their name to the news.  It's a good name.  Here they go.  Yes, very close to my heart.  They're very important to me.  But this song has been rattling around in my head this week.  And I think it's a good metaphor.  Ain't going to matter 100 years from now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you're right.  Or another Marinite, Annie, oh, I can't remember her name,  who wrote a book basically on the premise that we'll all be dead in 100 years.  So don't worry about it.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, one of the interesting things is this new people, all new people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This song is from 25 years ago.  So we're already like a quarter of our way through those that century.  So I don't know what lesson we take out from that, but something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That actually is a really good point.  Annie Lamott is the woman I was thinking of.  She says 100 years from now, all new people.  Think about that.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeff, do you have a number?  I'm going to get you through two numbers really quickly here  because I want to get to the really, really important news.  One is that Axios reports that news consumption,  and we kind of knew this, but Axios does what Axios does well,  it has fallen off a cliff.  And once again, I put the wrong link up.  It's Axios.  I try to find the right link for Axios.  It's down farther.  It's her newsletter.  So it goes on and on.  Anyway, it's fallen off the cliff.  I said I was going to do this quickly.  This is as fast as I'm going to go through, like you go through the change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, actually, I've been interested in this because we were getting our  lunch handed to us by The Daily and Up First and all the news shows during  the COVID crisis and during Trump's four years.  It really hurt our numbers dramatically while their numbers went up and up and up and up.  And I was just, I've actually been very curious.  I notice I don't listen to The Daily and The Daily News shows as much as I used to.  I don't watch the news as much as I used to.  I'm not surprised by that, right?  Way down.  Good.  The other thing is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm glad to hear it.  Good.  What's also happening is it's so-called, and it's not a great definition, so-called  user-generated content, a phrase I've hated since the beginning, now represents 39% of  time spent with media, according to Variety.  This is why old media hate the internet.  There's a connection there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's all those people watching TikTok tea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Okay.  So now let's get past-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do we, just can I ask a point of order?  Do we, is this user-generated content?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing.  Variety definition is a little bit off.  Like they call YouTube videos user-generated content.  So on YouTube, yes, you would be that.  See, that's wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So-  Yes, it is.  I think of TikTok.  I think of Reels.  Those, that's Instagram.  Parts of YouTube are.  Parts of YouTube.  Most certainly.  Some YouTube is, but mostly YouTube is-  YouTube is also there for-  Content people now.  NBC News video.  Yeah.  But the most important story of the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now we're going to get to the one that really matters.  This is the most important of the entire show.  If you've made it this far, congratulations.  Because now you're going to learn the thing you're going to thank me for.  I'm leaving immediately after this to go get this myself.  I found out right before the show.  It's a miracle I'm actually here.  Because I should have just gone to Frater Joe's to go buy Hachio Apepe Puffs.  Miss.  Oh boy.  It's delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  News of the week.  Actually, I bet they're really good.  Yeah.  Oh, can you imagine?  I'm excited to know that there's a Slash R Trader Joe's subreddit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  My wife sent this to me.  Yeah.  Hachio Apepe.  Knowing how it would go to my heart.  It's gluten free too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So good news.  All right.  Hachio Apepe Puffs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jammer B is not going to be allowed to have them because he  didn't fix Hachio Apepe the right way and then complained about it.  So you're not allowed to have them.  What?  I'm sorry.  You're not allowed to have them.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, Ant Pruitt from Hands On Photography.  What's your pick?  What's your thing this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My pick is, like I mentioned earlier in the show, I just got the news about Canon's  CES coverage and well, CES information.  So I want to try to catch up on that.  And they're talking about Project Kokomo.  This is essentially their VR platform that they're putting together.  Still in development.  And yeah, it does mention the fisheye lenses on the R5, but there's also reports that you  don't necessarily need an R5.  You can use a Canon M200.  We know that camera all very well.  So there's a lot of meat to pick through here.  So I'm going to check that out as soon as we're off the air.  But yeah, I'm always interested in what these folks are doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, because we're not at CES this year and we're relying on coverage from people like you.  And I should mention that Father Robert, who is at CES, is going to join us on This Week in Tech  on Sunday.  Oh, yeah.  So we will get some CES news in there.  So and there is some news.  A lot of car stuff.  Yeah, car stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like the new auto show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  There's always in the North Hall was always full of cars and car accessories.  It was a whole hall always.  Maybe there's something to talk about like BMW's color changing paint.  There's an innovation life needs.  What else do you got for us, Ant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Next, since I was on vacation, I said I was going to try my best to be on vacation.  Yeah.  Watching some television and stuff like that.  So Queen Pruitt came across a movie called Vacation Friends starring L'Oreal, Howie and John Cena.  Oh, gosh.  It was so dag gum funny.  Rotten Tomatoes score doesn't say so, but that movie was so dag gum funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I actually saw the trailer for this and I thought it looked pretty good.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought it was on I think it's on Hulu.  I believe it's Hulu.  Yes.  Or you can catch it.  It's a Hulu film.  Yes.  But it is so, so funny.  But definitely check that out.  And lastly, I wanted to give a shout out to blackwomenphotographers.com.  I've been following them on Instagram and it's great seeing what they're doing to try to help  promote black female photographers and help them continue to get work in this industry.  In this household, we've talked about it a lot as far as things can be tough on me in society,  on my boys in society because of color of their skin.  But what they tend to forget is how bad Queen Pruitt has it at times.  I've seen some things with my own eyes that were just flat out wrong.  It's a double whammy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a double whammy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Absolutely.  She's a woman.  I walk in the room and things immediately change.  And I'm like, really?  That's not cool.  But I want to give them a shout out because they've been working with the likes of Netflix  and Nike and a lot of big brands and getting women, black women work in the photography field.  So kudos to blackwomenphotographers.com.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I will check it out.  Very cool.  Kathy, I want to thank you so much for putting up with us for the last couple hours.  Kathy Gellis is actually a trained professional.

Transcript:  Yeah, I've always loved Miss Georgia Dow and I was like, please, let's have a chat because  I want to pick her brain and hopefully she doesn't judge me too much on there with her  profession, psychotherapist profession and have some weird thoughts about me.

Transcript:  I want to thank Jason and and Jerebby.  Craig asked for the sound file so he could surprise his wife.  Of course he wanted it.  He's got a jingle, baby.  Who would want a jingle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In radio, it was always the kiss of death.  As soon as they got a jingle package, Leo Laporte in the afternoon, you were going to  get canceled for sure.  Guaranteed.  And it works, by the way.  It really works.  You still have your jingles?  You know, I've got to find them.  I had some really nice.  I would love to hear those.  Yeah.  Okay.  If I could find them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you have show names or just?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm trying.  It was.  There were a bunch of them.  Mostly it was just the radio stations jingle and then they would shout your name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Build your own radio station.  You've always wanted to.  Clock FM is you with Leo Laporte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
