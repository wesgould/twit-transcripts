And we are actually going to pull in people from the cloud right now, starting with Kevin  Marks, who is in the press room at Google I.O., which is going on right now.  Google Developer Conference.  Hello, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hi there. Good to see you again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Congrats on your new job with Salesforce.com.  That's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm very excited about that.  And that's the original cloud company.  So that's very excited to be working there and bringing web standards to Salesforce and  Salesforce to web standards.  That's going to be a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Poor Kevin just can't hold a job.  I mean, everywhere.  He's been everywhere.  Apple and Google and BT and now Salesforce.  I know.  My God.  Nice to have you.  He's had many lives.  And sitting right.  Career ADD.  No, it's just the way it is these days.  Sitting right next to him in the press room.  I think they can actually reach out and touch each other somehow.  We can.  Yay.  Very weird.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There you go.  That'll work.  Gina Tufani is also here.  We have a lot of fun.  SmartAware.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She's an Android developer.  So she, of course, is at Google I.O.  I'm with my people.  And I was there at the keynote yesterday.  We'll talk about that.  And of course, there's another keynote that just happened today.  We didn't cover that one live, but there's lots to talk about with that.  So we'll get to that in a moment.  But first, let me introduce the guy in square number three in our little Hollywood squares  set up, Mr. Jeff Jarvis.  The guy with the dinky little guy.  The dinky little guy.  Oh, size doesn't matter, Jeff.  It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Why is it women always say that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And why is it they always kind of laugh maniacally afterwards?  I'll never understand that.  Great to have you, Jeff.  In fact, thanks for covering.  You and Tom Merritt did the dirty work yesterday covering.  Oh, it was great fun.  It was great fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Of course, the great thing was I was going off in the stratosphere about how important  this was.  And then I remembered Wave and Buzz and Google TV.  And Tom put a proper pin in my helix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So if you watched either our stream or Google's official stream, you saw the keynote yesterday.  Again, Google did it again today at Google I.O.  And now there's breakout sessions and seminars and stuff.  But we thought we'd get together as always and talk about some big announcements from  Google.  Where should we start?  Let's recap.  Gina, maybe you and I can recap and anybody wants to chime in what happened yesterday.  It was all about Android yesterday, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.  Yesterday was Android.  Today was Chrome.  So, yeah, there's tons of stuff yesterday.  And in fact, we recorded a little bit, Leo.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I have that video.  Should I do that?  Up to you.  I wasn't even thinking.  Yeah, I have the video of it.  I'll tell you what.  Let's play it.  We will edit it in and I will play it after the show because I don't want to slow us down.  So it is about, I think, a five minute video where I talk to you, Lance Ullinoff of PC  Magazine, Ben Parr from Mashable and the Scobalizer, Robert Scobal, about their thoughts on Android.  So let's roll that right now.  Day one of Google I.O.  Leo Laporte at Moscone Center in San Francisco.  That's Android everywhere.  And Gina Tripani and I both sat in for the keynote of day one.  There's another one tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, there's another one tomorrow.  I don't know what else there could be tomorrow.  Today's was pretty great.  These are the big announcements.  It seems that way, although I don't know.  I'm a big fan of the maybe a little extra, maybe a little more tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google's much more than Android and this was all Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's true.  I mean, we'll see some Chrome focus tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So tell me what you think.  As a developer, I mean, this was aimed at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It sure was.  And I was pretty excited, I have to say.  The Honeycomb announcements, the hardware, that Arduino-based 80K, that thing looks cool.  I wanted to get my hands on that.  I'm super excited.  I mean, watch the demo, the head movement demo.  There are so many cool things as a developer.  I was like, oh, I'm going to jump in and make my Android app really awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There was a pretty clear message to developers that we're going to put Android everywhere,  including in devices and refrigerators and lights.  And there's going to be a single unified SDK that will allow developers to develop across  the board.  I mean, we'll see how that works out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Definitely.  The message today to developers was like, we're going to make great tools that let you  make awesome apps that are going to work on all kinds of devices, and they're going to  be everywhere.  And that's really, really exciting to developers.  And I'm really excited to see some of those tools and see some of the neat things you  can do with Honeycomb 3.1 and then Ice Cream Sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Google executive who led the keynote, Vic Condutra, he usually does it.  He did a very nice job, kept saying the word choice.  This seems like this is, by the way, no mention of Apple this time, no slams at anybody else.  It was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There was that one...  Early, there was an image of the Android robot eating an apple.  Okay, I missed that.  It was about 60 seconds in, it was just a visual, but that was the only...  And then there was a little genius mention around music, you know, playlist.  But no, not too many digs at Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Except that the word choice is directly in contrast to Apple's marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Big emphasis on how many devices are out there, how many activations there have been, and  That great shot of the little Android robot that everyone loves, wearing its jetpack and  just shooting up that infographic.  So a lot about momentum and a lot about choice.  Choice was the word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And finally, the biggest cheer, of course, at the end when Vic announced that all 5,000  people were going to receive the new Galaxy Tab 10-inch tablet and that it not only would  be starting with Honeycomb, but it would be running 3.1 within a week or two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Next couple of weeks, that was definitely the Oprah moment, right?  Everybody loves that.  You know, get your tablet, it's not out for another month, and everyone that's here, everyone  that's watching the livestream is jealous.  I got a dozen tweets instantly that's like, oh, enjoy your new tablet.  So yeah, developers love that.  Hey, we're gadget geeks, we love getting our hands on stuff early, not only are we getting  early hardware, we're going to get to the software early as well.  That's exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we're going to actually talk to a couple of other people, if you don't mind, who are  here at the Google I.O.  I see Ben Parr from Mashable.  Hey, Ben, how are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm wonderful, how are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's your sense from what you saw tonight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They put out a lot of new things here in one hour.  It's clear that Android is growing and that Google is not stopping with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They announced 400,000 activations a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they're at 100 million total, which is a huge number if you think about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apple, it's interesting because Apple is now starting to say, well, we don't care if we're  number one, or that's the kind of the spin that's going around.  We never wanted to be number one.  It's pretty clear that Android is now the number one handset platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In terms of pure numbers, it seems that way.  It just seems like two different strategies on how to approach the mobile and the tablet  market.  Obviously, Apple has done very, very well with its approach to tablets and phones.  And clearly, Google's done a very good job with it.  I feel like it's just a market that's big enough for two very big players.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mashable, of course, covers Web 2.0.  And the big Google Music's announcement was today, the cloud service.  They announced a year ago they finally released.  What do you think of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It seems like a very, very good service.  It's interesting that they weren't able to get the deals with the major music players  so that you could have the streaming platform.  But as a product itself, there's a lot of cool things being able to push it to different  devices.  You have all that Googliness within it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Google, it does a great job of saying what they're going to do up front.  Delivery is another problem for Google, making it happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google can be hit or miss.  You've had some major hits.  Obviously, Android's a major hit.  But if you remember a couple years ago, two years ago, here they announced Google Wave.  That was a big miss.  Last year it was Google TV.  That's still to be determined.  So it just kind of depends on which product.  Like any other company, you have some hits and you have some misses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nice to see you, Ben.  Thanks for stopping by.  Look who else is here.  Lance Ullinoff, the editor-in-chief of PC Magazine.  Hi, Lance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, how's it going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They brought you all the way out from New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I decided it was important enough to come out here.  Google's made its mark, it seems, now in every part of our lives.  Apparently, they want to go into global domination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's interesting.  Microsoft for years, their business message was windows everywhere in everything.  It seems like Google's stolen a page from that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was.  I was thinking about this sort of embedded approach.  It was like Android in everything from an exercise bike to a light bulb.  Wait a minute.  When you start giving reference designs for hardware, they can drop into anything.  So you're going to be buying stuff in the future.  You don't even know it has Android in it.  You don't even know that it works with your Android phone.  It's a very smart, very savvy move.  But of course, you've got to get the developers, you've got to get the partners in there.  They announced exactly, I think, one partner on that side.  There was a light bulb guy.  I'm like, okay, that's cool.  Nobody ever heard of.  It wasn't Phillips.  It wasn't somebody like that.  But it's a good first step.  And now we really understand their intentions.  I am a little confused.  They said one OS for everything.  What about Chrome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well, we'll find out tomorrow, I guess.  But that's been an interesting schism in Google's strategy.  They've got two OSs.  And when they push Android as heavily as they did today, you have to wonder, where's Chrome OS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm just not getting this.  And I like the Chrome browser a lot.  I use it all the time.  But I don't feel like the Chrome OS is truly an OS.  I usually feel claustrophobic inside of it.  And I almost feel like it's an experiment that's run its course.  And now, you've got to answer.  First of all, great branding with Android.  People understand it.  Look at all these robots.  And they've just broken it out.  They've broken it out of the phone and the tablet space.  They've just said, go free.  Be free.  Do all this stuff.  Be everywhere.  Be in our homes.  Be in our lives.  I think that's a great strategy.  You've got to drop Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They did answer some people's questions about openness.  They didn't say specifics, but they did say several times, open source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they said that's what they said.  Open, open, open.  Is that enough?  You know what?  What does open really mean?  I mean, you can apply any sort of meaning to that.  And when they have trusted partners or selected partners, they say, yeah, it's open.  But it'll be open right after this.  So first, we give it to the people who are our closest partners.  They do what they need to do.  Then we open it up to the world.  So open is a fungible word.  You can do with it whatever you want.  And I think that's what Google does here.  But the intention is mostly good.  Well, it's also critical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can see how you might not want open in a handset space.  But if you're going to go out in the light bulbs and refrigerators and speaker systems,  open becomes very important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, by the way, I spoke to a bunch of appliance manufacturers how to CES this year.  And that was something we talked about quite a bit because openness also refers to standards.  When you have openness, you have no standards.  And appliance manufacturers absolutely want standards that they cannot agree on.  And there's no good standard right now.  No, there isn't.  And this is why we don't really have smart appliances.  Why they are not, in fact, talking to each other.  Could Android become that platform?  Could it become that subsystem?  If they can get to Westinghouse, Slovenia, all of these guys and convince them to march down the path.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Lance, it's great to see you.  PCmag.com.  Got to come back on Twitter soon.  Take care.  Hey, look who else is here.  Robert Scoble.  I'm surprised you're not overplaying on that giant labyrinth game.  That's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tell us about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's a life size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they're building these hardware controllers that are built on Android.  And so your phone or your tablet can talk to these new hardware controllers and control machines and physical machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know you and I both last year bought Google TVs hoping and really I disconnected mine.  I don't know about you.  They announced today that they'll be running 3.1 and Honeycomb 3.1 and the App Store, the market Google Marketplace would be available on these devices.  That make a difference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not to me anymore.  I, you know, I'm an iPad user and I'm using AirPlay to push the videos from my iPad onto my TV through Apple TV and Apple TV is 99 bucks.  The Google TV is still 300.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's too expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't recommend it to my friends because it's too expensive and it doesn't do what the Apple TV does.  Everybody loves that AirPlay.  And if they have an answer to that, that's interesting.  But so far they haven't really demonstrated that connected system yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It feels like Google's playing catch up to Apple.  At least on tablets it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now on handsets, you know, they're like you said, they're number one in numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So if you're a developer, now you're not, but put yourself in the mind, and you talk to a lot of developers.  Is the message today compelling enough for a developer to say I might either abandon iOS or do a dual platform strategy?  No, dual platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely.  The major, you know, you see Angry Birds, it's on every...  Yeah, you have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you're big enough, the problem is not most developers don't have the resources to do both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's really telling.  You were at South by Southwest.  I saw about 30 apps there, new apps, only one of which was shown to me on an Android device.  I spoke at the Wear 2.0 conference.  I asked how many people here have Androids?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's surprising since location and Google seem to go hand in hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The top apps, the top development tools are still on Apple, and they didn't answer that.  They also didn't talk about social.  We're all wondering, you know, what are they going to do with that plus one thing?  What are they going to do to keep Facebook from taking over search eventually?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That might be tomorrow, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I just talked to Rohit.  He was just standing behind you, who runs, who's heavily involved in the social team.  He says, no, coming the summer.  There's a scoop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One other story that broke this morning.  Microsoft just down the road having a press conference announcing that they have bought Skype for $8.5 billion.  Your thoughts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's funny because I told Bomber and Sonovsky and Gates to buy it in 2004.  They all wrote me an email that I have.  I'm trying to get it back on my blog, but it says business value 13 times.  It says no business value.  They've changed their tune.  They've changed their tune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Big business value if it's $8.5 billion.  How much of this has to do with their ownership of a stake in Facebook?  Do you think that this is partly for Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think it has much to do with Facebook.  I think they're getting attacked by Box.net, Salesforce chatter, VMware has something coming out in a week.  They're getting hit in the enterprise, and they need to have other ways to hook you in and keep you on a Microsoft office platform, an enterprise platform.  And Skype is a huge piece of that.  We're all on Skype.  That's a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Robert Scoble, thanks.  Rackspace.com and Building 43.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep, Building 43, the center of the Internet.  That's where Larry Page and Marissa sit.  Thank you, Robert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nice to see you.  Nice to see all the people here.  5,000 developers, day one at Google I.O.  The message is Android Everywhere and choice for Android users and, of course, the big sell to developers.  It's a platform you want to develop for.  We'll find out what they announce tomorrow at day two.  I imagine it'll be Chrome OS Search and more.  Back to the studios and this week in Google.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  OK, we rolled it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now.  Beautiful.  Now we're back.  The magic of editing.  We're back.  And so it was all about Android.  They did say some things I think that were pretty important, including Kevin.  And I imagine you were of interest as a developer, a third party developer for Android.  They reinforced the fact that Honeycomb and all androids are open.  Yes.  And that answered the question I think a lot of people had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I missed the Android.  I think Gina went to that.  So I didn't get all the details there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because Andy Rubin was actually in the press conference, not in the keynote.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Weirdly, he was never on stage.  I was surprised about that.  But he was available to journalists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did he reinforce what they said on stage that they intend to keep Android open and to offer people the source code soon?  Well, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I didn't make it to the fireside chat, although Eileen tweeted something that it was really fireside because it was like the questions were filled with fire, sort of being shot at the Android team, which made me laugh.  So now Honeycomb isn't going to go open source, but Ice Cream Sandwich is going to combine Gingerbread and Honeycomb and all of the other things.  Gingerbread and Honeycomb.  And that will be their unified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they were never going to release the source of Honeycomb?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  From what I hear, no, they're not going to release that source, which is kind of interesting.  So Honeycomb 3.1 is coming out in the next few weeks.  We're going to get that on our tabs.  That's got some cool stuff, resizable widgets, and it's going to be a USB host.  You can plug in a bunch of things.  They had a demo on stage of someone with an Xbox controller plugged into a Honeycomb tablet playing.  Cordy, is that the name of that game?  Which is kind of cool.  That was really cool.  Yeah, it was really cool.  But Ice Cream Sandwich, we're looking at Q4.  And yeah, I mean, that's the one OS that's going to run everywhere.  That's what the really cool demos are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I think they said, in effect, they're saying, we kind of, Honeycomb was kind of a botch.  We're not going to release that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it's kind of this weird fork of like, oh, we just need to get a tablet out.  But Ice Cream Sandwich is really where it's at, man.  That's really the message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I should explain a gloss a little bit.  You said, our tablets.  They handed out to developers, to the 5,000 developers in the keynote, these Samsung 10.1-inch tabs, which aren't out yet.  They're special edition.  They have on the back, they have little Android guys.  And these are, this is a dual processor tablet, kind of almost a reference design at this point for what the Android tablets look like going forward.  Today, they handed out to CR, well, not CR-48s, but Chrome OS laptops.  Chromebooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So they're calling them Chromebooks now.  Yeah.  There's Ken.  They didn't hand them out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's mine.  Running the music app.  They didn't actually hand out the Chromebooks.  They gave us, they said, we'll send you one in June.  They announced that the Chromebooks, Chrome OS will be coming out in June 15th from Acer and from Samsung at a price point of $350 to $450.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's get to that in a second.  I want to finish the, there's so much to say.  Yeah, there's a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Lots of stuff.  I think there's some big implications to what they're doing, too.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they basically look to me like Android everywhere.  In fact, you heard Lance Yulanov liken it to Microsoft's strategy of some years ago, Microsoft Windows Everywhere.  Android everywhere, except the desktop.  They're still reserving that for Chrome OS or Windows or Macintosh.  But they want to see Android on, for instance, Android at home, on home appliances, on lights.  That's where it finally comes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that was interesting.  That's the net of things, right?  Finally arrives.  Yeah.  And what's beautiful about it is it's so much the opposite strategy of what Apple can do.  Is Apple going to allow something to connect to your refrigerator or stove if it's not Apple branded?  No, Google's willing to control anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's been an issue.  You know, anybody who's looked at home automation and we've been all waiting for a standard.  The problem is there was one called Z-Wave, but these are all small companies promoting these standards.  And there wasn't enough weight behind any one standard for it to get a grip.  I would have loved it if Google had gotten behind Z-Wave, which is already kind of out there.  They are in the same frequency.  They didn't.  They've created their own standard.  But I guess because it's Google, it has a shot.  And it is something I think we want.  You need a standard.  You need a platform.  So what Windows did for computing, Google has an opportunity to do that for automation, for network everywhere, for intelligence everywhere.  That right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it looks that way.  The demos were the two home automation demos were kind of interesting.  One was, you know, the lights would in the house would kind of, you know, would get really bright when you shot someone in a game,  kind of cool, but also a little weirdly impractical.  The other one was they had CDs like music CDs with with theoretical NFC tags on them and they would tap it to the Android device and it would know what the album was.  And then you tap it again and it would just start playing the music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Never gonna happen.  It's never gonna happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, what's the point of having the CD to begin with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like the idea because if you have a CD collection, you can tap it on the Android and you don't have to download it.  But that's not gonna happen.  And even with them, I'm uploading right now my music collection to the music player.  You have to upload them.  They will not do that.  They could do it.  That automatic recognition.  But Michael Robertson got his pants suit off with MP3.com doing the same thing.  And I don't think anybody's going to take a chance of doing that again since he did lose that case or he settled that case.  Right.  We interviewed him a couple of weeks ago and he said, you know what?  They would not have won, but we just couldn't afford to fight Universal Vivendi.  But he says he I wish he'd pursued it because we would have a very different world if you could just kind of wave your CDs at something and say, OK, I proved I have it.  Now just put it in my cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But Leo, I think it was a shot across the bow.  If you look at where they're going here, you know, we were saying yesterday during the presentation that where's the store?  Where's the store?  Well, maybe there's never a store.  Maybe Google's proper role is you got it.  We'll organize it.  We'll organize it for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I have to say I like this because on a portable device, look, I've got all these I've got all these CDs now, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So in that sense, I think what they're saying is if you bought it anywhere, you should be able to organize it here.  Right.  And I think they'll argue that they're trying to encourage buying.  You know, one could one could fight that, but fine.  And you know, you look at the report today about social, they're looking to do the same thing with social where where what I said yesterday was that Google's still not connecting people.  But but the Internet is the connection machine.  And if they can similarly have a layer atop the Internet that and the cloud in your space that organizes what you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, there is there's definitely buying in here.  You know, if you play an artist, you can see more by artists.  You can you can, you know, in theory, you can.  It seems like I saw by this at some point, maybe it points to Amazon.  Yeah.  Why should Google get in the music business?  I like the functionality of this, especially since this is first generation.  I think that the potential for this is is great.  And I am currently uploading.  I've uploaded four hundred sixty three of my six thousand and eighteen songs, but it does it automatically.  I don't have to think about it.  I mean, it's it's annoying that it has to do that.  But I just downloaded the free program.  It's running on where my iTunes is.  It says you want me to upload the iTunes, all the iTunes music.  I said, yeah, put it all up on the cloud.  And it's free for now. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The beta is US only and free for now.  And invite only.  And invite only. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So don't all come yelling at me that you don't have it yet.  What will happen is you'll get a little a headphone.  The icon changes on the music player from a speaker to a headphone.  Look at this, though, these all these artists, they're not on the phone.  They're all on my cloud, which is kind of cool.  So, I mean, there is there is some real advantage to this.  I mean, it's on all my Android devices now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. And it does some some smart caching that, you know, music that you've listened to, it tries to guess what it should cache so that you can keep listening to it offline.  I haven't had a chance to play with it a whole lot. My Internet connection at the hotel is awful.  So I wasn't able to upload any of my songs after quite some time.  I'm excited to go home and do that. But you'll be able to try on the plane home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You'll see how it works. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. See how well the offline the offline component works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is interesting because it isn't you're right. It's not a business for Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, Jeff, what's your theory that that Google, whether it opens a store or not, it wants to be the place to organize your stuff.  Right. They're going to organize the organized the world first.  I can organize you and that if only you could waive the CD, you know, why shouldn't you be able to work that you own it?  Right. And Google could probably protect it better and say that we verify this person owns this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I would love to see them do that. That would be absolutely incredible if they did, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that's just a theory. But, you know, as I said, I thought wave was going to be huge, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, man. I think this is pretty compelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's different from what Amazon's doing because it's not tied to a store.  It does just go, you know, you just basically you run this music player on your desktop and it's going to copy everything over.  I think I think it's kind of interesting. I don't know what they didn't say when they're going to make this available to not by non invitation, but I presume it'd be fairly soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, the wholesale on this right was no wires, no painful sinking.  Right. And that's definitely a shot at that iPod iTunes, you know, connect sync.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, by the way, when I go to music player, it launches it in Chrome.  And of course, this is also something for Chrome OS that you need because you don't have much storage on these Chrome.  Right. Absolutely. Yeah. And they showed you on that as well. Yeah. Yeah. So that makes that makes sense there.  I don't know. I like this. I think this is about what you'd expect from Google. It's probably a little more polished than Google TV.  That was some of the some of the other news we got yesterday was that Google TV will have ice cream sandwich three point one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Am I right? Is that three point one? What is ice cream? Honeycomb is three one actually. There is not a version number for ice cream sandwich yet.  So I'm not sure if that's going to be four or what. But Google TV is going to get the Android market.  And I believe it was my notes or it's going to get honeycomb three one. That's what I thought, too. Three one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is that going to rescue Google TV? Are you going to bring back? I'll take I'll dust it off. It's sitting in a closet right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Three hundred dollar write off. If I can if I could put Angry Birds on it and play it on my TV.  I mean, I've got a keyboard with the Logitech one with it's got a trackpad. It's like a computer.  I think that's pretty interesting. I'll tell you one thing I noticed immediately, though, on this tablet is the is there aren't a lot of honeycomb apps.  And while all the apps run, only a handful of them run and take advantage of the real estate.  You know, if you run Angry Birds, it does fill up the screen.  But it but you can see some scaling issues a little bit with it.  You know, that stuff's not vector graphics and and look, it's got big buttons in the bottom and stuff like that.  So Gmail Gmail is pretty awesome. Gmail does a nice job.  But this is Google writing for right. Of course.  Although, interestingly enough, and this will come out with three point one, this Gmail widget doesn't stretch.  It doesn't resize. Yeah. That was such a big deal.  And people made a big deal out of that. But look, this is the this was not worth applause.  Yeah. Isn't it funny? I guess people really wanted that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, I thought it was interesting that developers clapped harder at the announcement that the Open Handset Alliance would be enforcing guidelines about that's huge now.  Yes, much harder at that than, you know, Google Music, which was a consumer product shipping yesterday.  That was a really big announcement, I thought the 18 month guidelines, you know, for shipping out the latest version of Android of hardware allows, you know, really trying to address the fact that you can issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So every phone contract is 24 months and they're going to guarantee that you'll get the latest right before your contract expires.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They don't care about you the last six months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right before your contract expires. All right, we'll give you the latest version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wonder whether that was what the what the telcos wanted.  It's the ultimate and planned obsolescence. You know exactly when it's obsolete. 18 months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good point. Why? Why give them such a big window?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a long time. The truth is, I'm behind now anyway, because I don't get the updates of the of the damned OS's.  It's really irritating. That's that's that's a problem with Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I agree. Yeah, yeah. The open accessory stuff was was pretty cool.  What's that? Tell us about that. Android open accessory like the first of all the 80 K.  I mean, this entire conference is just filled with their bait.  And my my my first bit of nerd bait that really got me was this Arduino based 80 K, which is a which is a hardware development kit for being able to connect anything to Android via USB initially and then Bluetooth later.  And being able to just, you know, add peripherals and program this board to to interact with with Android.  That was that was really cool. Android. That's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I don't think that they nearly speculated enough about what that could do.  It really does become, as I said earlier, the net of things.  And you can use that 80 K to control, you know, a lawnmower or a your stove or refrigerator or, you know, eventually a car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they had a giant labyrinth game, actually, as a Scott, I was pissed at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That was a waste of money. I wanted to get in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They wouldn't let people in it. Oh, you want to stand on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I wanted to stand on it. The the the exercise equipment demo was pretty good.  The stationary bike, you know, you plug in your Android and then you play this game where if you pedal faster, you know, you keep you keep the little robot above.  So, I mean, that that was really neat, like fitness, fitness equipment.  I thought was a really good sort of demo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I think there's no question in my mind that if Google sets a standard and there's home automation standard, it all works with Android.  It all developers can write hardware interfaces for Android devices.  This is all good. The question really is, will people adopt?  Will they you have to get critical mass to make this work? Right.  And will that happen? Kevin, do you have an opinion on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think, you know, we're all this is the thing I was said about the two halves of Android in that all the little consumer electronic devices are running Android.  They're starting to see that happen.  And we're going to see more and more of that because it's easier than writing their own firmware and they can just deploy some release of Android onto that.  And they don't have to go into the deal with Google and try and run Gmail and the rest of it.  They can they can just run the OS and use that.  But if if sort of that set of developers can then plug to the sort of the phone like a tablet like devices that we expect as well, that starts getting very interesting because it is it means we've got this.  We've got we've got a shared OS, which is somewhat interesting, but also we've got a whole set of standard communication stacks that you can go back and forth with.  So you've got USB stack, you got a Bluetooth stack, you got a Wi-Fi stack so they can all communicate over those and find each other.  So the challenge is going to be can they make it straightforward?  Can they make it as easy to use as buying everything from Apple?  And that hasn't been really true of DNA and the things that have been deployed previously.  But there's some potential for that to work there.  And we're starting to see sort of bits and pieces of that interoperating.  And let me ask you a question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Each of your developer types, if you know, because the interesting thing to you, too, is it brings in a new hardware, it brings in a new developer community, the hardware developer community.  If you were going to launch a device tomorrow using Kickstarter and somebody else's manufacturing using this ADK, what's the craziest thing you can think of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's good.  You got robots.  Don't you understand anything?  Oh, my God.  It's an entire floor full of robots outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Everything's full of robots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They had a flying car there last night as well.  Yeah, did they?  It didn't actually fly, but it was a car that had previously flown.  It could fly if you all clapped your hands and wished hard enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I want a remote controlled jetpack so I can strap it on Kevin and fly him around this press room.  All Android powered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kevin, I know you're sitting right next to Gina, but if she says anything about strapping anything on, just move a little bit farther away.  I'm sorry.  Oh, you know the ADK conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There was immediate like sex toy discussion amongst the mic.  That's where Jeff was going.  You got just out with the perverts.  I don't know, but it was like, yeah, get that.  I think I got in early on that tweet.  Yeah, I was definitely the Android powered vibration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, there is somebody made a French kissing remote control French kissing machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You saw that right in the news.  I didn't.  How does that work?  You kiss the thing and then the thing transmits what you're doing over the internet to a receiver, which then kisses the other person.  That's real.  But OK, so let's not talk about that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What else could you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I feel weird.  I feel dirty.  It's very weird.  I'm sorry I brought that up.  Well, I think you could do you could you could you could program a imagine if you didn't just get a recipe, but with the recipe came a routine for your oven to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm stretching here, but you know, that's what we want to do.  Right.  What all what all could you do if things were controlled?  As somebody said, you know, forget the the Mondo remote controls and all that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  That's what that's been heading toward death anyway.  Well, that's the stuff is cool, but it's all kind of the same.  I mean, I think it's a little bit of a different thing.  I mean, I think it's a little bit of a different thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But that's the stuff is cool, but it's all kind of toys.  And so I just think it's smart for Google to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you just sketch it out and build it, you obviously then go and get it manufactured.  But the point was, you can you can you can use the Arduino stuff.  That piece is fully open source as well.  So you've got open source on both sides.  I do.  We know that their stuff is Java issue, too.  So there's a lot of sort of shared knowledge.  You can you can go back and forth.  So I think that was that was like, oh, you know, a thousand child hobbyists just got interested.  You know, here's what I'd do if I were Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'd say that you do a contest that whoever manages to get to a certain level with a device on Kickstarter, Google will invest some huge amount of money to to license and manufacture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, we're going to end up having a coffee pot in Cambridge.  Yeah, it makes coffee.  It's like 20 years later.  All we did is we improved it so you could actually make the coffee instead of just that will be an espresso machine and you can make it decaf or not.  Maybe maybe Apple has the right idea, which is like making products people actually want and can use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What? I just want the cool stuff, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Forget what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google makes stuff for geeks.  Yeah, that's a point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's a point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was talking to Dan Gilmore and he said, OK, I've got an Apple TV.  I've got an Android.  How do I remote control one with the other?  And you can't at the moment.  There's like a double twist has just hacked in sending music from one to the other.  But they have to reverse engineer Apple's protocol.  So who knows how long that will last?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But truthfully, come on, you got a choice between Apple TV and Google TV.  Let's leave out Roku and some of these other guys.  But say Apple TV, Google TV, which one do you buy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I bought Apple TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but you can control the Google TV with your Android phone.  Does that change it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd like to control the Apple TV with my Android phone.  No, no, you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have an it comes with a remote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which I've lost on the back of the sofa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I have to use the if you had an iPhone, you could control it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Well, I use the iPod to control it.  But that's exactly the problem.  It's not open. I understand.  But but but but it could be, you know, they could they.  But what I've seen from Apple is that they're going the other way.  If you plug your Android phone into the Mac, it launches I photo, but it hides the photos from you.  That used to work. Right.  There is a USB folder on there that has it's called DSIM and has the photos in the number.  It's the same way that every other damn phone on earth has.  But iPhone is deliberately handing out the Android one.  So that's, you know, I'm cautioned.  And so I think Apple is playing with this to say, OK, can we make this feel a little more awkward for you?  As opposed to can we make our one feel better?  You know, maybe it's just a bug, but it's a bug they could fix and they probably deprioritized.  What else did what other what other Android news is there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So ice cream sandwiches coming later this year that will unify the two platforms.  Three point one, which is a fixed honeycomb.  And after using honeycomb for a little while, I could see why they might want to fix it.  Will come out soon. I mean, honeycombs in.  I don't know. What what what do you what do you what do you think, Gene?  I mean, this is the first time I've spent a lot of time playing with honeycomb.  I had the zoom for a little while.  It just doesn't. Yeah, I mean, that's how it is.  Really cool. It's a nice tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a good way. The power button is in a sensible place.  Maybe really look at honeycomb again and get like, oh, this is, you know, this is something I'm kind of excited about.  Right. It really felt half baked on the zoom.  I think one of the things the things that I was really excited about yesterday was the open GL head tracking demo.  And I actually think this is ice cream sandwich.  I don't think that this is honeycomb, but the ice cream sandwich could recognize the head movement and sort of adjust the perspective on on screen, which is really cool.  That was really cool. Yeah.  And it could recognize facial features so it can change the eyes and the mouth and the nose.  And then the video and I thought this would be really exciting to you, Leo.  The video chat with where, you know, two people are in front of an eyesight and a microphone and one is talking and Android knows who's talking and who's talking.  And one is talking and Android knows who's talking and zooms out on that face and gets close and the other person starts talking and it knows to shift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  As Kevin knows, though, most business video conferencing software does this already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's business. That's business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's expensive video. The point is they just commoditize something again.  Right. Yes.  It's like they did with the mapping stuff. The mapping stuff is like, oh, there's all these cool things with mapping.  If you buy this device and subscribe to it and Google's like, OK, we software we've done that.  Right. And so they're doing the same thing with this video stuff.  And that makes sense. Suddenly, you don't have to buy special cameras and fret about it.  Video conferencing. You can just pick up a couple of these things and wave them to each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And so here's your question. Can you do Kinect in two ways?  One, can you not have a Kinect device and use this to make your own games like Kinect?  Or second, can you use the Kinect hardware without anything else and hack it into this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the demos were Kinect like, but they weren't doing it with the infrared thing.  They were doing it with the camera.  So it wasn't as they weren't doing a smooth job as Kinect does of representing you on the screen.  They were just tracking the guy, moving his head and moving a 3D thing with that.  So obviously, they're edging towards that, but they didn't say that we're using the sensors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, here's where I think it comes.  The new UI, right? It's put that there.  Imagine this, you're sitting on your couch and all you have to do is start swiping your hand and you move things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, as somebody who has used Kinect to play games a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No good on the swiping. You don't like the swiping?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's too much freaking work.  It's a lot of calories burn.  It's fine if you're dancing and you're already standing up.  I don't know. I'm not sure that people really want to do this.  It's so easy just to do a mouse. I don't know.  I mean, but I'm glad. Look, I'm glad they're trying stuff and you need to try stuff to see what's going to work, what's going to stick and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I was doing a presentation at CodeConf last month and I didn't have the clicker for my keynote slideshow and I was like, gosh, I wish I could just go like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe I'm cynical because I've seen this for, I can remember 11 years ago on tech TV, we had, we demonstrated lamps that you turned on by voice.  Right.  And, you know, it's a great demo because I can remember Jim Latterback standing there going, tech TV lamp on.  Tech TV lamp on.  Tech TV. Yeah.  Yeah, the clapper.  It's just, you know, the switch works pretty well. The keyboard works pretty well. The mouse works pretty well.  It has to be 100%. It has to be. I mean, look, you know, I'll agree.  The touch interface works.  That's intuitive. You grasp it immediately.  This pinching, the zooming, the swiping does work.  So it is possible to come up with new interfaces that work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I'll tell you a funny story. I walked into the Moscone Center the other day early to register and to register for the conference.  They have all these CR 48 laptops laid out with barcodes. So you see barcode scanners.  So you scan your, you know, to get your ticket and I walk up to one and it's got this screen with a green button and I touched the screen of the CR 48.  And nothing happened. And then I went, oh, and I grabbed the barcode scanner.  But it was interesting because it was representative of this like big general conflict that I have as a developer being here and doing day one Android and day two Chrome is like, what do I develop for?  I don't know. They're both so cool. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Android. Android. Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, Android was day one. Yeah, I wouldn't develop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if you develop on the web, it runs on Android. That's, you know, you may have developed for both or decided to do both.  Or decide which one makes most sense.  I mean, the other thing we're seeing is that a bunch of people are using HTML for the UI and then some app plumbing to some other bits and pieces.  So you still want to use HTML because it's flexible and you can change it quickly to do the sort of broader UI.  But then you want to if you're doing some specific control of something else, then you go to the native thing.  And the stuff they were showing today with accelerated canvas and accelerated GL was pretty impressive stuff for web dev.  It wasn't like, oh, this is this is clearly creaky web stuff.  It's it looked good and looked like it was working well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And as anybody who watched security now last hour knows, WebGL has been hacked and in fact, or maybe has been hacked.  V.U.P.E.N. company has claims to have a hack that allows you to get by all of the sandboxing and own a computer through WebGL.  So the more of these technologies they build in, the more difficult it's going to be to secure these things also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, that's always been the case, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. I admire. I know I have to I have to say, yeah, play with your tablet.  I have to say this whole time, Kevin has just been like with the tablet.  I know. I know. The maps look great on there.  I'm still here. Yeah, you know where I am.  Is that that's latitude. Yeah, you know where I am.  Kevin and I are the only people who actually use latitude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's true. I've got three or four others here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They were there. It's kind of it's kind of a you know, it's fun.  I don't need to. My iPhone does it for me. Oh, shut up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just shut up. So you could you have to turn on.  Let's see. I'll turn on the latitude layer and then I will see where Kevin is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, I know where he is. But I think it thinks I'm in Las Vegas at the moment, apparently.  We hit my location and he goes, I got confused.  I think I'm using like my laptop as Wi Fi.  So it's got very confused about where I am. No, it's I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I see where you are. You're you're you're not where you are.  You're not where you are. You're you're at home.  Oh, really? You're in Menlo Park, it says.  I wonder if I can update that. And it says 16 minutes ago you were there.  So I don't know what the hell is going on. It does have a jet pack.  It says you're at SRI. It says 15 minutes ago you were at SRI.  Oh, you know why, Kevin? You probably have other devices with latitude on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think I think what it is is we're on some shared Wi Fi here.  It's doing by Wi Fi rather than by that could be a location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that's actually where the Wi Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is where the Wi Fi companies things live when they're not at I.O.  That's cool. I like that.  I can wake it up on this one. Maybe this will this will be smarter about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You probably have to turn on the GPS and all that stuff, too.  I think it's I think this is very close to being a an iPad competitor,  but it's the software doesn't feel as mature and the lack of apps.  I mean, I downloaded every app I could find that actually takes advantage of it.  Interestingly, the Kindle app, while it's not designed for this, does kind of was pretty good.  It does a very nice job of, you know, making it easy to read and things do scale better on Android than they do on the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you get a previous that I'll grant you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll grant you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. And in the sessions, I mean, the sessions are all about developers make quality apps be aggressively compatible,  take advantage of the new the new capabilities of honeycomb and ice cream sandwich.  But and make your apps compatible for all kinds of different screen sizes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the new development kit will do that kind of more automatically.  Yeah, there are more there are more developer tools that make that easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And and they're kind of pushing this agreement to update devices a little faster as sort of a motivation for developers to update their apps faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. Are you hearing any buzz from developers there are things that besides the applause meter seem to excite them or or they started to think about what they want to develop to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Everyone that I've talked to has been sort of had the same sort of Android versus Chrome conflict that I've had.  Honestly, the energy level here has been really high.  I mean, I feel like people are super excited.  I mean, this is like this is Vegas for geeks.  I mean, Google gets geeks and they just they know how to present and give developers stuff that they want.  So I've I've just sense a lot of really, really high excitement about about everything.  The Arduino definitely got great got great reception.  Reception and the Chrome the Chrome keynote today also went really well.  We should probably maybe talk about that a little.  Let's take a break.  We will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was I will.  I was just playing with this is the Google body, which has been optimized for the tablet.  And that's that's really cool.  I don't know if it's there's your there's your brain.  This is Gina's brain.  And if I zoom in, there's your vascular system.  It's kind of cool.  It's kind of an interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have enough veins to go around the globe three times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's take a break from Google I.O. in San Francisco at the Moscone West Center.  It's Gina Trapani and Kevin Marks joining us.  Jeff Jarvis is back home in New York.  I'm in the Twit Cottage and we will have more news from Google and the Google verse in just a bit.  But before we go much farther, let me talk a little bit about our friends at Squarespace.com.  The secret behind exceptional websites.  You know, we talk about the web and just kind of with the assumption that you're there, you're participating.  And I guess we really shouldn't assume that if if if you've got a Facebook page or your Twitter account, you're not completely there yet.  You need your own home page.  You need a place where you live.  And the easiest way to do this, the most secure way to do this is Squarespace.  No, not her, not her, not him.  Squarespace.com.  Squarespace.com.

Let's today's I think we covered Android.  Today's keynote was about Chrome and they announced these.  Well, aren't they just really netbooks, Gina?  I mean, isn't that really what they're what they're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hate speech.  Using a line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't it just really a netbook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a netbook that boots up in seconds that updates itself and that gets everything.  I like the way they I think some are referred to regular operating systems like Windows or I guess OS 10 as well as these like legacy decisions.  You know, we've got these layers and layers of software on our computers and we don't need them anymore.  They built it from the ground up.  So so it's a it's a machine that boots up instantly is is secure by default and updates itself.  Right. So I mean, that's a that's a pretty good idea.  It's a good promise.  And they announced they added a few things they've got a neat they've got a media player so you can play music and movies.  They also took one on Android.  What I think is one of Android's best features on Android.  You know, there's that share menu.  So as an app developer, you can hook into the share menu so you can be in one app and then hit share and send it to another.  Well, this is going to have something really similar.  You can build web service like file handlers into Chrome OS so you can be you know, they've got this new file browsing system in Chrome OS now.  And you can say, hey, for all my doc files, add this little button that says send to Dropbox, which is which is super nice.  You may hook into web services, not just Google Web Services and handle that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I'll be able to use Dropbox for storage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, you'll be able to send stuff to Dropbox.  You'll be able to edit different kinds of files and different web services, which is which is which is huge for sure.  And full full jailbreaking built in.  They made it clear that they were encouraging developers to jailbreak and that their partners wouldn't like that.  But they were doing that anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They say it's jailbreak ready.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which of course got great reception.  In fact, they showed a video that was really, really, really great about, you know, throwing your Chrome OS notebook in the river.  And then, you know, you'll still you don't lose a thing.  Everything is just in the cloud.  But don't throw it in the river.  But if you do, everything will be OK.  And then there was this incredible presentation by the Angry Birds guys or one particular guy who had a sweatshirt, which I was coveting.  It was a red sweatshirt with an Angry Bird, the red bird face on it, and announces that Angry Birds in the Chrome Web Store and immediately loses everybody in the room.  You could play in the browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In the browser.  Yeah.  Is that HTML5?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's awesome.  Yeah.  They said they were using WebGL and falling back to Canvas if your browser doesn't have WebGL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I wonder how it works in Canvas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it was looking pretty responsive.  I was trying to run it on here, but this net connection wasn't being happy about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's free?  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's free and they sell you Mighty Eagles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I've spent many, many, many dollars on Mighty Eagles.  So it's really not free.  Far from it.  I did it without that.  Shut up, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The 95%-5% cut was a big thing for developers as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the Chrome Store, they'll take 5%, that's all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's it.  That's network theory.  That's how you grow networks to be huge.  Wow.  Right?  The less you take, the bigger the network, the more the network is worth.  Wow, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's not really competing with Apple.  That's competing with PayPal, right?  PayPal charges you around 4%.  It varies because it's a fixed fee per cent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How is it not competing with Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because this is on the web, it's on Chrome.  So it's basically web development.  It's a way of payment mapping.  Apple doesn't sell, well, Apple does sell apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Apple has the App Store.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you can't do it with a web app.  Apple is like, it's a physical thing on a physical device.  You're buying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, but Kevin, the wall between apps and the web is going to disappear, no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think users really know or care, do they?  Maybe they do.  If I could put Angry Birds in my browser, what's the difference between Angry Birds from the  Apple Store and Angry Birds in my browser?  It's the same thing.  So it's going to be, the difference is de minimis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't understand why the battery power isn't like 24 hours.  It's less than my MacBook.  I don't understand why it's not free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The machine.  Yeah.  The machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It seems expensive.  Well, that was the other thing they announced.  Did you see that they announced for 28 bucks a month, they'll like rent you it and do a  full service business.  Including hardware updates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what's really interesting.  Now comes a subscription machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do I get free internet access too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.  That wasn't quite clear.  Maybe you get that 100 megabytes a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's probably what you get is the kind of minimal internet access, but something.  And I think for a lot of people.  That's for enterprise sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's that's if the company buys, I think, and number, you not only get the machines you get and the contract to replace the hardware, upgrade the hardware, but you also get other functionality, I think, to manage your network.  If you're a student, 20 bucks a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  20 bucks a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Students are in the best shape of all to use this because they do have Wi-Fi all over campus.  You bet.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they lose laptops like fiends.  So this is a great solution.  You know, it's funny when when Abby arrived at college, they rent you a bike.  Same idea, because your bike's gonna get stolen anyway.  So might as well just rent it to you.  They're just like community bikes around campus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Basically, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When I dropped Jake off, I made the mistake.  If I told the story or not, I was moving something around the room and the bookcase fell and cracked right into his roommate's brand new machine.  Oh, no.  I was off at Best Buy that night frantically buying him a new machine.  Oh, my God.  Oh, for Chrome.  Chrome will look very cheap right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No kidding.  So and do these are they attractive?  Do they look like I mean, the picture I'm looking at, I don't know if this is better.  This year.  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's very black.  Oh, it's horrible.  Yeah, they look they look pretty pretty shiny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you guys don't have yours yet, so you can't hold them up.  Yeah.  I'm looking at the ASUS model, which looks kind of surprisingly like a MacBook Air, actually.  So 20 bucks a month, you get a of course, internet access is free for students because as you say, Jeff, they already have Wi Fi.  But if but it does it have three, these have three G built into it, too.  They can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're offering options for that.  So that Samsung said 49 for Wi Fi and 499 for 3G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I think we're going to see this will be interesting.  We'll see if a whole ecosystem springs up around these with some people providing, you know, free stuff in return for a two year contract, that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is definitely like give this to your parents machine.  Well, it's so secure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, that's the idea.  OK, here's Angry Birds.  Now, what is this?  I get an SD version or an HD version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It'll HD, I think, by default.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And Gina answered that.  Why is it just a parent's machine?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sorry, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Were you saying something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not playing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's the zero tech support machine.  That's the idea, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But Sundar is very big on saying this is secure.  This is secure.  This is secure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I also wonder why it's not.  I mean, I guess I'm confused here.  If you were all cloud livers and here we are the.  What are we?  Cloud livers?  Livers.  As in people who live in.  My liver is now a cloud after last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If my liver could only be in the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Cloud is in.  We're all cloud is in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Isn't that wonderfully awful?  I like cloud.  So if here we are, the show about cloud, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  And what shouldn't we be seeing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What the advantages of living fully in the cloud then versus the advantage of having  the machine?  Are we just trying to say, I don't like this automatic gear shift.  I like my I like to be a control of my car.  What's the idea?  I agree.  I really see the advantage of living in the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's that's basically how I've been living the last few years is all my stuff is now in  Google Docs or in Salesforce or in something out there that isn't like a machine.  When I have to stick it onto the machine, it's a bunch of work.  It's like, oh, I've got to go.  It's not on this one.  It's on that one.  What a pain.  How do I get?  How do I stop that happening?  Is this going to be?  Is it going to be?  I'm thinking of two examples right now of how this doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like, for instance, Angry Birds, I don't know what's wrong with it's not playing.  I got the music.  I don't get a picture like your Microsoft machine never does that.  Well, I'm just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And then I try to sign up for the music service on my Android device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I guess Google didn't test their their terms of service because it went on so long.  I couldn't get to the button and I couldn't scroll down.  I can't tell you how frustrated this was.  OK, Grandpa.  OK.  We will make every effort to make it so you cannot accept the terms of service.  I couldn't.  We want to really make sure that you want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I had to go to a desktop because I couldn't do it on either the tablet, the iPad or the  phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's like these things.  You're obfuscating, Grandpa.  I'm too old.  What's the advantage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's the advantage of having, you know, a computer that's not working?  What's the advantage of having, you know, a local storage machine with all the software  there and all that kind of stuff versus the cloud?  What crosses the line?  Same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Besides access.  Same things happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I understand.  Yeah.  And so what I'm confused about is why Google at the event would dismiss the machine as  a grandma machine when you think they'd be pushing it as no, no, no, don't forget about  all this other stuff, all these other worries.  Just we will take care of you, you know, with a great machine that has the full power of  the cloud.  I don't get the positioning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, there definitely was that.  There was definitely the slide that was like the Internet is bigger than any hard drive  you will ever have.  So you should just store everything in it.  I mean, there was definitely that angle.  But there was also the like, hey, we know you're developers and you like your big fat IDEs  and you've got your specialized tools.  And, you know, so maybe for the nerds you want to, you know, building their own PCs.  Maybe it's not for you.  Just keep in mind that this is a great machine to share, to have a family and to give to  your parents.  And when you go home Thanksgiving, you're not going to have to do tech support.  So how do you think how do you think they'll market?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How do you think Samsung and Best Buy will market this?  What's good?  What's their pitch going to be?  You think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, they have no, there's no pitch.  They want to sell you an HP loaded down with a lot of crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, actually, actually, Leo, laptops are lost leaders in all these stores.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  They're not.  They're not profitable.  else and the service, which they won't be able to sell you and the service.  So I think they might actually be pushing this.  This might be a reason.  The price might be up there is because it finally gives them margin in the stores.  And you get an ongoing relationship.  You know, if you sell access with this, that's far more lucrative.  Right.  Because, you know, AT&T will pay you.  I'm going to make a prediction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  This is the Google Wave, Google TV of this Google I.O.  Google I.O. 2012 Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is not going anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We will talk in one year.  Chrome OS, Chrome, what do they call them?  Chrome, Chromebooks, Chromebooks, Chromebooks, Chromebooks.  I don't want a crap book.  I don't think anybody does.  I don't think this is good.  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just.  OK, I don't argue with that.  So so then why the heck?  What grandpa should buy?  An iPad.  Android devices.  Android devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  An iPad.  At some point, maybe Android will be competitive.  But right now, an iPad.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's about the same price.  It's a little more expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  More fun.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.  I got to say.  I'm rooting for Android.  I'm not.  And I'm rooting for Chrome.  But I just don't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  There goes the pin in the balloon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Especially without Netflix.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, they showed their own video store as well.  But yeah, it's a good.  That's what I want.  I've got another damn video store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yes.  Well, I can't wait to rent movies from YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're the cynic today.  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, Mickey, look at this.  This is like the third Google I.O. in a row.  I know.  You're right.  You're right.  They keep floating these ideas that just don't.  But I do think the strongest thing that they said at the Google I.O. this year was the  Android everywhere.  I would like to see them develop Android as a platform for mobile, for portable, for small  devices.  But I just don't see them on the desktop.  I don't see a desktop play.  And I don't see a cloud play for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I think the other thing is, is the netbook just dead?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Of course, it died a year ago.  Yeah, that's true.  I mean, sales went down.  Sales went down.  Everybody bought tablets or I'm sorry, iPads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  iPads.  Actual tablets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, no, not even tablets, just iPads.  I was trying to be, I was trying to be generic, but there's no point in it.  It's obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And you mean, you know that the first accessory for Honeycomb is going to be a keyboard.  So, I mean, you know, you're going to have a tablet plugged into a keyboard anyway.  That cracks me up though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I see people with their iPad in a case that marries a keyboard to it.  What is the play?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just get a laptop.  Get a laptop.  For crying all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's in that care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you want a laptop, get a laptop.  I can hear myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Kevin is taking pictures of me with his tablet right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's another, by the way, big disappointment on at least this hardware.  And I don't know if it's the same on the 7-inch, but like my barcode scanner doesn't work,  my HDR, a lot of camera programs crash on this device.  Oh, on the tab?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What kind of stand do you have there, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, this is an iPad stand that I'm just adapting.  It'll hold any extremely expensive, thin consumer garbage.  It'll just perfect.  What are you showing there, Kevin?  What do you got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was showing the Angry Birds and Gina.  Hang on.  Angry Birds and Gina.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Two for one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think Honeycomb on Google TV is interesting.  I think they might actually be able to pull that out of the fire.  I'm more skeptical about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Really?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm really confused at what I'm seeing.  It's almost like an augmented reality browser for Angry Birds.  Is it going to hit Gina?  I can't quite figure it out.  All right.  There's still tons of other stuff to talk about.  I mean, it's not all just Google I.O.  So we will get back to...  There is?  There is.  We haven't got Wi-Fi.  We don't know.  And I'm not sure if we have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We haven't got Wi-Fi.  We don't know.  Nothing happened.  Show them what Google shows us.  The Wi-Fi here has been awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Microsoft did not buy Skype.  Nothing happened.  That's true.  That's true.  We got that.  Nothing has happened this week.  Everything that is of importance in the world is happening right now at Moscone West in  San Francisco because Kevin Marks, Gina Trapani is there, Jeff Jarvis and I are watching from  afar.  And we will be back in just a bit.  Speaking of Netflix, let me offer you a free month of Netflix, which will run, by the way,  on your Google TV so you're not completely left out in the cold.  And I hope that they put the new Netflix interface on Google TV because I just love how easy it  is to use Netflix on your Apple TV, on your Roku box, on lots of Blu-ray players, lots  of new TVs, of course your PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, your Nintendo Wii.  Netflix everywhere.  And why do you want Netflix?  Well, of course, you probably know about their DVD by mail business, but what they're really  doing great with is streaming stuff.  And it's not rentals.  I hear Google and Amazon saying $3.99 to watch a movie.  No.  $7.99 a month, all you can eat.  And there are tens of thousands of movies on watch instantly.  I feel no need to rent movies, I have to say.  Well, OK, the other night, Henry wanted to see Donnie Darko and it wasn't, you know, I  had to get the DVD of it and I was in a hurry so I paid $2.99 to Amazon.  So occasionally, you know what this really does is it conditions you to getting movies  the minute you want to watch them.  So many great flicks on here.  And you can watch them instantly on your Mac and PC as well.  And of course, as Gina well knows, all of Glee are on season one and two on here.  And I presume season three will be on as soon as it's done.  Oh, yeah.  You don't have to wait for the discs anymore.  Now, of course, I will put Donnie Darko, the Blu-ray on here because I will want to see  the Blu-ray version of this later.  But I just I'm a huge Netflix fan.  If you've not tried it, please go to Netflix.com slash twit and maybe tell friends and family  too that it's out there.  Netflix.com slash twit.  It's great on your iPad, too.  I would love to see a Netflix app on Android.  I think that we're getting close.  I don't know what the deal is on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I wasn't the deal that it was it was DRM issues.  But if the studios have allowed you to rent movies on there, then they must be happy with the  DRM. They must have figured out a way.  That's promising.  Because the issue is not anything technical on Netflix side is them persuading the studios  that Android is secure enough for them to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And for instance, I love this is 16.9.  I mean, the real the biggest thing about this is that it's a wide screen compared to the iPad.  So this is just like made for watching, you know, games Game of Thrones or something.  Actually, the HBO app is on here.  So I can't watch Game of Thrones on here.  So that's cool.  HBO app is on Android as well.  Yeah.  Oh, it is.  Am I wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I thought it was.  I need the smart cover.  Yeah.  I'm sorry to say it.  I'm really sorry to say it.  It's great.  My favorite things about the iPad.  It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not even magnets in here.  You could just duct.  You could duct tape it on duct tape it on.  Yeah.  I'll just, you know, weld the hinge on floppy.  And then it would just go like this.  You need a stand, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Not quite.  Little frustrating.  Same effect.  Meanwhile, back to Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know how we got off the subject.  Netflix dot com slash.  Watch instantly.  I love this movie.  I'm such a romantic.  The American president, Aaron Sorkin wrote it.  Great movie.  And that Benning Michael Douglas.  You know, it's not.  It's fiction.  It's about the widowed U.S. president who falls in love with a Washington lobbyist and  their fairy tale courtship.  Hey, this is a democracy.  Forget Kate and Wills.  We've got Michael Douglas and Annette Benning.  Netflix dot com slash.  Twitter.  Enjoy.  You will.  I know you will.  So what about actually you'd be a good person to talk with this about about this, Kevin,  because you are a big voice over Internet guy.  You did Ribbit for British Telecom.  Right.  What the hell?  Eight point five billion dollars for Skype.  Does that make any sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It makes some sense in that they're buying a very large customer base.  And it's a it's a direction thing for them for their phones.  Sure.  So if given that, you know, in my head, it was like we should be able to standardize this  stuff and interoperate on this soon and that we're starting to see that.  But Skype is still the biggest install base and is in many like measures the biggest telco.  So Microsoft buying that is fits in with making their mobile strategy more.  Right.  But the question then comes, is Microsoft going to maintain the non Microsoft platform  versions of Skype or are they going to let those rot?  Now that becomes tricky.  I hope that's not true because the Skype has succeeded by building clients on lots of  different platforms.  Right.  Whereas we're stuck with, you know, on the Mac, we're stuck with with the balkanized  thing that they promised to open up and they haven't yet.  FaceTime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's not going to happen.  It has to be it has to be cross platform.  It has to be open, doesn't it?  Right.  Well, does it have to be open?  I guess Skype's cross platform without being open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  But that's that's its strength and its weakness.  Its strength is that it is cross platform and it works reliably on a bunch of different  platforms.  And we can use it.  You can use it to without worrying what someone's running.  But that's the challenge for the rest of us out here saying, OK, for an open alternative,  how do we do this?  Can we actually, you know, we know that we have to get technology.  We know how to do voiceover IP.  This is not new and magic.  This is there's a bunch of protocols that are standardized for that.  The tricky part is discovering accounts and deciding how you call them.  And that's the piece that Skype has got has got down nicely.  And they've got they've got their own public version of that.  So the other counterplay is that it's it's it is a large social network.  It's a place people go to chat and talk to each other as well as make phone calls and video calls.  There are a lot of people who use Skype chat the way that, you know, us old guys use IRC or lots of people use  G-talk or whatever your favorite chat is.  There are lots of people who just live in Skype chat because that's their their I am or their business I am.  So that piece coupled with Messenger would probably make Microsoft a very big chat player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the thing that surprised me because Messenger kind of does everything that Skype does, including video calls.  But so they're really not.  But only some other messages and only on Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What about the idea that Microsoft uses Skype in their business, in their enterprise and of course gets the benefit of this customer base also.  And then because they are they are a stakeholder in Facebook, let's licenses some of it to face.  You know, who could really use this is Facebook.  That's where I think the real benefit is. Yes.  And I wonder if Microsoft didn't think, yeah, we can make a little money on the side by relicensing it over to Facebook.  Imagine embedded video chat in Facebook.  I think it would be huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know what it does? It gives you chat roulette without the without the penis.  The penile. Yeah. Right.  Because it's your friends and my friends have to do it.  So it's OK.  Rub it in, Leo. Rub it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wasn't thinking of you specifically, but now that you mention it.  No, I think that that's I think that to me now I know that there were rumors that Google was trying to buy it.  Facebook was trying to buy it.  Microsoft swoops in offering a huge amount of money, eight and a half billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And doesn't eBay feel like a dork? No.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  eBay made money because they still own.  They have a 30 percent stake. 30 percent is two point five or six billion.  They made a billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They made more on this sale than they did in the last sale.  Is that amazing? That is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I mean, when you when you sell Skype for that much money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're not feeling like dorks. No. OK, I take it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I told you, you should have elected me.  I think the Facebook just didn't have the money probably to buy eight and a half billion dollars Skype.  Had they had that in the bank, I think it would have been they would be the most likely people to make to take advantage of Skype.  And I suspect they may still.  That's my point is that Microsoft probably looked and said, hey, you know, I bet we could sell Zuck a little bit of this.  I just when I say Zuck, I want to. Yeah, I like I like the impression.  Hey, Zuck. Hey, hey, hey.  There is other news, but I don't care.  All right. All right. All right.  One more story and then we'll get to your tip and your tool and your number.  But one more story. And this I found in an interesting place.  I found it on Hacker News.  It's it's in the wrong spot.  A guy named Aaron Greenspan actually posted this as an answer on Quora.  He started a money transfer company called Face Cash, and he's very concerned to California State Senate Committee on Banking, Finance and Insurance.  There's a law.  A B that they put out a B twenty seven eighty nine.  Actually, it's it's effective. It was effective January 1st.  It's called the Money Transmission Act.  He says this is a ticking time bomb and in 50 days it's going to kill everybody but the credit card companies and people who use the credit card companies like PayPal.  Essentially, this was a law that was essentially written by something called the Money Services Roundtable, who include Western Union, MoneyGam, TravelX, American Express, the credit card companies.  They passed this law saying that if you want to be a if you want to transmit money, you have to buy a license in the state of California for half a million dollars.  I'm sorry. Yeah, half a million dollars.  And furthermore, that's just California and many other states apparently have similar laws which the credit card companies have shoved through kind of, you know, surreptitiously.  In other words, if you wanted to start a money transfer service, a Bitcoin or something that actually was allowed people to pay money without using a credit card, without using Visa or MasterCard or America Express, you would have to pay millions of dollars in license fees state by state because there's no federal law state of trade.  Jesus big time restraint of trade.  And that's what he's saying.  He says, this is what we really need is a federal law that overrides the state law.  Because essentially, the problem is that if you were if you wanted as he wanted to do start a company like face cash, you'd have to go to your investors and say the first half million that you're going to give me is going to go to the state of California, just so we can do business in California alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you want to take commerce clause.  Pardon me.  Doesn't that violent interstate commerce clause.  That's weird.  Well, so California says you can't send money out of California or you can't send money into California.  I mean, that's yeah, it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Doesn't it?  It seems like that's why a federal law could easily override this.  Right.  I think some of this has to do with terrorism.  It's such a great.  It's such a great.  It's a great excuse for so many things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tracking.  Sure.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because if you transmit money illegally without a license, you will go to the jail under the Patriot Act.  Yes.  So this is a very nice little not they've tied here.  I just wanted to bring this up, make people aware of it.  Check in your own state.  You will probably have something simple.  Similar.  If you're in California, it's AB 2789 passed into law September 2010 effective the first  of this year.  And they have until I think July 1st, 2011 to get that license.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should get Denise to cover that on this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I should because I'll tell you, if I hadn't been reading headline news and seen this Quora  post by Aaron Greenspan, I wouldn't have known anything about this.  It's just stealthed right in under the wire.  But that's why I wanted to bring it up on Twitter because we have smart listeners who  understand the implications.  Yeah, essentially it's the credit card.  Some companies saying you're not going to take our business boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well, there was the other self law this week was the renewal of the dotnet domain  contract.  Did you see that?  What happened there?  So the the RIA and so on are saying the very sunshine to renew that if they can do the  same shutting down of dotnets that they've done to dotcoms.  So they're trying to extend that to the dotnets as well.  But they took the poker science offline that the dotcoms went down.  The dotnet stayed up because it wasn't under that control.  So they're trying to close that loophole by strong arming very sign.  And that was that was I think there was comments taken on it yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is why it is so important that you be literate tech literate and understand these  issues because this stuff is happening all the time.  And the people who understand it will manipulate will manipulate everybody else.  This is why it's so important, I think, for us to do what we do to educate.  So two very interesting.  We'll continue to follow both those stories.  But time has come for our tip, our number and our tool of the week.  Let's start with Gina Tripani, who has been very busy at Google I.O.  So maybe you don't have a tip of the week this week.  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I do, actually.  One of the one of the kind of smaller, more minor announcements, but one of the announcements  that was totally up my alley was that the Google Gmail Tasks now has an API, which is pretty cool.  Google Tasks is one of those things that's built into Gmail.  You can you can turn messages into to do's and like manager to do list on your phone.  And so they just just released an API.  It's been a long time.  Yeah.  And along with that, a Chrome extension which integrates with Google Tasks.  So if you search for Google Tasks in the Chrome store, you'll see the extension with the extension installed.  You can you can key up to the Omnibar and type T and the description of your new task.  And it goes right into your Gmail Tasks or you can highlight text on a Web page and turn it into a to do.  It's a pretty, pretty cool, pretty neat extension.  So, you know, if you're not a big to do list person, but you live in Gmail like a lot of us do and, you know,  you've been trying to kind of get organized and Gmail Tasks is actually looking pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's that's that's exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. Now that there's this API, there's going to be I think and there's also integration with a few other productivity Web apps in many moon productive.  And I might do something with to do text to.  But for now, you can just install the yeah, you can install the extension in Chrome and and start, you know, getting your stuff organized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, if it doesn't work with to do that text, I don't want to use it.  I love that.  No, I love it. That's Gina's great free.  Is it free?  No, it's ninety nine. How much is it?  A buck. It's two bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it's two bucks in the Android market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And to do TXT dot com.  If you want to find out more about it, really is great.  I use it all the time, but I would love that's exactly the kind of thing is it's missing is this integration and it goes never done anything with their tasks.  They just sat there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's true. It's true.  So it's exciting to see movement there.  I'm really thrilled.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A number of the week from you, Mr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, first, I want to do a little preamble here, boss, to get you scared here because not only did J.  Rockefeller propose a do not track a bit of legislation.  Also, I don't know if you know about this, Kevin, from your homeland.  But on May 26, basically the same thing goes into effect in the UK to match with the EU's privacy directive that says that businesses and organizations running sites in the UK need to get consent from visitors in order to store and retrieve information on users' computers.  Which means they'll have to get an explicit opt in in order to deploy practically any cookie says wired.co.uk alarms.  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've talked a little bit more with Steve Gibson about this do not track.  As far as we can figure from the way it works, the kind of tracking we do to count podcast downloads would probably be OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But advertising targeting and such won't be.  It's still bad for media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it's bad because that's where ads are toward media.  I mean, if you want to pay for all your media, OK, but nobody does and nobody will.  So how are we going to how are we going to finance all this stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We got to find out anyway.  So now numbers.  I'll do number two to the last week.  We talked about the brand value and how Google was on top.  Well, the Millward Brown Brands Survey came out this week and for the first time in five years, Google is not number one.  Apple is as the most rich brand on Earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know how they figure this out, but it does.  It's an utter bull, but fine.  It makes sense, though.  It gives us something to talk about.  I think right now, if you just think about it in your own head, doesn't the Apple brand kind of supersede the Google brand?  What's absurd about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, right on, Gina Tervani.  That should the buzzer on your super.  Well, OK, what other brand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Microsoft and Yahoo.  I mean, there are, you know, Nike and British Petroleum.  But Goldman Sachs, up fast.  Salesforce.  Very, very hot.  Very, very hot.  Thank you.  That's good.  Hey, my tool is something actually I discovered because of this Galaxy tab, this 10.1 inch tab.  I was looking I typed.  I Googled, you know, honeycomb apps, and they're fewer than two dozen or three dozen that were designed specifically for honeycomb.  But one of them was this kind of interesting app.  And here's a good example, Jeff, of an app that steals your privacy.  And I don't care.  I'm going to let it because it's it's given me some value.  It's called Grocery IQ.  Let me put it up on this on the screen here and you can see what it does.  I've got the little widget here for grocery IQ.  See, there's my grocery shopping list.  If I if I open up the app, it does, I think, very nicely use the Google interface.  I mean, the tablet interface I also uses.  Watch this.  Butter.  It also uses recognition.  So there's butter.  And so I can add to my shopping list using text recognition.  But what's kind of now so this is a free app.  It is coupon based.  So I don't really use coupons.  But if you wanted to, you could you could take advantage of this here.  I had whipped cream is on my list.  Don't ask why I could I could see we don't want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You don't want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But we know I happen to like whipped cream.  But I could I could look and see if there's any coupons available for whipped cream.  And if you were a big coupon user, this would actually be really cool.  But you don't need to.  You can organize it by store, by aisle and so forth.  You can send a list.  You can email a list out to somebody.  But what I really love about this is there's a free account you set up for grocery IQ.  And this is automatically populated onto my phone so I could keep it on my tablet.  It even has a barcode scanner.  I don't know if that I guess it would work since it's honeycomb enabled.  So I could scan in the barcode of things that I needed to buy, populate the list on the tablet.  Kind of this is kind of a natural inventory taker.  And then when I go to the store, I've got it automatically on my iPhone.  It syncs up automatically.  Plus when my wife's at the store, she can see what's on the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can see what's on the list when you're at the store.  Exactly. And I can even have different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can add aisles, hide aisles.  I can really. This is like I mean, that's cool.  It's kind of I mean, you know, Jennifer's out of town and I've been doing more shopping than I usually do.  OK, can you see you can also enter in.  Suddenly I'm very interested.  Next week, next week we'll be talking about darning socks and putting buttons on jerseys.  I like domestic Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Domestic Leo. It's the new thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, the new green.  It also will. You can enter in all your grocery savings cards and things like that.  But this is I think it's kind of a neat app.  And now obviously they're tracking exactly what I buy.  They're probably selling it to these coupon guys.  But do I care? No.  What do I care?  I mean, there's the value out of this.  Which is I get this great, good looking app.  They're making a little bit money on.  And by the way, they completely support brand names.  So if I enter hot dog relish and then it said, well, which brand of hot dog relish would you like to buy?  And I thought that was interesting.  Probably they're selling that back too.  But that's fine. This is called Grocery IQ.  And I kind of like it.  The new domestic Leo.  Rocking the grocery list.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Supercharged grocery list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a honeycomb app.  All right. I've just happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just happy to find an app that runs on this thing.  I do like I do like this tablet.  But, you know, if you really want apps, if you want form and function, you really you're going to want to buy an app.  But look, I've got the live desktop, the live weather desktop.  And it this is the current weather here in Petaluma's fluffy, puffy.  How many how many apps do you each of you actually use in a week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I forget how many you download.  How many do you actually open up and use in a week?  Not that many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the point.  I just grabbed our phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because if I look at the front page of my phone, you know, there's a calendar app, there's Foursquare, a camera app, a Twitter app.  That's probably about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. See, that's that's what I'm saying.  Leo is that is that when you get down to it, the smoke that's been blowing up our ears here is that, you know, the most apps win.  They both fighting that right.  Most apps is actually a disadvantage for each of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is a Twitter app called Twitcom.  It's the first honeycomb specific Twitter app, although it's OK.  Hold wait for a little while because Loic showed me Seismic for honeycomb.  Yeah, that was looking nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Looks gorgeous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it will I think it'll be.  But this is kind of reminds me a little bit of TweetDeck.  I guess now that Twitter owns TweetDeck, we can pretty much say goodbye to any updates to that program, which is kind of sad.  But Seismic is good.  Seismic is good.  And I think Loic showed me something else that I didn't realize.  You know that you know about widgets.  Everybody knows about widgets.  But there's also you know about bookmarks.  You guys know about bookmarks in your in your Android phone.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Just putting bookmarks on your home screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. But I never paid attention.  And Loic said, you know, we have a ton of Seismic.  Let me throw this out so I can make some room.  We have a ton of Seismic or shortcuts, I should say.  Shortcuts on here.  And I never played with shortcuts.  I always go to widgets.  But if you look, an app can actually create these great shortcuts.  Seismic has a ton of shortcuts for Twitter lists, for search, Facebook page, Composer.  So I could have a shortcut on here that's a Seismic Composer shortcut.  When I tap it, then it just launches a tweet.  OK. Yeah.  So yeah, this is that's I didn't I didn't pay any attention to shortcuts before.  So that's a free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  To do text also has one.  An ad task.  I noticed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I also I keep that ad task actually in my launcher pro bar right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the other one that's handy is the contact shortcuts.  Right. Because you can have direct shortcuts to contacts.  You can direct buttons for certain people that you call a lot as little buttons on the desktop, which makes sense for something this big.  I text my son all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So all I have to do is tap that.  And yeah, I have too many text apps.  Let's let's use Google Voice and automatically launch.  Oops. Let's not show his phone number.  OK, let's go home.  I just brought kettle corn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So the show's over.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's it. Kettle corn's here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Eileen's awesome.  Eileen's the greatest.  Hey Eileen.  She looks so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's another freebie, by the way, they gave everybody Google.  I feel I can't I can no longer go as a journalist to these events.  Google not only gave this 10.1 inch tablet to everybody who went, they gave Verizon LTE.  Smodum cards out.  Did you pick yours up yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, pick up starts at 45 minutes, actually, three thirty.  I guess they didn't want everybody turned them on at the same time.  So they saved them for the end of the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they gave you those.  Yeah, there you go.  Samsung and Verizon.  And then and they give you those the crap books.  So that's great.  You're loaded up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's messed up.  I mean, I'm not going to write a book about Chrome OS, but I see I see the cell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Gina Trevani is the greatest.  Hey, you know, waves back.  You should all go out and get the complete guide to Google Wave.  Complete wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is this is why Chrome will work and wave doesn't because wave basically ignored the web.  It wasn't it didn't use HTML as a file format.  It was like coming to a world where it was Chrome is like, OK, what if you make the web the only thing on the computer?  It's a very simple idea.  That's a good.  There's there's there's some legs in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think Mr. Marks is a web standards guru.  And that's there.  There you have it.  There's his pitch.  He's now at Salesforce dot com doing the same web standards thing there.  He did at Google and Apple and many other companies before him.  He's in the cloud.  He's in the he's Mr. Cloud.  Mr. Cloud.  Thank you for being here, Kevin.  Thank you, Gina Trevani.  Again, her blog is smarterware.org.  She also does that great ThinkUp app at ThinkUp app dot com soon on a server near you, I hope, because it's really maybe in the Chrome Web Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, she's firing it up.  Quit.  All right, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I being at this conference, it's like I don't know what to do.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  First, when I go challenging, isn't it to be a developer?  That's fun.  That's what developers want projects, things to do.  Lots of interesting things to do.  Jeff Jarvis is any minute now going to be the father of a proud new book called Public Parts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just sent it in right before the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the final edits are done, right?
