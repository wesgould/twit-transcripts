Also here from Mars Technica, Ron Amadio.  Hello, Ron.  Hey, nice to see you.  Great to have you.  Jeff Jarvis has the week off.  He's in Mexico City and could not get a good connection, unfortunately, at his hotel.  But that's okay.  I love these guys.  And of course, there's lots to talk about.  Google I.O. is next week.  Ron, you're going, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, sir.  I can't wait.  We got we got hotels booked and plane tickets and meetings and all that.  It's gonna be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hope you didn't book a hotel in San Francisco, because you should probably know that the  Shoreline Amphitheater is considerably south of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we're close to it, but on the wrong side of a 12 lane highway.  So you can't walk.  We're definitely going to need a car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google I.O. is next week.  In fact, our show will be delayed next week because we're going to do coverage of the  Google I.O. Wednesday keynote starting at 10 a.m. Pacific.  It's 1 p.m. Eastern time, 1700 UTC.  No, that's not right.  10 a.m. is 1700 UTC.  The keynote will take place not at not in the traditional Moscone Center or even inside  a venue at Google.  It'll take place at what is a place mostly known for outdoor concerts.  The Shoreline Amphitheater.  That's where Neil Young has his bridge benefit every year.  It is in Google's backyard.  Have they told us how this is going to work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a map for Google I.O. and they're just kind of going to fill the parking lot  with all sorts of, I guess, tents and event spaces.  I don't know.  I guess it's going to be like a little tent city, which will be weird.  And I'm going to bring sunscreen.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, it's been it'll be warm.  It'll be nice.  You're not going, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, I'm not.  No, I'm not.  Unfortunately, I'd love to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Google I.O. is fun.  You know, it's ostensibly a developer conference, but Google has so many irons in the fire.  It's not by the way, Ron.  Is it alphabet I.O.?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it is still Google I.O.  I don't think any of the alphabet companies are going to join in on any of that.  It's Google Show and it's going to be.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  That's interesting.  Come on, though.  They're going to show some Google X stuff, I would imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Google X is the only group that's ever kind of really participated in I.O.  where everybody else is just just steered clear of it.  Are you guys sending anybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  You bet.  Jason Howell will be there.  Father Robert Balasare will be there.  Jeff Jarvis will be there.  And we will, of course, being in the keynote doesn't help us cover it in any way.  So I'll be sitting here with our team watching the keynote.  They're going to stream it and doing our usual commentary.  But then what will happen is after the keynote ends, we're going to get these guys to kind  of go somewhere and find a place where they can Skype so that we can have them join on  Twig.  So Twig will be probably about 2 p.m. Pacific.  Be pushed back by everything.  Yeah.  So what do we expect?  What's going to be the big story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Every kind of weird reality thing you can think of, virtual reality, augmented reality,  that's pretty much what kind of takes up the schedule.  It's a weird show this year because usually the big deal is a new version of Android,  but that already launched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not Android N. We know about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, some kind of Android N.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you think they'll say anything about Chrome and Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like, oh, God, I have to think this is going to be where they're going to say we're going  to put Android on Chrome OS, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a couple things they could do.  the rumored desktop operating system that we may or may not hear about.  There's getting Android apps on Chrome OS, which kind of works now, but there was code  somebody found where it said Google Play was going to end up on Chrome OS.  So you'd get like the whole app store and be able to pick from whatever you want, which  would be crazy.  Because if that works, then it's because of the kind of technical underpinnings of it.  It would be very easy to make that work on Windows and Mac and Linux since it's just  a Chrome extension.  So you'd have Google's app store on like all these desktop operating systems.  It would be super crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're saying if Google went to the effort to put Android, the Play Store on a Chromebook,  they would as a benefit be able to put it on everything else that has Chrome on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can do this right now.  You can run individual Android apps on Chrome OS, and it all works through a project called  Arc.  It's the app runtime for Chrome.  And this is built on the Chrome extension platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's not using any Chrome OS underpinnings.  It's just using Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, it's just a Chrome extension.  Because it's a Chrome extension, it works on Chrome OS and Windows and Mac and Linux.  And they've kind of been building the technical part of this for like four or five years.  It's been called Native Client.  And now it seems like they're finally going to unleash the potential of this and have  like this crazy hostile ecosystem takeover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's kind of interesting.  That would be really interesting.  Maybe I picked the wrong time to put Linux on my Chromebook Pixel.  Whoops.  I had kind of given up on the Chromebook Pixel.  I thought, well, there are other really now better and faster Chrome books out there.  The Dell and the HP and the Acer are all beautiful, all aluminum and less expensive.  So and I'd been waiting for kind of something to happen with putting a Linux shell on Chrome  OS.  You know, there's crouton, but that's not really very happy.  So I just put Debian on it.  It actually works great.  There were a few things I had to do.  But that's so that's really interesting.  How about the Pixel C tablet?  Will that go the other way?  Well, that's an Android device that really could have been a Chrome OS device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you're you're kind of seeing the beginnings of that in Android and where  there's a split screen mode.  There's also a floating like multi window mode in Android that we found a bit ago.  So we'll probably hear about that.  That's not like officially released yet.  But through, you know, the usual weird hacking, we were able to enable it.  So I don't know that that I mean, you're you're definitely going to see Android go the other  way where you'll get more and more kind of desktop operating system features like a like  a window system.  The Pixel C doesn't have a mouse, so you're you're kind of stuck with just split screen  on that.  It's really limited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wrote a great article on the Pixel C and how it was really an orphan product that was  intended for other uses.  And they finally just pushed it out the door with not the right OS.  And it's kind of a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a weird product.  If they held it, I love it.  If they held it past the release of Android and I think their reception for it would be  a lot better because then you get split screen and it becomes a little more useful.  But yeah, it's just weird.  You could it was supposed to have Chrome OS and would make more sense with that, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this this could be frankly, I think Chrome OS is getting better and better and more and  more desirable.  And now that there are many, it's really interesting to see all these former Windows or I guess  continuing to be Windows OEMs hedge their bets with Windows and make pretty darn nice  Chrome OS devices in a broad range of prices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And what was it that that aluminum HP Chromebook makes a beautiful it's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really nice looking.  Acer also has an aluminum one and both HP Dell and Acer all have what I've been wanting  for a long time.  A lot of Chromebooks are the cheap $200 netbook kind of devices, very plasticky, which is  fine.  I mean, there's a market for that.  But I wanted to see something in the mid range, the five to six hundred dollar range that  was a nicer device, not as expensive as the pixel, which is really ridiculous.  Nobody's going to spend 1200 bucks on a Chromebook.  And I think now that there are I think Dell, HP, Acer, Asus and Lenovo are all making very  nice Chromebooks.  Samsung, too, I should throw them in.  Yeah.  And so that's a and and of course, the thing that people don't like about Chromebooks is  they feel foolishly, I believe, feel they need like a more complete operating system.  They want more apps.  They want a file system.  All this stuff that they trust me, they don't really want.  But a good way to do it would be to add Android, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well then you're going to get you're going to get a lot of phone apps and it's not I  don't know that it's going to fix Chrome OS all that much.  I kind of feel like Google Play on Chrome OS is just kind of the safe test area where  And then and the real target, I think, is Google Play on Windows and Mac OS.  It doesn't add a ton to Chrome OS.  I mean, like my personal problem with Chrome OS is you can't get like a good photo editor.  And I want these big, powerful desktop apps, not not little phone apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but there's also an issue there because you don't have a lot of storage on Chrome  OS.  You know, none of the Chromebooks really come with more than 32 gigs of storage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you're saying your pixels, what, 1200 bucks and has 32 storage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, in every respect, it's an i7, it's eight gigs of RAM.  It's a wonderful computer.  I love the keyboard.  The three to touch screen is beautiful.  So never respects a great computer, but doesn't have much storage because it's a Chromebook  and it got if it had 64 gigs or better 128 gigs.  On the other hand, it's funny how spoiled we are because I mean, Matthew, you and I  old enough to remember when PCs came with much smaller hard drives and we were in 50  megs. Yeah, we were fine.  I remember my first two gig hard drive.  I thought, oh, I'll never run out of space on this.  So 32 gigs.  Well, it doesn't sound like a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I mean, you can buy a USB, a 64 gig USB drive for 20 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This has an SD card slot, which a lot of Chromebooks don't.  So that means I could put a 200 gig SD card in there.  And there you go.  There you go.  Storage I need.  So I have to say, and you know, you think, Ron, is it time for another pixel?  Would they do you think they might show a new new Chromebook hardware?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, we would hear about it.  I think Chromebook Chromebook hardware ends up in the chromium source repository.  So it's not it's usually never a surprise.  The guys that pay attention to this are like there's a new board  found in the thing and it'll be named after like a Street Fighter character or something.  And then everybody knows some kind of pixel is coming.  Right.  But there's none of that yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe they're just happy enough that the other guys are doing them.  They don't need to do them anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just saw something about Google working on something similar to Amazon's Echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'd love to see that.  I mean, Google, it's baffled me with the Echo that Google and that Google and Apple and  Microsoft have not done something similar.  The Echo is really kind of a it's a unique device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so according to Ricode, they're working on something that'll look sort of like the on hub  wireless router and goes by the name chirp.  That's the internal name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I've heard that before.  Yeah.  Yeah, I've heard somebody say chirp before as their little voice appliance.  Yeah, it makes a ton of sense because Google already has all the parts and  and the software.  Yeah.  And the nice thing about the Echo, though, is because it's because it's plugged in,  the voice hot word is like a million times better than what you get on a smartphone  because smartphones are always trying to fall asleep and save power.  And this thing when it has electricity, you can just have the mic on full blast all the time.  It's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And brilliantly done mics.  The array mics are much better because they because they pick up every sound in the room.  In fact, we have an Echo now.  One in the we have I've I don't know, I've stopped counting.  I have a lot of Echoes, a bedroom, living room, kitchen, den.  Anyway, I have I have one in the kitchen and I say, you know,  Echo set timer for four minutes and it will respond and the one in the gym will respond.  And it's pretty far away.  And so they're they really are good in that respect.  It's kind of funny to have dueling Echoes.  So that's part of it.  Now, didn't the on hub, it doesn't have a microphone.  It did have a speaker.  You did not like the or were underwhelmed by the on hub.  In fact, I didn't buy it because of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, good call.  The on still sucks.  There's still none of that ever actually happened.  Like it was supposed to be a smart home device and has all these sensors in it  or has all these antennas in it that are dormant and are supposed to work.  But no, it still doesn't work.  The USB port still doesn't work.  Bluetooth still doesn't work.  The one thing they added was if this then that.  Right.  And so you get smart home stuff through somebody else's ecosystem.  Yeah, not not Google actually doing what they promised they were going to do.  So yeah, it's a huge bummer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Seems like a real missed opportunity.  I mean, when I saw it, I thought, oh, that's great.  It could be a smart home hub.  Google's got lots of services that could integrate with that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The actual story about the the chirp comes from Jessica Lessens.  The information read Albergati reporting.  And apparently there are four nest Google products under wraps.  One is called Flintstone by just for the name.  No, imagine a tech company naming a product after America's Stone Age family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I like the nickname for that because the engineers think it's never going to come out.  So they nicknamed it Tombstone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, well, Nest has been working on it for three years.  So maybe not.  That's a wireless hub in the brains of a Nest security system.  I can guarantee you it's dead now.  After the reports and we talked about it yesterday on security now that  Zigbee has a terrible idea for a security system because you can jam it.  And anybody with a two dollar jammer just walks in the door and the security system doesn't know they're there.  And it's just there.  It's so I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What gets me what gets me about Alexa is you can you can say like, you know, Alexa, unlock the doors or something and it'll do it.  And it's like, what if someone's just outside your house and screams it really loud?  Yeah, this is a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, we need to rethink the idea of security systems being tied to this infrastructure.  Yeah.  Security systems should be secure, seems to me.  They're also working on something called PINNA, which is a wireless security sensor.  Fancier, though, than the existing stuff.  Both of these will use thread, which is the Internet of Things OS or communications protocol, I should say.  Yeah, it's like a Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Replacement kind of thing.  And then Keshi.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Not Kesha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not Kesha.  Keshi.  These are Bluetooth mobile Bluetooth tags kind of like the tracker.  Also using thread could operate like a smart key fob.  I can't I really worry about wireless systems that unlock doors.  And then finally, this chirp thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but Nest is a disaster.  So anything you hear about future Nest products coming out, don't hold your breath.  Because I mean, these guys have been inside Alphabet for I don't know what, is it a couple years now?  And have released no new products.  They bought DropCam and rebranded it.  And that's kind of been there.  They got all this money from Alphabet and have done not a whole lot with it.  It's just there's been stories on...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The recode piece said that originally Nest was going to work on this thing that was sort of like the Echo.  They were rebuffed.  Yeah, and then Google's like, that's not happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is from the information.  Google is working on a device to compete directly with Amazon's popular Echo voice control personal assistant portable speaker.  Nest wanted to be part of the project within Google, but was rebuffed by the person in charge of Google's project.  Google already employs technology like the Echo and Android, of course.  You know what I just got and I really like? I haven't done a review of it yet.  It's the Echo Dot.  So this is the little, it's tiny part.  It's just like if you cut the top part off the Echo.  It's got a little speaker, but you really, it's not intended to be used as a speaker.  It's just the array mics and the smarts of the Echo.  And then you pair it or connect it physically to whatever speakers you want.  That was always my one knock on the Echo was it didn't have a great speaker in it.  So it's fine for audible books, but it wasn't great for music.  So now I have it hooked up to a very nice speaker system and I'm happy.  I'm loving it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So for me, the reason I'm looking forward to a Google voice appliance thing is that the my problem with the Echo was that the ecosystem around it really wasn't great.  I wanted to be locked into the Alexa app.  Like you say, you know, make a add this to my shopping list and it sticks it inside the Alexa app and you make it to do thing.  And that goes in the Alexa app.  Like I want you to use the apps that I prefer on my smartphone and on the internet and all that.  Like I don't want to live my life inside of your one app because that's like what most of the Alexa functions go to and you can't change them.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's a huge bummer.  I haven't been in that interested is exactly that.  I'd much rather have something that that moved across different platforms and ecosystems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can make appointments on your Google Calendar now, though.  They just added that.  So there's that.  There's that.  I think the thing that's interesting with the Echo is the skills.  It's fairly easy to write skills.  So it isn't that I mean, Echo is extensible to work with any app.  All the app developer do have to write an Echo skill.  What's a skill?  So it's very easy to write these.  Amazon provides the infrastructure.  You use Amazon's own servers.  There you can write one for free and or you can pay per transaction.  And it's a very simple thing to add a skill to the Echo.  And the problem with it is it's kind of a silo.  So you have to know and there are hundreds of skills now.  You have to go to the Alexa app, search for the right skill and add it.  You have to enable it.  And then you have to remember that you did it.  So you have to go to the Alexa app, search for the right skill and add it.  You have to enable it.  And then you have to remember that you did it.  So it's like there if this then that.  It's very extensible though.  I mean, yeah, it's an API.  It's a great API.  So there's no reason why you couldn't, you know, if you're a calendar app, for instance, have an Echo skill that would work.  You know, I play Jeopardy with my Echo.  I say Echo, ask, you know, let's play Jeopardy and it gives me six Jeopardy questions.  It's tied to the Jeopardy app.  It even does a plug for the Jeopardy app.  It says, that's cool.  So I feel like it's an open equalizer.  So I feel like it's an open ecosystem.  But it's difficult to manage at this point because the vocabulary is all over the place.  You know, it's very hard to know what your Echo can or cannot do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but the Echo is like a good year old, I think.  And I tried it a few weeks ago and it's there's still that skill ecosystem never turned into being able to do what I want with it.  Really, it's still it's just not very popular with developers, I would guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  So if you're, you know, if you're a Pythonista, it's not hard.  There's 87 pages there of skills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can use it to pull your Tesla out of the garage, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can. Somebody auto-summoned it.  Tesla added a summon feature, which makes me extremely nervous.  You'd also have to tie it to your garage door opener.  Yeah.  But I'm sure you could do that with If This, Then That.  And and the proper garage door equipage.  And you could the car would pull out of the garage without a driver in there.  It does it very slowly. So it's not to run into anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I hope so. Yeah, you'll only be slowly run over by your vehicle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just saw something.  Someone used summon and and smashed the car up, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're relying on the Tesla's sensors to know everything.  And it's always been the case that they don't see everything.  It even says that in the manual very clearly.  You know, don't trust these sensors.  So summon. It's more of a nice idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This guy in Utah's car crashed into a parked trailer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice. At a very low rate of speed, probably like two miles an hour.  But, you know, you hit something with a two ton car.  It doesn't really matter.  There you go. See how slow it is.  This is a video of parking.  That is slow.  Yeah, no, it really is inching in there.  And that makes you feel a little bit better.  But but that's because it has to see all the stuff and know when to stop,  know when to stop, know when to stop.  Let's guess it's going all the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, Tesla, it's interesting.  They have so much detail in the driver logs.  In this case, they're quoting from the logs.  Oh, yeah, by the way, show that someone was initiated by a double-printed car.  Someone was initiated by a double press of the gear selector stock button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't own those logs.  No, no, of course not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The driver was alerted with an audible chime and a pop-up message.  And ignored it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ignored the cancel.  Wow.  They did change how summon worked to make the cancel, make it more, was it a dead man switch?  Yeah, no, they know a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Brake pedal was released. Two seconds later, the driver exited the vehicle.  Three seconds after that, the driver's door was closed.  Three seconds later, summon activated pursuant to the driver's double press activation request.  Yeah.  Is that wild?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amazing.  You broke all the rules.  And Elon doesn't mind telling you.  The warnings were not heeded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Six seconds later, driver puts his arm out the window, waves to a passenger.  I have to say, I'm sure...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's good, though.  They knew the ambulance chasers would be after a second.  They had any kind of car auto driving stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a Tesla in order. It's going to come in the fall. Model X.  Which one? X?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think that you just...  That's the price you pay to be a Tesla owner.  Is that Elon is always watching.  Oh, yeah.  And I will be...  You probably won't hear me do a lot of talking about this thing.  I don't want to get in trouble.  They'll take it back.  I'm not going to do that.  I'm not going to do that.  I'm not going to do that.  They'll take it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They'll take it back.  Here's your check.  Did he refuse someone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He did.  Stuart Alsop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he rejected his order.  Great tech reporter, old friend.  No, you can't have a test.  He was bitching because he went to the event.  Oh, right, right.  And he had to wait three hours, didn't see the car.  And he blogged about it on Medium.  And Elon said, fine.  No Tesla for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so...  I really want one.  You have to really want one.  I really want one and I'm willing to surrender all privileges to own one.  Everything.  Everything.  You can log everything I'm doing.  What else? Google I.O.  So you really think they're going to be all in on VR and AR?  They have a big investment in leap motion, right?  Or magic leap?  Leap? Oh, yeah.  No, that's not for a million years.  Don't worry about that.  We're not going to say anything for a magic leap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No. The big deal is going to be Project Tango.  They're going to have the first consumer Project Tango device built by Lenovo.  So this is going to be a smartphone with a bunch of sensors on the back.  Kind of like a Microsoft Kinect.  Where it'll have...  It'll be like 3D computer vision.  So it's going to be a computer vision.  So you'll be able to take it and pan it around a room and it'll scan the room and give you kind of a 3D model of it.  And they want to use this for stuff like gaming where there could be little gnomes running around on the floor  and you could kind of lower your phone and zoom into whatever's happening in the virtual world.  Or precise indoor mapping.  So when you can 3D scan a room, you know exactly where you are in the room.  Google Maps could take you from the door of the airport into the airport over to your flight gate.  This has never felt like a consumer product to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I could see why you'd want it if you had a business and you wanted to have a floor plan in the Google Maps.  What is the consumer side of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's weird.  I mean it would be I guess like a gaming console kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's not a VR or an AR headset.  It would be a part of an overall AR experience but they don't have the rest of the parts, right?  They just map the room.  There's no gnome part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or is there?  Maybe they'll show that.  There's no headset.  But it would still be augmented reality just through kind of an LCD screen.  You can't attach it to your face or anything.  But that still counts as augmented reality where you kind of scan a room and place people in it or characters in 3D.  And I mean people who have been using them as robot heads since it kind of has all that scanning stuff and has a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no I can see how you...  So that's what it feels like to me, something you might use for something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't get the consumer pitch.  With all of this crazy camera gear and 3D processing and all that, the battery life has got to be horrible.  You wouldn't want to use it as a day-to-day smartphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There have been Tango tablets out for a while.  Yeah, there's a developer kit.  It's a specialty product I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean I don't get it.  I mean yeah, here's for sales in a house.  Yeah, great for that.  Yeah, there's like a Lowe's app where you can visualize the dishwasher in your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I mean I don't think a real...  There aren't that many realtors out there who are going to actually do this.  Maybe if it's a Sotheby's $8 million home, you want an online catalog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean as the first ever consumer version, that's kind of their job to give us the sales pitch.  So who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like if you care that much, you're going to go see the house.  I mean okay, this is... yeah, all right.  Apparently they're going to do an Android, standalone Android VR headset.  This is not cardboard.  Peter Rojas tweeted that Android VR will launch as a dedicated standalone handset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a weird report because Android is an operating system.  So they wouldn't call it the hardware Android VR.  But he says yeah, that some kind of hardware is going to launch.  It can't be called Android VR though.  It sounds like gear though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So right now if you have cardboard or gear, you have to have a phone that you insert in the thing.  So the cardboard's cheap because there's a holder is all it is with some lenses.  But of course if you didn't have a phone or you didn't have an appropriate phone,  I guess if you would spend a few hundred bucks you could have cardboard with a built-in hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so the full collection of rumors is that they're going to have a gear VR competitor  and then they're going to make a standalone headset with the processor and screen and all that in it.  And they're going to have an Android version of Android built for virtual reality,  which I think would be the most important part because all of these,  there's already a million headsets out there, the gear VR already exists,  but Android built for virtual reality would be like the first ever VR operating system.  Lots of people have Vives and Oculus Rifts and all that stuff, but all they do on them is play games.  Nobody's really tried a menu systems and email and all this stuff in 3D virtual reality all over the place,  which sounds super interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would also imagine we'll see some Android TV stuff or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nothing, there's been nothing serious for Android TV.  I don't think they've been talking to the FCC about getting access to cable boxes  so that you wouldn't have to get a cable box from your cable company  and could buy one with maybe Android TV on it or something.  It has been a very long time since we've heard anything from the Android Wear people.  There's no rumors or anything, but it's been like a year maybe since they had a serious operating system upgrade.  And all the watches are pretty old. So yeah, that's a good bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or not. Or it died.  I remember Android TV starting to feel like Google TV, which just kind of died on the Vaughn.  Are you a fan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I wanted to be a fan.  I was looking for basically an alternative to Apple TV.  And I thought, geez, if Android TV works good or Google TV, just nothing has ever seemed to...  I have the shield, the Nvidia shield.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you like it?  Yeah, except that it's just unrealized potential. It's huge unrealized potential.  It should be better than the Amazon Fire TV or the Apple TV, except nobody's doing anything.  It's very disappointing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is anybody doing anything with any of the TV platforms though?  I mean, it's all just kind of...  They're all moving slowly, aren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they're all moving fairly slowly.  I think everybody is hoping and waiting for an over-the-top solution.  We're waiting for the FCC in the US anyway, for the FCC to mandate an open standard for set-top boxes.  Right now you have to get it from the cable company.  Or, as I do, I use a TiVo and then the cable company has to give you a cable card.  But the FCC has proposed rules that would require an open set-top box system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It sounds like that's coming.  So I imagine everyone's sort of waiting.  Like, why pour a bunch of money into it if the whole landscape's going to shift soon?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And of course, the other side of that equation is getting the cable companies and the networks,  which are sometimes the same thing, at least in the case of Comcast and NBC,  to give us some sort of over-the-top experience.  Or Apple's been trying for years to do this.  The rumor was that...  Who was it?  Who's the latest one that was about to make a deal?  YouTube, unplugged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, YouTube, unplugged.  Well, I wrote about that.  I don't know if...  I'm sure Ron has thoughts as well.  Right.  How long have there been...  Since 2012, as far as I can remember, Apple's been talking about it since 2009.  And it just never seems to happen.  And what it feels to me, at least, like one of the sticking points is  every time these guys get together,  Google and Apple say,  So here's what we want.  We want all your stuff, all the best channels.  And here's the price we want,  because we want to basically offer it for like $30 a month or less.  And then all of the cable, all the TV providers and content companies are like,  Well, that's not going to happen because we want you to pay us X amount for this channel and X amount for that channel.  And pretty soon it's $75 a month.  Right.  And so then they just say, well, let's talk again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the problem.  They're not getting a hard no.  If they're getting a hard no, if they say,  You nuts, get out of here.  Get out.  They're saying, well, you know, it's an interesting idea.  We maybe, you know, I like that idea.  Let's see if we could, let's crunch those numbers.  Right, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they go away. So Disney and CBS and, you know, Viacom and everything.  They don't want to say a hard no because I think they're terrified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they are. They know that they're in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they know they're in trouble.  And they're losing sort of power by the day.  And so part of them wants to cut a deal.  They haven't hit bottom yet.  They can't stomach the price, right?  They just can't.  The finance guys are like, are you joking?  We can't give up to Apple and Google for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if you put yourself in the position of an NBC or Comcast,  for that matter.  You know, everybody under 25,  nobody under 25 watches TV.  They watch YouTube.  So they see this train hurtling down the track at them.  But they're playing a game of chicken.  I'm not going to jump.  I can get another year.  What about the music industry that kind of did the same thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's very similar.  So the same way the music industry tried to charge exactly the same for digital files as they did for CDs,  to sort of prop up the CD business,  cable companies and TV providers want exactly the same amount of money from Apple and Google or more  as they charge out all the satellite and cable guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Meanwhile, what Comcast has been doing is a backfill operation  where they slowly increase the cost of internet.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So cable companies get to do that.  They get to hose you on cable as well.  Although, they can't do caps.  That's one interesting feature of...  So the FCC has basically said  caps or bandwidth caps are not kosher.  Not officially.  Well, it's anti-competitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because if you're Comcast,  you really don't want people to be watching HBO now.  Right.  Because you don't get any money for that.  Because that's coming in over the internet.  You want them to be watching HBO on the television.  Because you get paid monthly for that.  But you see everybody's making these...  They know it's coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yes. They know it's coming.  And they're all making these sort of side deals.  So, you know,  Disney will kind of deal with Sling TV.  And kind of deal with Sony for the PlayStation Vue.  Apple and Google are so huge.  You know, they're not...  Sling TV is still a relatively small thing.  But if you suddenly cut some cozy deal with Google or Apple,  you know, all hell's going to break loose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The record industry,  the guy in the white pants from Capitals  calling the guy at NBCUniversal saying,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, we did this deal with Apple.  And you saw what happened.  It was terrible. iTunes and that is alive.  So stay away. Those guys will still kill you.  Oh yeah, they say they're just a small computer company.  But they're not a small computer company.  They're going to kill you.  Take it from me.  I'm on my fifth heart attack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think if...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think if this...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If this FCC thing does take off  and they kind of open up cable boxes,  then I think Android TV gets a lot better.  I hope so.  Everybody needs a DVR anyway for TV.  So, you might as well get one with the TV.  It's got both Android TV on it and has all these apps  and can run Netflix and all that.  But right now having it as a standalone box  is kind of like...  I don't... I hardly ever launch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's got so much potential. I hardly ever launch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just imagine, like, if you did have a set-top box  that was open in some way.  Oh man.  Like even the crappiest version of an Android box  that you can buy from some guy  off Craigslist  who set up all the channels for you or whatever,  is ten times better than your cable box.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely.  These cable boxes are horrible.  I'm slowly replacing Comcast's  top-of-the-line product, the X1,  which they really are selling  as like a digital solution,  is so... just god-awful  that I'm slowly  replacing it with TiVos.  But TiVos are not a great solution either  because they're incredibly expensive.  You have to buy the TiVo and then you have to buy the subscription  and it ends up being a very pricey alternative.  And you still have to rent a cable card  from Comcast so they get you anyway.  But then they really screw you.  This is the thing that gets me.  So TiVo has  HBO Go on it.  But you can't sign up  through Comcast because they block it.  They did that to Roku for a long time.  Roku only recently  could you use your...  if you were a Comcast customer, could you use HBO Go?  You have to... but you know, it's just...  Ay...  Ay...  It's tough to be a cord cutter, but the problem is  what's going to happen is, you know,  we still want to see our shows  the younger generation.  They don't care.  You got nothing I want, so see ya.  I got my laptop  or my tablet and that's fine with me.  My phone.  Let's take a break. We're having fun.  Ronam Audio's here from ours. Tecnica  is going to be at Google I.O. next week.  We'll check in with you.  If how much of this came true, we're going to be doing lots of coverage.  Yeah, I get to hold my feet to the fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Ron!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You didn't tell us about the parachuting nanobots?  Yeah.  Why are you not paying attention?  Also Matthew Ingram from  fortune.com. He doesn't have to worry about that kind of stuff.  He's a big thinker.  Medium sized thinker.  Don't ever get in the prognostication business.  You can't say no win.  No win.  Our show today  brought to you, we got a new sponsor. I love these guys.  Ministry of Supply. I was telling you before  the show, I didn't even know  they were going to be a sponsor and I went out and bought some great  stuff. My new shorts, Ministry of Supply.  They make stuff that's for  people like us that's  long lasting,  smart clothing.  And they do things  like if you were going to rethink clothing,  so for instance,  the shorts instead of having buttons,  have these  little snap things.  And it's great. They're so much better than buttons.  They're faster and easier to use.  And they hold on better.  I got some Ministry of Supply clothes here.  I just love it. Go to ministryofsupply.com  slash twig.  You'll get 15% off your first purchase with  the code. Twig. I also got  a travel jacket from them. The whole idea  is  it's stylish, good looking,  long wearing clothes for smart people.  And this stuff is  business clothes that are engineered by  MIT trained engineers to provide  technical things.  Body temperature regulation  keeps you from getting too hot or too cold.  Moisture wicking fibers.  They're stretch. I love these.  Those are the shorts I got. Best shorts  I've ever had. Incredible.  Some Gemini chinos.  This is a classic twill chino, but they re-engineered  it using face  change materials.  From NASA.  It stores and releases body heat based on the  surrounding climate. It's cotton with  these face change materials built in.  And the fibers are stretchy.  So you can bend and sit without  any restriction.  It's clothes like you want to wear that if you thought  oh, I think we can reinvent clothing.  This is it. Ministry of Supply.  Oh, this is a nice shirt. Here's a shirt for you.  Nice collar. I mean, they are stylish, right?  But it's really a work  wardrobe workhorse.  The material wicks  sweat from your skin with laser cut.  Ventilation underarms to keep the airflow  going. Stretchy material.  Allows great movement. The brushed  interior is, it feels different on the inside  than it does on the outside. It's really soft.  Here's the archive.  This is the archive shirt.  All their clothes are easy to maintain.  Wrinkle resistant. That's one of the reasons I got them  because they're wash and dry.  Great for traveling. You never need to iron them.  They're great for geeks.  Look at that. And they look good.  They really do.  Ministryofsupply.com slash twig. 15% off your  first purchase. They also have stores.  Boston, San Francisco.

Finally, somebody's designing clothes. Buy us for us.  Ministryofsupply.com slash twig.  Oh, this is a Mercury SVK sweater.  So it's marina wool.  But also has this PCM infused acrylic.  And let's get this. This is 28%  carbonized, coffee infused nylon.  Doesn't smell like coffee.  But the coffee infusion  reduces odors.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is awesome stuff.  Yeah, it doesn't smell like coffee, but it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  Matthew Ingram is here from fortune.com.  Mr. Ron Amadio from Ars Technica.  Today, day two, Oracle versus Google,  the smackdown in downtown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is a trial that never will end, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember talking to James Gosling,  the inventor of Java a few weeks ago on  triangulation.  And he says, you know, son invented Java.  James Gosling was his son when he invented Java.  And then, of course, Google went to son and  said, we'd like to license Java.  We'd like to use Java for Android.  Actually, it wasn't even Google at the time.  I think it was Andy Rubin at Android.  Google later acquired them.  And for whatever reason, they didn't end up  licensing it.  They created, you know, an equivalent,  a JVM called Dalvik, right, Ron?  Dalvik.  And now they're using art.  But Dalvik is API identical to Java.  Now, I have to say, Gosling said, well,  we looked at the Dalvik code and it was our  opinion at son that they had actually copied  some of the code.  This was our code we saw in there.  So he said, Google slimed us, but not to the  point where we were going to sue them.  We didn't want to sue Google.  So we just copied some of the code.  And then we got to the point where we were  going to sue them.  We didn't want to sue Google.  So we just left it.  But he says, during the conversations between  Oracle and son, during the acquisition talks,  he says, the Oracle lawyers' eyes lit up  when we started talking about Java.  They knew there was something there.  And Oracle was perfectly willing to go  after Google.  And in fact, they did.  They sued, saying, and this is the interesting  thing, and this is where Gosling said,  this is where I, I think there was some  merit in this, but their lawyers, the Oracle  lawyers, determined that we're not going to  get them on the stealing code surface.  Too arcane. No jury will get it.  We're going to get them on,  on the APIs  are copyrightable.  They stole the API.  Now, by the way, there'd be no PC  industry if Compact  couldn't copy IBM's bios  API in a clean room environment.  They didn't steal the code.  They just made it functionally equipped.  There would be no PC industry if that hadn't happened,  if that had been illegal.  Initially, this was thrown out.  The court, and even the appeals  court said no, but somehow this has gotten  back into trial. Now they're having a jury  trial. And Oracle's suing  for nine billion dollars.  They're suing Google,  saying, Google's  use of Java APIs  violates copyright  law.  Former Sunset  former Sun CEO,  the final CEO, the last guy, the man who  sold Sun to Oracle  testified  today, took the stand  today.  Was the Java  language created by Sun in the 90s free  and open to use? The Google lawyer asked.  Absolutely yes.  Jonathan Swartz said.  Since its inception, long before  I arrived at Sun.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It was in our

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  interest to promote the use of Java  everywhere. If you were using Java, then  everything else Sun sold, we could sell  it to you. If you're using Windows, which  is the dominant, or was the dominant  operating system, we had nothing to sell you.  Swartz said that freedom extended  the use of Java APIs as well.  See, I don't think Swartz was real happy with Larry  Ellison and Oracle.  No one's happy with Larry Ellison.  Who is? The strategy is  this is Swartz talking.  We agree on these open  APIs, then we  compete on implementation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the whole idea of copyright  ability for APIs,  like in using copyright law  to pursue people  who use an API, I think that  the implications of that are kind of disturbing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's messed up. And if they win, it's a very bad  thing. Did  did, did, so  Swartz says the strategy was we agree, okay,  the open strategy sometimes led to things  Swartz doesn't like, like the new  Class Path project, an open source Java  product that Sun was forced to  compete with. Did they take a license? Asked  Google's lawyer? No, absolutely not,  Swartz answered. I was annoyed,  but it was completely  consistent with our practices.  When you say APIs are open,  they're going to be competitive implementations.  Apache Harmony.  He says there was nothing we could do about it.  Swartz, when he was CEO,  had discussions with Eric Schmidt  about a possible partnership in the mobile space.  Sun was looking for Google to promote the brand to  endorse Java and endorse that logo.  That would mean a lot of other  companies would want to pick up Sun products. It would make  Sun more relevant in the marketplace. They didn't make a  deal. I think it was a combination of money  and technical independence, says Swartz.  Google didn't want to rely  on anyone else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it sounds more like that to me.  Sun also just like to do  their own stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Part of the big difference at the time was that  Google needed to strip  down everything  to get this to run on  a smartphone. Because I mean  smartphones back then were unbelievably  slow. So they,  you know, it wasn't just the Java  APIs. They had to hack and slash away  at everything that was unnecessary in order  to get some kind of working operating  system up on this. And  at the time it seemed like they were doing  everything above board. You know, they  had a, they did a clean  room implementation of the APIs  and the CEO of Sun posted  like a congratulatory blog  post when the Google deal was  announced. And now Oracle comes along  and says, oh well we own this now and we're going to  see the crap out of you. And  it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's  right. Yeah.  So Oracle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. So  apparently Schwartz is testifying for  Google even though he was the Sun's  CEO. Now  Oracle's lawyer gets  cross-examination.  He asks, you didn't  want to work for Oracle, did you?  Schwartz, no I did not. Oracle  didn't offer you any senior management position  did they? No. By the way  this is, I should really point out, this is a jury trial.  So you've got 12  people who have no freaking clue what an API  is. Guarantee you. In fact there  was only one person with  any development or technology  experience and Oracle got him  off the jury.  So these are 12 people who know nothing.  They're off the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they don't know  anything about technology. Right. They don't  know anything about APIs. They don't know anything about  probably about copyright law either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. These are 12  of your peers.  Oracle didn't offer you  a position did they? No. I resigned.  Was Oracle frustrated at your guidance?  Oracle was frustrated with the speed  at which customers began abandoning Sun  once it became clear we were going  to be acquired by  Oracle.  So they're trying to basically  say, oh Schwartz you hate Oracle and that's  why you're testifying. Right.  Against us. And of course this is not about  technology. This has nothing to do with APIs  and whether they should be copyrightable.  Because the jury won't understand that  anyway. No. It's about

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  nine billion dollars in damages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't, you know, who cares  if Google has to pay nine billion dollars. That's not what  worries me. What worries me  is there's precedent that APIs  are copyrightable. It's the principle.  Bad idea.  And even James Gosling  said that would be a terrible, terrible  precedent to set.  Well we'll follow,  this is going to continue on, okay.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, our  guy in the courtroom,  our guy in the courtroom, Joe, has been  crazy. He posted I think like  four or five stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is Joe's, by the way I should have  given Joe Mullen credit here. This is  his, this is from his transcript at Ars Technica.  He's done a great job  on this. By the way.  At the end it says,  this in fact, I highly  recommend you just follow Joe and Ars  Technica and just read these articles because this is fascinating  stuff and very important.  So  finally, in the midst of the greatest recession,  you were one of the bottom ten CEOs in the  country according to the employees,  says Oracle's lawyer.  Ten, fifteen worst CEOs  in American history. Ouch.  And short says, in the midst of the greatest recession of my lifetime  a lot of people were upset.  I was upset too.  Anyway,  this is good. Highly recommend it.  And it's an important trial,  not because of nine billion dollars,  but because of the precedent  it might set. And unfortunately the Supreme Court

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  has already ruled that  API use doesn't,  can't fall under fair use.  So you can't claim fair use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that was related to this. So what happened was  Oracle lost  in the appeals court.  So they took it to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court  didn't rule on it. They just turned it back.  And that's why we're having a jury trial now.  By the way,  only ten people in the jury. Not twelve.  Sorry.  How long is this supposed  to go on? Do you know, Ron?  How long will Joe be stuck in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No idea.  I don't know if he knows, really.  I have no idea.  All of this court stuff,  it just goes on forever and ever.  And there's appeals and more appeals.  I don't know. I let Joe take care of all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think this one is kind of  interesting. And of course this would be  a terrible, terrible precedent.  We'll continue to follow it.  With interest. Not because of Google, but  as much as just because this is  something that would affect everything.  It's like the Feinstein-Berr  encryption bill, which would effectively make  browsers illegal.  Just a little thing.  Not a big deal.  Or actually would make SSL illegal. I guess you could  still have a browser, but you couldn't have a secure browser.  That couldn't,  there's nothing wrong with that. That couldn't  have any consequences. People should be able to bank  without security. No problem.  Uh...  What else?  We did Chirp, we did Nest.  What is going on at Nest, Ron?  Are they going to just  fold their tent eventually?  Seems like a train wreck.  I had Nest thermostats installed,  and when we moved in, I didn't bother reinstalling them.  I was like, eh. I even own them!

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And this was like, eh.  Yeah, the Nest really bummed me out when I got one.  But they, a couple, maybe  months ago, they finally added  GPS via your cell phone  to turn the  heater on and off.  So as you get closer, you could...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Transcript:  Before it was this one little sensor in the hallway  or something, and whenever  somebody walks by, it would trip it, but now  it actually, the app actually uses  your phone to know where you are and whether someone's in your  house, and turns on and off  that way. And that works a lot better.  But yeah, I mean, it's just a thermostat.  Whatever. The interesting  thing I had heard about Nest is that  it was like a  recode report, I think, where  they were kind of on  like a three-year funding plan  at Alphabet, and that three-year funding plan  is about to run out.  And I think they get to pick  if they're going to just spin off Nest  and say, goodbye, have fun.  Or they could leave Alphabet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or Alphabet would... They could get kicked out.  They could get kicked out of the Alphabet club.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess, yeah. I mean,  Alphabet is a, you know,  as a company full of companies, some of these  companies are going to fail.  And we don't know  what happens when that happens.  So that will be an interesting  thing to see.  I don't know. Google has

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  banned payday loan advertisements,  thank goodness, on its AdSense  platform. It's about time.  This seems the rules aren't  too draconian.  If your interest rate is 36%  or more a year,  or you have  to pay back in fewer than two  months, we're not  going to do ads for you. I think  that's fair. Do you think so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. No, I'm...  You're serious? Well,  I'm concerned about...  I mean...  You know, it's... I don't like payday loans.  Okay, this is interesting. No, I see what you're saying.  Yeah. But Google  says we simply... They're not illegal.  Right. They're not illegal. So  if they were illegal,  then obviously Google should not  provide advertising for them.  But if they're legal and people are choosing to  use those services for whatever reason,  why  should Google not allow them to do that?  Very interesting. It feels  a little bit like,  you know, sort of escort ads and  those sorts of things. Lots of those things are not  technically illegal.  Authorities have been trying to get  lots of services  to not include them  to not... But if it's  a legal service,  you know, if I'm, for whatever  reason, decide to use that,  why shouldn't I be allowed  to see ads for that and then  choose to do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a slippery... I see what you're  saying. Now I'm coming around to your point  of view. Because it's  a slippery slope. Because this is now  Google not merely enforcing  the law, but making policy decisions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And so I think  it's fine if we all agree  that payday loans are shady  and so we're fine with that. Make them illegal if they're bad.  But you know, it's like, first they came  for the payday loan ads and  then they came for the thing that  I actually like. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, related to this, the  rumor, and I don't know if it's true, and Facebook denies it,  that their  editorial team were,  these temporary curators  that Facebook hired were blocking  some conservative content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's interesting. First  they denied it.  And then they said, we're looking into it.  Oh. So...  Those two things are mutually incompatible.  Right. Like, either it didn't happen  or you're looking into it.  So, and I feel like  definitely there's some pressure  the Senate wants to  talk to Facebook about it.  They don't actually have, the interesting thing is the  Senate sent a letter  and they don't actually,  they don't have any right to  tell Facebook what to do with its trending topics.  Al Franken

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is always sending letters out, too, right?  Jeff Roberts

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  wrote for us about the  First Amendment and how it applies to  algorithms and various other  methods through which you do things. That applies  to both Google and Facebook.  So it's not as though the Senate can say,  you know, here's how you have to run  your trending topics. But for me,  the real issue is,  everyone got obsessed with the  human beings fiddling with things  and trending topics. The thing that I find  interesting is the algorithm that runs  the newsfeed, which routinely  chooses to highlight certain things  and not highlight other things.  Those are all effectively editorial  decisions that Facebook is making.  And you and I have  no clue why they make  them. They claim that it's  just to serve you and show you things  you like. But there are some  very real implications  around that in terms of people's consumption  of the news, the things they see  Facebook chooses to hide,  you know, news about  Syria or news about  attacks on black  people or whatever. And so you don't  see them because you  spend a lot of time on Facebook and it's one of  your main sources of news that  has some very, very, I think  fundamental implications for  sort of society in  general. How do we, and Facebook,  my big problem is  Facebook kind of pretends that that doesn't  happen. So they say, well,  it's an algorithm and it just does  what you want. The end.  That's sort of their standard response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is kind of the problem Google's had though, too, right?  Google's also algorithmically generated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But algorithms are, you know, people.  They're made of people. It's like swirling green, right?  Yeah, it's made of people. And so human beings  tinker with the algorithm.  And if what you have is a lot of  and I'm not saying this specifically about  Facebook, but if what you have is  a lot of sort of 20-something  white guys from Silicon Valley  running your algorithm, it's going to make  certain decisions, you know,  that may or may not be appropriate.  Tom Stocky, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google search kind of  ends up having the same problem  a bit because it, um,  they personalize your results all the time  based on your history and what you've clicked on in the past.  And if you go on Google search,  there's like a little, a little man  and a little world button. And if you  click on the world button, it will turn off the personalization.  But it kind of ends up  building like a bubble around  your search results where you,  you know, it only shows you, or it has  a bias to show you things you've read in the past.  So it will block out kind of alternative  viewpoints, which is weird.  Um, but it's, it's good  for some stuff because like I can type in,  I can type in  almost anything and it will be  related to Android because of  my search habits and research and all that.  But if you're searching for  political stuff or whatever, it's,  it's weird and kind of unwanted.  It's actually a little more of an issue with Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's easy to adjust the Facebook algorithm.  I just ended up following all the  uh, uh, candidates, Republican  and Democratic for president. And that  really helped, uh, create  a more broad feed.  In fact, one of my friends said, what are you following Donald?  What, you liked Donald Trump on Facebook?  I said, yeah, and so should you.  Because if you don't want to ignore  everything you disagree with,  if you should disagree with them.  But lots of people do. That's,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that's, so not everyone is going to go for that effort.  Yeah.  They probably do it in their lives as well.  Filter bubbles, filter bubbles  were, were possible before too, right?  I mean, we all knew people  who only watched one  news program or only read one  columnist in one right-wing newspaper.  I'm married to the only Republican  in Northern California, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know about filter bubbles, baby.  But with the liking Donald Trump thing,  it's like you, you have to, you have to read

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  something first in order to disagree with it.  So, you know,  I mean, I think it's good to do that.  And it broadens you and,  but people are going to, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a lot, I know a lot of people put their finger  on both sides, put their finger in their ears  when somebody says something from the other side.  Yeah, that's not, but that's just human.  The thing I find interesting is  Google can't fix that.  I mean, Facebook has talked  in the past about  the fact that you can't  fix that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, you can't fix that.  It has talked in the past about  doing research  into how the structure  of the newsfeed affects people's  political behavior,  affects the way they see the world, affects  whether they vote, things  like that. There's a huge amount  of power when you're as big  and influential as Facebook is.  And I know, you know, journalist  friends have said, well, newspapers  and editors make editorial  decisions about what to include  in their version of the newsfeed, which is the  web page or the website  or the newspaper. But  there is no newspaper that is  as big as Facebook. There is no newspaper  on which, you know,  of millennials find most of their political  news. There just simply has never  been a media entity like  that before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been saying this for years about Google, I say  it now about Facebook, because they both wield  immense power.  And they are private corporations that  aren't required to be balanced and  fair in any way. But they  have, but I think there's a higher moral  responsibility on both, for both

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  parties. And the thing is, they don't,  neither one of them is particularly, Google's  gotten a lot better. I mean,  I think years of criticism  of things like Google News has, they've  gotten a lot better. Facebook is  still refusing to  even have the discussion. So  when all this stuff comes up, they just  go silent, or they come out with a statement  that says, you know, the algorithm  is this magical thing that chooses  things based on your behavior, and  we're totally scrupulously fair  and objective, or whatever, which just  simply can't be true.  So I would much rather  they at least started  having the discussions, started  saying, yes, you're right, we are a big  media entity. The things we do  can have these huge  social effects. And so  we should talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tom Stocky, who is  VP of Search at Facebook,  posted a couple of days ago,  my team is responsible for trending topics  and I want to address the reports about  Facebook's contractors  manipulating them.  By the way, they are anonymous  reports in that, you know, right  there. And he writes a nice,  I think, piece. And I think it is  true that Facebook  understands  this responsibility. And  I mean, at the very least, they  don't want to get caught doing it.  I don't think they're tempted, though.  I think that they understand that their  business, he says, our review, finally says,  our review guidelines for trending topics are under constant review.  We'll continue to look for  improvements. We'll also keep looking into any  questions about trending topics  to ensure that people are matched.  This is where you might get into trouble.  Matched with the stories that are predicted to be the most  interesting to them.  And to be sure that our methods are as neutral and effective  as possible. Those seem like contradictory things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, those are totally opposite things.  If it's neutral,  then you can't match it to what someone  might want to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You might have a problem with that last sentence there.  It's a difficult thing to do, but, you know, I think Facebook,  I would not expect Facebook to,  in any way, be trying to manipulate the feed.  I mean, you can't imagine someone  sidling up to Mark Zuckerberg  and say, Mark, what would it take for you to throw me to presidential?  And I don't think they do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I don't think they're deliberately mucking around in things  to change people's opinions.  In fact, it came up at a Q&A, I think.  Facebook employees said,  should we be doing something to stop Donald Trump?  And, you know, everyone said, well, no, that's not what we would do.  And that's not part of what we're supposed to do.  My problem is that  they will sort of accidentally do that.  And I think that's a good thing.  And I think that's a good thing.  And I think that's a good thing.  Is that they will sort of accidentally do things  that affect the way people vote  or when they vote or who they vote for  or how they see the world  by pursuing their other interests.  So not deliberately.  Sort of acts as a secondary effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's an interesting question.  Yeah, see, there's an article for Fortune  written by a colleague of yours  in Mount.  Facebook employees, big Hillary Clinton donors.  But that's neither here nor there.  I would hope  that their politics would not intrude  into their algorithm.  There is always the potential, though, for unconscious...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and some people pointed out the things that  if you look at the things that were removed  or that these anonymous sources  said were removed from trending topics,  it was garbage  news reports from right-wing  news sites that have no  basis in fact.  And so I guess it's a little like payday loans.  Those are the sort of political reporting version  of payday loans. We can all agree  well, that's dumb. You shouldn't include that  because it's garbage.  But what about the next thing?  What about this other link that's slightly more credible?  Who says it's garbage, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but also the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  first report that was like  Gizmodo or something, I think,  they have tools to inject  stories artificially into the trending  topic thing, which is also  crazy, because you can  influence stuff just as much as  you can, you know, adding stuff from removing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they were also  prevented from... It's a little  like Twitter moments aren't allowed to be about  Twitter. So Facebook trending topics  at one point were not allowed to be about

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Facebook. Because then would only be about

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twitter. There would all be Twitter. It's a  giant echo chamber.  The problem is it's very hard to watch dog  something like this.  It's completely  opaque. Both Google's search algorithm  and Facebook's trending topics  or news algorithm. They're completely opaque.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I know there's been, you know, in Google's case, there's been  lots of people trying to  push for, you  know, trying to make search neutrality  the same as net neutrality, and trying  to force Google to  basically  publicize the algorithm  or to guarantee that  they're not going to fiddle with the results.  I mean, nobody that  I don't think would improve the problem  or improve the situation  might actually make things worse.  It's not  that Google and Facebook, you know,  part of the value they add is by  is through the selection process.  I just think there are implications beyond  beyond just,  oh, my news feed  sucks or my search results  are terrible. You know, there are implications  beyond just the  results you're getting because it does  determine those filter bubbles help  shape your world view to some extent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We take you now  to a Renaissance  Festival in Central Russia  where a drone  is shooting imagery of the knights  and ladies and lords and  a combat  scene. That's a drone footage.  But notice one of the knights  takes umbrage at this  20th century technology  and hurls the speed, takes the drone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Samsung Galaxy Note  from nine to five Google.  August 15th. This is the  new Note the six.  I have to say I have tried all the  the Android competitors.  I don't know what you use. I'll ask you in a second.  I've settled on the Galaxy S7 as my  daily driver.  But I love the Note and I do like  the stylus and maybe this one I won't be able to put the  stylus in backwards.  Because I broke my  That video was awesome. Oh man.  Oh man.  Now what would be interesting and this  is the rumor type C  connector.  Finally. Well you know I realized  the reason they didn't do it on the Galaxy S7  was because they wanted to fit in the Gear VR  which uses a micro USB

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  connector. Yep. So I  guess that means we're getting a new Gear VR. Yeah.  Right. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got the HTC 10.  I want to be open. I love HTC and  everybody was saying oh this is the best HTC  in years and I'd agree with that. You know what's nice  now? Top of the line Android  phones are  all good. I wouldn't say  there's anything wrong with any of them. This one does  have a type C connector  which I really am a fan of the type C connector.  Unlike this S7  it's an IPS LCD screen not an  OLED screen. I do like the OLED screen on  the S7. Let me unlock the S7 here.  What do you use?  I bet you're a 6P kind of guy  Ron because you seem like a pure  guy. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I always have some kind of Nexus phone.  My daily driver is actually the 5X  because it's smaller. Right.  And I definitely  enjoy that size more.  But I would love to have an aluminum version  that would be super awesome. That's one of the things

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do like about this. This is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah and I'm a big fan of the  HTC 10. It's a  they did a great job with that thing. I agree.  Especially from HTC I never really expected  anything that good and it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  really great. I miss the  front facing speakers.  They got rid of those and now they have a tweeter  and a woofer. Yeah.  I don't get that. That's kind of dopey.  The camera's good. It's the 6P  sensor. They have the  Zoe's as always are here.  I still think the S7 is a better  sensor. Battery life is better on the  S7. I do like a long battery and the  S7 has really been the champ. Although  HTC 10 is no slouch.  It gets  through the day anyway.  It's just with a little bit less  by the end of the day. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The S7, it's a shame the version we got.  If you want to be a real connoisseur  you need to import the Exynos  version which is faster and  has better battery life and  just totally kills the Snapdragon  820. Oh yeah.  It's a lot nicer.  Last year's S6 was Exynos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't like the S6.  Exynos couldn't keep up.  The new Exynos probably is better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Benchmarks are better than the  S820 and in our test  at least the battery life was way  better. Way better is big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Always want better.  Well I will also be very interested  in the Note 6 and if it comes out  August 15th, that's a little earlier than last  year, that would be good timing.  So  if you can wait a few more months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I haven't seen that. Did it say they were  changing anything or adding  anything? Just the Type-C connector.  Big. Great.  It's Samsung.  They're not big on giant  massive changes. It's just they just keep  going. When

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you got a winner, go with it, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, true. They are winning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And also when you got a loser, go with it.  Right? They don't, they go with it.  They've had a few losers  in their time.  The S5, what a terrible phone that  was. Let me see what 9 to 5.  This is a rumor of course. It's a leak with 9 to 5.  I guess it'll have nut roll on it.  Android N.  This comes from  Evan Blass, EvLeaks.  So usually, he's pretty good, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  I can guess.  It'll have a Snapdragon 820 and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, wait a minute. Get ready.  5.8 inch display, bigger display.  And 4000 milliamp  hour battery, biggest battery yet.  I'm liking that.  12 megapixel camera, micro SD  slot is back.  As it was with the S7.  Also a choice between  Exynos and Snapdragon 823.  What's the 823?  Whoa. What? No, that's not a real thing.  Is that a typo?  Is that a typo? Because the 820 is...  You know, what do you think about  this, Ron? Because I've been saying this and I think this is true.  I think all the Android flagship phones  got screwed by the 810. That turned out to be  a bum chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah, absolutely. It was way too  hot. It throttled all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so HTC and others really  suffered from that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we've had like a whole lost year of Android flagships.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lost year. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because Qualcomm needed to rush it out the door  in order to get that 64-bit tag.  So they grabbed ARM  CPU cores off the shelf  and just kind of shoved it into a chip and shoved it  out the door and we're like, it's 64-bit, we did it.  But this  year they're back to using their own  cores and things are a lot cooler  and nicer and yeah, the  820 is a way better chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what the 823 is. They're also going to use the same...  Oh no, it is. There is an  There is an 823 and it will be  first in the Note 6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this is the first...  This is the first we've heard of this. This is not like a  for real thing anyone's heard of  before. So who knows  what's going to be different?  What? What? What? What? What? Up to 3  GHz. Wow. Okay. That would be  super duper fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They also will do a slightly  higher clocking on the Exynos  than the S7 as well.  So don't get too attached to your phone  kids.  There's a new one every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you see that the  feds are apparently  said to be taking a second look at  Google search? This is from

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Politico.  Not normally considered one of the big  Google reporter  outlets, but this is what they're saying.  They've got good fed contacts though.  They're in DC.  FTC asking questions about  whether Google has abused its dominance  in the internet search market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apparently they've been meeting  with representatives of a  major US company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you say Yahoo?  No, it must be Bing.  Yeah, they said major.  Oh, burn!  Yeah, obviously it's Bing. And that's what really bugs  me. The same thing in the EU.  The EU's actions against Google  all came from complaints from  Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, although in Europe, I think  my sense is there's  a much more receptive environment.  So Microsoft  might be the one. It was an easy nudge.  Right. But lots of  countries, they feel  Google is too dominant  because they dominate  the search market in lots  of smaller European countries.  Even more so than  some countries. I think it's like 90%.  Even in France, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where it's only 60 or 70%  here because of Bing, I guess.  Well, that's  in a way you could say  Microsoft brought it on  because it was the  results in the EU  that apparently stimulated this FTC  second look.  But the FTC will  not comment because agency investigations  are non-public.  But apparently, according to  the reports, they've been meeting with companies  more than one concerning Google's  dealings over Android as well.  That's the other thing. The EU  slapped Google for predatory practices  with Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's interesting. I don't know  what, Ron, what you think of that, but  the Android case,  a bunch of it was about  basically forcing people to take  Google Play  as part of the deal,  which everyone kind of compared  to Microsoft forcing  people to take the browser  effectively. Very similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the  difference is that Windows  is not open source and Android is.  And if you don't want Google Play, you are free to  go grab the Android source code and  kind of make your own version  and make your own app store. And Amazon does  that with the Fire stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So... Okay, but wait.  But if you do that,  true, and I agree with you, and I think Google's getting  beat up for doing something that Apple  doesn't get beat up for doing only because they have an  open source version.  But one of the things Google does  do is if you do make an AOSP  open source version phone, you can never  use... That company now is  banned from doing a Google Services

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  version. That they could  absolutely... And that was one thing the EU  didn't like. That's probably the strongest  thing. Harsh.  And actually I've heard Amazon has  a real hard time getting Fire devices  built because so many companies  are under the Google  Play contract. They're just like, nope, we can't  build that for you. We're sorry.  So that's... Yeah, it's really  lame. That they could definitely get

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  beat up for. But you do have to...  I have to give Google some cred  for making an open source operating system.  Supporting it, keeping it up out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and Europe had to bend  over backwards even to...  I mean, they had... They described the  claim so  that it would only apply to Google.  So it was only applied to  companies that have an open source  operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's only one of those. You may remember  in the previous investigation, the FTC  did rule against Google, but it was a slap on  the wrist. A very minor fine and  a few things that Google had to do  going forward. In fact, some people complained.  Remember the Wall Street Journal?  Also a hereditary enemy of Google.  Wrote an article saying some FTC lawyers  had argued for stronger  sanctions.  So maybe they're  back at the table. I don't know.  An investigation is not...  Doesn't mean anything. It's just an investigation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I gotta say, I feel like  there's far more...  If you want to go after  a company for  a dominant position  in some growing and  highly relevant market,  you'd probably wind up going after Facebook before  you would Google. Not that search isn't  still relevant, but it doesn't...  You know, there's...  With apps and social services  and people are finding things a lot  in a lot different ways than  a Google search box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Love...  This is from  Recode. Irv Azov  who is a  superstar agent.  He's the guy who talks like Colombo by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dear YouTube, an open  letter from Irv.  You have built a business that works really well  for you and Google, but it doesn't work well for  artists. When the artist  sends a takedown, it should be  a stay down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice.  This is the  old mainstream  music industry talking to  the new kid in town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If music matters to YouTube,  why not give musicians the same choice  you give yourselves? Taylor Swift should be

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  able to decide which of her songs are available  for free and which are part of a paid service.  Or,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  she should be able to opt out of YouTube  if you won't give her the choice. But artists  can't opt out of YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because of the DMCA,  the only way for an artist to keep a song off YouTube  is for that artist to send YouTube a notice  every time that song is uploaded by  a different user. That is impossible.  Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.  That's just not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The content ID system  that you flaunt is meaningless  when YouTube continues to hide behind the safe  harbor provisions of the DMCA.  That's why they're there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The safe harbor provisions  give YouTube a safe harbor.  Yeah, it's funny how

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually wrote something about  who's the guy who runs the  Record Record Industry Association?  The RIA.  Who is it these days? Is it Ted Ninja?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Satan.  Satan.  So he was

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  saying similar things about  and you know what they really want to do?  Michael Gondry?  They want to get rid of the DMCA and safe harbor  altogether.  That's what Azov is basically saying.  And radio if they could.  If they could, they would just go back and un-invent  radio and the compulsory license.  Carrie Sherman  is the...  They want to fight the last war.  Not this war.  Actually it's two wars ago I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they're  fighting Korea.  It's the Korean conflict.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know what these guys are complaining about.  I really think like Content ID is  pretty much the perfect system  because you can upload a song to it  and it will  repeatedly, automatically, instantly  slap down every video that  contains that song. Or you can  choose to monetize it. You can choose to totally  take it down or choose to monetize  it with your own ads.  It's a great compromise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually Hank Green,  the YouTube  star and  author and  for all I know he's in the circus as well,  he wrote  a letter responding to Irving  saying exactly what you just finished  saying. That yes, you can  actually keep it off YouTube.  Or you can choose to monetize it. The whole system  is designed to do that. It may not be perfect

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but the fact that everybody  hates it, music industry and content creators  means it's probably a pretty  successful compromise.  I think it does the job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If there's a big problem with YouTube,  it's false  takedown. There are  companies that spend all their time  forcing YouTube to  take things down and they don't have the right  to do that. Speaking of YouTube,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amazon's launching a service for  content creators. Some say to compete with  YouTube. I don't think it is actually a direct  competitor called Video  Direct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't think it's a direct competitor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No. And I'll tell you why.  We were looking at it. It would be great for us.  There are three ways you can play on Video Direct.  One is you can put your content there for free  and Amazon Prime members will be  able to see it for free. And YouTube  has  said they're going to put, I'm sorry, Amazon  has said they're going to put a million bucks a month aside  to distribute among the top 100 most  subscribed to content providers.  So there will be some potential upside for you  but you'll get free distribution on  a huge platform, Amazon Prime.  The second way  is you can do a pay service. They will let you  sell your shows right  next to the shows from  HBO and CBS and everybody  else. And the third way is more YouTube  like. Amazon will put advertising  on it  and you'll share a 55-45  split in favor of Amazon  revenue from that advertising. That's very  much like YouTube. But here's why  I say it's not probably  for everybody. A, we  wouldn't be able, we'd have to cut the ads out of  our stuff. Not a big  deal. We have some ad free content, you know,  our highlights, reels and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We could put that up there. What do you mean? You can't have competitive  ads? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, okay. And the second  problem is you have to have  closed captioning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you do? Yeah. Which is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm all for, I'm not against closed captioning.  That's great. And the  only reason we don't do it is it's hideously expensive.  And so, and they're not offering some sort  of automated system like YouTube does.  You'd have to pay for it. So  at least  that's when we went through the, you know,  as soon as I saw this yesterday, I, you know,  went through, Lisa and I sat down and went through the  terms of service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I  wrote this up too  and I said that it was a  it was a competitor for the professional  side of YouTube. That's who it's for.  If you actually  go to the Amazon site and click the  upload button, you have to make an account.  And to make this account, you need to have  a company name and you need  to connect a bank account to  Amazon for direct deposit  and you need to give them like a  tax ID for tax information  for all the money you're going to make.  So that cuts out  the whole like viral cat video  side of YouTube. It's definitely not that. And that's exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  my point. Interesting. Yeah, but if you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  a machinima or TYT  networkers, one of these like  pro or semi pro YouTubers, then you could  you could jump in on this. Right. In fact,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they've got a one of their content partners  is machinima. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I'm reading off the  the partner list. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I, you know,  and maybe they'll change the closed caption  that maybe just an ADA requirement  that you  that Amazon has to adhere to for some

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  reason. So maybe you could upload it to  YouTube and get them to do the closed captioning  and then they're closed captioning so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's terrible. It is.  Yeah, that's that's a disservice  to deaf people. That's just  you should know and should have to read  those captions. That's part of  the problem, too, is, of course, our content is technical  and requires  you know, and there'd be a lead time also.  So it's not great for news content  because we'd have to send it off, get a  closed caption, and then get it up there. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  must admit, I can't decide whether  this is like someone  at Amazon thought,  you know, we do Kindle direct publishing. Why don't  we do something similar for  video and we'll just see what happens?  Like, I don't know if it's a kind of  let's throw it out there and  see what happens or if they're actually going to invest  some time and resources  in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The thing that gets me is that I feel  like the Amazon Prime video  interface is horrible. And  now you're going to mix in  all these kind of YouTube channels  with TV shows and movies  and all this other stuff. It's not  their interface is not ready for this  at all. Well, that's the other reason it's not a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  YouTube competitor. YouTube really is optimized  for browsing.  And it works great that way.  To watch this  on a Roku or a Fire TV  or my television Smart TV  software is not going to  be as satisfying. It feels almost like it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  more of a Netflix competitor.  Where they kind of want it to be. I mean, they certainly want  Prime Video to be. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  why not? Look, it's clear that if you're  Amazon or Netflix or  anybody in this space, you want to have as  much content  original exclusive content as you can.  And why  not put it on there? Except for that issue  you raised, which is it makes user interface

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually wrote something  I can't remember if it was yesterday  or the  the whole the entire  video market.  Whether it's long form  or TV style shows  or cable or YouTube  videos or  Facebook Live. I mean, it's just a massive  kind of  if you had a map  all the borders and boundaries that used to  exist would be erased.  You know, there's it's just a massive kind  of redrawing of the landscape  where everyone is effectively  trying to compete with everyone else.  Even Facebook Live  now is not live.  Lots of companies are using it to upload  archive stuff.  It's just it's fascinating because it's  so chaotic.  You know, it's so  and literally everyone is competing with everyone  else.

Transcript:  Disney getting out of the video game business  I guess the infinity. I just bought the infinity  stuff.  We have it.  We had the collector's item. I know. I guess  that's it. Hey, leave it in the box.  Don't open

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  hardware and software wise.  We could talk about, you know, Linux,  Mint or...  We were talking about that. I mean, we were both saying how...  I do like Mint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm amazed that you use it. You used  Linux on the desktop in lieu of  like Windows or Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep. Yep. I have a Macbook as well.  And I love Mac.  I just...  At one point I decided to try and run  Ubuntu and then  I switched to Linux,  Mint.  But it's not that new or exciting.  I actually had a number because I thought  Jeff's not here. Give us a number.  I love it. So I came across  since we were talking about YouTube,  I came across  a research report  from Bernstein  about  YouTube.  And of course it's hard to get sort of hard numbers  out of YouTube about  numbers of videos, you know,  the size of the archive,  that type of stuff. So this analyst,  I came up with his own  estimates based on research  that he did  going through a bunch of different YouTube videos  and extrapolating.  His estimate is that as of this quarter,  YouTube has  about 2 billion videos  corresponding to  12 billion minutes  or 197 million hours  of content.  I just thought those numbers were  yeah, really mind-bogglingly  large.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, in a way, Amazon doesn't want to do  that, right? That's not what Amazon's  trying to do. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And even if you were to try to do that,  YouTube is so  far ahead of you already.  You know, you could still have a half-decent service,  but you're not going to do that.  YouTube videos have been watched  an estimated 39 trillion times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, YouTube keeps a running  stack page up and run, I think,  all the time. It's like YouTube.com slash stats  or something, or maybe it's in the press site where they just have  like every second  10 billion hours of YouTube videos  watched or something. It's amazing.  And the numbers keep going up.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want that site.  YouTube stats.  Maybe it's on the press site. I would love to  just have that up on the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, just search YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here it is in the press site.  It's YouTube.com slash  YT slash press slash statistics  dot HTML, but this doesn't look like it's real  time.  I'd love a real time. Wouldn't you love to see that?  Real time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It'd be moving so fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Awesome.  Ron, something you want to plug, something you like these days,  something you're excited about, nobody knows about, but you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to be a huge  dork and recommend a Star Trek podcast.  Nice.  It started  30 episodes in, so yeah,  it's pretty new. It's called The Greatest Generation.  And the  tagline is a Star Trek podcast  by two guys that are a little bit embarrassed  to have a Star Trek podcast.  That's the kind of guys I want to listen to.  You know, it's not like the  I'm sure there's like super nerd stuff out there  or they're, you know, really into it,  but this is just kind of two guys making fun of  Star Trek and  kind of revisiting it since  like, if you're my  age, you probably saw  the next generation on TV when you  were kind of a kid and a lot of the stuff went over your  head and now  they kind of go back and look at  everything and are great  at coming up with running jokes  and now they've done the whole  HD transfer to Blu-ray.  So like, stuff that  looked fine on your TV  back then, now you  look at it in HD and it's like, oh, that's  definitely a piece of cardboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's cool is they go  it's an episode. So are they watching together  and talking about it or are they just  or should you watch it first and then  listen to the podcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I like to watch the  while you're listening. They go episode by  episode, yeah. I wouldn't recommend playing  it that much since it's definitely  crude humor. Oh yeah, I could tell from  the title.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It makes me sad that you said watching  the next generation when you were a kid.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I watched the original  Star Trek when I was a kid. Star Trek podcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  by two guys who are a little bit  embarrassed to have a Star Trek podcast.  They got the nice NPR sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's good.  They comment on that a lot too.  They sound like an NPR podcast about Star  Trek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's very funny though.  It's been pretty awesome and they're only 30 episodes  in so they started episode one  and worked their way up. They just got through the  horrible season one  where everything's made out of cardboard  and yeah, season one  was a hot mess.  It's getting good now. I have three

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  numbers as well.  One comes from our chat  room. Creeney Kornkop says PewDiePie's  total views on YouTube. Total views  12 billion.  47 million.  983 thousand and 37.  Oh, make that 38. Oh, make that 39.  12 billion PewDiePie views.  He's been seen more than all  the sitcoms combined.  Of all time. Of all time.  Wow. It's just mind-boggling.  Of course, it's the same  58 kids watching it a billion  times each.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And of course, TV folks  will say you can't compare  YouTube video to a Nielsen  TV viewer. Of course, you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I agree with him. As an old time media guy.  Here's another number. 268 million  dollars. That's how much the Japanese  satellite cost  that was destroyed by a software  update. What?  The Japanese x-ray telescope Hitomi  has been declared  lost. It disintegrated in orbit  torn apart while spinning out of  control. Early analysis points  to bad data in a software package  pushed shortly  after an instrument probe was extended from the rear  of the satellite. Oops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they bricked it and it crashed. They bricked  it and it crashed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kids, don't root your satellite  while it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  in space. Don't run as  root on your satellite. Never. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Matt. Matthew  Ingram. Yes. And  finally. It was a Windows  update. It really was.  It was a Windows 10 upgrade.  The most expensive Windows 10 upgrade. And here's  another number. 2 million  eight hundred. No. Two hundred eighteen thousand.  The all time Donkey Kong  record broken.  West Copeland. Actually,  I'm sorry. It's one million two hundred eighteen  thousand. Actually, you're missing the one  because no one. They never when they designed  Donkey Kong. They never let anybody go to  this record.  I think it was a  game that was  played for  one million seven digits  one point two million  and he played for how long straight?  I think thirty six hours. Something like that.  Wow. Wait a minute. No, I can't  be right. But he  he  he has been the Donkey Kong  champion for a long  time.  The pair who held the record in  that show are now eighteenth and  nineteenth. So apparently in the intervening  nine years have been a lot of people.  A lot of people working  on this. It's an all new  record.  He did it on May  fifth. I'm trying to find  how long he played for. I don't think he was that long  actually. Oh, the thing that's amazing.  He never died. He it was all  with the same character.  He didn't lose a single Mario in the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He got one quarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, one quarter obviously.  The record has to be  one quarter.  But he didn't even lose a life.  He's going to retire.  He said, that's it. You can't get any better  than that. This is a record that will never be broken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My last

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  record score.  I don't believe I can put up a game  any higher than this says West Copeland.  He's the king.  Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes this  episode. I love it that  the one is missing  because nobody ever thought anyone would get anything  like that.  Yeah, that's a good question. Was he wearing headphones  or did he have to listen to that stupid music over  and over and over and over and over and over and over?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so much for being here. Matthew Ingram  from Fortune.com. Always a pleasure.  Look at the bright  side, the lake, the ice is melting and the lake  will soon be ready for  canoeing.
