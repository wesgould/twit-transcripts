Which includes the cloud verse, the Twitter verse, and the Facebook verse.  Chapter and verse with Danny Sullivan of searchengineland.com.  Hello, Danny. Hello.  I'm glad you're here today.  Briefly, you looked like you'd get promoted to Admiral, which is always a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll go back. My wife won't let me wear it.  She says it looks like some kind of weird S&M kind of cap.  It does. I'll just put it this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you had a handlebar mustache, I'd start to worry.  I do.  Young men, there's no need to feel down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyway, there we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Searchengineland.com. It is also a pleasure to welcome Mr. Jeffrey Jarvis, professor of journalism at the City University of New York.  Where are you today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm in Atlanta. At the Atlanta Journal Constitution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice. A newspaper.  A newspaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They still print these.  You can't quite smell the ink anymore, but it has that feeling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it must be nice. Is it nice for an old newspaper man to go to a print newspaper and just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is. It is. It's nice to see a newsroom, and they still exist, and they're doing their jobs, and calling around and getting stories, and yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been watching Julio O'Hara de Zapata's...  He's with the Pioneer Press in Minneapolis, in the Twin Cities, and they just moved into a new building.  It's actually kind of a nice new building. I've been watching his pictures, his Instagram pictures of the new office space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you see the Washington Post departure from their old building?  They moved?  Oh, they moved, yeah. And the great thing is they all wrote on the wall before they left. Woodward and Bernstein came back.  Wow.  And a marching band came in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was the old All the President's Men newsroom.  And it was a rat trap, literally. A rat trap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I bet it was. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Times, are they still in the gray lady?  No.  AOL's there now, or somebody, right? Who's this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, AOL in a bowling alley. So the Times is extinct.  And they spent a huge fortune on the building, and then they ran out of cash, and they had to basically sell the building.  If they had just waited to sell the old building, which they sold at a horrible price, they would have saved themselves.  Because...  Real estate's not their business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's on Times Square. Maybe people don't know that, but that's why it's called Times Square. The New York Times was there.  That's where my office is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And now Jeff is.  That's where Twit's East Coast outlet will be.  Soon.  Soon.  Very excited about that.  We can find a producer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you gotten any responses to your ad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not as many as we need, so we need more.  Oh. BIT. What is the link?  Oh, I forget. It was last week. It was not BIT.ly. It was something.  It was in last week's rundown. Jason!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll find it. We'll give you the link one more time for the job, because we want to get some applicants.  Get it up at the early part of the show.  Yep. Soon joining us in a little bit will be...  Right now, in fact.  Oh, he's here.  Yes, I do have him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Perfect timing.  Yay!  This is Jeff. Jeff did the good job, good work here of getting Simon Rogers with us.  He's at Google. He's data editor at Google.  Hi, Simon.  Hi. How are you doing?  Am I getting your title correct?  You are getting my title correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He sounds like he edits all of Google.  Yeah, what is a data editor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, it's not about being a good mathematician, because it turns out when I was a kid, I was terrible at math.  So, this is really about being a data journalist. I'm a data journalist at Google, and I work on telling stories with this incredible data set that Google has of the way people search around the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, this used to be Zeitgeist, and it's now called what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, now it's called Year in Search. So, originally, this was the thing that Google started, this idea during the year end review.  You loved it.  I don't know if you can remember the old days, and there'd be a video and something uplifting, obviously, and there'd be a kind of marketing website, and that was it.  And everybody now does this. World and His Wife has a year in review website and a nice uplifting video with uplifting music.  And we thought this year would be nice to do something a little bit different.  And I worked for the News Lab, which is the Google team, which really is about thinking about what's next for the future of news and what Google can do to support it.  So, the idea was this year, let's try and do something which is journalistically interesting and contains a ton of data that people can then download and use and has lots of charts and visualizations.  And really tries to bring some kind of hard numbers to this incredible year that we've just gone through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I really like this because video is really powerful in a few seconds, conveying an idea, an emotion, and bringing back the memory of Black Lives Matter or Cecil the Lion.  It's just instantly. And I guess that's part of your job as data editor, is bringing data to life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, that's the idea of it. So, we have two things going on here.  We've got the video, which was done by this great team here.  And the one thing I've done with it, I've kind of spoiled it for surprise a little bit, is that it has the Caitlyn Jenner speech that she gave at the ESPY Awards, kind of narrating the whole thing.  And that's a really clever device and it works really well.  And then the other thing that we've done is this website, which is, and this is the first time we've ever done this, we've got like 200 odd stories around the big news moments of the year.  And they've been translated into 43 languages.  And these are full of charts and visuals and things that we want people to be able to use themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, and this is the first time, as I understand before, all of the searches were kind of relative, like this is bigger than that.  This is the first time you're putting some raw numbers out in this. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely. We've never done that before. So if you go to the website, you will see raw numbers.  You will see the nearly 900 million searches there were around Paris, for instance.  What is the website address so I can pull it up while we're talking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's google.com slash 2015. Oh, I should have known that. Nice and easy.  You can get good URLs there. Yeah, Google has URLs. So you'll find the video there right at the top, but also, wow, 800 and 9000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So look at all those lovely, lovely raw numbers. And we've never ever done that before.  And so the great thing is you can really get a sense of the relative kind of significance of the year.  And there's a great visual, which our team have done, which is in the official Google blog about this event.  Which you can see, you can see them all in one place as well.  And the stories go from things like Cecil the Lion to through the Women's World Cup to the big kind of heavy stories like the Iran nuclear deal, of course, the Paris attacks and the Greece crisis and so on.  So if you click on one of those links, save them in the puller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, when you have that list like Paris under attack and that's at the top with about a billion searches, are you saying that that's the most searched for topic during the year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So out of those stories that we chose, I mean, we kind of made it as a choice selection.  You know, we wanted to have a nice kind of selection of sorts out of the stories that we chose to look at.  It was the easily the biggest story. I mean, substantially.  I'm going to send you, I'm going to send you, if you go into the Google blog as well, there's an amazing visual, which unfortunately we did too late to get onto the site, which shows you all these stories lined up together.  You can see how Paris just dominates everything in just a few days.  And in fact, it was the highest searches just for the word Paris in all history of Google.  So there we are. We're adding questions, the top questions people ask and that visual there, that one in dark there, that's a visual where you can see the news spread around the world on Google search.  So that's something where, you know, the attacks took place at about 18 minutes past the hour.  They started happening within two or three minutes.  People were searching to find out what was going on as the story spread much faster than conventional news media could ever hope to cover it.  So the idea is all of this stuff, it's all embeddable. You can embed that little map or one of those lists.  And it's all there for people to share.  And we want to be, you know, this report to be really transparent and really give people a sense of what the world was like, not in a kind of, you know, isn't everything great, uplifting way, but in much more of a kind of we've got this data set.  We want people out there to be able to use it and share it because you think about it, they're like three billion searches a day.  The kind of insights I can give you into the way that people think and behave and the things that people care about.  That's kind of unique. And we've got a responsibility to make that data available and help people use it to find out more things about the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is this button? Download this data. What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's on some of the pages where we've got a key data set.  So that, for instance, was is index search interest in Beirut versus Paris by the hour.  So they're like that old data sets where we've published on GitHub.  So we published the News Lab publishers Google Trends data sets on GitHub and make them available for people to download.  We want, you know, because we think out there, there's amazing communities to taste journalists and people will do stuff with it, which we way better than we can do.  Our small, our small team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Simon, is this the same data set that we query when we when we ask Google Trends for Trump versus Clinton?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is different. So basically we have two things. If you go to Google Trends, you get this thing called the Explore Tool, which allows you to search for anything.  You could search for the Beatles versus the Rolling Stones or or Trump versus Hillary Clinton.  What it might be. So that search box at the top says explore topics.  Search for literally anything you want in there.  You could do you could do Darth Vader versus Luke Skywalker.  So there you go.  There's a topic, a hands solo topic there.  We have students separately.  So you have to do one and then you enter the other.  But don't do them together like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't do that.  Don't do what I just did.  Am I breaking it?  Am I going to break Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just won't like what I get.  See interest over time of hand versus Darth.  So the cool thing about this tool is you can download this data on the top right hand corner.  There's a three dot button.  You can download all this data.  But the stuff that we're including here in search is actually data that we've done for our own visualization,  which is harder to get from the public tool is where we've we've said, well, this is an interesting data.  We've curated already and then packaged it up and then also in addition to it, supplying a video or a data base,  we've made it there for people to download.  So there's a lot of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are some of the things that your data set that you put out that you don't get in that in the Trends search?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there are things like questions and some of those data sets.  Questions is really messy data.  So we know we need to to reduce the noise in that.  We put out there's things like when we want to bring together historic data, which is anything over a week and real time data,  which anything under a week together.  We've we've we've done that.  Is this the blog post?  Yeah.  Oh, this is cool.  So if you scroll down, there's a really nice visualization.  I think you've extended that one.  Yeah.  You can roll it.  You roll over it.  So these are the big stories that we chose over the year.  Oh, this is cool.  You can see how they all compare.  Yeah.  When you pick a news story, so what are you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you looking at searches in Google News and then clustering them up to try to figure out what the big topics are?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the way it works is Google Trends is actually a combined signal across Google Search and Google News and YouTube Search.  So when you see on the Google Trends site, it has this trending feed, which is amazing kind of wire feed of what the world cares about any moment.  Then that is really that combination of signals.  And it's all relative and index numbers and everything's normalized by geography and so on.  So that it doesn't just mean this is the place that has a lot of people living in search something.  And then so with this so that the trend, the tool we use will combine all these signals.  This this visualization actually just shows searches.  It's just searches on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I mean, these are news topics.  So, for example, in November, you would have had a significant number of Black Friday searches.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  So for news topics, we didn't algorithmically choose the topic, the stories that we're using for you.  And so that was literally I've got a lot of years experience in the newsroom.  This is really us just choosing stories that we think are interesting and represent a kind of balanced view of the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I mean, could there be news stories that because you're you're doing that editorially, it's actually critical.  But that's basically you guys picking 20 different topics and saying, find out how well these did.  Yet there could be news topics that aren't included because you've you perhaps missed them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Oh, yeah, absolutely.  I mean, we have to like if and so when I was when I was a news editor, one of the big fears that we talk to any news editor, the big fear.  There are two things, one of which is you're going to miss something really, really important.  And the other fear is that you're you're doing too many things that aren't important.  So that editorial kind of sense is why is, to be honest, what I use when I'm working out what we're going to provide extra data for and what we're going to do.  So that isn't algorithmically driven.  However, if you go to the Google Trends front end, there's a ranked list of stories on there which is totally algorithmically driven.  And it's the you know, what's trending right now?  This is Google.com slash trends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I was going to just because somebody wanted to see that great.  There's one in Great Britain. I presume other nations as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On the right hand side, the right hand side, there's a drop down menu.  So we just we just and basically we make sure each country has some stories the same.  See underneath. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So global Australia, Brazil, Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we thought that some countries, you know, every country probably interest in Paris.  However, Australia had a change of prime minister this year or, you know, in Japan, they're going to be interested in another story in India.  They're interested in this retiring cricketer and the scandal.  We're not. We don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Ag retires. Yeah. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Big story. So if you can check out the Japan pages or there's Korea, South Korea in there.  Yeah. India got these floods just happened.  So we've kind of we've we worked with people in each country to say what's the big story there that people are caring about and that would produce some interesting data.  It is. And Canada, Canada, you know, you have a lecture and the Blue Jays reaching the playoffs was bigger than the World Series.  Right. Right.  And if you're a Canadian, this is a one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is such a good time to be a data scientist.  You know, between the fact that you've got these data sets and companies like Google are being a little more free with them, which is amazing.  We've got the tools to do the analytics and we have the tools to do visualizations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's exciting. It's a great time.  I've read a lot about data journalism.  I think there is no best time to be a journalist than there is now because you've got these amazing tools.  You can visualize something.  You don't have to be a developer to visualize something anymore.  And that's incredibly Simon is an editor from The Guardian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then he went to Twitter and survived that.  And now he's at Google.  So he's editorial in his blood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So trends is also a site that you don't have to be a journalist to use it or even to find stuff of interest because, you know, it's what's trending.  And by the way, it doesn't have to be the end of the year either.  It's what's trending on Google at any given moment.  But how do journalists take advantage of trends?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there are two things that are going on here on that page.  You see the stuff across the top.  Those are feature stories that we choose.  So that's editorial.  That's where I say, right, so Dave Fed and interest rates, a big deal.  Right.  So we should do a story on it.  And that means those things hang around in the sidewalks.  Obviously people care about that at the moment.  We've got the climate conference.  There's a page there on gun violence and the football season.  All these American sports, which obviously I'm a huge expert in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry, we don't know who Selweg is either.  So it's OK.  It's fair.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then the stuff below it where it says trending stories, if you scroll it down a little bit, those are algorithmically driven.  It's probably the world's biggest news algorithm.  It takes all these signals from across Google search and Google News and YouTube.  And it works.  It's trending at the moment.  And that algorithm is different in each country that we do this.  So because in the UK, you have to watch out, there's a lot of soccer stories literally dominate the whole list.  So we're trying to work on that one.  And in other countries, it might be something else.  So this is kind of if you click on any of those links, you get some basic data around that story.  And that's all stuff that really we don't interfere with.  It just exists and it works.  And what we do find is that we kind of keep an eye on it.  So when Paris happened, literally you could see the word Paris spiking on its own.  And the other thing, if you're interested, is what it works, the way it works, that says we're still gathering data.  The way it works is each of those words, those are what are called entities in Google's Knowledge Graph.  And the Knowledge Graph is basically how Google organizes the world.  It's like groups of topics.  So for instance, if you're looking for Lincoln, are you looking for Lincoln the President, Lincoln the car, Lincoln the movie?  And each of those is a separate topic.  And each of those has its own set of keywords around it, which are language agnostic pretty much  because it reflects the way people search around the world.  So you could include terms in Mandarin as well as in English or French or German.  And so this looks for groupings of those topics that are suddenly accelerating together.  So that's why you get the words joined together there.  So I don't know which story is that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the Baltimore story, which is a breaking story about Freddie Gray, the jury is hung.  I find it interesting that news sources become part of the search trend as well.  Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we've attached the relevant news articles to that partly because Google News is a big signal for what's rising or not.  That really helps work it out.  So we have the stories there for context.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And when I see news today in the trending queries, that's news today vis-a-vis Baltimore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So probably what's happening is that people are searching for these are trending queries that are related to the search.  So people are probably searching for Freddie Gray news today, for instance, or Freddie Gray jury news today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But why isn't it saying Freddie Gray rather than WMAR-TV Baltimore News?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Probably because of the way that people are searching.  I'll take exactly the terms people are using, but obviously I'm assuming that WMAR-TV is starting to trend along with Baltimore News when those three things are connected.  So if you were searching for them, there's a chance that you'll be searching for those three terms together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so this is purely algorithmic. This is not editorial in any way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Purely algorithmic. We don't affect that at all. We look out for messy results, obviously.  And my preference would be, I mean, in the long run, I'd love it if that was actually giving a headline at the top instead of a group of entities.  You'd probably also love it if these related topics didn't include Gray, the color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But computer algorithms are notoriously intransigent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. There's a lot of things, for instance, with the Greek referendum.  One of the ways people talk about it is the phrase, Grexit. And there's a software company called Grexit.  So things like that are hard to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But boy, I could see why you'd say this is valuable for a news operation because of that concern you spoke of of missing the big story.  You can see the big story. It's at your fingertips right away, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, a lot of newsrooms now use this.  You can actually have... If you scroll up to the top of that second algorithmic there, which says Trending Stories,  see on the right there's a little square thing next to the reload button?  Yeah.  And that actually allows...  Oh, I can sit on this?  Yeah, that's just a pop-out feed. So we've all had wire feeds in the corner of our screens.  And this is a pop-out feed that a lot of newsrooms, you know, we know the BBC, Telegraph, people like that have this on a big screen on the wall because it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is awesome. I'm a news junkie and this is awesome.  I usually, you know, as all radio stations do, and, you know, I've kind of like, we're kind of like a radio station.  I always have TVs on with the news stations on so you don't miss a big breaking story.  This would be probably more useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's all about that fear of missing something important. We're all scared of that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't... I had no idea Martin Shkreli was trying to bail out Barbie Shamuda.  Shamurda.  There you go.  Might have missed that story.  Exactly.  Wow. Isn't this cool?  What do you think?  Jeff, Danny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the data that you're giving out, did you change up Google's trends as part of today? Is this a new presentation?  It looks like it, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We relaunched it in June and there were two big things.  One of which was if you'd ever looked at Google trends from the beginning of the year, it wasn't real time.  It went up to about three days ago.  Yeah, yeah.  And the big change was this is now up to a few minutes ago, which is a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, this clustering and the way you're describing the topics, that's not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the clustering, this is all from the summer and then things like pop out window, that's brand new.  That's only about a week old.  Love this.  And as Jeff and I met a few months ago, I wanted to say, why can't you embed this stuff?  So one of the things I wanted to say is look, Jeff, we should be able to embed individual visuals.  So all of the charts now are embeddable.  So we're always working on improving it and making it better.  It's nice. It would be nice if these topics told me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like if I go over to Facebook trends, they do an excellent job of looking at the trending stuff and telling me what it means.  So something like WMAR TV Baltimore News, I'm like, I don't know what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but if you're in the news business, I think you might guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but this isn't for people in the news business.  It is for people, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, not really.  It is. I mean, I guess we've kind of had a bit of a focus on the news industry.  And the news lab, which I'm part of, is definitely focused on that.  So we have pushed towards that.  I would prefer to have real headlines.  I think I'll make it more useful because actually, you know, I've worked with social media days.  And the great thing about Google data is it takes you beyond that echo chamber.  Right.  You know, this isn't a public expression of opinion or something.  This is an implicit interest because you actually search for it.  You care enough to search about it.  That makes it interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amazing that Donald Trump is nowhere to be found.  The reason I say it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what's interesting.  So like if you looked at this last night.  Yesterday, I'm sure he was.  Last night at about 8 p.m., you would have seen him all over this.  So it reflects how quickly things go up and down.  We care about things intensely when we care about them.  Then we don't.  Why does Google do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I understand why you do this.  I love it.  But why does Google do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I guess, I mean, you've had to ask.  You're not.  I know you don't speak for.  I don't speak for them.  But I would say there's a, you know, you know, if you think about the core mission of Google,  it's historically about organizing the world's information and making it accessible.  This is like, you know, Google's that's been a core thing.  So this this to me, this is making that real.  You know, you're taking the world's information, all the way that people search Google,  which is now an interesting source of information and making that accessible to people.  So so I think that's the motivation.  And Simon will probably probably give the corporate t-shirt there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Leo, we've talked enough on the show about about the European situation.  This didn't come entirely out of Europe.  But Google wants to make friends in the news business now starting.  And so News Lab, tell me if I'm wrong here, Simon, it has a lot of training for newsrooms and how to use the news.  It's much bigger than just our little data journalism operation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have people who go out there into the newsrooms and show people how to use tools.  And we also have partnerships with newsrooms and partnerships with organizations that support the newsrooms as well.  So the idea is free for us to be a kind of support system for journalists.  And we're not selling anything.  We're not you know, this isn't PR or marketing.  This is really about about what can we do?  Google has all this data and resources and expertise.  What can we do to help people use that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Simon, can you can you just as I won't do a good job of it.  Can you describe the first draft coalition, which, as I understand it, was basically started by Google and a whole bunch of partners?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, yeah, I just first draft is really about, you know, we're really interested in there are certain themes we think are really interesting, one of which is obviously data, which my area.  There's also verification and, you know, this idea of verifying itself.  We've also working with YouTube Newswire, which is about, you know, system generated content, news generated content around news stories.  So with first draft, you know, we've had we've already had events around the side of how do you verify all this information that's coming to you as a reporter now?  You know, what's the best practice?  What can we do to help with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's also it's so there's so many little interesting things to be gleaned from this.  I have no idea why interest in The Force Awakens is highest in Salt Lake City of the entire United States.  And I'm sure there's there's all proportional as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the great thing about a day.  So basically it's not we get it.  We get it as a percentage of all searches.  Yeah, that makes sense.  Yeah.  So basically you could otherwise a small, you know, New York or Texas or California is always on a right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you have graduate students parsing this data coming up with all sorts of interesting theses?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's probably why we have to start publishing on GitHub.  We want people to do it.  And so one of the things that we go, actually, if you go to the feature stories, go back to the trends from.  Yeah, you look at the and I have to go to meeting.  I'm so sorry.  You scroll to the right.  See the Republican debate page.  You go to that.  Yeah.  It's a visual.  Now I just want to show you because this is one is something I can replay this.  It says, yeah, so replay the debates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so you could read this visual was actually designed by one of one of my students at Berkeley.  I teach state journalism, Berkeley, and she designed this.  So cool.  This visual using data we published on the GitHub page.  So that we now we use it now to tell the story.  Oh, is that cool?  So this is this is this was this is a cool thing.  Makes me happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What cautions and I'll ask not just you, but everybody on the panel, what cautions should we keep in mind when we remember that this is merely search data?  I mean, this is people searching for something.  I mean, I don't that's actually pretty good signal because it's uncoerced.  It's not, you know, it's not very self selecting.  I mean, I think Google's pretty universal these days.  I guess it's people with computers in the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know the answer to that.  I wish I did.  So, for instance, we did something around the UK election where we aggregated city data to constituencies, which is weird because not a Google boundary.  You know, right.  It's like we're taking the system and averaging across it to a constituency.  You know, in the UK, like the US, it's first class host system.  So what that means is that, you know, whoever wins in each place wins the seat, even if they don't win the majority.  You can win just like in the US, I guess.  And when we did it, that the same at the time, the polls were neck and neck between Labour and Conservative.  There's actually no nobody to tell who's going to win.  And Armat came back and seemed to kind of indicate that David Cameron, the concertoist, were going to win handsomely and they were going to completely win this.  So I think, well, this is obviously not true.  This is just a bit of fun, but we should just put it out because people like to see who the top search person is.  But actually, in the end, we were closer to the result than the polls were.  We could we predict to this this this loud side and he won.  You know, he won by last night.  Kind of what we're doing with this stuff.  So this is like you might say, well, this just reflects Donald Trump is is in the news.  That's why he's been a search.  He's also top of the polls.  So I don't know what I'm saying.  I guess is I don't know what the answer to this is.  I think there's a really interesting thing goes on.  And whether that equates to a correlation, I really don't know.  But I think it's a fascinating gives us a fascinating insight into the way that people's minds were and things that people really care about.  Whether it was it doesn't mean we're going to see President Trump.  I have no idea.  This is I think it's data.  I think it's data that's valuable and data is valuable.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'm thrilled that Google shares this data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to go to Facebook now to get them to change the result if that's the case.  But that's their job.  You just indicated that they'll change it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and there is some editorial here, for instance, I doubt very much that this was algorithmically algorithmically selected.  The top questions about Wolf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With questions, questions are such messy data.  So we have we look for question words in different languages and the topic of warflits, I say.  Yeah, it's a topic in Google.  And and then within that, you know, because of the way that search works is it's looking for everything you search for within a certain time.  We have to kind of clean out the mess and things that are repetitive.  There might be a saying question asked in four ways.  And that's how we end up with those questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I'd love that.  I mean, so so yeah, and I think people can distinguish between editorial and raw data.  And I'm just I'll tell you, if I were starting out, if I were one of your students, Jeff, yeah, or I or I should, to be fair, if I were one of your students, Simon, I would be this would be this is where I would head.  This is fascinating.  It seems like it's a treasure trove that we're just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I mean, it's really interesting because we think like, you know, data has been around for a while.  But really, it's since 2009 that it's been, you know, newly popular, I guess.  Yeah. Yeah. And I think there is something there about, you know, is this going to run out?  Is this trend going to run out? People are going to get bored of data and want to move on to just flying drones or something or VR.  I think it was actually there's a ton of data that is just so unexplored.  And it's like being an archaeologist finding something nobody's ever seen before a real time modern archaeologist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  Just fascinating.  Simon, I thank you for your time.  Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a pleasure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And for your work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love it.  Thanks. Good to see you again, Jeff.  And yeah, thanks for your work.  This is this is a great, great broadcast.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you.  This is Data Editor at Google.  Where are you located, Simon?  I'm in San Francisco.  OK.  Because the Google offices in San Francisco don't look nearly as nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, this is pretty good.  This is very nice.  We can have a view of the Bay Bridge.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Looks a little like a newsroom, I have to say.  You must be.  This is horrible.  Thanks, Simon.  I appreciate your time.  Thanks, Simon.  And thank you, Jeff Jarvis, for arranging that.  That is really interesting stuff.  Man, I would I want to start all over because what's what I like about I'd love to code stuff  that manipulates and parses and creates visualizations for this data, because I think that there's  it's just fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just want in journalism school now, we teach a lot of the students scraping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, are there people learning coding data and that's this kind of thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's focused.  They're not going to go out and start making apps, you know.  But yes, they're learning to scrape data.  We just were tomorrow, Friday, day after tomorrow, we graduate our first class of social  journalists at CUNY.  I wrote about it at The Observer and they were taught how to scrape data and they were taught  how to analyze data.  One guy used IBM Watson to do a sentiment analysis against Facebook posts.  They're not coming out data scientists by any means, but they come out literate in how to use data.  I think you'd need to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is an important source.  Yeah.  Wow, really neat stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Danny, do you code?  No, I wish I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what's nice is the tools for this, you know, I mean, Python has some great libraries  for this.  I mean, the tools for this are widely available and not frankly that hard to learn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, the nice thing I like about trends is that, you know, you have the ability to go in and  pull down the data and they've been increasing it more and more over time.  The downside is if you want to go through and figure out what's the most popular search thing on Google,  you can't tell.  So, you know, for all the transparency that you hear, you don't know what the number one thing people  search for on Google is.  And that's historically been things like sexual terms and stuff like that.  But that's also fascinating to know and really useful.  And so I kind of miss that we don't have it, although I understand why Google doesn't want to give it to us.  Because once you give people a list of top terms, it increases the amount of spam that they get,  which has been part of the problem that they have with Google Trends in the beginning.  For all that they've talked about, you know, well, we're doing this to help news sites and everything.  Old Google trends used to be more heavily used, I think, by news organizations who were getting ahead  of the stories and competing to try to show up for topics.  So, you know, they would look at what the trends were and then they'd snap and they'd go and, you know,  and now I think that's been diffused a bit more.  So by the time something hit Google Trends, it's even though it's got the real time stuff and everything,  you probably are not going to be able to kind of ride the crest in the way that some of the news publications did in the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a really good point, Danny. Really good point.  But the funny thing, you're right. Transparency is relative, right?  So it's transparent within itself, but you can't see the bigger picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I think that's fine. I think one of the fascinating things I saw with Google Trends was the article that the New York Times  magazine ran this week, which was on looking at Islamophobic searches and trying to understand if you can see a rise in the  searches, if that would translate into a rise in hate crimes or whatever.  And they did a fairly good job pulling this kind of data down and going through it.  There were some concerns I had, though, because you mentioned, I think, Leo, like, what are the caveats you have to keep in mind?  A common type of thing you'll see was like a few years ago, like Fox News ran an article saying, like,  I can't remember what it was, something like, who hates George Bush?  And they said there was like a rise. But then you could do a search for who likes George Bush.  There was some weird thing where, like, they didn't think about all the combinations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This could be manipulated inadvertently or advertingly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Or with the New York Times article, they did one where they said, you know, and most of the stuff that they did, I agreed with.  But one part in the article, they said, you know, like, we saw a rise in people searching for our all-Muslim terrorists.  And they said, like, clearly, people who search for that must believe it.  It's like, no, that's not clear at all.  It's a misinterpretation.  You know, you literally don't know what they think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Well, that's why we've got to have people like Jeff and Simon training journalists in how to understand this, what it means, how to use it,  rather than just kind of going with their gut. Well, it looks to me like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Journalists aren't terribly good at this. But I saw recently, I saw Hal Varian, the chief economist at Google,  give a presentation that was just phenomenal using Google correlate.  And these are publicly available data sets where the correlation of, you know, hate crimes and Obama is the Antichrist in search is unbelievable.  Right. Things like that.  I wish I had the presentations he had, but you use correlation and it's pretty damn amazing.  When you get to just the size that Google has, what it can do is phenomenal.  Plus Google surveys. I don't know if we've talked about that in the show, you know, where if you go to a pay site, you get a survey instead of paying.  That is a phenomenal data set.  And in the last election, they were number two in accuracy using that just because they're so darn big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But there is... I think your point is well taken, Danny, that there's a huge risk of misinterpretation and misuse.  And then there's the secondary concern. Maybe it's the primary concern that Google, I don't think, is doing this now, but could at some point skew this stuff.  And I mean, I mean, if I were an evil conspiracy theorist, I would say, yeah, Google's going to hook you on this data and then it's going to slightly...  I would expect that a Facebook slightly modify it to skew it in a direction that's beneficial to them.  I don't think they're going to do that, but you could see how there'd be some concern about that because there's no audit or verification.  We have to take their word for the data that they provide for it.  And then there's also the question of does it amplify the filter bubble?  I know you question the existence of a filter bubble, Jeff, but...  I think it exists. I think it's overblown.  Okay, so let's say that there is an amplification effect because it's reinforcing.  News organizations look at this and say, oh, well, everybody's searching for this, so let's do more stories about this and then more people search for it.  So there is this amplification effect that is also could be risky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To be a favor, Leo, go to search for Google correlate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  The good news is, and this is the answer to people who say there's a filter bubble as well, is as long as there's a diversity of news sources, which there is,  and as long as people are willing to search for more than one news source, which they seem to be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course we have them. Go to a pair of US states.  Now search for Antichrist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this is going to generate correlations?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're going to see a state by state core what is correlated with...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Obama the Antichrist.  The Antichrist, of course, is almost a one-to-one correlation, but very close is Obama the Antichrist.  Now look at the state structure.  And then do it by states. Is that this playback here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I should have seen that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  State maps, scatter plot. Let's look at the scatter plot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What you see is, if you look at the state, it's the Confederacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can see it here as I play it. I see the playback just means you can interact with it.  Yeah.  So California, it's only a 0.8 correlation.  But in Arkansas it's 2.4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So look at Trump. What does Trump correlate with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Interesting. This is fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what Herat Varian showed is you do this with certain news events and predictability and you tie it...  Correlated with Trump crazy glue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What?  Jersey boy tickets?  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, this makes no sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Trump and crazy glue?  Maybe Trump and crazy?  Try Donald Trump.  Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's probably the Trump tower I'm getting.  So let's see. Donald Trump.  Crazy glue.  Now we get Otis lyrics, no church in the wild lyrics.  No, it still doesn't make sense.  Trump, you know what? Trump is a noisy search term.  It is very noisy.  And that's why when you search for Donald Trump, it correlates to 0.89 with Ben Gay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have the tools we don't have to get rid of it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently in Florida, there's a strong correlation between searching for Donald Trump and Ben Gay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They go to Trump golf courses and afterwards.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, but that's the thing with data. You never know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You never know. And its correlation is only correlation, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you could spend days just playing with this.  Oh, you could. You could.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, let's take a break.  Danny Sullivan's here from searchengineland.com.  Longtime Google observer and one of the best writing on the subjects of SEO and search.  Here he is observing. He's in his laundry room.  But he's hidden the laundry, which makes me wonder.  Which makes me wonder what's behind the curtain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tide is behind the curtain.  It's okay, Danny. I'm not going to make you do it.  Also, you're Jeff Jarvis and he is in Atlanta at the Journal of Constitution.  And it's nice of them to lend you some space.  They call this the closet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For obvious reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're going to have more in just a bit. Our show today brought to you by Slack.  What a great name. Stuart Butterfield has such a great sense of humor.  Of course, he's one of the people who created Flickr, left Yahoo after being kind of ignored for some time.  And I think he kind of floated around in a few things, but then came up with this idea, Slack.  Slack is a great way for your team to get more done, more efficiently.  NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory uses Slack. What is it?  Well, it looks like it's a messaging app for teams, but it's really so much more.  Brings all of your work communications together in one place.  Email, Skype, instant messaging.  And it integrates with the tools you use every day, like Dropbox and GitHub, Google Drive, Hangouts, MailChimp, Trello.  There's more than a hundred integrations. You could drag and drop to share files, right?  Drag it right into the Slack timeline.  Images, PDFs, documents, GitHub, spreadsheets.  Is there such a thing as a GitHub?  I made it a noun.  The GitHub. It's got so many cool tools.  Slack makes your life work.  We work life simpler, more pleasant, more productive. Teams using it.  It reported 32% increase in productivity.  48.6% reduction in internal email. I think it's probably even more than that.  And 25% fewer meetings. That's, there you go. There's your big payoff.  More than 1.25 million daily active users.  It is on the desktop. It is on web browsers, but it's also in apps on Android and iOS and Mac app and Windows apps.  It's used not just by NASA, but MIT, the Wall Street Journal, Salesforce, Zappos, eBay, Dow Jones, Airbnb, Expedia, and two at Samsung.  I can go on and on. Spotify, Pinterest. We use it with our web team in Austin.  Just love it. Pulls all those disjointed conversations into a single organized searchable view.  And you know, I even know people use it just for fun because it's that good.  It looks that good. It feels that good. It's that effective.  So even friend groups use it. Nonprofits use it. It's so great.  Go to slack.com slash twig. You can sign up now and try it for free.  You'll also get a $100 credit towards your paid plan when you convert.  But you've got to go to slack.com slash twig. Slack.com slash twig. Slack is the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Leo, one of my students went to visit the Gawker newsroom.  And she walked in and said, it's so quiet. How could it be so quiet here? It's a newsroom.  And they said, oh, everybody's on Slack. Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The new Gawker, right? The Politico Gawker. Yes. Yes. The nicer Gawker.  The nicer, kinder, nicer Gawker. Please don't sue us, Gawker. Please, please don't sue us, Gawker.  Well, that was fun. I'm glad we talked to Simon Rogers.  And that just gives me so many interesting ideas for things I'd like to do.  Did you? We had this on TNT this morning.  George Hotz, who is a great programmer, made his own autonomous vehicle. Did you see this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, this is the greatest. Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He is building, what can I say? He's building an autonomous vehicle.  We had Ashley Vance, the author of this article for Bloomberg Businessweek.  Ashley had the guts to get in Hotz's Acura outfitted with LIDAR on the roof, a camera mounted near the rear view window,  a giant, well, sideways 24-inch monitor in the front.  He says, Tesla only has a 17-inch screen, says Hotz.  Actually, it's 21 and a half inches, the Hotz screen, the Hotz car.  Would you go in? So Ashley gets in the car with him and goes on the highway.  Makes me a little nervous. There's a joystick in the center console.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, the guy's behind the wheel, though, isn't he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. But if it pulls in front of a truck, it's not as much you can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but he's like behind the wheel. Like, people have the Tesla out of driving cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would trust, would you trust GeoHot? He was the first guy to hack the Apple iPhone.  He's very well known. And I think it's great that he just said, you know, I think I could do a self-driving vehicle.  I asked, Ashley says, I'm amazed. I asked Hotz what it felt like the first time he got the car to work.  And he told him, dude, the first time it worked was this morning.  You're not!  Well, actually, it feels exactly like this because it's the first time.  Anyway, so I guess it's not so hard to make a self-driving vehicle these days.  It's what happens, isn't it? Is that it's very hard to do the first one and then it gets easier and easier.  And the technology pretty soon because, you know, kind of consumer grade. It's wild.  There he is in his basement. He likes to work next to the furnace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he's grown up from his rapping days.  Was he a rapper?  Check this out. You haven't seen this.  Have you had him on All About Android?  No, no, no, no. But he said, OK, I'll just play it.  Let's play the George Hotz rap.  I have to mute it at some point because it gets a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sony suited for hacking the PlayStation 3, I might add.  Yeah, that's what this was all about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anytime I think of GeoHot, I think of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They settled their feud and he agreed never to meddle with Sony products again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's designing autonomous vehicles.  Yeah. Hey, he was 22.  The dude is smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was a New Yorker profile on him at the age of 22.  He's wicked smart.  He says, I live by morals. I don't live by laws.  OK. Basically, that means I do whatever I want.  But he was in high school when he first hacked the iPhone.  So legend. He's driving himself.  Well, what your choice is self-driving car from GeoHots or Google or Alphabet or Alphabet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pardon me. GeoHot or Geostorm?  The self-driving car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I haven't read through the whole Bloomberg article, but the self-driving car that he's built  sounds a lot more like the self-driving car that Tesla built.  That's what the article said, in fact.  Which is nothing like the self-driving cars that Google has built.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not truly autonomous. It's a driver assist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like driving assist. And those are like completely different things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't diminish it. It's hard to do.  Time for a Luigi Cableman here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is hard to do, but since I don't have a Tesla, I'm still not getting why the self-driving car with me  for the Tesla is going to be that great.  And maybe if I had one, I would go like, oh, this is great, because now when I'm on the freeway,  I guess I could just relax a bit more. But that's not what I'm thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I do that in my Audi because the Audi has something called adaptive cruise control,  which means it monitors the car in front of you and maintains a safe driving distance,  even if the car slows down. And in fact, even if the car stops, if the car in front of you stops,  it will stop my car so I can sit there and you have to steer, but I don't have my feet on the pedals.  And it's great for stop and go traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That stuff is all great. Well, but I see I have a stick, so it's not going to help me.  No, well, you just having an automatic car.  You must like to drive.  Yeah. And then keeping me too far away from the car in front isn't going to work in Southern California  because we need to be right on top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody's going to come in. Yeah.  As long as there's an override.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It does drive my wife crazy when I use it. So why are you so far back?  I said this is safe stopping distance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But those sorts of things I love, but those are more safety features than I'm going to let you auto drive.  I want the Google auto driving car so that we're not going through this whole thing like, you know,  it's New Year's. Well, how are we going to get home from New Year's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm drunk off my ass and I'm going to let the car drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. So or, you know, so I don't know what's the big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Horses used to do that all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They get on the horse, he'll take you home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's it. That's all we need to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is a Louis CK moment here. My car is driving itself and you're complaining.  Yeah, it's driving itself, but it's not driving itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not driving itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sort of. OK, in the video, Ashley had his hands off the wheel in freeway traffic, no less.  Although there is an argument made that the freeway traffic is actually somewhat safer because even though you're going at high speed,  the consequences of a failure would be greater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess I would define it like this. The car to me is not driving itself until I, as the driver, don't have to worry about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. OK, that's what. Well, that's that's your standard, but that's a good standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's a very good standard.  Well, I think that's a very good standard because we're going to call something self-driving, then I shouldn't have to be sitting there.  It's like saying, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But we're a long way from my children. My children are self-raising.  Right. You want to move to Australia. I understand.  You know, leave them behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't get me wrong. I mean, this stuff is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You want a car that will drive you home even if you've passed out in the backseat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Technology has come down to the point that you can have someone like this guy say, hey, I don't even need to be a Tesla to kind of do it.  I can pull it all together. That's cool.  That's cool. It's got a lidar. Yeah. So it's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google, you mentioned its alphabet, Jeff.  That's because they have announced they're going to make the autonomous vehicle division an alphabet company in 2016.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Has somebody gone through to figure out, by the way, if every â€“ are they literally coming up with a name for a company to fill out every letter of the alphabet?  I doubt it. Is that the way it's been going so far?  That would be so dopey.  No, I think â€“ but I think that â€“ no, they're just dopey enough to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what is the Life Sciences Company called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And also because you could just see that Larry and Sergey would be like, and in our calculations we've determined any conglomerate with more than 26 companies doesn't work.  Therefore, alphabet is naturally self-moving in a perfect confluence that matches with â€“

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry. You can't have a company we've run out of letters.  No, you can't have D. Docs already has it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was like, I just typed in alphabet.com and it's like electrify your fleet with our leading light fleet.  No, that's the wrong word. XYZ.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, Jeff, are you there? Because you sounded like your Skype was â€“  Could you keep it down, Jeff? You're being a little noisy in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Alphabet go. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can't hear you now, Jeff.  I can't hear you.  No, you're muted. Unplug your headset and plug it back in.  It's glitching.  Is he using Skype or is he using that other thing?  No, I'm using Skype. Can you hear me now?  Yeah, yeah. It was just â€“ you know what? It was your headset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the Skype. The Skype has now stopped twice.  Yeah, it has.  Well, maybe that guy closing the door will help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, well, this is â€“ do you think â€“  Put back the highlights. Yeah.  Do you think maybe life enhancement is Calico? That's a C.  Somebody said Sue Grafton should be in charge of company names.  You know, I don't know. Are you looking it up?  The Alphabet thing?  Alphabet. Alphabet companies.  It took me a while because I couldn't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  First I was at Alphabet.com, then I was at Alphabet.  Then I was at ABC, XYZ.  And then, of course, they don't have any stuff on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A is for Android AdSense Analytics, ARA, AdMob, and Alerts.  B is for Blogger, Boston Dynamics, and Book C is for Calico, Cardboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where'd you put that at? How come I â€“ oh, that's the more.  Oh, because I should click on more.  You can't just show me everything. Make me click on more.  Because it's all about being fast. Where'd you get that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is QZ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it's Quartz. It's not even on the Alphabet site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they don't do it on the Alphabet site.  But Quartz â€“ see, the intrepid journalists at Quartz â€“  No, no, no. That's old. That's old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's August. It's old.  No, no, no. There's new Alphabet. Okay, like â€“  But there's enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can do this live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, these aren't companies. These are features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Names, new company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, I'm doing a search. Alphabet names, new companies.  I'm going to News because they just rolled out.  Okay, so Life Sciences Division got a new name.  Yeah, that just got â€“  Which was V for Verily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Verily, that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When you call something â€“ oh, yeah.  So when you call something V for Verily â€“  That means you're looking to fill the V.  That's like in that scene from Avengers when they go â€“  we call an organization Shield. What do you think it means?  The strategic home line, what do you think that means?  Someone really wanted it to spell Shield.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's Calico, there's Verily, Google Ventures,  Nest. See, there's Google and Google Ventures.  You already got Google and Google Ventures and Google Capital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't rename Google Ventures, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fiber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Zoot Takeover Venture Capital dot com.  This former moonshot's going with the new name Google X Verily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Zoot, yeah. As soon as â€“ you know what?  That's how we'll prove your concept, Danny.  If they name a company Zoot, then you know they're trying to fill me up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, in the self-driving car company is being given its own â€“  they're going to spin that off, as you said, in its own name,  but I don't think they gave it a name yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they're going to go through the alphabet in a Fibonacci sequence.  Yes, of course. The golden mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They had three other companies that they named.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the Verily was the most recent one, right?  Nest is a Nen. I think your thesis may not hold water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to be all over. I'm going to be all over.  But I'm telling you, as soon as there's a Zoot â€“  BuzzFeed's going to be like, why didn't we do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hooli. Yeah, that's right. You better do this before BuzzFeed does it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Remember they had the Hooli reference when they went live with that.  That's right.  Yeah, Verily. Google Alpha.  There were some other â€“ there were three other divisions that they named.  I'm sure it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is how â€“ this is how the blog gets written, my friends.  So we have Palo Alto. We have Verity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We have Google. Verily.  There's room. There's room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a lot of room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's room. Just telling you. I heard it here first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lightsaber.  But I can't.  With Google.com. This really should be my tool.  So awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So awesome.  I heard you doing it earlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why not?  Because it won't work on the Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, do it on your phone, your other phone.  He has an iPhone or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Though you have to do it with a laptop.  And I don't have a laptop. All I have with me is my Pixel C.  Oh, you have to do it with â€“ it says on your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm trying to go to yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but you have to also go to the computer.  Oh, I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wonder if I could go to your â€“ is that yours up there, Leo?  Yeah.  Watch this. I should be able to go with your code and then start fighting.  Will it hear you?  Yeah, watch. Because I can see your code, right?  Yeah. It's OCQ0D.  OCQ0â€¦  â€¦slash.  Because it's not like my phone is talking to my laptop.  It's talking to your thing.  Lightsaber.  And then I guess I just go with the slash.  OCâ€¦  Q.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've got to get in before everybody else gets in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you think others are doing this?  Yeah, they're trying. I'm going to win.  Okay. All right. Here we go.  Wait a minute. It did.  I told you.  Hey, Breeze, come here.  Okay, ready?  Yeah.  Okay, I'm going to press initiate. I'm calculating.  Calculating, calculating, calculating.  Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I told you.  You're controlling my computer across thousands of miles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, my God.  The screen over here. Watch this. See the screen up there? Check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What the what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. To enhance.  To escape. Okay.  Can you see me? Oh, I got lightsabers on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, he turned on his lightsaber. Here comes his stormtrooper.  Look at this.  For those of you listening at home, for some reason, heâ€¦  Danny is able to use his Nexus 6P  to fight a lightsaber battle on my computer  3,000 miles away  because he can see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  PC does a little bit of extra latency  thrown in for good measure, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Plus, I don't have full screen on my end, so it's kind of tilted.  This is better thanâ€¦ Oh, I'm ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  You obviously succeeded, Padawan learner.  Now, escape.  So the stormtrooper is shooting it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to start hitting it with my lightsaber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What, you're supposed to bounce the bullets off with your lightsaber?  No, that's a pain.  Well, how else do youâ€¦ Oh, you want to go up to him and slice his head off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, that's right. You're going down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no.  Uh-oh, there's a few of them now.  It looks like an endless corridor of them.  I always thought this was ridiculous that you could do this.  I guess if you're a Jedi Knight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Check out the accuracy, Danny.  You are a professional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, look at you, Danny. You are good.  This is better than Fruit Ninja.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Knockin' all the stormtroopers, take them down in the hallway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Danny's the new PewDiePie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. You've got to explain to me how this works, though.  How does it know? How does it know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My phone is connected to your browser through that unique code at the end of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, so you're sending it up to Google from your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google's using an accelerometer to know where my phone is positioned  and using it basically as a remote game controller.  Oh, God, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't worry, stormtroopers can't hit a thing. You're safe.  Look at that. He bounced the bullets back at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no! This is awful. Where's the boss key?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently, you have infinite lives, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Up, up, down, down.  Well, because Google knows that those photons...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you've been captured. You need to hone your lightsaber kills.  Oh, my goodness.  Wow.  Danny, that was really nice.  What the what? I don't even know how you do that.  But can you do it with a BlackBerry? That's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I should be able to do it with any phone, right?  Yeah.  Let me check. There's a little question mark next to it.  Yeah, you should be able to do it with any phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think you've now... you've taken...  I can't play because you've taken over my...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hang on, let me just get out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't have access to my computer anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Page and then it'll...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, I want to surrender.  Quit. Yes.  Am I sure I want to quit?  OK. Now I have a new URL.  Now, don't show it because anyway, well, I think we got the...  Yeah, I think we did.  So each time you refresh, you get a new URL.  That's a cool Chrome experiment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if you're lucky, you can guess into somebody else's experience and totally throw them on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, well, you know what? Let's do it right now.  Go ahead. Show my screen.  86WVC. Anybody at home wants to try this?  86WVC. You got to go to g.co.slash.lightsaber.slash.86WVC.  You know what? The latency to the viewer is worse than latency via Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. It's terrible.  Basically, you're dead meat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no way you can be able to...  But I think it's cool that I can let somebody control my computer, some random person control my computer.  That's the best.  That is neat.  That's exactly how I got my blood going.  Day after tomorrow.  Somebody's got to go full screen with my screen and take down the lower third.  Let's give them at least a chance.  Is this just some random person who's come in?  We have no idea who this is.  And spell your name with a lightsaber, will you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we know who you are.  It's Matt's cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, look, he's got a little cat.  He's got a little cat.  He's got a little cat.  I'm going to use the lightsaber, will you?  So we know who you are.  It's Matt's cat.  Oh, look, he's moving.  Okay, so get used to the latency because that's going to kill you.  Whoever you are.  Whoever you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mysterious fan of twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm just going to find a way to use it to hack your computer.  Find out tomorrow if you know someone's...  Okay, start moving now before he shoots.  You're on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Turn on your...  Oh, he's trying to get up in the left...  There he goes. There he goes.  Uh-oh.  Oh, we have lost...  I know, you're calibrated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just, you got to keep going.  No, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody else took over.  The street.  The street.  Somebody else got it.  All right.  That is so funny.  Okay, chat room, who is it?  Admit it.  Fess up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  Well, whoever it is, they're not in the chat room chatting because they're busy fighting.  Oh, yes, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody's having the ride of a lifetime.  The most thrilling thing they've ever done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can't, wait a minute.  I can't take it back.  Okay, quit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, sorry, I'm out of that.  Nice job, though, whoever you are, Mystery Stranger.  Wow, that was kind of interesting.  Everybody's betting it's Father Robert Ballester, Padre SJ.  I'm willing to believe that he's a father of a father.  Probably.  I'm willing to believe that he could be doing that.  That's a Lightsaber with Google.com, Lightsaber.withgoogle.com.  It looks like it's not a Google project, but it's a Lucasfilm project.  Oh, the way it's branded.  It says with help from Google as opposed to by Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, at the bottom it says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It has all the logos.  It's got all their copyrights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's a Lucasfilm.  They probably control it, but it's made with some friends, but it's a Chrome experiment.  It's a Chrome experiment.  Everybody's got a hand in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've been speculating that Disney probably has given Google a significant amount of money.  Did you see the loading page on Google Now or maybe Gmail as a Lightsaber now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  If you opted into the light side, dark side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you do that and you go into Google Maps, like my maps now, my icon is like an X-Wing.  I walk into New York and this X-Wing is flying me along.  Oh, man.  I got to say the cool thing they did on actually this is not Google, but it's Facebook.  Yesterday they rolled out this thing where you can change your profile and your profile picture.  And you can have like a lightsaber in front of it, which is pretty sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, and this is cool for me.  This Street View man is a is a stormtrooper.  I must have chosen the dark side.  See a little street view.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's going to be hard to figure out how to turn all this stuff off later on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hope it doesn't go beyond next week.  That would be very bad.  See, there's my little Street View man.  So I must have chosen the dark side.  Shame on me.  I don't I don't have a TIE fighter, though.  It's for navigation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, so if you were to pull up navigation on your on your Android device, you get a TIE fighter turn by turn.  Or actually, no, you're the dark side.  So you'd probably get something else.  I'd get a X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, what would I get?  I would get something bad that I don't want to be.  Why did I choose the dark side?  What's wrong with me?  It's the kind of thing you do.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You giggle about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are we all going to Star Wars tomorrow?  Friday.  That's borrow.  Oh, we're going to borrow.  And 26 of us are going at 730 in the evening.  The real question is the line is going to start forming at 7 a.m.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm confused.  How did it?  How did how I thought it was opened on Friday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but it opened early in some some somehow some way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the it's the damage.  It's the midnight thing and then midnight.  But ours is at 730.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you're going to you're going to probably see like a marathon up to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, God, I hope not.  Oh, my God. What have we done?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Listen, listen, this is important.  OK, this is really I need your full attention on this.  OK, so I have been we have scheduled out the watch.  We have scheduled out watching all the movies before they started.  And this is there's still time for anybody who's considering this.  And after I said I'm watching the films, people started saying to me,  oh, you should watch them in machete order.  And I'm like, what are you talking about?  And you've got to look this up.  It's by this guy, Machete.  Yeah. And it's not machetes.  This was his name, but it's really awesome.  So I'm going to just tell this to you.  I know it's not Google, but it's very important.  OK, there are different ways of thinking about doing it.  One thought is you watch them four or five and six,  which were really one, two and three with the way they originally came out.  Then you watch one, two and three.  And there's some advantages to that.  Then there's the thought, well, I'll watch them one, two, three, four, five  and six, because that's the order.  But most people agree that one sucks.  OK, I'm not going to argue about it.  That's just there's general agreement because that Jar Jar episode.  And this guy, but then this guy, this machete guy, he was like,  he was like, hey, here's the way you should do it.  You watch four, then you watch two and three,  which work is kind of a flashback in the way that you sometimes have flashbacks  in movies or whatever.  And they tell the story about how Luke ended up being Luke,  which is what this is really all about.  And you get a little bit of that, this whole Anakin and this Darth Vader stuff  and some things I don't want to spoil.  And you don't lose the surprise that episode one just completely blows away.  And then you go back to five and six and I'm like, oh, my God, you're amazing.  You're totally right.  This this makes sense.  So the order. Yeah, actually, this is the order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just so you know, it's four, five, two, three, six.  Note that episode one is completely disappeared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, damn, I screwed it up. I went for you went wrong, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the reason is because despite appearances, Anakin, it's not the story of Anakin Skywalker.  Yeah. That really that isn't what's the whole Star Wars thing about is about.  It also is designed that way to delay the well-called the Vader reveal.  Yeah.  And introducing the young Anakin before the end of the return of the Jedi.  So you put the prequels in the middle.  But why skip episode one?  Because it's pointless.  It's irrelevant. It's irrelevant.  It's irrelevant to the story.  It does not anyway in any form have anything to do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nothing. It's a fascinating read, actually, when you read through the logic behind this and you start to realize like, oh, yeah, I guess it is relevant.  I've never seen part two and three.  So but what I have leading up to Star Wars tomorrow done is I've seen Star Wars and Empire.  I've never seen you haven't seen all of them.  No, I have not seen. No, because I saw whatever I saw Phantom Menace and it was such a pile of poo that I lost all interest.  I lost all interest. I was like, if they can't get that one right, then I have no faith in the other ones.  One right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's the problem. Like we did this with my wife.  Like when they put him back in the theater, it's like, oh, we'll go see one.  I don't want to. Well, actually, she was like, that Jar Jar was kind of cool.  So but she had no interest in everything else.  But now we've been doing it the other way and convinced her to go back and do that.  She's like, yeah, that's actually better than I bought them all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I bought them all. I could go back and we could watch them in that order tonight.  So I'd have to start now, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you got to get going. But if you are thinking of doing just just save yourself.  Do you not watch one? I actually don't care what order you do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just don't start with. Well, wait a minute. There's no if you if you don't watch one, there's no midi-chlorians.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't need it. You don't need midi-chlorians.  But that explains everything.  Now, it doesn't explain anything because what do you need to know that the midi-chlorians with four?  Oh, I know I'm being too serious. But actually, there is one mention of midi-chlorians in episode three.  OK, which is a great episode. Three is really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that the one? Is that the one where he's got the little braids?  Because I love the braids.  You know, he keeps. No, Jake Lloyd.  You're acting is terrible. And I've never wanted to see Darth Vader's little boy.  No confusing pod make queen switcheroo. Yep.  Less confusing master apprentice relationships.  Nothing about trade disputes.  No pod racing. Yeah, that pod racing I could do with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And no Virgin Mers. So so I mean, I just honestly, if it was like a Nobel Prize for how to watch.  It should be awarded to this person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, we're interviewing on the screen screen savers on Saturday.  We're going to do a Star Wars episode. My cohost will be Alex Lindsay, who drew Princess Amidala's starship.  You know, that beautiful gleaming starship in episode one. So don't tell. Oh, that's pretty.  Don't say anything about this, Dan.  But we're also interviewing the guy who does the despecialized edition, which is awesome.  That is the coolest get ever. What is it?  You don't know about the specialized. Here we go.  Well, now get ready for another rat hole.  Okay. Your brain's about to explode.  Prepare yourself. Army will be our guest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does this take out all the stuff that they put in after?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, the idea is that the Star Wars you saw in 1977, the Star Wars episode.  What is it? Three or four? Yeah, the real one. The real one that you saw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They started doing all the fake change. Then they changed everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have used sources as diverse as the laser, VCRs, the laser disc, the VCR, VHS tapes, all sorts of sources to recreate the original episode four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I need, because when I'm watching episode four, I just lose it.  You start seeing those things walk around. I just start screaming fake, fake. Right.  When it comes up and says episode four, I start going, lie, lie.  It wasn't episode four. There was no episode four.  That worries me about having the digital copies too, because at some point they decide, well, let's reshape it more.  Then they just switch it around. What are you going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this will be, I guess it's Army will be our guest right on Saturday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's awesome. Are you allowed to just?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No. Notice that the image of him shows no face. I think he's, I don't know. Is he going to be, are we going to do the?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a great question. I don't know. But yeah, there is no official way to get this, by the way.  This is not something that you go into a store and buy. This is something you procure pretty easily on the internet through, yeah, through means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's really, there is a, if you want to kind of get a better idea of it, there's a YouTube video that describes some of the scenes that you will hate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Someone just did this too. I thought it was like all the differences documented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, it's kind of like this. This video is created by Army as well. Let me close all these ridiculous giant things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What year did they start revising it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lucas did it. Lucas always said, well, I can revise it because A, it's my movie and B, this is how I wanted to make it.  But we just didn't have the money and the tools.  So they added a bunch of weird and the problem is they added these new effects kind of at a bad time when effects looked like crap.  So they introduced a lot of crappy special effects that today look really dated.  So this is the Blu-ray. They use the Blu-ray. They use the official DVD. There's a lot of different versions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, they went through and extracted every like scene by scene, the original construction based on some old tape or whatever.  And then they got they brought people in and color corrected the whole dang thing.  It's like the craziest like fan recreation that shows you just how how important the series is to true fans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Those of us who bought the digital versions when they came out earlier this year have I think the same as the Blu-ray version essentially, which is the worst.  So look at the difference. This is the Blu-ray version. Look at the color correction in the Blu-ray version.  And then we'll see Harmy's corrected version. It really is a lot better. Here it comes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can go with color correction. That's all right. Yeah. Well, there's all sorts of things. There's taking out bad aliens.  There's removing just put in new things. I don't like the new things. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, but the color correction in the Blu-ray is terrible.  That's the that's part of the problem is they did color correction that made it look worse, not better.  So I don't know when we're going to see the fixed version. This is the still the blue.  Oh, here's the fixed. Look at how much better that looks.  The Blu-ray actually looks blue. It also is extra dark. Wow.  This is I mean, this is actually an improvement. If I were George Lucas, I'd give this guy a medal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Oh, and then the other thing was hand shot first.  They changed them. Didn't they change it? So, yeah, hand. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know I could tell that you were just realizing that was one of the big issues. That was the big thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We were all very, very upset about that. So that's I'm looking Wikipedia has a page on this. Oh, yeah.  1981 is when they added episode four. Right. Bye. Bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They really did a massive improvement, I believe, not not just taking out bad effects, but really good color correction.  Remember, they added that whole scene with Han Solo outside the ship and Jabba the Hutt was completely added.  It is terrible. See the 1977 theatrical version available for a limited time only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that them selling this or that's them saying if you had bought this is the sources he's talking about how he made the specialized edition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, silly, but I'm just filling. It's important.  I think it's important because this is a national holiday coming up, a great international holiday. All of the world will be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But not China. There was a great Wall Street Journal article where like China, nobody has no idea what you're talking about.  They don't know what Star Wars is? No. What? And it ended with a great quote.  This is why he's like, you know, I mean, honestly, we want some stuff that's more real like Avengers.  You know, that's happening on Earth. Right. So more realistic. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. OK. Anyway, we're excited.  So tomorrow we'll see. But you know what? I'm going to promise a spoiler free zone.  You can watch the new screensaver safely on Saturday. We're not going to reveal anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Guardian made a point of saying in the headlines, no spoilers.  It's challenging. You're a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That YouTube video you have. And that's very nice because it's showing the title crawl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, yeah, yeah, yeah. You're fine. Oh, look at this. He's a speeder.  There's the red leader, red leader.  But I was going to ask Jeff, you're a longtime critic.  You wrote for years as a television critic. How when it I guess the spoiler thing wasn't a big thing back then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it wasn't. And it's also not hard to avoid it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can write a review because some people are saying I can't write a review without spoiling it.  Of course you can. I don't need to review Star Wars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well. It's like writing a review for the new iPhone.  You're either going to buy it because it's the new iPhone or you're not going to buy it because you don't like iPhones.  What on earth is going? Oh, I've been waiting for this review of Star Wars because it's out this weekend.  I've got to know. Is it any good?  I don't know if I'm going to go. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No one's thinking that this weekend. No one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No one's been sitting there going, I can't make a decision on this until I read the New York Times and the LA Times and whatever else.  It's on me if I should go to Star Wars. Right.  Please, please just save your review for a week after and give me the what we learned about from Star Wars.  So you didn't read any of them? You didn't read any of them?  What's that? You didn't read any of them, Danny?  No, I wouldn't read them. I want to go into it. I've kind of not really kept track.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot of people refuse to watch the trailers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know we have this thing like I know I have that's going to be in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I know that there's like Patrick Delahanty is refusing to go on Facebook all week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've got the Stormtrooper person, but I've actually kind of not been trying to seek out more about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's a great review in The Verge. This is Brian Bishop, the spoiler preview.  Oh, what do you have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no, it's all just. I don't even know the name of the characters.  Go on, you guys, anyone wrote it for me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, yeah, it's a spoiler. See, anything that you're right.  Anything that reveals anything people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Howard Stern's crew, Howard Stern's crew, they go to all the cons.  There's like, you know, there's there's baby con now and there's my little pony con and so on.  So they went to one of the cons and they found this guy who was, let's say, just extremely, extremely, extremely nerdy.  And so we do it. They called him with a 40 phone call.  There was George Lucas calling and the guy saying no spoilers, no spoilers.  And the and the George Lucas says, well, but at twenty seven, yeah, Luke gets killed by this and that.  The guy's crying at the end.  They have to call him back and explain it was a joke.  Really, George Lucas, we didn't know it was it was kind of sweet.  Yeah. That'd be Danny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Review is Star Wars.  Give me a break.  Let's take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll come back with some actual Google News in just a second.  It is Google News because because Star the the number one inescapable place for Star Wars these days is Google stuff.  They've put it everywhere.  You know what I got? I just got this in the car and I love this.  This is called the automatic and it is a OBD to dongle.  So all cars since 1996 have been built with an onboard diagnostic port.  It's you can find it.  You don't even know it's there.  Probably a lot of people don't because it's kind of hidden on your driver's side below the steering wheel.  And it's just open there.  And normally the idea is the tech when you bring it into the shop will plug in the diagnostic equipment and go from there.  But it's always intended, I think, to be open.  And so automatic has made this great little dongle that plugs into it.  And then and this is, by the way, the second generation.  So they've gotten even better.  And then you bond it to your phone, Android or iPhone, over Bluetooth.  And you're going to get real time performance data.  You're going to get intelligent coaching.  It might think at least it crazy will beep at you if you break too hard or accelerate too fast.  Keeps track of all of the information.  It exports my trips.  I use it with if this then that to add entries for every trip I take to Evernote, including maps, gasoline, mileage, how much it costs.  You know, just knowing how much a trip cost alone.  Isn't that eye opening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You go to the grocery store and then you look at automatic.  You're like, that trip to the grocery store cost me a dollar fifty.  Yeah.  It's like it's information that you don't know if you actually want to know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'll tell you what the check engine light means.  What if it comes on?  It integrates with so much stuff.  They have a platform.  So Nest, your mechanic, FreshBooks.  It will track mileage and put it into FreshBooks for your expense report.  Business expenses like Concur and Expensify also interact.  I love it that it works with if then that it works with Amazon's Echo.  I can say to the Echo, hey, Echo, tell me how much gas is in the tank.  Tell me how long my last trip was.  Supports the Apple Watch and the Pebble.  And there are no monthly fees or subscriptions.  This is all part of the deal.  Normally, 99.95.  Use our special offer code 20 percent off.  This would be a great gift for a teenager.  Good stocking stuffer because they have tools to help teenagers be better drivers.  Including not texting while they drive.  Automatic.com slash twit.  Use the offer code TWIT and you'll save 20 percent of checkout.  That means it's 80 bucks.  And the software is free.  It is awesome.  Highly recommended.  I love my automatic.  It's really nice.  I have one in both cars now.  Automatic.  It's not exactly a self-driving car, but it's more of, you know, it's kind of this theme of data  and how valuable data is.  Hey, good news.  Project Fi now will work with tablets and Internet only devices.  I'm not sure what that means.  No phone.  Just data devices.  But oh, I see.  So you could use Project Fi's data.  Yes.  Ah, so the Nexus seven, the Nexus nine, the iPad Air two and many four and the Galaxy Tab S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not, however, the Pixel C, which doesn't come with it.  It doesn't have LTE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Obviously, the device has to have LTE and you support a SIM card.  If you fact, it says it will work with any GSM unlocked tablet that works on T-Mobile.  Because that's the carrier.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've been using Fi for about six months and it's like it's ideal as a tablet data device type of thing  with the rollover and the low cost.  And, you know, it's great.  Did you say Fi?  Yeah, I say it is Fi.  I guess it's Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are we into a whole new GIF and GIF thing?  Are you into this right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, because it's GIF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Has Google given us any indication about whether it's Fi or Fi or Fo or Fum?  How do you pronounce it?  I don't know.  I'm going to call it Fo.  Google Fo Fum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's another thing like that that I kept calling wrong too other than GIF, which I'm not saying wrong because it's GIF.  No, it's GIF.  No, it's GIF.  But, you know, whatever.  I say GIF.  I say GIF.  The stupidest debate in history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pull the whole thing off.  But geeks love this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's clever.  It's really clever.  And I actually think it's especially clever because I haven't thought of it that great as a voice service.  Not that I use it for voice service.  Well, it's not a bad voice service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not.  My phone is what my Nexus 6 is.  It's not.  But, like, you know, I find that AT&T and Verizon have been more dependable.  That's geographic dependence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The confusing...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no.  But anywhere I go, it's had to work.  Where are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'm usually in SoCal, but I'll be in Northern California.  I'll be in San Francisco.  I'm just in New York.  And, you know, because it's Sprint.  And Sprint generally sucks.  Sprint or T-Mobile.  And T-Mobile sucks less than Sprint, but it's not as good as AT&T and Verizon.  It's not bad, though.  And for the cost, it's not bad.  But that's why for a data sim, to me, it's pretty sweet.  Because, you know, you can tolerate it a little bit less, I guess, if you're, you know, having  a little glitch.  And you only pay for what you use.  And they slice it pretty thin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's like...  Yeah.  It's, you know, kilobytes or something.  I don't know what the...  So let me ask your advice, since Danny's in a very, very dogmatic mood today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't even had anything to drink.  I still have.  I still have my AT&T.  I still have my AT&T.  I still have my AT&T unlimited.  They're raising five bucks, but still cheap.  Thirty five dollars a month.  Oh, I've been holding on to that for dear life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's all you pay thirty five dollars a month for a whole line?  There's no other charges?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the data charge.  Unlimited data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, but you still have to pay for the line.  I have to be part of the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to be part of the family thing and all that stuff.  Yeah.  The line is five dollars.  But I hold on.  It means I cannot tether.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just let it go.  Let it go, Jeff.  I'm going to say the same thing with Verizon.  Let it go.  Let it go.  You'll never use all the data you know.  Go to a family plan and you can have two devices.  It'll all roll over and you get 15 gigabytes for 10 right now with their special offer.  So, I was like, I'd like to tether it.  Like, oh no, we'd have to charge you another charge.  I was fine.  Like, I give up.  They're getting the unlimited out of me.  But I will tell you, Jeff, what you want to do.  Sorry.  Yeah.  The other thing is take a look at Postpaid.  Because, like with Verizon, they're like, I didn't want to leave it not because I wanted  the unlimited data, but because I had like a $65 plan.  And they kept saying, well, you can go to this.  And I'm like, you have nothing that's this low anymore.  I'm like, I'd be happy if you wanted to cap the data.  I just like the price.  And then when I changed my phone, they lost my plan.  I couldn't get it back.  And I gave up.  I just gave up.  They broke me.  It was like, you win.  But I went to Postpaid and it was like $45 a month.  Right?  And that comes with gigabytes of data.  You need more data.  You buy it.  It's like you buy a gigabyte for $15 or maybe it's two gigabytes or five gigabytes.  I can't remember what it is.  But it lasts for like 90 days.  And you can have an extra one in reserve.  So, it is really cheap.  The only thing is you kind of have to, it's a little more hassle dealing with Postpaid.  But you can do the auto payment.  You just make sure you have the...  But PHY solves all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  PHY solves all that.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  PHY is great.  You know where PHY is going to especially rock is the next time I have to go international.  Right?  Because that's supposed to be on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'd get that with a T-Mobile account, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's true.  That's true.  I mean, at 2G speed rather than...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the same.  You're getting exactly...  I paid extra $100 a month.  You're getting the same thing from PHY as you're getting with T-Mobile, as far as I can tell.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think you're getting better speed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think the speed's reduced internationally, but I could be wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think you're getting the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It could easily, easily be wrong.  I'll tell you what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Next time I travel, I'll let you know.  Who's going overseas?  I'm going overseas the day after Christmas.  You are.  Well, if the Bahamas is overseas, it is over AC.  Oh.  But I don't know if the Bahamas is overseas.  I think it is.  I think it counts.  I think it is.  I think so.  I'll be in NASA for one day.  I'll let you know.  Are you doing a cruise?  Yeah.  Out of New Jersey.  Oh, hello.  Apparently, I'm going from Port Liberty, which apparently is not Port Liberty.  It's somewhere else.  But anyway, I don't know.  Jersey City.  Jersey City.  Jersey City, whatever.  On the highest tech ship on the ocean, me and a few close friends, 5,000 other people.  Is this a work cruise?  No, no.  It's with Lisa and the kid.  But it's got bumper cars on the boat.  It's got parachuting.  It's crazy.  And you use your smartphone to open the doors to make reservations to know what's going on.  Oh, my.  Yeah.  What could possibly go wrong with that?  It's super high tech.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would we have the dysentery because nobody could flush the toilet with their phone?  They say it's unsinkable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can't be sunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When you're on that table, just tell Rose to move over because I think that...  We're going to take a run of the iceberg and see.  I think there's room for more than one person on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It will be interesting.  They claim to have very fast internet, like not shipboard style, but really fast internet.  So I'm going to try to Periscope and Skype and maybe I'll call in.  I don't know what we're going to do.  We're going to see Leo in flippers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In flippers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  With a rum drink.  All right.  Pixel C. You've had it for a week now.  I've had it for a week.  I got it.  Oh, you did too.  Oh, you got the portfolio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, because I didn't know the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Jason got the portfolio too.  I got both of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the portfolio is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a full size case.  It's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like my case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just the plain old keyboard case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like if you've never seen an Android tablet before, here's an Android tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's fair.  It's an Android tablet.  I've got like a transformer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Remember the old transformer that they came out with?  Yeah, that's fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nothing special.  I like it.  It's nicer than my Nexus 7.  It's faster, it's bigger, it's prettier.  I like the size of my Nexus 7 better still.  Well, and Jason Howell says the keyboard is too small for his too.  But you know what?  I've got to go get it now.  His big finger.  He's out of here.  He's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like it.  Yeah, I feel too cramped typing on that keyboard.  It just doesn't work for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But also the Android experience makes me feel cramped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To me, you're comparing it to the Pixel, but I'm comparing it to an iPad.  And I like the Android experience better on a tablet this size than I do the iPad experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But going through the rundown today, this is where I drove Jason nuts because I started the wrong date.  And trying to go back and forth between the search and the webpages and the spreadsheet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it would be nice to have split screen.  But I don't mind that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can I rant about the keyboard?  Oh, please do.  So here's the thing.  Here's where I'm like, OK.  I'm trying to center myself.  I used the Surface when the Surface first came out.  And it's been interesting to watch how the Surface form factor of a tablet with a keyboard has kind of taken off.  But the thing is, the Surface is not a tablet with a keyboard.  The Surface is a computer with a keyboard.  And it's really nice to have a keyboard when you're using a computer to do computer like things where, yeah, you've got some touch.  But still, you really want a keyboard and a mouse pad for all that stuff.  So then now that the Surface can continue to get popular because it's a nice form factor for some things.  I've used the Surface as an actual tablet.  That's never a pleasant experience.  But you can get by.  You know, I suppose you can get by if you're like, I kind of want to do it or whatever.  So then Apple's like, well, we have to have the iPad Pro and we'll put a keyboard on it.  Because why?  It's still an iPad that doesn't really need a keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like having a keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not a computer, though.  It's not putting the just hanging that keyboard on the iPad did not turn it into any kind of productivity.  It's an old question.  It's kind of it didn't turn into the productivity device that you get with an actual traditional computer.  And so when the Pixel C hangs their keyboard off of it, it's like, yeah, I know you got the keyboard there, but this didn't make it any more computer like versus tablet like.  So that's why that's the problem I'm having with the keyboard.  It's like, yeah, you've got a keyboard, but it's not changing the fact that this is still just a tablet, not making it anything better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I disagree.  I actually I really like the keyboard on this thing.  For instance, I can go into into our chat room.  Well, I mean, I have email.  I can go into our chair.  So actually, the reason this comes up is because Ron Amadio wrote a great article in Ars Technica where he goes back through and creates, I think, a fairly credible case that really makes it a little bit more difficult to get into the keyboard.  And it's a credible case that really this was going to be a Chrome OS device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  And it was a Chrome OS advice.  Keyboard makes a lot of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  It would work beautifully.  It would be amazing.  So the project Athena, which was a touch screen interface for Chrome OS, was canceled and they were stuck with the hardware which they developed.  And and there is, by the way, there is credible evidence in the in the Chrome OS source code and so forth.  So stuck with this tablet, you know, which and no operating system, the operating system was canceled a year ago, exactly a year ago.  They decided to go ahead with the tablet and just put Android on it.  The motherboard was called the Franken board because at one point they were considering doing a dual boot Chrome OS and Android boot on this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  However, that ended July, July of this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And now they're stuck and they've got to announce something at Google I.O., which was when?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Google I.O. was the that was before that.  But this was announced at the Nexus announcement in September.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they basically just made it an Android tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it explains a lot.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If this thing were Chrome, I would be so in love.  But you hate the keyboard, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, the keyboard is kind of OK.  Yeah. Kind of OK is a good description.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I went back to go look at the ACES Chrome flip or flip Chrome, a Chrome flip or whatever,  and which I mistakenly thought was the Pixel C at one point.  But the downside to that is it has the screen resolution on this is much better.  But but Leo, you know how you said you can go to the chat room and everything.  So you have an iPad now, right? Yeah.  Do you use it with a keyboard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I use the iPad Pro with a keyboard.  Yeah, I think a keyboard.  The problem is absurd. But that's a giant thing.  This is to me because of its size and form factor, a very nice little lightweight halfway laptop.  But I mean, the MacBook is my go to very lightweight laptop.  And it has it's really a laptop.  This is more like for sitting in front of the TV or eating breakfast.  And I can I feel like it's a fairly good device for purposes like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But if you were sitting in front of the TV, you think you would break out the keyboard to go with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It just sits in your lab like this. Yeah. Yeah. It's a nice stand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a stand. Danny, what about covering a conference?  You're at a conference, you're running all around. It's nice and light. It has a keyboard.  You can open it up. It's beautiful for a student or a conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That might be more than you want, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, at a conference, I could see you doing this, but that's where actually a surface is kind of nice, but a bit heavier.  But, you know, I don't know, I go to conferences all the time.  And usually if I've got to open something and I need a little bit more than a more than a laptop, a little a little bit, I get my iPad out and it's all touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is iPad size. I'm not trying to I'm not trying to do and it's Android, which I think is better suited for this kind of stuff.  I like it. I'm actually I don't know if I should have the other keyboard now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel bad. Yeah, you see how you see how compact that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't even I don't even care to have a keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can return it. You have an extended return.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really yeah, that's right. Because of Christmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, I thought Ron's story was was good.  I feel like this thing does everything I want it to do.  I don't I really do like it.  Once you learn the keyboard shortcuts, you can very quickly do most of the stuff you want to do.  I like touch on a laptop, and that's one reason why I think the MacBook is, you know, is missing touch.  I have a Surface Book, which I like a lot, but it's a little bigger and heavier than this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Definitely could use that touch. I love touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't I think Apple's wrong about touch.  So I feel like I'm but I also love Android and I feel like now a lot of the critiques were things like, oh, it's you know, there aren't enough Android tablet aware apps.  That's just a choice of apps. For instance, you know, Instagram is is not tablet aware.  You know, it would make this stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, what would make it so much better is what's what I liked about it was, especially with the keyboard, was when I went into the browser.  Yeah, because it felt like I was using a regular browser.  And what I wish they would have done is set the browser up to act as if you weren't using an Android device, which you really were using a Chromebook because they use Firefox.  Use Firefox.  I guess I could do that.  But it's like I could I could probably get an extension or whatever.  But if they just gave me a full Chrome browser on it somehow, some magical Firefox is the desktop browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It uses all the Firefox extensions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. Well, maybe I'll switch over to Firefox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's basically a desktop browser.  So that's one thing I would say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I haven't finished Jessica Jones yet.  No spoilers.  But you know, that's the other thing, too.  So I got the you have to choose the right apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Twitter doesn't use the space well, but Talon does a really nice job with the space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that was the point of like if you just give me your Chrome browser and configure the Chrome browser to act like as if it were a desktop, I don't need to worry about that.  That's Chrome OS.  I understand.  Because the Chrome browser does everything.  That's why I got the Lumia 950, you know, the Microsoft thing.  Right.  And I finally got the little box that lets you turn it into you know, you plug everything into the box and you can use it as a computer.  And that was amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because you got the continuum and you like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's amazing.  Interesting.  What was amazing about it was to me was once I fired up the browser, the browser and the desktop, it was more it was slower than being on a desktop.  But you really realized how when you have a browser, it kind of doesn't matter so much what your apps are.  And I really was intrigued by the idea that I could have this phone go somewhere and just turn it into my computer browser if I just, you know, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and connect it in to the all the external stuff if I wanted it to that.  It was intriguing to me.  I'm a fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I guess this would have been interesting.  Frankenbord would have been interesting, the idea to be able to switch back and forth.  But I don't know.  Maybe everybody is funny.  I like it.  Everybody hates this so much that I feel like I must be wrong.  Don't you think they're going to hate it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't you think they're just going to release like in a few months?  Like, hey, Pixel C owners prefer Chrome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or I think there's an equal possibility that the that Android N will be extended to make this more palatable with with, you know, resizable windows.  The Pixel team has said as much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, they said that in an AMA on Reddit a few days ago.  There's only a few things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I think it's so close.  There's only a few things that might make a big difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is this when they turn Chrome into Android?  No, I don't think this was initially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I thought this was really.  That was my thought.  But now I kind of like this as an Android device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Jeff, we're getting your weird mic stuff again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's interesting.  While Jeff's fixing his microphone, let's listen to Google Pella.  There's an a cappella group at Google.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Who knew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Some people, a cappella groups make them want to just poke their eyes out.  Other people.  Love them.  Keep boxing.  Yeah.  A geek sandwich.  Geek on geek, geek on geek.  Apparently, it's hard to get into, much like a cappella groups at the nation's leading universities.  Okay, that's enough of that story.  Sorry.  I love my Chromecast audio.  I do believe Chromecast audio is going to eat Sonos' lunch, and I'm a huge Sonos fan.  They've added multi-room support, which really was the Sonos secret sauce.  Now they have support of high-res audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've got disappointment with Chromecast audio.  What's wrong with it?  Here's the thing.  I was excited about it because we have a boat and then everybody's always wanting to play music.  It's cheap.  It's always like, well, hand me the aux cable.  No, here's the aux cable.  It's not going over there.  I thought this could be awesome.  I get it all installed, and I'm out on the water, and it wants to hook up to my Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It has Wi-Fi on the boat?  Well, why did you think it would work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like bringing your Chromecast on the boat.  Why do I need to have Wi-Fi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why can't it generate its own Wi-Fi like my drone does?  I think you misunderstand the purpose of the Chromecast audio.  No, it's to be totally fine if you can just set it up so that it generates its own or it doesn't do it.  It does Bluetooth like you have.  Instead of the Chromecast, which I thought I was going to use, I'm now using one of those things you plug into Bluetooth  that does the...  Hotspotting.  You connect it through Bluetooth, and it does the audio.  Yeah, but there's lots of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The idea of this is much like Chromecast video, that it enables a speaker, a powered speaker system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, but it can't internet enable that speaker system if you're not near the internet.  If you don't have the internet, well, what's the point?  Because if I'm in my car, or if I'm in an RV, or I'm in a car...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's not for that. It's for your house.  Why?  It's for a place with internet.  Why?  Because the idea is it brings...  But it could be.  It's like saying, my Roku, it's really annoying. I need the internet to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what it's for.  It's not hard to do it. You just make it so that it broadcasts its own local Wi-Fi as it does.  And it won't be $35.  As it does when you need to set it up in the first place.  Just use a Bluetooth speaker.  Then everybody's got their phones, just connects to it, and you play your music locally, because we all got local music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you need that for? You just use your Bluetooth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but now I have to get another device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't all the powered speakers you have have to support Bluetooth?  No.  Oh, well, that's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like a stereo thing in the car, right? They've got old cars, and it's been money on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So in any event, just because Danny doesn't understand what it's for, I think it's great.  I do. I like Chromecast Audio.  The only thing wrong with it, just as there was with the video Chromecast, is there's a lack of support at this point.  But Pandora, Spotify, iHeartRadio, Google Play Music, and I use it all the time, and it's very high quality.  And I think it's a really good solution.  Howard Stern kept his employees and fans hanging. Were you listening to...?  Oh, you bet I was.  Tell us what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On Monday, he came and said we might have two more shows. I really don't know. He insisted he didn't know.  I mean, I guess the T and Stern wasn't crossed yet, but he was just too calm the last few months.  He wasn't neurotic about this, and he was making great shows, and he was saying nice things about the show.  His contract was about to run.  Yeah, it was the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So he signed a deal and he did 10 years total, right? So he did a five-year contract, two five years? No?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, he did a five-year, but he's handed over his video and his history for 12 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but I'm saying up to now, he signed a very famous $400 million deal for five years.  That was an $80 million deal. Then he renewed it for another five years, and now the third term is up.  And apparently they weren't seeing eye to eye. He just wanted the same amount of money though, right? Just another, just $80 million a year. That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't know. I mean, he got screwed royally out of the big stock option he was supposed to get,  which I think I've always guessed was part of the calculation of the value of the deal.  And he lost the court case on that because when the XM serious merger happened,  they said you don't get any credit for any of that XM stuff. All you get is credit for the serious stuff.  And he said, whoa. And he said he wrote in his journal when all this started way back when,  that serious, this thing would hit 30 million users.  Nobody laughed at him while they're almost at 30 million users right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And there's only, and I understand serious because there's really only reason, one reason,  one reason that anybody would have satellite radio in their car when you've got all these great options on your internet is Howard Stern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No way. I have serious. I don't know if it's the Howard Stern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's great. Why would you have satellite?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why would you pay $15 a month for satellite radio? OK, for music?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's crappy sounding hits one because all FM because 80s on eight because you can get all of that on the internet.  There's no internet in my car. I just want to turn on the car. Listen to my music.  There's internet on your phone. Listen to some live music.  I've got music. It's nice. I've got NPR. I've got BBC World Service. My wife loves that. She turns it on.  Like, why do I need to get all of that on your phone and then I just drive in the car.  I just want to turn on the music clearly, nicely. You're one of the few of the proud.  A little laugh FM. It's all right. It's terrible.  I got all my original VJs on 80s on eight. I'll tell you why. First of all, why would I listen to Howard Stern?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, I'm just saying that most normal people find that they have a much broader range of choices on their phone  and they just put it through the speakers in their car and they get all the music, all the laughs, all the radio,  every radio station in the world. International stuff.  And the quality, incidentally, is so much better. The Sirius especially. The old XM was slightly higher quality.  Sirius is the worst sounding music, worse than AM. It's terrible sounding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm in a car. I'm in a car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You must be deep because I swear to God, you can hear the digital artifacting.  It's very low bandwidth because they just don't have the bandwidth.  I don't drive that often. So it's not. I don't even. I'm not even like driving that often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If I'm going to be seriously driving somewhere, maybe I think about getting a podcast set up.  Then I can't even do that because no one wants to listen to me listening to podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, every time I get a new car, I get Sirius for some period of time, usually a year or two.  But I rarely listen to it. I like Coffee House. That was OK.  But I really have to think that Howard Stern is probably 80 or 90 percent of the reason people listen to satellite radio still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If Stern did leave, and mind you, I've told the story here five years ago, I connected him to Google.  I wanted him to go to the Internet. I wanted him to be, not that I could have had any influence,  but I think that he could have made entertainment on the Internet a whole different level.  But he didn't. He was a wage slave. You want to stay there.  But if he came back around this time, I was thinking, all right, do I give it up? Yeah.  There's no reason. My wife, my wife is Danny. My wife, same as Danny.  She likes Sirius because she has the station and she wants a DJ picking the songs for her.  Whatever you can get beats one from your. I agree. I agree.  Yeah, but I, I, Stern is Stern has been absolutely brilliant.  And there have been a couple of tributes to him in the press. I'm glad to see right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A million dollars a year. Is he that brilliant? I feel like he's going to bankrupt Sirius XM.  I mean, I understand why they had to give it to him, but they actually he's the he's the core of it.  And they had to have no business without him. But do they have a business with him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, don't forget that also includes by all accounts production cost of a show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My feeling is that they're hoping that the because they did get seven years of rights to all of his previous content and they're making an app.  And I feel like they're really hoping that's going to help defray the cost of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, here's the real question, Leo. Satellite is a ridiculous technology.  They're not going to be business in a few years. So so what you're going to start listening to is Howard Stern via the app, not via the satellite.  I'll give up the satellite radio. I'll have the phone. I'll listen to Stern. It'll have more functionality.  I can listen to what I want to. I'm not I'm not caught to his schedule and so on and so forth.  I'll get video as well. But then the question is, can Sirius as an entire company compete with all those choices that you just listed?  It's got to be tough. It's got to be tough. Now, Danny, Danny's going to want hits one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And but your reason I believe the reason I believe well, you can duplicate all of that.  I mean, go to tune in and you can get 80s, 90s. There's I mean, there's plenty of ways to duplicate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I don't even know why I'm paying for it. I've seen the light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. You spend you waste a lot of money. But yeah.  And I think that radio terrestrial radio succeeds to the degree it does because it's live and local.  And so you get a sense of a human being.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's all dead. That's gone. Dead. It's been Stern was the was the last nail in that coffin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My local radio station, because I can't get I can't get I can't get the other thing unless you commercial terrestrial morning edition.  You got to like you can't get that on satellite. I make a million dollars a year on commercial terrestrial radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I better not go away. That's a big chunk of my income.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're a special. You're listening. No, no, it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you're right. Because the weekends are tougher and tougher.  I'm telling you, we have a hard time clearing stations because they want to run vitamin infomercials on the weekends.  They don't want to write run. They just want to want to milk them right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's where we are. Whereas you compare to Europe, where it's government supported at some level and radio is still very popular.  There was a story in The Guardian asking last week, how come podcasts are taking off in Europe?  And I said, it's because radio there's pretty good and terrestrial radio here is pretty sucky.  And what happened was the chains and I'm not against, you know, if companies got to do what they got to do when the chains came together, they delocalized local radio.  So there was no real. I know. This is our guy. Yeah, I know. That, by the way, you're a specialty on some metros, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You still in most metros, I mean, you still get a local the local talk show host, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You get the talk show host and then you get and you get the 87th worst Stern imitator. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the mornings are pretty bad. But I'm not I'm not as big a Stern fan as you are. I know you're a massive Stern fan.  Oh, he's frozen. Either that or he cannot believe I don't like Howard Stern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel bad that I don't know how our Stern now. So so don't be angry with me, Howard. I know.  You never listen to Howard on Sirius. I watched your movie. No, I don't even know what channel he's on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's on like eight channels. He has a fairly hefty chunk of serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just what you have to understand that, you know, I'm very unculturally relevant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you haven't picked up, you've got to get a T-Mobile phone because then you don't have to pay bandwidth costs and you can see mobile phone.  Oh, then you can stream unlimited. Do you have Bluetooth in your car?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe you have an older car. Well, I have on one of the cars. I have Bluetooth.  It's all those wires and things. If I were in the car, there's no wires.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You get in the car, you turn it just I listen to audio.  Oh, yeah, I don't think I have Bluetooth. You don't have Bluetooth audio.  That's why. OK, because otherwise there's no one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have the little Bluetooth thing. They told you because the Chromecast can't do it.  So I had to get the other thing. And do you know what happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I still use I still have a car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that my son wants to play music and I'm like, well, I'll put this in there and then you can do it.  And I don't have to try to hand you the aux cable so that they can like play the Hamilton soundtrack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then it's like, no, just hand me the cable. Oh, the Hamilton. Is that good? I got to get that.  Oh, yeah, it is good. I'm one I we went to see a really good show when we were in New York when to see something rotten.  But now I'm regretting because you can't get Hamilton tickets until 2019.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can I? Last week, I like. Oh, did you see it? I'm dying to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, my God. It was so good. I'd rather see that than Star Wars, to be honest with you.  Tough. Lisa's going, no, it's a rapping Alexander Hamilton, a rapping Aaron Burr.  I hear Thomas Jefferson's amazing. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. But the best thing, honestly, George King George.  Oh, my God. Look, just get you can get the soundtrack. Yeah, I might do that.  I got it. Yeah. But we play through the aux cable because Generation Z can't be bothered with Bluetooth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Generation G can't be bothered with. Is that what you are? Is that your problem?  Are you there? Are you? I'm generation. Are you're genetics?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm like still trying to put the cassette in the car. What are we Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're generation stone age. Generation stone age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's all what works. They don't they don't, you know, they don't care.  They don't need no Bluetooth that because you know what?  You know what, Leo? What? Hey, come here. Here's my theory.  Here's my theory. Yeah. They don't want to do the Bluetooth because Generation Z is so far advanced that it is too much work  to tap on this, turn the Bluetooth on and make sure it's connected.  It just can't just get in the car and it works. Just hand me the cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, there's no cable. You just get in the car and it plays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's because it's analog. It's because of my. Who's that?  How come you don't use Bluetooth in the car? Because auxiliary cables are easier.  And the other son is yelling from his room where he normally when he does his own broadcast, normally he's all like streaming quiet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's really. Yeah. What is he doing? Twitch. Twitch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, what is he like games? Yeah, this is broadcast like Call of Duty all day long.  Are they? What grade is he in? They're doing stuff.  They're doing stuff. I just I hope I can just retire off of them.  That's all. But they can't be bothered with Bluetooth. Aux cables work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's where they're at. All right. All right. Far be it for me to argue with Generation G or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If I gave them the Chromecast, they would be more excited about the Aux cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The tiny little like one half inch cable. That's when we get them excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, one last thing, by the way, because I know I'm just I'm destroying the show. I'm sorry.  I think I'm already into the weekend. But the other thing is like there's the echo, right? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My wife's on this. You don't like the echo either? Love the echo. Oh, good. Thank God. Love the echo. Thank God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought that someone used the echo to turn on the Christmas tree. So I'm like, she's like, can you make that happen?  I can make that happen. Did you? Yeah. Well, I said I don't know that I want to spend the hundred dollars to make it happen.  You have to buy. Yeah. But then me thinking I'm awesome. I ordered like a thirty five dollar plug that uses Apple home kit.  Yeah. Work with Android. Right. Yeah. Got it all set up. Got it all set up.  And then I'm like, I'm all like, what do I do right now? Like, you'll love this. I should do this, Lisa.  I got to set this up. Turn on the Christmas tree. I'm sorry, Dave.  OK, boom. Christmas tree is on. Nice. Right. I think I take everything back that I ever said about you, Danny.  I think that's amazing. She's like, no, I don't want it through Siri because Siri is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't you have an aux cable for the Christmas tree?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's like, I'm the wall because she's British and Siri still doesn't understand her.  So she's like, I can't be messing with it. And then it's like, well, if you unplugging it from the wall, you're undefeated.  The whole point. I spent forty bucks for a dog. It was amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, all right. Little Hamilton. And then we're going to take a break.  And did you guy come to fix up your house? He's 20 minutes late. Oh, good.  All right. We're going to take a break from the tips and picks of the week. Oh, oh, my God.  Oh, he's so good. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you King George the third.  When's he going to rap? He just rap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know I think you could probably use anything but as long as you're searching Google obviously.  See what you got. I'll try it on iOS and I'll do it in Safari. All right. I'll do it in. I'll do it on my blackberry.  Speaking of the blast from the past. B-U-B-B-L-E. I might even talk to it. I might even just talk to it like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's your number Mr. Let's see. Jay choices. Well court says that we have we hit peak Google in 2013.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the. They took that term from Ben Thompson's strata query right. Yeah. Yeah. Technically they said peak desktop desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly. They really had to really had to work that. They're a traditional product desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And now they have so. Yeah. And Google's gone on to all kinds of new things and alphabet.  So I thought it was a little bit of a cheap shot actually but that's OK. But also a more useful number.  The pixel pixel Nexus 5X and 6P are on sale right now for fifty dollars off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I really like those phones I have to say. I do too. I would say you know I was holding out hope on this Blackberry.  Priv but that might have great better battery life because it's got a big old battery and does have a probably a better camera than the with OIS and a physical keyboard  which really is such a retro thing. But I have to say having used this now for a day I'm thinking the Nexus 6P is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can I make a plea though. But it's law with the Nexus piece. Yeah. This is my iPhone.  And if you look at my case nice case respect. Yeah. All my credit card stuff is there.  So I have not carried a wall for two years. I want my Galaxy S6.  Same thing. Beautiful wallet case. This is the nightmare. That is my thing. I've got to like got to put something on the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you are you saying you don't like the Nexus 6P because it doesn't have a wallet case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. Let me tell you if you have hit peak Danny let me tell you.  I'm telling you if you haven't judged your popularity and whether people actually like the phone you will find a freaking wallet case for it.  And if the makers can't be bothered to make a wallet case for it that phone has no future.  No future. I need Google. This is really important.  I it looks awful. Look who wants to have that on the back. Not me. I see people at Google like that as well.  Just make us a wallet phone. It's not what I want. You know what I want.  And you know what when they sold the phone when they released it the first cases that they gave out for the 6P that the official cases didn't have the right cut out so you couldn't make screenshots.  I had to send mine back and get a proper one. This is a nice one from Seaton or Sidon or wherever they are.  But like you would use it and it wouldn't take the screenshots because the case wasn't even right.  So I want as much care taken to the accessories I can get with my phone. It's a beautiful phone.  But I have to let go. Do I really want to carry that and then shove my wall in my you know never think about that my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you know what I want. I want Danny Sullivan on a talk show with General Leia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  General Leia. Don't know spoilers. Oh no no no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh well that's all right. We kind of know. You know she was I just saw her last night running around giving orders and then you know Hans like but a scoundrel scoundrel and then like they kiss and then all of a sudden she goes from I'm in control of the whole empire to.  I'm wearing slave girl outfit. Come on George. Come on George. Which episode was that. Can we eliminate that episode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's got it all from the machete. Just machete that out of there. Oh no this isn't my son's giving me suggestions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Use the hump on the battery case to make that into a wallet case. Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A little razor blade. You slit the razor blade. You take the battery out. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They could just do it. Look I never want to carry a wallet again.  I love having a wallet case and the spec wallet cases. They're awesome. They've been they've been really good.  And like I've seen some other companies do them too. So it's like just give me somebody somebody I'm begging a nice wallet case for the 6p and that'll make it happen or Google should just make it happen.  That's just anyway but yeah it's good fun and I got used to the whole fingerprint on the back thing. I love that. I really love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's why I hard use it because my watch unlocks it. Well see I did the opposite. I turned off all of the automatic unlocks because it's so easy just to fingerprint and it's more secure not to have it ever unlocked unless you give it your fingerprint.  So I just turned off all of the smart unlocking everywhere. Yeah and use the fingerprint because it's just so natural. And by the way that is where I'm going to ding the BlackBerry because without a finger I think every phone should have a fingerprint reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you know what by the way message for you Apple if I give you my fingerprint let the fingerprint unlock the phone. Yeah I know. Because on the day for some reason they change this from four digits to six digit pins and because I'm older now I couldn't remember the last two digits and I locked myself out of the phone.  And I'm like my Apple watch can't unlock it. My fingerprint can't unlock it and apparently if I keep entering it wrong I'm going to well I eventually figured it out again. You only have ten tries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well I kept turning it off or something. Was it really if I'd done it ten times in a row. Then what. Then what. Well it depends if you turn this feature on but there it sounds like Danny did. There's ten after ten retries it erases the phone.  Oh my god. I was just like. No. You were that close to losing everything. I mean I have. Imagine how it's. Apple. This is actually a ding on iOS. It asks for passwords way too often for the store for the thing all the time. You updated it asks for password and I think they're trying to prevent people from stealing it.  And reselling iPhones and it does do that. Katie Benner of the New York Times was on the show a couple of weeks ago. Her iPhone had been stolen but the guy couldn't wipe it with it without bricking it.  So he just sold it on eBay with all her stuff on it and the guy who bought it on eBay said well this is Katie Benner's iPhone and called her and said I have your iPhone.  That's great. Because. And so to their credit that's the reason but I have to say it's very annoying. Yeah. Way too much. You have a fingerprint. That is a very secure way of identifying myself. You shouldn't have to go beyond that.  Damn. You know we were going to ask for submissions for Twitter for the best of coming up next.  We just had Christmas like I think we just played this episode. Yeah. Just the Danny. It's Danny Sullivan. Best of. You rock Danny. Yeah. I love your passion.
