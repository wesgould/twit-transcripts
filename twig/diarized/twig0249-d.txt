And Gina Trapani is here from her headquarters, her world headquarters,  at thinkup.com.  Hi Gina. Hello. How are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good. Good to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And she's, of course, not only the creator of Think Up,  but the founding editor of Life Hacker, the author of the famous Google Wave book.  The complete guide to Google Wave.  You're so mean. You're so mean.  Well, that, she wrote it.  Okay. Also a couple of Life Hacker books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was going to say, we had Life Hacker books in the third edition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go. Third edition, where did that come out? That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, win some, you lose some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think a couple, a year or two ago now.  We're actually talking about the next edition, so that's exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Awesome. I still want to do that Life Hacker show with you and Merlin.  I guess you both have kind of gone off to do it elsewhere,  but because his, I guess his work, Men at Work show is kind of a Life Hacker-ish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, really? I don't even know.  I sort of lost track of him a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. No, he was on the other day. It was really nice to see him again.  Also here, speaking of nice to see him, look, he's in studio with us.  Jeff Jarvis, City University of New York, professor of journalism.  His flesh tones are real. He blogs at BuzzMachine.com as author of Public Parts.  And what will Google do?  And I wish you told me you were going to go to Starbucks,  because I would have arranged for a better coffee experience.  We actually bought an espresso machine because we were spending so much at Starbucks.  Like hundreds of dollars a month, I figured it out.  I thought six months, we'll pay for it, but just with a coffee machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you had the Oprah chai yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Starbucks has chai from Oprah?  Yes.  Is that south of India, Oprah?  Oh, I saw Oprah.  Is that in Kathmandu? What is Oprah chai?  You mean it's Oprah branded chai?  She doesn't have enough money.  Would this woman get her fingers out of my life?  Oprah branded chai?  Yeah. Oh, yeah.  Is it like Oprah's favorite chai?  Of course. Of course.  Like Oprah's best? It'll make you feel...  I like chai. No, I'll go down and try it. I didn't know.  See, it worked. It made me want to try their chai.  They did not have good chai at Starbucks. That was actually a...  What is chai?  It's Indian tea with spices, so cardamom, pepper.  I can't remember what some of the other chief spices are.  Maybe a little cinnamon.  And it's delicious. You don't like chai? You've never had chai?  I've never had it.  It's a spicy tea.  It's something you eat with sprouts.  No, it's fabulous. It's a spiced tea. You'd love it.  No, it's not hippie-dippy at all.  Oh, no. It's all you can get in India.  Now, if they made Deepak Oprah chai...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now you got a hit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see. In Google land, there is some big news.  Europe has said you have the right to be forgotten.  A European court said Google must edit sensitive search results.  People can ask Google to take stuff off of their index.  There are 180 similar cases right now in Spain.  This is a very popular thing.  In fact, I think it was the EU's privacy czar who first proposed this.  First proposed, yes.  Nelly Crowes.  Well, actually, it was the other one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, first of all, as you understand it, you are our reporter from Europe.  You have to have a...  You've been there, right?  I'm closer.  Yeah, you're closer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's closer than I am. She's about two miles east from where I am.  What is the right to be forgotten?  The argument is that when something bad about you is online,  you should have the right to get rid of this.  But clearly, clearly, that has an impact on the other party's free speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what you could do is go to the place where it is.  Oh, I guess if, like, you were...  I don't know, there are pictures of you in an orgy that were distributed widely.  Or...  The only place you could get it kind of turned off is Google.  Well, the original site...  But if it's, like, in a hundred sites...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If it's spread all over, then you can probably cut access to it,  but it's still on those sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google's defense would be, I imagine, well, we're merely...  Google search index merely indexes the state of the Internet as it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the argument that comes back then is, well, what's your algorithm?  And they always risk this danger of the demand to reveal the algorithm.  And how did that end up on top?  But this is a really, really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can't Google defend that by saying, well, we have PageRank,  and this is how we use it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But here's the problem. They don't have a First Amendment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no right to free speech in Europe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, right. There's not the same guarantee in the same kind of absolute way.  At CUNY on Monday, we gave an award to Alan Rusberger, the editor of The Guardian,  and Floyd Abrams of The New York Times, who defended The New York Times,  and the Pentagon Papers case both spoke.  And Alan keeps on going on about the need for a First Amendment in the rest of the world.  We're the only ones who have one.  So that's an absolute right to speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even more, in my opinion, seems to reflect a misunderstanding of technology.  A deep misunderstanding of technology.  I think the right to be forgotten is a wonderful thing, and I wish it existed.  But it doesn't, because you're not eliminating these websites at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but it's worse than that, Leo, because what you're really saying is  that you're going to control knowledge.  It's a men in black pen moment, right?  And you forget. So you're telling the world to forget something the world already knows.  That is offensive to the notion of knowledge.  That says that we're trying to control knowledge.  It's mind control, it's propaganda, it's tyranny.  All these things leave that you would think if anyone in the world has learned this lesson, it's Europe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, but let me put a counter example.  So you're a person who doesn't have a lot of a presence on the internet,  doesn't participate in the internet.  You're just, you know, you don't, it's not part of your life.  You don't have a Facebook page or a Twitter page.  You've in fact never put anything online attached to your name.  But somebody, a bad person, decides to write something bad about you.  That bad person has a popular website or whatever, and that bad thing gets spread everywhere.  That is the entire Google search result for your name is that bad stuff.  May even be a lie, may even be libel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you do then?  Well, we have a cure for that. That's libel.  It's libel law.  We already have that legal mechanism.  And in fact in the UK it's so wacky people from around the world go to sue on libel there.  So there's plenty of mechanism to say something is said about you.  But the other case is what if you got arrested for drunk driving 10 years ago and that's online somewhere.  And you say, well really it's been 10 years.  Can't you just forget?  But it's public record?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not in the internet, you can't.  Right.  Yeah, and I think that blaming Google is what's really puzzling to me.  Well that's the anti-tech part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the Luddite moment here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because this is just an index of what already exists on the net.  And they're saying, well since we can't delete what already exists, what if we just control your ability to find it?  And that's not Google's fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's not at all.  And again, I still want to come back to this notion of free speech because in any transaction of information there are two parties.  And if you say something bad about me and I go on and say, well I just didn't like that or in the words of this, it's irrelevant.  And I make Google take it down and you have the right to be able to say, no, no, no.  When I call Jarvis a jerk, it's because he is a jerk.  It's because I mean it.  And I have a right to call him a jerk.  And now that right is being impinged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the ruling, which was in Luxembourg because it's the European Union Court of Justice, was in a case where a Spanish man complained to the Spanish Data Protection Agency.  It's interesting they even have such a group.  Those are fun groups, yeah.  That an auction, this is the same country that brought you the Inquisition just in case you're wondering.  That an auction notice of his repossessed home showing up on Google, that infringed his privacy.  Now the company, well this is a quote from the judges.  If following a search made on the basis of a person's name, the list of results displays a link to a web page which contains information on the person in question.  That data subject may approach the operator directly and where the operator does not grant his request, bring the matter before the competent authorities in order to obtain under certain circumstances, the removal of that link from the list of results.  The judge is conflating the listing of the repossession, which is presumably not just, Google is pointing to a page somewhere, but he's conflating that with the Google search results saying that Google is in fact presenting that information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have this idea that Google is the Internet.  And Google, this is what Eric Schmidt always says, that because Google is the largest entity on the Internet, anything people don't like about the Internet, they're going to go after Google for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the biggest issue. The judges said an Internet search engine operator is responsible for the processing that it carries out of personal data which appear on web pages published by third parties.  That is so abhorrent.  But what if Google took out any extract that said what that content was, but merely a link to the page?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, think of it from Google's perspective. Now they have to become the court of what's right and wrong.  So I come to you and I say, you should take down that foreclosure notice.  And then Google says, well, were you foreclosed? Was it true? Is this libelous? Is this wrong? Google can't be the court of hurt feelings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's not even practical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, this is hard. I'm going to try and take it from the other perspective.  I mean, I think in these situations, I try not to think about it necessarily from the perspective of Google, but maybe from the perspective of someone who has a genuine issue.  I mean, I don't know. What if when Etta grows up, she doesn't like the things that I wrote about her, the pictures that I published of her when she was a child.  She wants to be defined, you know, other than how I defined her or worse.  You know, you have those sites where like ex-boyfriends publish, you know, private photos of their girlfriends.  That's a better example because that's so obviously harmful.  Yeah, yeah. I mean, of course, I don't think that Google can decide what's right and wrong and decide what's fact and what's not.  But the truth is, I mean, it is kind of privacy through obscurity.  If it's not listed in the first page of your Google search results or the first few pages, it might as well not exist.  People can't find it or if someone's been doxed and their address and social security number has been published somewhere for some reason.  I just it feels like there are so many instances where an individual who can't necessarily practically reach out to all these third party websites and ask them to remove private and embarrassing potentially harmful information like doesn't have any recourse.  I'm trying to I'm trying to figure out, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm reaching back into my in my two elderly memory right now.  Wasn't there a feature on some search engine or some such somewhere once that allowed you to annotate things and say there was a response?  There was more of a right to response than a right to erase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hmm. Remember that right to put do anything to the Google index.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What do you mean? Like like like trackbacks that that kind of thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it wasn't that it was it was that there was some kind of a kind of chat room with my crazy.  Wasn't there a moment where there was an effort to be able to add on to church results?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess my question is, is the solution for an individual what Schmidt suggested that we'd have to change our names if we want to reinvent ourselves?  I know it was a joke.  But like if I'm an individual who has a history of, you know, of, you know, whatever well documented online, I'm trying to reinvent myself and trying to be a better person.  I'm trying to be a different person.  And I can't get that information.  I mean, the solution is a more tolerant society.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The solution. Sorry, it's this big.  The solution is a more tolerant society that recognizes that we all do things that we were mistakes.  We all do things that we're ashamed of.  At some point, we all learn lessons and learn life as we go on in our one attempt at it.  And this idea that off with your head, if you do one thing wrong at one point, or if somebody doesn't like that you're gay, that's the larger issue is tolerance.  We can't solve that through trying to sanitize Google of things some people don't like.  Or for even so fine, you know, take Google out of it and now just say the Internet.  OK, so now say that you said something about me that I didn't like at some point.  I said something stupid like I like wave.  And as a technology genius on this show, I would never mention that book again.  So just because I don't like it, can you come to me and say that you have to take down what I don't what I don't like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, so there's the Internet and there's most people's lens into the Internet.  I think Google search results are most people's lens in the Internet.  Does the book if you can't find the book in the library, you know, it's not in the organ in the do decimal system.  It's not in the catalogs like no one can find it.  Sure, it exists. But but it's you know, look, the reality is that employers and clients and mothers and siblings all Google people.  Right. That's what you do. You Google people to find out something about them.  And there might be a time when you know, you I mean, I get it.  I get it. It's a tough issue. I just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the next step of this is that if Google can be forced to take it down, then any and every site, including us, will be forced to take things down and will be held liable in Europe.  If we say something, if I say something, you know, hair Schmidt is a dork.  And now hair Schmidt can go to the EU court and say, you must take that down, Mr.  Jarvis. I said, no, he's a dark.  And this just proved it because you went to the court to ask me to take it down. No, I don't like this.  It is irrelevant to me. You must take it down. That impinges upon my speech.  That's I just can't get past that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, something's verifiably untrue.  Someone says something verifiably untrue about about Leo.  You know, but what happens all the time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It happens all the time.  So I'm just I mean, I understand both sides.  But I think that it's like saying, well, let's just not have an Internet because then this is a problem.  And I think that, unfortunately, punishing Google for this is, first of all, is ineffective.  It seems it seems misdirected.  I understand what you're saying, Gina, that it's the card catalog.  And if you if you take the book out of the card catalog, doesn't matter if it's in the stacks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But even if you look at things like the Knowledge Graph, I mean, Google has taken upon itself, you know, the idea that it's this repository of facts that you can ask it questions and it will give you answers.  What if something is the wrong answer? If something is untrue?  I mean, do they become the arbiter of truth at some point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Truth is a very hard statement.  Well, and that's a problem is that this puts them in a position to do that, right?  They they they don't have to be a judge.  I mean, this is a tough one.  I don't know. It's tough. It's tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I actually I tend to agree with both of you.  I'm just trying to I like to take the perspective of kind of the, you know, the person who's less empowered.  I think this is less about, you know, someone calling someone a name and more about someone who's in a position where information about them, which is either untrue or which is truly private or should be private.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, but that's what Leo's point is, I think, Gina, is that is that the horse is out of the barn, the cat out of the bag.  We're in a world now where knowledge passes around quickly, information passes around quickly.  And all in all, I want that. And it comes with a price.  So we also have to teach people to check things first.  We have to teach people to that they do have to go online and say something in response.  We have to recognize that people make mistakes early in life.  These are these are new realities and trying to hold back the technology in their work.  And so we have to deal with that reality, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And meanwhile, you have the freedom to annoy in New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you know about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yesterday, the Court of Appeals in Albany in a near unanimous decision struck down a statute that made a felony in New York to communicate with someone in a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm.  These are actually ordinances used by the district attorney in New York to prosecute harassers, which is an issue, too.  It was an anti-troll ordinance.  The case involved a 54 year old Greenwich Village resident who waged a yearlong campaign, actually many yearlong campaign against academic rivals of his father, a Dead Sea Scrolls scholar.  Man, it takes there's all kinds of trolls in the world.  They create the guy created or is alleged to create sock puppets, false identities.  He opened email accounts in the names of some of his antagonists and wrote messages confessing to wrongdoing.  Of course, those were not real.  He was convicted of 30 counts of aggravated harassment, criminal impersonation, identity theft, forgery and unauthorized use of a computer, sentenced to six months in jail, five years of probation.  Now, he's still, you know, seven of the ten charges were thrown out.  He still has misdemeanor counts of criminal impersonation and identity theft.  But the being annoying part was, yeah, and that that that statute was struck down Cyrus Vance Jr.  District Attorney in Manhattan says the aggravated harassment statute is one of the most important tools we have to protect victims of among other serious crimes, stalking and domestic violence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's what we have to figure out here is that is that there's a line.  It goes over the line.  You become a troll.  We had the story on a few weeks ago about how trolls really are sick, sadistic people.  Right. So it is at some point where somebody is going to determine this is an illness.  If you treat it like that, you know, this is an odd comparison here.  But look at Donald Sterling, who is saying noxious and abhorrent and awful and ridiculous things.  But he also appears to be off his rocker.  Right. And so what we're doing in the media now is exploiting that fact to get an hour's discussion on CNN repeated over and over and over again, because he's friggin loony.  And so I don't want to speak about this guy who was in the court case in New York, but trolls are generally loony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so it seems like you could prosecute on a variety as they did on a variety of ways.  But apparently you're free to annoy people.  It's not against the law in New York.  I could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, a lot of people do it to me.  I am very annoyed by open mouth gum chewing and people do it.  I'm annoyed by tourists who walk slowly on the sidewalk anywhere they friggin show.  Pants. Yeah, right.  I'm annoyed by knees, guys.  We got nothing but short pants.  They annoy me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nonetheless, it's perfectly legal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is. Knees are legal and good thing for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I actually have to agree that this, you know, you don't want to take away tools to prosecute true harassers.  But I think that there are, in fact, sufficient laws probably to prosecute them.  You know, we have yet another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Another case on Google is in Germany.  They're there now.  An agency is now demanding that Google take down, stop compiling data.  This is that problem. Data across services.  So there's one big Google and Google can't act like that anymore and can't can't move your data across from service to service.  I don't know how Google survives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would just say I give up.  Throw up my hands and say, Europe, you can have yourself.  I'm going home.  I take my ball.  Here's Bing, man.  Go. What if what if Google did that?  They did it in China.  What if they did it?  What if they did it and said, OK, Europe, you win?  If they were a private company, the stock would go boom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Because Europe as a whole is a bigger market.  It must be tempting.  It must be tempting.  Just Google has the money and the lawyers to handle it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess they've got people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't really pay attention to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They've got some people there.  They're not they're not working long hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  However, you know, if I were Larry Page, I go, gosh, you know, they basically want me to ruin my beautiful service and somehow become this arbiter of what's right, what's wrong, what's true, what's false.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Once again, it shows a fundamental understanding of the technology is that if Google had come out fully birthed with all these services, it would have one privacy policy across all would have one database across all.  And it just happened to add them on as time went on and then regularized them.  And it's just ridiculous.  And it comes out of this leadite fear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And German Germany's history of collecting data about people.  Right.  I mean, this is a I mean, this is a deeply entrenched sort of cultural.  Yeah, but there are two Gina, I would argue that that erasing things you don't like is also part of tyranny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so they don't recognize their own irony in this case, that trying to control knowledge and control information is something Europe of all places should know is a dangerous thing to do.  So the single the single user, the single ID thing would be simple enough to solve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If Google put a checkbox up for you each the first time you used any of Google services saying, because because you know it's without their consent.  In this case, it say if if you wish to use a Google service, you need to give us your consent.  Not goodbye.  Not goodbye.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like you can't go.  You may be offended by advertising, but you can't go to a site and say, I don't want any ads here.  Because that's the business model.  So just don't just don't use it.  I use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  The privacy thing is, I mean, the sharing data that that's easily dealt with this issue of removing search results because somebody didn't like them.  Is there a they're going to insist on a higher standard than you just don't like it?  What is the standard?  Yeah, what is the relevance is one of the words I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Relevance to what?  It's very nebulous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I could, you know, if they said if it's libel, if so first you have to go to court and show that it's a lie.  Yes.  Then you have to it has to be removed.  Then I would.  Then there's then there's a.  Yeah.  But you don't have to.  It could be actually a true fact.  Yes.  And it just because it happened 10 years ago or happened yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's an opinion about you and it's an opinion you don't like or something you did that you wish you hadn't done.  We got a few of those.  Yeah.  I get it all the time.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's something you and I live with, just live with.  Right.  I mean, speak for yourself.  I have nothing to be embarrassed about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have nothing to be embarrassed about today.  I just my solution is to embarrass myself daily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then that way, the overwhelming amount of embarrassment just dilutes the whole thing.  I don't know what to do.  I really don't.  It's so it's really a challenge.  It really is.  And I just don't know what the answer is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we're not going to find it for I read a book right now on the history of newspapers.  Oh, boy, isn't that exciting?  Yeah.  It is actually.  Not so far.  No.  But it's something I got to read.  But it makes the point that the first newspaper was not invented.  Sorry.  Geek out moment.  You're going to hear it.  Get your drinks ready until one hundred fifty five years after Gutenberg.  Right.  That's what happens.  Invented the press.  Right.  So it took one hundred fifty years to say, hey, I could use this to spread the information.  Wow.  Cool.  The first hundred fifty years, all it is print Bibles and indulgences.  Yeah.  But yeah.  So I was saying that we don't know what the Internet is yet.  We don't.  The change on society is indeed fundamental.  And yeah, society is fighting it as societies tend to do.  But it ain't going to work, folks.  In the long run, it doesn't, does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They got some sense here.  Is that a hint that CUNY should be advertising on Twig?  You don't need to.  They got you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true.  The Dean, Sarah Bartlett's here once again.  We're going to talk later about a relationship.  Yes, we are.  CUNY and twit.  A marriage.  We'll call it Twini.  New York Studio, baby.  Twini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Twini.  Twini.  I had to go that way.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  The other way wouldn't have worked out so well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to take a little trumpet break here.  Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the wrong sound.  That was my fault.  I pushed the wrong button.  Ladies and gentlemen, Gina Trippani, the latest from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Spell up.  Have you guys seen this?  It's a new Chrome experiment.  It's a browser-based spelling game for English speakers.  If you go to spellup.withgoogle.com, you can try out the game.  In fact, Leo, you should probably try it out.  I'm an excellent speller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You are.  You're an excellent speller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know that about you without even having ever given a spelling game with you.  This is fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I used to be good until Google came along and ruined my spelling because I can just look it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We were just showing a product review that had the worst spelling ever.  Let me see if my spelling...  So, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's falling from the...  So this experiment is showing off Chrome's new Web Speech API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  My speakers are turned up.  Please click allow.  Okay.  Oh.  There we go.  So you want to allow your microphone access?  It needs to use the mic, yeah.  And this is not flash.  This is HTML5.  Oh, I made some noise and it heard.  Okay.  Five meters.  Spell.  Go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  G-O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh.  Well, that was hard.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was easy.  Okay.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So the idea is that you make a tower of words.  So I guess it should give you the next one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Spell.  Play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is so exciting I could barely stand.  I can't hear it.  What?  What?  You can hit the replay button next to the mic.  Okay.  So I'm going to go ahead and click play.  Okay.  So I'm going to click play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  So I'm going to click play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  So I'm going to click play.  Okay.  So I'm going to click play.  I can't hear the mic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Spell.  Play.  P.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Spell.  Play.  P.  L.  A.  All right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.  This is all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why?  You get the idea.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Spell.  Play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's the point?  Why can't I just go P-L-I-Y?  Yeah.  It could be a little faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the point is, just to show off ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know how much I like slow talkers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have the right to a point.  There's an old Bob and Ray routine, an interview with the President of the Slow Talkers.  Spell.  Play.  That's a great interview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the most annoying game ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can do that in New York now. You can do that as legal.  You can do that.  P-L-A-Y.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, next.  Hell. Play.  Yes. This is hell.  H-E-L-L.  I'm going to hell, and they will play this game that speed for the rest of eternity.  Maybe if you had a Chromebook it would be faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, we can ...  Spell. Play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Spell it already, will you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you did spell it.  Just shut up, because every time you say something it ruins it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, quiet.  Spell. Play.  P-A ...  Stop it!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stop it!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, I give up.  This is not something you can play with a father in the room.  Next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Next up.  Gmail gets revamped Hangouts on the desktop.  Yes.  That makes Leo so happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I couldn't get rid of it. I actually had to close it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So what was more annoying for you, the spell up game or the Hangouts new layout?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right now Google is 0 for 2. I'm just going to say that.  No, but the reason is I show my Gmail all the time, and the Hangouts were there, so I turned it off.  But you could still have it in plus.  And did they not have emojis before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They had emojis. They've added new emojis.  They brought back the little green availability bubble to let you know if your friend is online.  And they added message snippets.  Just means that when you're looking at your contacts list you can see the last thing a person said,  the kind of snippet of their last message to you.  Oh, and there's a new search bar so you can find friends in your list and you can find friends that aren't on your list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I see the green dot. Okay, so with the green dot next to Dan says he's online.  Available. Right.  Yep.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you'll notice that looks a little different in Gmail and also if you use the Hangouts extension for Chrome, which I do,  you'll also get the availability bubbles and the message snippets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, there's a Hangouts extension for Chrome.  Yep.  I should put that in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it kind of puts it in a separate window.  Oh, all right.  What else do we have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can use it for the show. I can use that. Eh, Chad?  Yay!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love Hangouts extension.  You use it too?  Yeah, it's now, it's replaced. I used to use, you know, an XMPP.  Yeah, Google Talk.  Google Talk.  And yeah, now the Hangouts extension has replaced everything.  Because it's like a, it's that separate application sort of thing that they rolled out where it can run.  Shows up in a grid and all that.  Well, yeah, it can run when your Chrome isn't up and running.  It can?  Yeah. So I do that on the PC. It'll now be at the top of your bar, your PC bar, and it's just a little...  Hangouts logo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You guys did nothing with this, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's quite nice. It's the thing that has replaced Trillian and Collequy and all those things.  Or not Collequy.  Full-fledged chat client.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, there it is.  Cool. So it's going to have all those new features as well.  Yes, it will. I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I can't even remember. How do I get to the web store to get on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Help me, Gina! We're old!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I always have to go to Settings, Extensions, get more extensions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just Googled Hangout extension and that pretty much worked. So I'm just saying, let me Google that for you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I would just Google Chrome.  I would have, but I have the experts in the world right here.  You asked a friend a question? Geez.  Hangout. So I don't know actually the answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll admit, I have to Google it every time myself.  Just Google the name of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know the URL.  It used to be, yeah there it is. It used to be that when you got a new tab, it was on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So my mood is now, it's not text, it is an emoji.  Okay, so my mood is now an emoji.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of my students is going to do a business based on emojis.  Yeah.  Don't ask me how it's journalistic, but it's called Path.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, more options.  All right, good. This is cool.  Sign up to hang out on Chrome starts.  Keep Hangouts on top of other with us. Show system tray icon.  So that kind of keeps it semi-permanent, just floating there.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Moving over to iOS. Google search 4.0 for iOS.  Add a few options that we already have on Android.  New voice search options and more relevant results.  So the app recognizes voice search cues and conversational inputs.  So you can say to the app, you know, what's the weather like?  And when you get results, you can follow up with, you know, how about this weekend?  And you'll get the results for the coming weekend.  And like it does on Android, the app on iOS will now also alert you when new articles on certain topics appear.  And that's powered by Google Now. I don't know if you guys have seen this, but Google Now cards,  which is like updates to websites you visited or suggesting articles about things you've searched for before.  I got the notification for the new Justin Bieber album.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ooh, is that out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  So that's all on iOS now.  I got Bieber fever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're a Belieber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm a Belieber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google's Knowledge Graph now extends into Google Maps.  So if you search for certain locations, you'll get a quick facts card that'll tell you some information about that place.  So if you search for the Space Needle, you search for Brooklyn Bridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the only problem is, you know what irritates me about Maps?  Is that all that big box on there takes up the map.  You can close it, can't you?  I know, but then I've got to do that all the time and it irritates me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In my test, it was collapsed by default.  So yeah, it was kind of there are cards that are stacked and you have to click on the quick facts card in order to expand it.  So it won't take up all the side by default.  Google Wallet updated for Android and iOS actually, and introduces multiple accounts.  So if you launch Google Wallet, you can now switch between your Google accounts and set a separate pin for each account.  So that's nice for folks like us who have multiple accounts.  And we talked about this a couple of episodes ago, but the Google Drive update that rolled out this week that finally officially removes document editing.  So it's read only and search only.  If you want to if you want to edit your sheets or docs, you have to install the separate sheets and docs apps, which let you edit both online and offline.  So it's a little annoying when you first go into Drive and tap on a document.  But once you get the other app, you have all the functionality used to have.  They've just separated it out into these these different apps.  And that's it. That's all I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is the Google change.  Thank you, Gina Trapani.  You're welcome.  We're going to take a break when we come back.  We'll tell you how you yes, you can own Google Glass in your of your very own.  Because I'll sell you one.  Really?  With Jeff's prescription built in.  Our show today brought to you by 99 Designs, the world's largest graphic design marketplace.  What is the current count of 99 Designs?  I think they cross 300,000 designers.  They're all waiting for you at 99designs.com.  And if you stop by, yep, three hundred one thousand four hundred eighty one.  The tote board has turned over once again.  This is that is a big community of designers and they're they're waiting for you to start.  They call it a design contest.  You could you know, you could say a request for design or something.  The idea is you go there for your logo, for app design, business card design, web page design, get a T-shirt.  We get T-shirts frequently from 99 Designs.  This hoodie design is a 99 Designs design.  So you post the post the projects, see how much you're willing to pay.  Designers will then flock to you and offer you ideas.  You can refine it with a designer.  Pick one, pay him and you get the design.  Projects start at just one hundred and ninety nine dollars and your happiness is always one hundred percent guaranteed.  The designers love it.  You will love it, too.  In fact, two million dollars in payouts to designers last month.  Last month alone.  It's a hub for design talent and for people who need design work.  Ninety nine designs from New York.  No, you can leave it up.  This is one of the small island close to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm actually I'm here in San Francisco because of an opportunity that presented itself through 99 Designs.  Working on a pretty exciting project that involved taking on their entire product branding from the ground up.  I've always been designing since I was seven and watching my dad.  He wanted to be architect at one time.  The thing that really inspires me about architecture is just the user experience element of it all where you can see a building that can look a certain way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But then when you enter, you can see the rest of the video at 99designs.com.  I need story about Nicholas, who became a designer, who actually got a pretty darn good gig out of it.  If you have design work you need done, just go to 99designs.com slash twig and we're going to give you a ninety nine dollar power pack of services.  Absolutely free.  That gives you more designer time and attention.  They'll bold highlight and feature your design project and 99designs marketplace and you'll get nearly twice as many designs.  99designs.com slash twig.  An army of designers is waiting for you right there right now.  They're going to do.  They have a lot of interesting things in the works.  I don't.  I probably shouldn't talk about it until you have one of the things you're going to have as an offer is a whole logo kit.  So you get the logo design, but then you get letterhead.  You know, it looks even more dorky with the wire hanging off.  It was out of juice.  Now you look really bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The reality of Google Glass is that it's generally out of juice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much. So Jeff Jarvis is wearing his glass.  How much battery life do you typically get on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I forget to turn it on. I leave it in the bag and it goes on somehow.  By itself. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Google is now apparently, as far as we can tell, saying anybody who wants it can have it.  It's still fifteen hundred bucks.  This is not the, you know, the final version.  This is still the kind of the Glass Explorer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Explorer Edition.  It's a more open beta.  But you do you get a free pair of the titanium collection frames, which is which is nice.  You have to buy those.  Free.  Free.  And of course, it's US only.  And it's for as long as they have glass in stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this sounds kind of open that they're not going to do a consumer version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, that was always my contention is I didn't think they were.  Certainly, if they do this, you bought one fifteen hundred bucks in three months.  They announced a three hundred dollar one. You're going to be peeved.  And by the way, there there's some speculation.  I'm seeing a number of articles saying that the glass costs as little as one hundred fifty dollars for Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a new tear down we have on the run from IHS. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A little bit more. Now they point out that yes, one hundred fifty two bucks.  They point out that much of the cost of a device like this comes from engineering and development.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but it's not like you try to get all the costs from five people.  Yeah. The Tesla from the first five. Right. Right.  I mean, I think it's reasonable to say glass should be expected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, we reported a month ago a tear down that said it was eighty dollars.  But even if it's one hundred fifty or three hundred dollars, fifteen hundred dollars, let's say it's three hundred bucks.  Maybe they're off by a factor of two and it's three hundred dollars.  It's still five times more than the cost.  How much of a schmuck am I? I bought one too.  We show. Do we show last week, Chad, did we show Jason Howells glass video of Savannah walking?  No, we didn't show. Jason Howells video shows the single best reason to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's great. We showed it on all of Android last night.  It is the most beautiful magnificent thing, Dad. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is just. And you gave me props, Jeff, and I thank you on Google Plus saying Leo bought this for Jason Howells.  I bought this for Jason. It's exactly why I bought it for Jason because I unlike Jason, I didn't have a he had a newborn.  And I thought, boy, this is going to really be great for him.  The first time here's his Savannah wearing glasses. So great.  This is his daughter. He stayed home that day from work.  She was a little cranky, had a fever, didn't feel well.  But I know for some reason he's torturing her now. I have my your look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, cheating a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can take a step. So Jason's wearing glass.  That means he's got direct contact with Savannah.  She's not doesn't think that as a camera.  I will give that one to you. It's the greatest.  And here she goes. This is all by herself.  She's going to take a couple more steps.  Yeah, I'm good. That is such an important moment, as you know.  The first step. Six, seven.  That makes it all worth for me. Fifteen hundred bucks.  Fifteen hundred bucks. All worthwhile. Right there.  Because Jason has that.  And I remember who doesn't their baby's first steps.  I remember Abby and Henry's first steps. Absolutely.  I'll never forget it. I wasn't there for Abby's and I was there for Henry's.  He is first steps were at a rest stop between here and Redding California.  Hey, I'm not going to Redding. It's too hot.  But but I remember that, but I don't have video of him and I never would.  And but I think that's really great that Jason does have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I still have a shot. You know, Jason's raised the bar very high.  Edda is really late. She hasn't started. She hasn't walked on her own yet.  She cruises. You know, she holds on and cruises, but she hasn't started walking yet.  So now that I've seen that, I'm like, oh, man, I got to just wear glass every minute I'm with her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because she's so close. She's so close to let me go.  Even with glass, there's some serendipity to having the being there at the right time.  It's true. It's true.  I wasn't even in the room when Abby walked.  So anyway, I don't know. Where do you go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anybody in that room? Anybody want to buy glass?  I mean, your glass? No, well, no, not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't think anybody wants to buy glass. It's too expensive.  Where do we get it? Do we go to glass.google.com?  I mean, the project page, does it have how to buy it?  I don't I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. Google.com slash glass slash start.  OK. Become an explorer.  And yeah, you click on become an explorer and you can go.  Anybody can do it. Choose your color. Choose your frames.  Wow. Choose your shades.  They got different shades, too. I didn't see the different shades.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you got sky. You got charcoal out of stock.  Tangerine. Definitely not out of stock. Cotton.  Just really just gray. OK.  Shale, which is just a darker gray.  Which one would I would get? I'll get the orange.  Might as well. If you're going to wear it, announce it.  Select your complimentary accessory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the part that pisses me off. I didn't get this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Four featherlight titanium frames. Oh, but these are for prescription.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but this cost which one did you get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The curve, bold, split or thin?  Or would you like shade?  Can you only get one? I got sand, I think.  So I can get sunglasses from Maui Gym.  Two hundred and twenty five dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You are. Your frames look really good, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These are nice, aren't they? They're not my glass.  Yeah, let's see. Let's see. These are thin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, you got your. Oh, these do look good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're titanium or they're plastic.  Titanium. They look good.  Plastic from Google.  It's good, except you have this black thing over your right temple.  What is that? Maybe if we're orange, I'd like it better.  I don't think my head is too big. All right.  So I'm going to choose bold because again, you're wearing glass.  Why try to hide it? Add to cart, add accessories or check out.  Should we dare him? Should we dare him to go ahead and buy it?  I'm just it looks like I can just walk right through this.  Here's my cart. Let's see.  Subtotal of fifteen hundred dollars.  I agree to glass terms of sale without reading.  And that's with tax.  Oh, no. Shipping's already included.  Buy with Google. Wait, wait, wait. You just clicked.  No, no, but that's not a buy yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just prompts you with the wallet.  And I have to give it the address because now it's going to say still doesn't say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, there's the tax. One hundred twenty five bucks. All right.  So sixteen twenty five. That's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just saying.  Should I wear mine to I.O. or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, you should. You'll be at home with all the other geeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll go into the men's room and scare Scoble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just can't ever bring myself to wear glass to Google events.  I went to an event here in New York a couple of months ago  and there are a few people in the audience who had glass.  I just couldn't I couldn't do it. I couldn't do it.  I don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One place in the earth, Gina, where you'd fit in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know, I know.  Does Google? I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You notice how quickly I click those terms of service.  And in fact, that's what everybody will do.  But it probably would be a good view to wear them because I would bet this is they say this is beta.  There's no like if it breaks, are they responsible?  There's no responsibility, right?  This is your I'm sure in those terms of service, it says you're buying as is without warranty.  We don't warrant it for any use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's probably probably do say that my experience has been that they're pretty pretty good, pretty responsive.  I don't know if you've had the same experience, Jeff.  They called to see how I was doing.  There's a community, you know, there they seemed pretty pretty good.  Returns exchanges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'll accept returns within 30 years.  30 days.  One year.  30 days.  Yeah, we're years.  Is it going back?  One year.  The day to receipt.  Oh, that's not bad.  Defects of materials.  Wait, oh, under under under ordinary consumer use like there is an ordinary consumer use for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, so they'll replace it if it breaks in the first year.  Can I just when can I can send it back for how long?  So I have 30 days to decide not to buy it.  30 days, I think just for you at home would be more than enough to get a sense of what it does, how you can use it, blah, blah, blah.  And on day 29, send it back.  If you're curious, I think that's a good idea.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a colleague of mine at CUNY said, no, no, no, hold on to them.  But it's going to be valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it will be a bit of history.  You know, I mean, if you have I still do have my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you call Newton?  Yeah, I have to do this is the wearable new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yes.  Kind of new knee, isn't it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  When Wave launched, I remembered CNN did a whole thing.  They were in the offices when they pressed enter and launched it.  Google's reinventing email.  And you could tell that they were just sort of documenting it because they thought it was going to be this big moment in technology.  And that's not going to be in the Computer History Museum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you see this guy typing on his Google Glass?  This is from Minium, which is the world's smallest keyboard.  Is this a joke?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, Minium is a natural app.  And it is it's a it's a different way to type.  So he's sliding along his sliding along his temple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's going to fall off the mountain while he's typing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's crazy.  But I think it's interesting.  I mean, you can dictate, right?  Yeah.  Well, this is the thing, right?  You don't want to use voice input.  I mean, typing on your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're an idiot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, my God.  It's actually more as code.  Look at the last five seconds of this video.  I just I just.  Yes.  Right after this.  That.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  Look at.  Oh, wow.  So these are these.  OK, OK.  Are these prototypes or are they selling this?  They seem to.  So he's typing on his arm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, the typing on his arm that it seemed to be a hint toward that you can't.  I don't believe that you can do that yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then he was typing in the air to just I guess you see a keyboard.  But see, it's not a heads up display.  So and what is he wearing?  Is that ring on his finger part of the must be censored?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It must be.  Oh, yeah, that must be that ring.  That's a ring.  Yeah, you're right.  You're absolutely right, Leo.  Oh, yeah.  The index finger ring is not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not fashionable.  It looks like a donut like a batting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's interesting to experiment with different input types, especially if you think

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  about this with with with a with a watch or other kinds of wearables.  I mean, I would speak what I wanted to say.  But if you're in a place where you can't speak, you need a nice one handed typing thing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  somehow you can get every letter in some way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doesn't look at all strange.  Oh, you mean with those courting keyboards, the bat like the bat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, just one at one hand.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I mean, you know, it was cool, like the guy, the MIT wearable computer guy  when you were the only one and you had a lot of gear and that looked right.  Well, you really, you know, inventing something.  But now it's just product.  And that's kind of I think it's less cool, even less, even less.  The more people can't take you seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like you ever do.  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  But not now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The more people look like that, even less cool, even less cool.  I don't know.  And somebody in the chat pointed out this is true.  Do not wear your typing ring on the middle finger because you could really get hurt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, we were talking about the Chrome extension and you were saying, Chad, on Windows, you're able to make that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, not the hangouts extension.  You're able to make that an app.  Yeah.  Can't do it on the Mac unless you're using Chrome Canary.  They are now tying those together.  So this is a little different.  This is tying.  So you open a document and it will open a Google Chrome app in the browser.  Right.  Right.  I mean, which is basically just this.  So if I if I have read me dot text associated with a text editor that is a Chrome extension in the past, there was no way to say type double click on read me and have.  Is that is that in Twitter chat room in the chat room?  So this is that's kind of interesting.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ben Ben did this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Ben Ben did a little illustration of what this show is reminding him of.  Ben, can you put glass on the old man on the left?  Unfortunately, that really looks at that's what a staff is.  Their heads.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's exactly right.  It's exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then Gina, why doesn't Gina get why can't she get Miss Biggie or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess you like Gina.  I'd probably be Miss Biggie.  OK.  Can you talk in faux French?  This is a little different.  This is a little different.  This is a little different.  This is a little different.  This is a little different.  Can you talk in faux French?  This is actually a bit of a hack to get the Mac to do this.  But to enable it, you have to be first of all using Google Chrome Canary, which is their gamma version, not even beta, but gamma.  And then you have to use the Chrome flag, enable apps, file associations.  And that's kind of cool.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They actually say it's easier to do on a Mac because of the way the Mac works.  So I think we should start doing more.  Clearly, we need to do more Chrome extensions like the like your app arena and all about Android.  We should do Chrome extension arena.  Interesting.  Because clearly that's more and more becoming a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You never see it all about Chrome show.  No, no, that would be no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All about Internet Explorer.  All about fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you note the 20 year anniversary of IE?  No, no, of the reunion party for Netscape last week.  Oh, yes, I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saw a very interesting picture of Jim Barksdale.  And yeah, I mean, these guys 20 years ago, was it the stock, the IPO or was it?  The browser was released.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was released in October 94.  OK, so was the browser release?  No, it was October.  So it was before October.  So it must be the company was formed.  Company was formed.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A Chrome show, though, you know, would be like Chromecast, ChromeOS.  Yeah, you know, actually, we could do a Chrome show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you know, there is something there.  Meanwhile, the burden is on this show to do.  Yes, we'll cover Chrome stuff.  It's our turf, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's ours.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Give it away to some young person.  Let us old farts do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We can leave Android all about it.  Yeah, Android's for all about Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're the host of that.  And along with Jason, that's fine.  But we want to keep Chrome extensions.  Last month, Governor Cuomo in New York announced or appointed a three person commission to advise on the use of technology in schools.  One of the three, Eric Schmidt, seems like somebody would know a little bit about technology in the schools.  He is still the chairman of the board at Google.  Apparently, there are consumer watchdog and others are not happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because we're watched on being an organization that goes after Google all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's their job.  Not to be happy there.  They filed a complaint with the New York State Joint Commission on Public Ethics saying Schmidt has, quote, serious, troubling and unlawful conflicts of interest.  It is a good point.  I mean, I figure Eric's going to go in there, say use Chromebooks.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think he might also have the good sense to recuse himself in that discussion.  Plus, what do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have no, you never get any advice from anyone in industry?  Right.  Don't you want?  What do you want?  You want somebody from an oil company there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, consumer watchdog said it's because Eric's the, Google's the only person with a seat at the table.  He says if it were one of several technology representatives, it would be more acceptable.  I'll buy that much.  You know, get some, get Bill Gates, Eric Schmidt and Tim Cook on that board.  Now you got some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought that that was a good point.  And honestly, I'd rather see somebody who is an advocate for the students primarily, who's very tech savvy versus, you know, somebody.  How savvy is Eric Schmidt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, kids, if you want to buy pants, we've got a solution for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or I'd like to see someone like you, Leo, you know, who, who reports on and commentates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I serve on a nonprofit board advising them on technology.  So it's great.  And I did do that for the city.  Did you tell them to buy Chromebooks?  I did.  And they bought Lenovo Windows notebooks instead.  That's OK.  You know why they did?  Because they used to do, it's a one-to-one program in the school and they used to use Macintoshes, but Apple's price just got out of reach.  Really?  Yeah.  And so they've, they had to go Windows.  I think, you know, they use Google, all Google services, Google Docs and everything.  I think it's just a matter of time before they go to Chromebooks.  If you were to run your own mail server, because you're very privacy conscious and you didn't want Google to get information about your emails,  how much of your mail would not be visible to Google?  Turns out not much.  Only about half.  Benjamin Mako Hill, who has the Copyrighteous Blog, says, it doesn't even matter if I don't want Google to have information about me, because you are probably using Gmail.  About half of my correspondents use Gmail.  I use Gmail.  Anybody sends anything to me, whether they use Gmail or not, is exposed to Google.  What's the problem with that is?  If all your friends use Gmail, Google has your mail anyway.  So he wrote a little program to go through all the email he's kept in his personal inbox since April 2004.  That's when Gmail first came out to see if they had a Gmail address or not, to see how many emails Google would have.  And he says about a third of the email in my inbox comes from Google.  I think he's lower than most of us.  But I'm going to do an analysis.  I might get a lot of email from AOL.com users.  Because you got old farts?  I'm the tech guy show. You mentioned Windows XP.  Where can I get that?  It also says that the proportion of my personal email that comes by Google is probably much higher.  Yeah. That makes sense.  Despite the fact that I spend hundreds of dollars a year and hours of work to host my own email server, Google has about half of my personal email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's probably even higher than they know because if you send email to Buzz Machine, you don't know that it's an apps account.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter.tv is an apps account.  If you send an email to Leroy at Twitter.tv, it's going through Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.  And that's what he's saying, right?  That a lot of it goes through their SMTP servers or whatever, or forwarding addresses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So just give up. Just give up. It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As one of the people in the chat room says, well, you just said a minute ago that if you don't like Google, just don't use it.  Now you're still trapped anyway.  Well, don't use email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or only use 43% of your email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, this is a little bit akin to saying like all these people have my personal letters because I sent them to them.  That's the nature of it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it would make sense if you need a campaign not to use Gmail.  That would be your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, but this is analogous to our first discussion today. It's exactly that.  So you sent me a letter, and then you come along five years later and say, I demand you destroy that letter I sent you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a right to be forgotten.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Now, the difference between someone who has a Gmail account and a Google account and has all their emails stored on Google and uses their services all the time is that Google is actively advertising to that person.  Whereas someone who hosts their own email account, even though Google has a storing email that they've sent to people who use Google, from what I understand, Google isn't building a profile or keeping a store of data about that person to try to advertise to them because they're not signed into a Google account when they send that email.  Right.  So for the folks who do want to opt out of Google's advertising on whatever level, I think it is still worth setting up your own email server.  And I actually have quite a few friends who do that.  I'm too lazy, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's a good thing you don't live in the People's Republic of New Zealand.  Apparently, New Zealand is now going to require network operators, internet service providers, to register with police.  Their staff must have security clearance.  And when they change networks by gear, they actually have to get approval from the New Zealand spy agency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who spies on New Zealand?  What's the spy on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Government Communications Security Bureau.  Kiwi pricing?  That's interesting. I don't know.  It gives me... I always thought of New Zealand as kind of a little bit like hippies.  Yeah.  Apparently not.  New Zealand, if you're an internet service provider, you're going to have to... this is like China.  You have to register with the police.  Did you read Liz Gaines' article about how boring it was to take a ride in the Google autonomous vehicle?  I guess that's a good thing.  Although, you know, the headline from a lot of people was it was mundane, it was boring.  I don't know.  She says the car braked for jaywalkers, paused when it was coming around a curve, and couldn't see whether the light in front of us was green or red,  and skittered when it worried a bus might be turning into our lane.  That doesn't sound mundane. That sounds a little nerve-racking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It does sound nerve-racking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you see Silicon Valley this week?  No, not yet.  One of the characters gets into an autonomous vehicle, and it says, where would you like to go?  And he says, you know, and gives the address, I'd like to go home.  And about halfway through the trip, the autonomous vehicle says rerouting, and all of a sudden it's on its way to an island, a man-made island in the middle of the ocean.  And the guy's in the back seat. He says, what? Hello? Hello? Car?  The car just keeps, it makes a big U-turn, keeps going, drives into a container on a ship.  The guy's going, let me out, let me out. They seal the container. The ship sails. He's off on an island in the middle of the ocean.  Finally, he gets there. The container is open. He thinks, finally, humans.  Turns out the whole island of the ocean is manned by more robots.  We don't know what's going to happen to this character.  Now, that's a self-driving vehicle.  That's a self-driving script?  I think it's pretty funny.  It was well done. It was a B plot, subplot, stretched throughout the show.  So every once in a while they check back, where is he now?  So anyway, good for Liz. I don't know how she got a ride in the self-driving car. That's kind of cool.  I wonder if we could get a ride. Have you driven it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I haven't, but I was going to visit Google campus and somebody said, oh, we get you a ride in the car.  And I didn't do it that day, so I think they'd do it for you.  Oh, I'd love to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We should see if we could arrange the whole twig crew go for a ride in an I.O.  That'd be pretty awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would.  She says, my show from the self-driving car.  Oh, that'd be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, I presume there's a guy sitting in the driver's seat with his hands poised over the wheel just in case.  That's going to be a nerve-wracking job. You're always ready.  My distinct impression, Liz writes, was that the Google self-driving car is nowhere near ready for commercialization.  She said, you know, she felt fairly confident in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But also stories today that Google is talking to auto companies actively.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeff, so my question for you is, I know you said you can't you can't stop progress, but would you trust?  Would you take a ride in the self-driving car across a bridge?  That's my question for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I wouldn't.  I wouldn't do that.  Is the self-driving car suicidal?  I wouldn't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently, Google employees are now commuting to work in self-driving cars.  Really?  But again, there's always this drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Until San Fransiscans stand up and throw yogurt on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The day you can sit in the back seat with nobody in the front seat, that's a self-driving car.  If you're sitting in the front seat with your hands poised over the steering wheel,  you're pretty.  In fact, I think that's more tense than just driving yourself.  I think it is too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like just giving you the wheel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Plus, what does it take to take it over?  How long is that added response time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google self-driving cars still have trouble in rain, especially on the highway when other cars kick up water.  They're currently about as good as a human driving in heavy fog.  And they forget snow.  They haven't even tried that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Snow, what's that, man?  Wait a minute, that water is going to freeze?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That'll be version 4.0.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is good.  In fact, he says for all the millions of measurements and computations per second, you're really only doing two things.  The throttle and the steering.  How fast you're going and which way you're going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this story from VentureBeat says that Google self-driving car technology may appear in Toyota's, Ford's, and other widely available vehicles in about six years.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's about, you know, the cycle for developing a car is fairly long.  Yeah, it's about that.  It could well be just that.  Well, you know, didn't Twitter have a mute function all along?  Is this I see so much about this mute function.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not the official apps.  The unofficial apps, third party apps had the mute function.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You explained this before, Gina, but I forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mute is you're following the person, but you don't see their tweets in your timeline for however long that person has muted.  You don't unfollow them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just shut them up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you just you just don't see them in your in your timeline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And more importantly, the muted user will not know you've muted them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  And you appear to be following them, in fact.  So it's like the way to unsubscribe for someone, but keep them as your friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is this is programming on the head of a pin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I love nine to five Google, which use Donald Trump as an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I think the use case is like Leo is live tweeting Silicon Valley.  I don't want to watch that.  Right.  So I mute him during the Dory show.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or, you know, when you know, when conferences and everybody's at South by Southwest, I wish you could mute a hashtag, anything with SSSXSW.  That would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I want to say now, if I'm at a conference irritating people, I want to say, number one, I'm from New York.  I can irritate you. Right.  And number two, just mute me.  Mute me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Feature will roll out to all users over the next coming weeks.  And finally, Flappy Bird is back.  Thank God.  The world was a much worse place without it.  I did play it.  I still have it.  You want to play it?  No, I hate games.  Well, this game you'd really hate Flappy Bird creator Nguyen Dong says, I'm bringing the game back in August.  It will be a multiplayer game.  And he's been spending all this time making it less addictive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, this guy feels really bad for him.  I mean, the fact that he's into making it, he's a game maker and he doesn't and he's trying to make it less addictive.  It was too successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was too successful.  It was too successful.  And he said people were wasting too much of their life.  Oh, I feel bad.  Well, we're glad to have Dong back in the in the Android store.  Back in the mix.  That's all I can say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And what store doesn't need more dong?  We're going to take a break.  And when we come back, thank you for laughing.  Jeff did not laugh.  I had no idea.  Neither did you.  Let the world go.  Word go forth.  This show brought to you by my good buddies at Personal Capital.  In fact, I was just meeting with them.  I love these guys.  Personal Capital is they said, can we use the word lifehacker?  I said, no, I don't think so.  Gina has to.  But it is a life hack.  It is a way to make your life that you guys must have trademarked life hacks.  I think we trademarked lifehacker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Let us get our tip and our number and our tool of the week.  We'll start with Gina Trapani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is a new Google Now feature that I think is a little weird, but also kind of interesting.  You can you can use Google Now to remind yourself to cancel things like Amazon Prime and Netflix.  I don't know what this is about.  I don't know if Google's trying to get you to cancel Amazon Prime, but maybe anyway,  if you say, remind me to cancel Amazon Prime, that seems anti-competitive on the face of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But OK, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And now we'll show you a little cancel subscription link that will take you right to the cancel page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, that's that's what's different, because you could always say remind me to X.  Right. But this actually says, oh, I see the word cancel.  Let's show you how to. You know what? This is great because I do that.  I have I had a Vonage subscription for four years that I never used.  And I bet. Yeah. And it was on my to do list.  But if I had known how to click the link and go to it, I probably would have done it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, how long after I can't remember how long after it took me to cancel AOL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, same thing. And they just kind of slowly draw the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the here's the one I need. What is whatever I go to Europe, I sign up for the extra day.  I up to one hundred dollars for one month for extra data so I can use my phone. Another great one.  And then I always say, don't do it right away because the bills will come in.  My wife went out the other day and said, well, did you cancel?  I said, no, but I'm going back to Europe. So no, I do that all the time. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is good. I have I have many IOS magazines, subscriptions that just sort of pile up on my iPad, which is not charged.  I did that will not work with this. But but I think this is pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can still ask for a reminder, but won't have a link to it.  That is very interesting that Google would get into this business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's kind of interesting. It's a little weird. It's a little weird. And yet it's there.  So there you go, kids cancel everything that's not Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you wait? Can I say cancel Google Wallet or I mean, cancel Google Listen or listen all access?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good question. That's a good question.  We should try it out. I think so.

Transcript:  I like it.  We should use that as our album art for today's show.  That would be great. That's awesome.  I actually think that looks better than the original.  It does. It's great.  Miss Piggy, Statler and Waldorf, the hosts.  What are their voices?  Yeah. Oh, man. I don't remember.  Although I did like the commentary when you guys were back.  That was the real you know, you know, that was really the intent all along.  Ladies and gentlemen, it is time for a number.  I see you have several, Jeffrey.  Always, always prepared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I guess maybe we could do eight things to look for at I.O.  Eight things?  Eight things to look for at I.O.  There's also a video of ten things to expect at I.O.  But I didn't watch the video, so I don't know what it's.  Do more than eight.  Do more than eight. So what do we have there?  We have, it's one of those bloody slideshows you got to go through.  Oh, I hate that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Should I go through it for you so you don't have to?  Let's do it. Information week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So number one is the Nexus 8.  Will we have a Nexus 8? Should we vote on this?  What do you think? Nexus 8? Yes, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nexus 8. Oh, that would be an 8-inch tablet.  A new Nexus tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you think, Gina?  No.  No.  No.  No. OK, no.  Next one is Android 4.5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm getting an ad in every single slide.  Oh, jeez.  Holy camole.  What was the next one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Next one is Android 4.5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know about the version number, but yes, yes on the redesign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A flatter motif, fewer textures and shadows.  Like, I care.  Android Hostess HoHo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's K-H, right?  Hostess HoHo.  Android HoHo.  That's right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What did it say here? It just said something about that, I thought.  Moonshine, code name Moonshine.  No, no, no, but it's got to have an H, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a dessert with an H.  Oh, right, HoHo.  We just did KitKat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Unless they version up KitKat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait a minute, I don't know my alphabet. L.  L.  What would L be?  Lollipop?  Lollipop.  Or Licomade.  Licorice?  Licorice.  Lemonheads.  Lemonheads, that's a good one.  Android Lemonheads. Who's going to get the magic?  You know, I'm sure they're calling them right now.  Licorice. I never liked Licorice.  Licorice isn't a dessert.  Do you like the licorice, though?  These are delicious.  They are.  Natural. Red vines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't know licorice was unnatural.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you can get a natural licorice.  You can get a natural anything.  I'll do it later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You remember I said I'm irritated by people who do open mouth chewing.  Like me, yes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Not you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Room next.  Number four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gmail.  Oh, we didn't even mention the changes in Gmail that have just appeared.  Or did you mention the changelog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They haven't come out, right?  This is still rumor and speculation, I think.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you think you'll announce a new Gmail at I.O.?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm yes on this.  I think this is going to happen.  I think that they are testing this.  I think there's going to be some new stuff in Gmail.  I think this redesign is going to happen.  I think there's going to be some tasks and upcoming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google, can you stop redesigning Gmail and just make it IMAP, please?  I beg of you.  This fake IMAP is confusing.  I cannot find a good mail client on the Macintosh, and I've tried them all now.  The only ones that are any good are just a window to the Google website, the Gmail website.  Wow.  Because it's not traditional IMAP implementation, mostly because it doesn't do folders.  It does filters, but it doesn't use IMAP tags, even though it could use IMAP.  Anyway, please just fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's because you can do multiple labels, right?  You can have more than one.  So it's not like a one-to-one folder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What Google could do with Gmail at I.O. that I think would get us an innovation would be adding encryption.  They will do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  I'm going to add that to this list.  We just made it nine.  Encryption.  Absolutely encryption.  I bet you that is, in fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because that's the crowd that will respond.  Yep.  All right.  Next is focus on design.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They announced that already.  They said that this is going to be the design Google I.O.  All right, fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everything these days is design, design, design.  We go all around the valley and it's, I'm design thinker.  I think in Helvetica.  All right, next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A Nexus 6 phone.  A Nexus 6.  They're going to have a name collision.  They're about due.  They've got a problem.  This might be the last one.  LG is going to have a 7 and 8 and 8-3 and a 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think this is where you go to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What was it, Silver that they were proposing?  Yeah, I think it's going to be Android Silver.  This is where you do Android Silver instead of Nexus 6 because it can't be a Nexus 7.  There already is.  So I think you make the change now.  6A, 6B.  No, you go Silver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what do you think?  Vote.  Nexus 6 and I.O.?  No.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think so.  Me neither.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nope.  All right.  I think maybe Silver though.  You think maybe a new phone?  Yes.  Oh, so a new phone?  I think Silver would be a Silver edition of mainstream phones like Google Play Edition,  right?  Is that right, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, similar to Google Play Edition but consumer focused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Silver is kind of like Microsoft did with Windows.  They had a signature series where it didn't have a lot of crapware and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  Number 7 is Android 5.  A big Android change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have been due for a big change.  Android 5 Milk Dud.  Oh, that's probably not a good name for an operating system.  Marshmallow.  Malamar.  Code named Herod.  Malamar.  How you talking?  Malamar.  Android Malamar.  That's a brand name I can get behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Reportedly allows a device to perform a task normally associated with a particular app  only without having to open the app to do it.  What?  What the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What?  Well, what?  Yeah, no.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is going to happen.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  Next.  Google Plus refocused.  All right.  Here's that.  Here's the question.  Will they talk about Google Plus at IOP?  Yes.  Do you know?  I think it could be Uncle Ted we don't talk about.  I don't think they do.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't think?  Neither of you?  All right.  We should make a bingo card out of this.  They're going to talk about hangouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Plus.  Not Plus?  Not Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  God, I'm going to be depressed if they do that.  I don't believe it.  I think they will talk about it.  But this is good.  We should make notes on this.  I'm sure this is good.  Because we're going to, you know.  You should bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bingo card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bingo card.  Who buys the coffee on the way to the show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to stay here.  So I'm going to do the keynote while you guys are at the show.  And then you're going to whip up here afterwards as we've done in the past.  And we'll do this week in Google afterwards.  Jeff on the bridge.  Mike Elgin.  Actually, maybe.  Is Mike going?  He is going.  Everybody's going.  I'm going to be all alone here.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Chat.  Was that Liz?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was that Liz shouting?  Chad and I will be.  Oh, no.  That was Tanya, wasn't it?  Tanya, you can join me.  We'll be covering it from here as the keynote.  And I will make a note.  Is that bouncing, Tanya?  No, that's Liz.  It's bouncing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, hello, Liz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I will make a note of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then when Google doesn't, you know, as we tick to the end of the keynote.  Will Larry Page do his?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the real question.  No, no, no.  What's the question Robert Scoble is going to ask of Larry Page?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Will they let Scoble go to the microphone this time or will he be tackled before he  gets anywhere near it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then number nine, number nine, number nine is something wild.  Will there be something wild?  A Nexus Q type device.  Yes, something, something we couldn't anticipate.  So we get up here and we all admit we were surprised.  Will we all get here and admit surprise after I.O.?  Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I don't think so.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Where's my watch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's no mention of a watch here.  I want to, I want to watch.  This is the time frame for the Moto X watch.  like the Q this year.  I mean, I'd love that.  That's awesome.  It's fun, right?  But I don't think we're going to get blindsided by something from left field like the Q this  year.  I mean, I'd love that.  That's awesome.  It's fun, right?  But I don't, I don't think so.  But that's just a guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How about an update to Chromecast?  Update?  That's got to be a successful one.  That's not a, that's not a wow.  What about Android TV?  Didn't they say we're going to replace Google TV with Android TV?  That might be a product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Android TV might be.  Android TV.  That could be a surprise.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Motorola did not at its event announce a new X, did they?  An X plus one.  Did they announce the E?  They announced the E.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They announced the E and they announced the G, right, with LTE.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But no, both of which are very low end, low price phones for the developing world.  It's been a huge, huge bank.  It's time for a next interesting phone.  I feel like Motorola, well, the Motorola deal hasn't closed.  They're still Google, but they're on the way out.  What's that one, Leo?  What are you carrying now?  This is the M8, the same one that Gina uses, except I don't use the Google Play Edition.  I use the HTC Edition.  But I do like this phone.  You know, we played with, and I think, did Jason show you yesterday?  The Harman Kardon edition of this, the audio file edition of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, he did.  Yeah, yeah, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like the sound quality.  I thought the sound quality was actually better.  But I don't know if I would say spend 50 bucks more on a phone just because of some better  headphones and some improved sound quality, because it looks the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's got a couple of crazy, crazy headphones, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and you're stuck with a black versus some of the other choices in color.  Yeah, Jason, I can see your fingerprints.  Yeah, you know what?  That phone is brand new and it looks...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Either that or you've been eating the potato chips, haven't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I don't like the black and gold so much.  Gina, do you have the gray, the steel?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, I have the steel.  Look how dented mine is.  Wow.  And then there's lots of scratches here.  You know, Sherlock Holmes noted that a drunk must live at a house because of all the scratches  around the keyhole.  Do you remember that?  Yeah.  Well, you might think I was a drunk as well because of all the scratches around the USB  port.  It's because you never know what's up and down.  I always do it wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Scratch, scratch.  It has three sides.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and none of them fit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mine's always pitch black and I'm trying to plug that thing in at night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't done my job.  I am tool-less today, I'm sorry to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, did you try the Yahoo News Digest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's the new...  Yeah, Gina, I see.  I've used it on iOS.  It's on here now.  And I kind of like it.  Do you like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really?  Well...  Yeah, it's on Android now.  It was like the last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the Sumley thing.  Yeah, I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't get it?  I don't get it.  You know, New York Times Now is also doing that.  This is the only thing.  Is it on Android yet or not?  Not yet.  Okay, that's good.  But the idea is that instead of wading through all these articles, all these things that  Why don't we just pick nine stories that are important?  And in fact, we won't even give you all the text of the story.  We'll just give you a summary.  Because you're a busy person and you don't need all that detail.  That's the idea.  But you can click on it and drill down and get more information.  And I actually kind of like it.  Here it is.  What's the name of the app?  I can't because I can't find it.  It's down a little ways.  Yahoo News Digest.  It's very pretty.  And this was the way it was on iOS as well.  So, this is Wednesday Mornings Digest.  And they literally give you just nine stories.  Whoops.  Oh, so that's different from iOS.  iOS you go down.  So you go down if you want to read more about it.  This is the coal miners in Turkey.  And you see as you go, you're going to get pictures.  You're going to get videos.  And you just keep going down if you want to have more detail.  Right?  So I think that that's kind of nice even down to tweets and references.  But the idea is you don't have to drill down.  You could just say, oh, there's that headline.  That's story one.  Story two, wildfire season opens.  Thousands in San Diego flee.  Court order, judge calls for pastoriists to undergo mental evaluation.  Military dilemma.  Pentagon, okays Manning's transfer for gender treatment.  Rule unconstitutional.  Judge strikes down Idaho's same sex marriage ban.  Now, one of these stories was in Twig so far.  The finish to the Clippers game.  The stay to Texas execution.  The Swedish Oscar-winning director Searching for Sugarman died.  He was fat.  That is a great movie.  I didn't.  That's terrible.  So you want to know more?  So again, you see what happened there?  That was the first one that got me interested.  If you haven't seen Searching for Sugarman, that's a fascinating documentary with quite  a twist.  About halfway through.  Sony posting a $1.3 billion quarterly loss.  Yikes.  So that was nine stories.  There's ten.  Michael Jackson's Thriller.  New album number one in over 50 countries.  And then Did You Know?  That's interesting.  But then I also got a little thing that said, I don't have it now.  How many stories I've gone through.  I think this is, there's a lot of editorial judgment on it.  I don't know if it's...  Isn't that all automated or no?  Yeah, I think so.  I don't know if it gets smarter.  You can...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's pretty straightforward.  You get one in the morning, 8 a.m., 6 p.m.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  United States, UK, Canada and international editions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's just a quick way to catch up on the news on your commute.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And actually, you can get pretty deep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can get pretty deep.  Well, New York Times now is very much the same idea, except you have to pay for it.  This is free from Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll give you less news and I'll pay for it.  Yeah.  One of my favorite tweets today was the editor of the New York Times, Julie Brunson, just  got ousted, replaced by Dean Baquet.  And the best tweet I saw, I forget who I could give credit, was that the news of Y will be  available only for New York Times premium platinum users.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like it.  There's also a pretty good widget that remembers what you've read and what you haven't.  You can flip through the stories in the Android widget.  That's the only, I think, main difference between the Android version and the iOS version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That gives me a good tool that's related.  So that's one.  But here's another one.  I always thought that Newsstand was just like selling magazines, but it is in fact a news  app with a nice widget.  You can scroll through the Newsstand stories, even if you don't buy a magazine.  You can see news highlights.  This is the Google Play Newsstand.  And I think it actually is a pretty darn nice summary of the news.  Now, if you subscribe to magazines, they'll show up here.  I like it too.  I use it every day.  I prefer this to the Yahoo Now.  We just looked at it, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a different use case.  I'm not sure what it is exactly for Newsstand versus Flipboard.  But here's highlights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like Flipboard.  Here's news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's different.  And I like them both.  I think it's business, entertainment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if you subscribe to a magazine, it'll show up here.  I don't actually subscribe to any magazines in Newsstand or newspapers, but I did log  into my New York Times account.  I subscribe to lots.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's the name of this?  Play Recommendation?  No, not Play Recommendation.  No, it's old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I just thought it was the Play Store.  It was another Play Store.  It's Play Newsstand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Play Newsstand.  It's a Google News app, but it's not Google News.  Play Newsstand.  Remember that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you have Play Books, Play Games, Play Movies and TV, Play Music, and Play Newsstand.  I just assumed, because it's lumped in with these places where you buy music or you buy  movies and TV, that it is like Apple's Newsstand, a place where you would buy and subscribe  to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's actually much better because it's actually a news app.  This reminds me.  I've been meaning to complain about something for a long time.  All right.  Complain about it.  So the Google Finance app is awful.  It's like an orphan child.  Here it is.  When you try to go to a story, it's bad sources.  It constantly has problems updating.  If you go back to the portfolio and then go to Google, let's say, because we're on that,  and then you get news.  But the news is always from weird sources.  It doesn't give you very much good stuff.  Sometimes you try to click through and you get...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is the same kind of news that you get in Yahoo Finance.  This is financial news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know, but Google should do a better job of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's very much like the Yahoo app or any other financial app, I think.  Mostly people use that for your stock price, right?  And the only reason you look at...  Oh, you can have a ticker.  The only reason that you look at news is to say, why did that stock talk?  Yes.  Yes.  So it's that kind of news.  It's got...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the other thing I don't understand why they haven't done is there isn't a Google  News app.  Now Google News is made nicely for mobile.  I'm surprised they even still do Google News.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Do you think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, really, seriously, I'm surprised.  I use...  That feels like Google Reader.  That feels like another era.  Don't say that.  Another time and place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I use Google News every week for the show.  I use Google News often.  I go on and see what's new.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I use news occasionally.  There are times when I get results that are old and I switch over to news and get the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hillary does not have brain damage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, remember she got hit in the head.  There was some concern that she was injured.  Why do I have two phones?  Oh, this is Jason.  This is the one with the smudges.  Yeah.  Well, good.  Thank you, Gina.  You gave me my tools, the Yahoo News, Yahoo News Digest, and Google Newsstand, Play Newsstand,  which actually is a very good and has a great widget and a very good little news app, whether  you subscribed to anything in it or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Thank you.  I just installed the widget.  So the widget wasn't in my widget list.  And then say, okay, got it.  You know, I'm in.  And then the widget showed up.  So I got it now.  It's a nice widget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's quite pretty.  You can scroll.  It's, you know, these are all very...  Oh, you want to see it again?  These are all...  Chad shows my hand.  I want to see it.  These are all very much like Flipboard.  Currents.  Well, remember Google Currents, which kind of for a while the choice.  But I think this is nice.  It doesn't take up a lot of space.  And just tap the down bar and go through stories like this.  Which one is that?  This is the newsstand one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the newsstand widget.  Oh, I gotta put that in.  Oh yeah, if you use newsstand.  I forgot how to put widgets in.  Where do I find the widget?  I don't know.  Our show...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wrong tap on the home screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here I have my help desk.  They don't help me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  Jeff, Google it.  It's a long tap on the home screen.  I have a right to irritate you.  I just want you to remember that.  Or you can go to your app drawer and tap the widget tab.  And then drag them to your screen.  Our show today has come to the end.  It feels like the intelligence is going downhill this way.  Hey, hey, hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Geez, man, you come here and you get the abuse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like smart, dumb, and dumber.  No, I'm just teasing you.  I'm just teasing you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Some of us need someone to dumb down the news and summarize it in nine points.  And some of us need help putting widgets on our home screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  You're telling me there's a Hangouts extension in Chrome?  Are you kidding me?  I'll buy you lunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are you throwing your shoes at him or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stadler and Waldorf.  These guys don't know what they're talking about.  I remember you were on TV.  Our show is every Wednesday.  Let's go back to that spelling game.  You want to do that?  Let's have some more fun on this show.  That was gripping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whose idea was that?  Brilliant Genus?  It was mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was my brilliant idea.  Brilliant Genus, thought that one out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a game to play by yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've exhausted everything else in life you can do.  Your last two minutes before you die, you play that game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's not enough time in two minutes.  The idea though is to help you learn to spell English better.  So it's really for non-English speakers.  Let's play another round.  We do this week in Google every Wednesday afternoon, 1pm Pacific, 4pm Eastern Time,  2000 UTC on twit.tv.  If you watch live, you'll see great fun and occasional profanity.  But if you don't, you can get the on-demand version of which we have expunged all profanity  and fun and get that right there on your iTunes or Stitcher or use the great twit apps or  just go to twit.tv slash twig.  Nice to have you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's great to be here.  I love being here.  Next time we'll be here, all three of us together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  After I O.  What day is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's June 25th.  End of June?  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Something like that.  That's exciting.  It is.  And we will do live coverage, by the way, of the I O keynote and then do this week in  Google right after.  Gina Trapani is at thinkup.com.  You got to get Think Up.  If you haven't got it yet, let me just get some insights.  I'd like to do this.  I'd love to do my Think Up.  See how my week was on Twitter.  It takes Twitter and Facebook, analyzes it and tells you what happened, who followed  you, which tweets were big.  Wow.  That was a big one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, Leo, more people follow you than went to Woodstock.
