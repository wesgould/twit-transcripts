He is at his at his post at the City University of New York where he is training young minds to the twisted world of journalism.  Hello, Jeff. Happy holidays. Same back. You have spreads. You're at work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am still I have meetings all day today. You know, the kids want to jam everything in. Oh, my God, if we don't do it by the end of the year, it'll be next year. Next week.  But the kids have gone. Right. Yeah.  We had a graduation. I wore my. Your gown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mufki. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you.  But now I remember when because my dad was a professor commencement, you'd wear the gown of the college from which you graduated or got your graduate degree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. But don't forget, I only have a bachelor's, so I don't have any hash. You have no gown.  I have a gown. I have the cheap gown. It's a nylon thing that they rent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Dad had like Columbia from a PhD, Columbia. He had a blue velvet and stripes.  And it wasn't it wasn't a mortarboard. It was like a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, yeah. I'm on it. I get jealous of those.  It's not it's not worth it to go get a degree just to get the dress. That's a long way to go just for the dress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, welcome. It's good to see you. We should mention once again, Gina Tripani is taking the month of December off to relocate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We miss her. But she'll be in New York. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Baratunde just got his Brooklyn apartment. So, oh, wow.  There's a there's a massive tilt to the east.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I believe you think Silicon Valley is all happen. It's not Brooklyn.  Brooklyn is the place on earth. Oh, God. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We I interviewed Alexis Ohanian on triangulation on Wednesday and you found her Reddit.  And of course, he probably the king hipster. And people were coming over.  They had people in the house.  He actually got in the bathroom to do the interview so that the people in the house, they were all going to dinner afterwards, probably some, you know, polenta crust pizza parlor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you make fun. You make fun. You tell us. Hey, look, who else is here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We got Kevin Marks. He is visiting us under his umbrella out in his garden as usual.  Hello there. Nice to see you all. I'm going to resist the temptation to say the out of works.  Kevin Marks, I will say the consulting consulting engineer, Kevin Marks.  There we go. X of Google, Apple, Salesforce, British Telecom.  This guy has left more jobs. Which one? BBC. That's right.  You started at the Bebe. Yeah.  That's where it gets that English accent.  And also with us, Mike Elgin, who was soon to take the helm as news director here at.  Oh, he's wearing Google Glass Glass. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ron Burgundy of Twit. Exactly.  Stay classy, Jeff Jarvis. Grow your mustache now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute. Set up on head detection.  Enable this feature to consume less power when you're not wearing glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is your son's glass. When is anybody not going to be wearing glass?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can wear it 24 7. This is the one that's this is a 2.0, right?  That's right. And supposedly I can wink, take off glass, put it back on and tap touchpad.  And then they have a lovely lady doing it. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Done. You just did something. You heard a little click, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, something happened. Now I just see the Google logo. Is it rebooting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's just to program the Google logo into your brain.  I'm burning the iris. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you have glass, Kevin? You think you're the only one here who's not a glass hole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wear glasses all the time, so it was practical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They will be now, though. You can add prescription lenses to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Glass hole is now a term of endearment. And so now we use glass wipe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Glass wipe. Stay glassy, Petaluma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll be sending my back in January, first week of January. I get my exchange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ah, good. So you already got your 2.0s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is my son's. He got it later. So he got his first pair with 2.0.  And I have 2.0 on the way. This is the old one. That's the new one.  They look identical, but the 2.0 has faster speeds and additional capabilities.  Have you found it to be fragile at all?  I actually broke my first pair. I put it in my backpack in the case that they give you.  And I bent it in half. It's happened to a lot of people. They just replaced it. No questions asked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Scobel's like on his third. Well, I think there's a little margin built in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he showers with the things, though. Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they should have refused Scobel on that basis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So one of the things, and this is I think a little controversial, that they have now enabled is blink to snap a picture.  So in the past with Glass, you had to touch the temple and then say, OK, Glass, take a picture.  Or bring your head up and down and say, OK, Glass. Yeah, you could do that. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that was way too inconvenient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it was a warning to those about that you were about to take a picture of them.  Now you just wink and it takes a picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you always had the ability just to just to hit the little switch there and take a picture, which is the most subtle way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or voice. Oh, so you could do this and it would take a picture.  There's a little button there. Yeah, there's a button right there on the top.  Oh, yeah. That's it. So I could just do that.  Even that's more obvious than just blinking. And blinking also has a little bit of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, winking is a little creepy. Yeah. If you're taking pictures of strangers, winking doesn't help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if you get a piece of dust in your eye, as Dr. Mom says, you could end up taking a lot of pictures.  I don't know. I don't know. I think that this I'm surprised.  I remember it was a hack in the first glass. I'm surprised Google actually enables this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's it's I think it's a speed thing.  They've really tried hard to make it really fast to take a picture because that's really the only benefit.  If you have to take out your phone and take a picture, that takes a while.  But if you suddenly there's like something crazy happening in front of you, you just wink and you've got the picture.  Even if it's off, it'll work. It's actually kind of kind of amazing.  It's just a little creepy to take pictures of strangers because they think you're the one who is stranger.  Yeah, no kidding. They're winking at people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Microsoft. I'm sorry. Google is very focused on photography, the additions to Google Plus.  And now people are putting snow in their pictures by shaking their phone.  That's their holiday. I've had enough of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm a big fan of the photo stuff, but the twinkling and the snowing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you take an existing picture that's on your phone and all you do is you shake it and then it will generate snow like this.  You can share that. And then, yeah, it doesn't automatically share it.  But if you save it, then you then you then you have a copy just like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The other thing, it's one of mine, but except it managed to turn it upside down while it was doing it.  It's snow falling from the ground up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's worth something. That's an error at the printing plant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like a misprinted stamp. I've got a collectible Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think so. But I guess it shows their capability. I don't know what it shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They seem obsessed with snow globes. They had the mall, like temporary mall demo thing with the snow globes.  You go inside the snow globes. Oh, yeah, yeah.  Snow globes. That's right. Anyway, it's a strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff, just say that one more glass story that just came out was that I think in a week or so a an independent facial recognition app is coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, well, Google block it, right? They have to approve it, right?  They can't. It doesn't just appear unless you can you sideload on glass?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't. Well, I mean, it won't be listed among the normal apps that are generally good.  But it can be out there. There's there. There are kind of R rated apps and things like that.  They don't approve that people can still the world's tiniest porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, like I want to. That's ridiculous. I think that's a breast.  I don't know what this is, but it's flesh colored and I like it.  So they're going to see that's the that was the that's see this is OK.  So there's two two issues of privacy. One is that you're surreptitiously taking pictures.  That's why I'm surprised that they approve the winking.  But the other is this facial recognition, which I think is very, very valuable.  Yeah, I think that's great. But Google has declined to do to do it, even though they can.  Mm hmm. Because of the issue of stalkers. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's just because they think it sounds creepy. This was a directly a Schmidt thing, wasn't it?  Crosses the creepy line because they built this years ago with Google goggles.  There was a version of that that would identify people that they they tested and then said, no, we ought to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's too creepy. Right. But let's be honest. It's going to whether you find Google's not going to do it.  They're going to wait for others to do it. It's going to become popular. It's going to work.  You can't stop it. It's just knowledge. Knowledge is not dangerous. Being creepy is what's creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. The other thing is that it's just a convenience.  You can already take a picture surreptitiously uploaded to Google Plus and Google Plus will tell you who it is.  So why not? Why wait?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And as I've pointed out and pointed out with back in the goggles days, the government already does it.  So shouldn't we? Yeah. Shouldn't we be able to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of my students, I think I told you a year ago, trying to use class with people with Alzheimer's.  There'll be therapeutic uses of it that are valuable for people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, for all of us above a certain age, Jeff.  Well, yes. Uncle Leo.  I don't remember people's names. Oh, God, no.  I mean, I get introduced to people and five minutes later have no idea who they are.  So having glass would be great.  Face recognition glass anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's also the problem of phantom glass syndrome, which I've suffered from.  I've actually looked up to get information and there was nothing there.  I've also touched the side of my head and there was just nothing.  A phantom glass syndrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Poor Mike Elgin. He was a normal man until he got struck with phantom glass syndrome.  Google apparently is moving ahead with its photographic stuff.  They just hired Blaise Aguera-Yarcas, who is the guy who did photosynth for Microsoft,  which is an amazing, wonderful technology.  I think that was one that Robert Scoble said he was in tears when he saw it.  I may be wrong, but if he wasn't crying, he should have been.  Photosynth is really, really beautiful.  He just helped Microsoft with the newest version of photosynth,  which ironically appeared on iOS first, not on Microsoft's Windows phones.  He's going to work on machine learning at Google, according to the New York Times,  who quote, people with knowledge of his plans who asked to remain anonymous  because news of his hiring had not been publicly announced.  Mr. Aguera-Yarcas has confirmed that he has left Microsoft to join Google,  but wouldn't say what he was going to do.  Microsoft says we wish him well in his future endeavors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's an amazing engineer because he's been involved in a very wide variety of projects,  including augmented reality, wearable computing.  He was deeply involved in Bing, the development of Bing.  These are disparate, unrelated areas, and he's been involved in all of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That makes sense. He is kind of an AI guy, then. He's kind of a machine intelligence guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who knows what he's going to do at Google, but it's a big blow to Microsoft.  This is the problem with Microsoft. They have such good research.  They develop so much good technology. And then where is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It reminds me of another company, beginning with an X. Xerox, I think, was the name of it.  Same thing, right?  In fact, somebody once wrote a book on how Xerox invented the world and then lost it, never made it happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the difference is, Microsoft is a company that rightly or wrongly, for various reasons,  some people don't trust as much. It became more the Borg. Xerox was never a Borg company.  It was just kind of, eh, didn't go on and do its own stuff.  I think some things that Microsoft tried to develop didn't develop because it was Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. Photosynth is a really neat technology, but it doesn't really fit the Windows Office Nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and some of the content things they've done and when they tried to do their version of the wallet  way, way, way back when, and people just didn't want to do it with Microsoft.  And Microsoft had a certain, it was, it limited itself to what it was envisioned to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I've seen things in Microsoft research that are the kinds of things that are becoming, just now coming online.  And I saw them a decade ago at Microsoft, things like voice recognition.  They were, and they made a big point to say that all of these things were using off the shelf laptops and computers,  nothing fancy, and this is, you know, old stuff by today's standards.  And they were doing amazing things. They had this voice recognition thing that could give you a computer voice in any celebrity's voice.  They had JFK, Marilyn Monroe. This is like 12 years ago.  And you never even heard about it outside of their lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, but the computer voice sounded like Marilyn Monroe?  Yes, almost indistinguishable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's kind of intriguing.  It was fascinating. It would also learn your voice and would speak in your voice.  What?  Yeah. And they were doing this kind of stuff.  They also had this fascinating project they were working on, which was 3D avatar chat, where they had two cameras, kind of like Kinect, actually.  On you.  And it would 3D map your face.  Wow.  And then you would chat with people by looking at the avatar.  They found that the reason people don't like video conferencing is that they can't make eye contact.  One person's looking over here and the other person's looking over there.  But with an avatar, everybody, each person can look at the, make eye contact with the computer generated avatar.  Fascinating technology, using off the shelf parts and nothing fancy, and it went nowhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that where Google, is that the difference with Google?  Google, it seems like its R&D almost always ends up in a product of some kind, even if it's a moonshot like Self-Defense Avatars.  Even if they kill it later, they play with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's part of the openness. They open it up to the public and say, what do you think of this? We're not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of which, have you met Google's newest employee?  They call him Big Dog. Yes, he's a little noisy.  But imagine seeing this coming at you through the woods.  Boston Dynamics, the robotics company making these robots for the U.S. Department of Defense, just acquired the eighth robotics company purchased by Google,  presumably for whatever robotics project Andy Rubin is working on.  Although Andy said, I'm working on business to business.  I don't know what business this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a courier service.  Well, you know what it could be. I'm not sure we want Google working for the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Watch, he's going to try to kick it over. That is uncanny. That looks like there's a man in there.  That is creepy.  Boston Dynamics specializes in robots that locomote using human-like or animal-like capabilities.  This is a four-legged creature that can walk over uneven terrain and keep its balance.  I mean, that guy kicked it and it did not fall over.  And it really looks like a human.  A lot better than I can, I'll tell you that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's not smart enough to get off the snow and into the road.  You can't go to the road, Big Dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Andy Rubin is obviously, he's got a big checkbook. They're giving him anything he wants.  Unbelievable.  This to me is a little creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, here's what I fear about this. So it's not very far that this thing is, because it's done for DOD.  This thing carries guns and weapons and it becomes the bland lubber drone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They want to use it instead of mules, although as Mike pointed out on Sunday, a mule is a lot cheaper.  It probably does exactly the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Should the government, should Google really be doing, especially right now, the bidding of the government for these kinds of secret projects?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They said that Google said that they are going to honor the existing contracts, but except no additional future contracts.  They did.  So this is actually one of the most interesting aspects of this story.  The Pentagon now needs to go find a robotic donkey supplier because these guys are out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you, Mike. I didn't know that. That's very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And yet they are still doing government work. We don't know for how long.  So a big dog can handle 225 pound payload. It can dance.  Actually, Cheetah is another one of them. It can run faster than Usain Bolt.  Look at this. I mean, I don't know if this is a pack animal. It's pretty impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, my feeling is that this, the founder of Boston Dynamics, has always specialized, I think his name is Mark Raybert, in duplicating animal locomotion.  And the reason for that is it's more efficient. Nature has already come up with the best forms of locomotion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that true? Because sometimes I feel like nature came up with like the least...  Cluges.  Yeah, the least unacceptable kludge as opposed to the most efficient means.  I feel like a kludge many days myself.  Look at this. This is the big dog, the Cheetah, running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It could go to the gym for you. Think about that. Just send this thing to the gym and work out for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But notice that there's a massive tether. I mean, yeah, big dog was gas powered. That's why it was so noisy. But yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And of course, Google purchased eight robotics companies in the last six months.  Right. Busy, busy.  And many of them are body parts. There's one company that specializes in robotic hands. There's robotic eyes, these kinds of things. So they're body parts.  I don't think they've purchased, to the best of my knowledge, any companies that specialize in robotics, computer, machine intelligence. I guess Google will do that part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a walking man, a pet man, who was able to walk over sprint ads in a single bound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't look at that without thinking of Skynet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very Terminator like. I mean, you know, come with me if you want to save your life. If you want to live. What?  That would be a good celebrity voice. Microsoft should collaborate with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's pretty spooky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a bit Battlestar Galactica. What was that series?  Oh, yes. Cylons. Yeah.  Caprica, where they had the guy making these in the lab.  Okay, Kevin, you win the Nerd Award today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, Caprica. So should we be, I mean, but that's the problem with science fiction. It's just fiction. So you can't let that stop you because, you know, Frankenstein.  I can't let that stop you because, you know, Frankenstein.  As somebody in the chat room, Castle Bravo says in the chat room, the future is both interesting and scary.  At the same time.  Oh, it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.  Well, I just wrote a column about this concept. What is it that's scary about this kind of technology? What is it that's creepy?  And I have come to believe that it's the combination of the fear of the unknown combined with a fear of being out of control.  So people don't know what these things are going to be capable of, and they have a strong feeling that they won't have any control over it coming into our lives.  And that creeps us out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've told the story many, many times in the show, but that's the case with many technologies, starting, you know, the Kodak camera, the book, the press.  But the Kodak camera couldn't run 28.3 miles an hour.  But it could take your picture and steal your soul.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like it's also uncanny valley.  You know, the where you don't want to make it's very hard to do animations that look just like humans because they're just off enough that the human brain goes, oh, that's something wrong with that.  Yeah. And we're programmed for disgust.  In fact, one of our regular listeners does research in disgust, I think is a Cornell.  And disgust is a very valuable evolutionary trait because it keeps you from eating rotten food.  And we also have disgust at malformed creatures.  And, you know, those are potentially dangerous situations.  So I think it's partly that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But we have the opposite to Leo where there's a wonderful researcher at MIT with wonderfully named Kate Darling, who does cute little robot things to make you cuddle with.  Right. You know, it's the it's the cyber cat.  And then she tries to get people to destroy it.  And they can't.  They can't.  Right.  Logically, it's just a machine.  I can I can I can I can, you know, I can destroy this computer.  Well, no, I'll destroy the Mac.  I won't destroy my so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Boston Dynamics blew it.  They should have made Big Dog look like an Ewok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's an interesting fact that Mark Raybert, who founded this company in 1992, was actually a consultant.  He was a consultant on the Sony IBO.  Remember that that was a cute and cutly robot was cute and cuddly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So apparently the pet man can actually do the John Travolta impression.  Just exactly the right things.  Right.  I can.  It's also scary because it looks like OK, here's what's the most scary thing you can think of.  A human being with no conscience.  Yes.  A killing machine that doesn't care.  Yeah.  Yeah, better, more powerful than a flying movie.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they can be replicated in factories, you know, like iPhones, just cranking these things.  Aren't we doing aren't we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't Google making all that?  Yeah, we're pushing us in that direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, so Larry gets his Google Island and we're not allowed there.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You must throw back.  You know, it would be great if you could use technology like that to make more money to somehow keep track of your finances.  Keep track of your financial status.  Wait, you can with personal capital.  We'll be back in just a minute with this week and Google our sponsor this week is personal capital.  I talked to Bill Harris, the founder of personal capital on a triangulation about about a year ago.  In fact, that's when I first got my first personal capital account.  He was the CEO of PayPal and Intuit and really done a lot of, I think, profound thinking about finance, about money, about our relationship to money.  One of the things, of course, he learned at Intuit is that people want to keep track of their financial life.  They want better tools for doing that.  And that's what personal capital is.  It's a dashboard for your financial life.  You give it your accounts, all of your accounts in a single spot.  And, you know, it's truism that the more money you have, the more successful you are, the more you got to keep track of, the more complicated it becomes.

It puts it all in one place so you can look at it, gives you information that helps you make the most of it and investment advice so that you can do the right thing and then reap the benefits.

Abby finished her exams today.  Your students have headed for home.  Jeff Jarvis.  There was a kid at Harvard didn't really want to take his exams.  Oh, yeah.  And what we know now was a kid because there were there was a bomb threat phone into to Harvard and he actually email bomb threat to Harvard.  And the suspect, according to Bruce Schneier on security, did everything he could to be anonymous.  He used an anonymous email account.  He used Tor, the onion router.  And nevertheless, the FBI was able to identify the suspect.  We got to say the suspect and make an arrest.  Turns out, according to the criminal complaint, Bruce Schneier read it.  The FBI got it got itself a list of Harvard users that had access to Tor and went through them one by one to figure out who it was sent the threat.  Oof.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, he sent it on their network, right, which meant they actually had the packets going out.  Yeah.  So he did what you would say would think would be a smart thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Create a lot of water to have gone to the to the town library.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That would have been better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be better.  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess he did it from his dorm room.  Hey, he was behind on his exams.  He didn't have time to go to the library.  If he had, he could have studied.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the famous story of Zuckerberg and his art final?  No.  That I heard him tell the story that he had not.  He was too busy starting a hundred billion dollar company.  He hadn't stayed for his art final at all.  And he put up all of the pictures that they were supposed to analyze and sent everybody an email saying I put up a study guide.  And Harvard students being Harvard students fell over themselves to get the best essential descriptions.  And the professor said that the class got better grades than ever, according to Mark.  And this, I think, is an example of wonderful crowdsourcing and platform making.  But of course, in the movie about Mark, they presented it as if it was cheating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just as the NSA portrayed Edward Snowden as a cheater on its 60 Minutes piece.  Oh, that was dreadful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The fall of 60 minutes, 60 minutes, the last Tiffany Gem has gone.  It's a bad Kubrick Cercone.  Cercone had CBS now.  It was just an absolute dreadful day after having gotten in trouble for hiring a for assigning a military fan to do a story on the military.  Ex ex ex employee of the director of national intelligence.  They put a security fan to do the security story and John Miller.  Yeah.  Who at the same time was trying to come back to the New York NYPD to work for Bratton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, I mean, it's to be it's yeah, he's going to quit.  Now that now he's done his duty, he's going to quit and go to work for the NYPD.  He is, to be fair, he's done television news reporting for a long time.  He's a senior correspondent at CBS, but has a lot of connections.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it was it was a law enforcement piece to the NSA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, OK, what could I could could you reasonably position it as it was giving the NSA the chance to tell their side?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But even a reporter who does that should then ask tough questions, other side is to them and ask them tough questions and not do it and not well, they showed us the door to the secret rooms.  Yeah, you know, it was it was it was absolutely dreadful and shameful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is the third strike. You got Laura Logan, you got Charlie Rose and now you got John Miller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And let's go back to Dan Rather.  Yeah, it's it's it's the fall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was wrong with this piece?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What was wrong with it? Yeah, I'm just that it was not challenging at all.  It was a propaganda. It was flakery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And just look at like like the description of Snowden as a they even used some ad hominem attack that seemed completely not germane that he when he was at home computing, put a hood over himself and his girlfriend thought that was weird.  It's like that was that seemed like a completely ad hominem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, no, I mean, but actually it was only a smart thing.  The Guardian and this has now been made public.  The Guardian was warned that they shouldn't have anything and say anything in offices.  Their offices are very windowed on next to a canal in London and that other agents could come and use lasers bouncing off of plastic cups on their desk to hear and see what they say.  They can do that, by the way.  Yes. So that's why he used a hood, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. To me, the problem was that they presented a very strong side of the story, which there isn't necessarily anything wrong with that.  But then they pretended as if it were not controversial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They didn't bring out doesn't collect phone information on American citizens, just metadata, which a judge the next day ruled unconstitutional.  Exactly. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so and so that just looks foolish.  I mean, obviously, I'm a fan of the Guardian.  I work with the Guardian full disclosure.  I'm a fan of what Snowden is doing.  That's my view of the story and fine.  But then present that view of the story and hear the NSA's best arguments against it.  Fine. I moderated a panel with Bob Carey, which he went after me about just these topics with Yochai Benkler and and Bob Carey going after a lot.  And and you know, my my position was clear, but Bob Carey was there to present the best that he could for that side.  That's what we've even done that on this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've tried to I've tried to represent the NSA.  You were the Stuart Baker character.  Stuart Stuart did email us and I apologize to for not getting back to you.  We will get him on the show.  I think that would be very interesting.  Yeah, because there are two sides to this.  I don't you know, but that was a that was a fairly self-serving piece for the other way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The NSA report, the committee, the the the I would say dubiously appointed committee just released its report minutes ago.  Forty six major recommendations.  It's like 300 pages.  The funny thing is they didn't invite the Guardian to the announcement.  The joke on Twitter as well.  Of course, the Guardian already had it.  Somebody leaked it to them.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about this contention that Snowden has millions or at least a million more documents, some of which could be very detrimental to the U.S.  U.S. interest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think there was misinterpretation of what Alan Ross Perjurer, the editor of the Guardian said in Parliament, because he said that one percent of the documents were out.  And I don't know this from Alan of me to ask them.  But I think that my interpretation of what he said was he was talking about actual physical views of the documents.  And whereas I think that they've used a tremendous number of documents already in the reporting.  And yes, there is more stuff that's there.  The shocking thing is that they can't find out how much he has because the monitoring software wasn't existent.  I wasn't turned on in the office where he was in Hawaii.  And Snowden knew that.  And so he was able to get more in a short time.  But I come back to the argument that that nothing bad has happened from Snowden's revelations.  They have been responsible.  They have brought things into the public discussion that needed to be brought in the public discussion.  Witness that decision about metadata and phone metadata.  Witness the fact that there's a report today from a committee reviewing what the NSA is doing.  Witness the fact that our allies are also questioning what happens with surveillance.  This is important to have a discussion of a democracy.  And it was here only because of what Edward Snowden did.  He shouldn't have had to do it.  The system should be better.  But that's where it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Meanwhile, the heads of many of the big technology companies, including Eric Schmidt of Google, Marissa Meyer at Yahoo, LinkedIn, AOL, all of the big companies met with President Obama yesterday.  Schmidt began the meeting by going over those five principles we talked about in the full page ad and the website.  Begging the president to change government surveillance programs.  Apparently, I mean, nobody who's in the room is talking out loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which a little irony right there.  Can't you tell us something of what happened in this meeting?  Secrecy on secrecy.  Yeah, by the way, share that picture there for a second.  I like the guy. He's a nice guy. He's a smart guy.  What is Mark Pinkus doing there?  He's Zynga.  Zynga.  A game company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we know that the NSA is going into games to collect metadata there, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He also gave more than a million dollars to the Obama campaign.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All of the two of them contributed to Obama.  So AT&T didn't and Eric Schmidt didn't.  AT&T's Randall Stevenson, I think his name is.  He was there. He had the CEO of AT&T.  He made a huge contribution to Romney.  And he's there because AT&T is, I believe, the number one contributor to political campaigns and political parties in the world, in the US.  AT&T drops a lot of money in Washington.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this just a photo op or do you think there really were, there was any intent on the part of the administration to listen to these guys?  I mean, this is the economic engine that drives the United States.  I mean, you know, it's not an industrial, but in terms of the information age, these are the big names, the big companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Obviously, nothing is going to happen at this meeting.  Right.  But but in optics, as they like to say, the fact that eight major companies took out that full page ad directly to the president and Congress, giving them principles to live by that they have not created and that this meeting then occurs, says that it didn't fall on deaf ears.  It may have felt on obstinate ears, but not deaf ears.  And that there is something that we're talking about here.  Again, we're having the debate.  Thanks to Edward Snowden.  We're having it.  And so there it is.  And so there's an obvious political pressure that's here.  And it had to be dealt with and still has to be dealt with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Marissa Mayer, CEO at Yahoo warned the president of balkanization of the Internet as international companies or international governments don't stop dealing with American companies for fear of spying.  Dick Costolo was there from Twitter, Brad Smith, general counsel at Microsoft, vice president, general counsel at LinkedIn, CEO of Etsy, CEO of Netflix, Reed Hastings was there.  Drew Houston of Dropbox was there.  Zynga.  Shervin Pishavar.  Brian Roberts of Comcast.  It's kind of an odd list if you think about it.  Well, it's not an odd list when you think that all but two contributed to the Obama campaign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the other thing is that this this whole NSA thing is taking off the table a whole bunch of other issues that I think should be on the table as well.  I mean, this you know, this NSA scandal is really screwing American technology companies.  Yep.  And it's very dangerous for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Congress issued a warning last year that we shouldn't be buying phones from Huawei and ZTE because they were partly owned by the Chinese government.  I mean, it's a two way.  Well, but nobody trusts anybody anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the NSA, the NSA, they're they're high.  One of their highest priorities should be protecting Silicon Valley.  They even say that from the Chinese.  They even say that's their agenda.  And they fail completely to do that.  There's some recent reports coming out demonstrating that the Chinese government just pretty much gets every secret they want.  Every military and technology secret.  And they're into industrial espionage and all these other things.  And what is the NSA doing about that?  What is the federal government doing about that?  No, and you're giving a corollary argument to the one that, well, well, everybody else spies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we should, too.  Well, the Chinese do bad stuff.  That doesn't justify us doing it as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but I have a feeling that Chinese, Chinese government was loathed to buy American goods before.  Yes.  Right.  I mean, this is I mean, maybe the Germans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Except Cisco goods they use to make the great firewall.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's part of the problem is if you don't get it from the US, there's a lot of stuff you can't get.  Yeah.  What do you think of this, Kevin Marks?  You're an international person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  International traveler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Traveller. Man of mystery.  Have you ever been cavity searched at the border?  I hope you pay your maid well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did get searched on my way out of the country for having too many wires in my bag.  Oh, yeah.  We all have that problem.  Actually, no, that was that was going from London to Paris.  That's when I got searched there.  You know, there's this amount of window dressing with the meeting with the president.  But, you know, at least it's, you know, that's useful window dressing.  It's a change of being called before Congress testify because they've done they've they've allegedly done something wrong, which it was the previous pattern.  I think the other subjects of that meeting was they were they said, oh, we're asking them to help us sort out the health care website.  Yeah, that was kind of a yeah.  But then they appointed someone from Microsoft to do that.  Right.  It was also kind of odd.  So, you know, there's a bunch of structural businesses there.  So there's there's kind of a recognition that that these these companies are doing useful things and they should the government should listen to them all.  And certainly I know that there are they've got some smart people who are working at the White House now who come from from the from the valley.  Again, there was a sort of wave of that when the first Obama administration came in.  There's another way of that going on now where people are moving there as in the office of the CTO and things.  So hopefully they'll be they'll be paying more attention.  One of the UK angle on this is that they've they've they've invested very heavily in building up expertise in open source and open standards within government.  And the Cabinet Office has the government data services team that is explicitly trying to reinvent government websites so that they don't cost millions of dollars and get farmed out to ridiculously expensive contractors but are able to build on open source technologies and reuse things where they need to.  And that that's definitely a trend that's that's it's welcome and starting to make trying to bear some fruit in the UK.  Something's been going on for maybe three years, three or four years there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Angela Merkel, we are learning now after hearing from Dersh Beagle that the Americans were listening to her personal cell phone called President Obama and said this is like the Stasi, the East German secret police that she she was an East German.  So she had some experience with.  She was particularly angry according to the New York Times that the NSA quote couldn't be trusted with private information because they let Snowden clean them out.  So a she's pissed off that we're spying on her and be that damn Snowden guy cleans you out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, same with your senator Feinstein.  She, you know, NSA was fine and wonderful and glorious until one of her own that is to say Angela Merkel one of that level got hacked.  And then that's when she got mad.  Yeah.  Now Feinstein after after the court decision about the metadata, Feinstein said, well, it's good to have but not not all that credit.  Not long ago she was saying it was vital to have that to stop terror.  The metadata.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, see, this is the thing.  And I think this is why you the 60 minute piece tells you a lot about what the NSA thinks the American people will tolerate what the American people understand.  And and I think that they're very clear that the American people don't think metadata is an issue.  Like, well, big deal.  They know what calls I made to whom when.  Right.  So what?  They're not listening to the calls.  That's what I'm worried about.  But those of us in who follow this stuff, and that includes all of you watching and listening, know that big data.  This is precisely the kind of data that you can use to find out all sorts of stuff.  You don't really need the call content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  And I think the process that they're using is precisely the thing that makes it unconstitutional.  They want this data so that they can go fishing for crimes or terrorism acts or things like that, because actually what they're trying to do is solve pre-crime.  That's it's this is minority report stuff here.  They're not trying to solve crimes.  They're trying to stop crimes before they happen.  And so they feel that they need this tool.  But essentially metadata just enables them to go on these fishing expeditions.  And all these things have slippery slopes.  That's exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And let's let's by the way, the review panel, and I say review panels releasing its findings right now and right up front.  One of the first things they said, we're going to read that this is fascinating.  This is from the report.  Finally, the report says we cannot discount the risk in light of the lessons of our own history.  At some point in the future, high level government officials will decide that this massive database of extraordinarily sensitive private information is there for the plucking.  And here's the big quote, the pull quote.  Americans must never make the mistake of wholly trusting our public officials.  This is from the government review panel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, this is this is from the rubber stamp.  So it's so strong.  The next post there, it says that metadata can reveal quote calls to the psychiatrist, the surgeon, the abortion clinic, the AIDS treatment and so on.  Knowing that the government has ready access to one's phone call records can seriously chill associational and expressive freedoms and knowing that the government is one flick of a switch away from such information can profoundly quote alter the relationship between citizen and government in a way that is inimical to society.  Boom.  So, so Edward Snowden should be banned from this country forever because he caused this debate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we were we were he revealed that horrible secret.  So, so that was to me the big takeaway, the 60 minute piece.  The NSA did in fact say yes, we're hovering up all call records.  Yes, we are.  And we're saving them for years.  But just the metadata folks tells you two things.  One, they admit it to they think you're too stupid to know what the implications of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And also also Leo, this is this is the problem of regulating to technologies rather than principles.  Right. So let's move this back to mail.  Right. The first example using the show many times is that your your contents of a first class letter or package are are are can be searched only with warrant.  Right. We agree with that as a society.  That's what should happen.  And of course, I didn't extend over to email itself because of all the reasons we've discussed.  Now we get to the metadata side.  And the presumption about metadata is that, well, it can be seen by the postman.  It can be seen by anybody.  So it's OK. So to this day, the USPS now photographs the cover of every single letter that is mailed.  Now, the argument might still be made that, well, that's just that's just, you know, who said to whom was the big deal.  But now what the Monday decision said about metadata is that sorry, I'm the NSA turn off my lights.  Is is that now there's there's that much more data that lets you you put together a very complex mosaic of life around this metadata.  So there's a continuum here that either says that our communication is sacrosanct or not, regardless of technology.  And it either says that metadata is presumed to be public or not.  And they got it both ways.  Right. They said, well, no, our communication is not protected, but metadata is always OK.  And we have to regulate this to principles, which is what the technology companies at least are starting to go with the White House on.  And what they're saying is technology companies don't Hoover everything, go after specific cases and specific matters.  And that is what the law was until 9 11.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The three major telecoms, this is fascinating.  So what's happening is they released the report, which is very long and very dense, hundreds of very dense pages.  And now people at The Guardian and elsewhere are parsing through it and they're live blogging it as they as they read it, which is which is great.  Yeah. Watching the live the live blog of The Guardian.  Glenn Greenwald tweeting, Wouldn't it be increasingly hard to say Snowden is a felon deserving decades in prison when the courts and the White House's own panel are saying all the same?  Guardian business correspondent Dominic Rush is one of the people looking at it.  Finds some interesting ambivalence in the telecom industry about new restrictions on NSA access to customer data.  AT&T, Verizon and Sprint declined to comment on the new proposal to have them hold customer data on NSA's behalf.  But one executive warned it could create as many problems as it solved.  Quote, it would be costly for us.  And more than that, it would potentially open access to consumer data to other government agencies.  Once we know once they know that we are holding the information, what's to stop the IRS for asking for it?  Exactly. It wouldn't just be the NSA anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But also the telcos have a lucrative business in billing the government.  They make good money on it.  That's one of the reasons that the AT&T lot wouldn't sign on to the thing the other companies said was they didn't want to talk about this.  But they've already had the retroactive immunity thing written into the law.  But also they have this that they basically say, yeah, sure, you can have that data.  That'll cost you this much.  And they've turned it into a revenue stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And one question of why didn't Amazon sign the letter?  Oh, you know, one one speculation is just speculation that I hear around is Amazon has CIA contracts.  I don't know. I don't mean to besmirch.  But but but you have you have a lot of data about us, Amazon.  You are the library of today.  Libraries have a ethical view that they should never release the card of what you read.  So, Amazon, are you a library or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there'll be lots more.  And the good news is Patrick Leahy has asked for a January testimony on this report,  which means it'll keep it in the news cycle because this is actually a great time from the United States point of view to release this information because nobody's paying any attention.  They're busy shopping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It'd be nice if Greenwald. Yeah, that's right. Before Christmas.  It'd be nice if Greenwald and Snowden could testify as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, by via Skype.  Of course.  Google and Facebook, according to the Wall Street Journal, are expanding their efforts to control the world's Internet backbone.  It's currently controlled, at least in the US, by the telecoms sprint AT&T sprints, I think the biggest Google has spent years piecing together its own network of private fiber optic cables now has more than one hundred thousand miles of backbone route throughout the world.  That's bigger than a sprint, which is forty thousand miles.  And to reduce costs and probably also to increase privacy, both Google and Facebook are starting to light these dark fiber cables to provide their own backbone.  This is amazing. Both Google and Facebook have undersea cables to Asia.  Yeah. All the way from California to Japan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is a big C, the Pacific Ocean.  Wow.  Yeah, I mean, this actually hints of this began about nine years ago when a technology publication called Light Reading noticed a job listing for somebody whose job was essentially to go shopping for dark fiber.  And by the way, for people who don't know what dark fiber is, dark fiber is fiber optic cable that has been laid but isn't being used.  It's not lit up.  Because what happened in the in the in the tech boom in the 90s, all the irrational exuberance caused the telcos to just invest massively in fiber.  They thought it was all going to be used up and then nobody used it.  So it's been sitting there all this time. And so wealthy companies like Google can come along and buy it.  That's one thing they're doing. They're also laying their own and they're all doing it for different reasons.  For example, Facebook is is either doing dark fiber or they're laying their own cables so that they can have this massive data center near the Arctic Circle.  Whoa, because the cooling is cheap.  Because the cooling is cheap, cheap up there. Just open the window and the laws are somewhat better, too.  Yeah. And Microsoft is using it for a similar purpose, which is that they're going to super inexpensive areas for their data centers to operate.  Google just wants massively high speed Internet at low cost.  And in fact, I've I've I've encountered this myself in Istanbul earlier this year.  I got a chance to go to the Google office and use their Internet.  And wow, wow, in Istanbul, this was a blistering fast Internet connection.  Yeah. So they their Google offices have fiber to the nearest hub or something because it's just blisteringly fast.  And it's a fascinating thing. And it turns out actually that when Google goes to telcos to make these deals for Google Fiber,  the telcos have a contract saying we'd like you to sign this.  And Google says, get rid of it. Here's our contract.  Take it or leave it. And they have all the power now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but also they have to do deals with the Department of Homeland Security as they lay these cables to to protect U.S. interests.  It must be a hell of a negotiation.  But why should the telcos own this?  You know, that's just that's for historic reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but there's there's some conspiracy. Oh, no, the big companies trying to get bigger.  Well, the telcos weren't on that letter, weren't in that in their group.  The telcos are not protecting your interest in your rights.  You're better off in the hands of Google and yes, Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. They have opposite incentives.  The Google's and the Facebook's have an incentive to make the Internet as fast and cheap as possible.  And the telcos have it the opposite.  And so that's why I'm on the side of. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't Google and Facebook also spy on us in order that's their finance.  That's their business model. Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not spying. No, Leo.  That's not spying. That's a transaction of information for in return for relevance.  But but fast Internet explicit.  Yes, it's explicit. You better.  I tell Google where I am to find out where Google I would argue is probably more explicit than Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. It's Facebook. Make it explicit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Facebook. Facebook does not make it very explicit that they they when they talk  about making the world more open and available, they do say that stuff open and available to us so we can sell more ads.  There's this week.  They were somebody pointed out that Facebook is indexing the text you type, but don't send as part of their trying to make more sense of what you're doing.  Yeah, I like that. That's a good one. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you said if you decide to send a status update, man, am I drunk and then go, I better not send that.  Don't worry. Facebook's already got it. It's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I think that the question of privacy and all that kind of stuff is separate from the issue of bandwidth.  I mean, half the bandwidth in the US is or maybe even in the world is used up by YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's actually one of the big problems that Google has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Exactly. And and a third in the US is used up by Netflix.  And so, you know, if they're going to if they're going to harvest our personal information, at least they'll do it faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I trust Google more than I trust government, or at least that's not true.  I trust Google actually about the same, but at least I'm less worried with what they might do with that information.  They're going to sell ads versus send a tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's always the key issue. Government can that was that's my argument in my book is the government fancies itself, the protector of privacy and across Europe.  In this case is the worst enemy of privacy because it can gather and use our information against us in ways no one else can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But there's another point. Yeah, there's another point, too, that there's a there are governments and then there are governments.  There's the government that can't put together a health care website completely inept and which cannot keep secrets, especially over the long term.  And then there's the NSA, which can keep secrets and does.  And, you know, that's an entirely different thing.  That's why we can't trust the NSA, because they are a secret organization and they do stuff and they expect to get away with stealing.  I mean, they're in the stealing information business. That's what they do.  And and so without oversight, who knows what they're doing?  The rest of the government? Yeah, I mean, there's no oversight on private industry at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yes, there is. There's more watches. Who watches Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they're going to spend the market. The market there isn't in there is legal oversight in different countries.  It varies a bit as well.  You know, there are there are privacy laws in Europe that are stricter than they are here.  But here there are data breach laws that are different from in Europe.  So you can integrate between them and get some get something out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And there's the SEC and the European Union and everybody's always, you know, trying to go after them to reveal what they're doing and all that kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And media, you know, the idiocy, I still think it was idiotic that Google getting accused of stealing data that was on open airwaves, what happened to drive by certain houses.  Look at the hoo-ha about that. That certainly acted as a check on Google.  I think it was a stupid check, but it was a check, nonetheless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree. I mean, if if if people are broadcasting passwords into the public, you know, unencrypted passwords into the street, it's not up to, you know, it's not up to.  It's like putting a billboard in front of your house and then and then blaming people for reading it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's really an important point, important point, Mike.  I think I think in this entire discussion again and again and again, I see efforts to say you can't know that you can't have that knowledge.  That is a very dangerous thing for society to ever say, whether it's you can't know about your prostate or you can't know some information that passes in the public airwaves.  You're not allowed to know that. That's dangerous.  You're not allowed to use it in this way or that.  That's that's appropriate and is part of what we should be talking about in legislation and regulation and mores and norms.  But not knowing something. Never tell me what I can't know.  Never. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And somebody in the chair did point out in a good point that, of course, if Google and Facebook collect data, there's nothing as we can as far as we can tell that keeps them from giving it to the government.  So anybody is collecting data on you is collecting data on you.  Right. Well, what stops them is the market pressure.  Yeah. Well, so they keep it secret. Market pressure only works if we know it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. We don't know.  That's why that's why the companies in the third of their five principles demand transparency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But do they really want transparency or they just want to demand it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I think they want it. I think they want it when it comes to government demanding things. Yeah, they want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When it comes to themselves, let's say, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, yeah, but but I always go back to the example of Amazon.  I'm criticizing Amazon for not showing up to this party.  But, you know, I think the transactional value of I'm recommending this to you because you bought that and you can see it and you can change it.  That is the model for where this data goes.  I was dealing with a startup today that's going to get a lot of neat data on people.  And I said the thing to do is to go is to think from day one to be aggressively open about that, to give people the value value from that, give them control over it.  And they'll give you more data in return as long as they trust you and see that there's value in it.  That's exactly, exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are, you know, we have to remember that the alternative to contextual advertising is mass advertising where they have to essentially program your brain to want certain things because they want everybody to want the same things on television, for example.  Makes it easier in a world in which they are trying to figure out what you really want to determine your your desires.  That's a much better world.  And that's worth having.  But again, as Jeff said, as long as they're transparent about it and give you control over it, somebody messaged you and me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mike on Google Plus said an interesting thing.  He said he'd been working in web advertising for 15 years.  And really, the most valuable signal was not what people wanted, but what people didn't want.  That knowing that they were wasting money on an ad to somebody who was not interested in that product was actually the most valuable kind of really important point.  That's why you see Dig pioneered, but a lot of companies, Facebook does this, has a thumbs down on the ad.  Is this ad useful to you?  No, you won't see that again.  Not because they want to be nice to you, but because the company that bought the ad doesn't want to waste its money.  Google may be designing its own server processors, maybe not designing, just building.  Google just gets more and more.  Apparently, they have plenty of their Intel's fifth largest customer.  They spend hundreds of millions of dollars on server processors every year.  And they've got the manpower and the brainpower to design their own server processors.  They'd be based on ARM designs.  So they wouldn't be completely their own thing, but they'd probably be some sort of large scale integration based on an ARM cores.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're building their own servers.  Why not?  They're building their own network switches as well for quite a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really?  Because they wanted throughput that nobody else could do.  So they had to do their own chip design and switch design for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google has always been very smart and very innovative when it comes to building servers and dealing with servers in the very early years, at least as I learned from In the Plex, which is a great book.  Stephen Levy's book about Google.  And they bought, they were scrounging together the cheapest computers.  Instead of having the fail-proof servers, they went after the go ahead and let it fail servers, which were much cheaper.  And then they did a good job with failover technology.  And they were able to build data centers for pennies on the dollar, meaning that they could be much more powerful for the same amount of money.  They've always been super innovative and super out of the box thinking about this kind of thing.  And so I'm not surprised at all that they want to do this.  They probably like to build every aspect of the data centers because that's after all what Google is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is there any PR damage to that that you can't rely on Google to make business?  They're going to ruin companies that they should be more open or is this?  Yeah, it's understandable business.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, as long as they just do it in-house, right?  It's only for their own personal use.  If they started selling chips, that might be an issue.  But Apple sells chips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apple makes their own A-set in chips and ship them in their products.  But they don't sell the chips direct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't sell the chips direct, right?  Google does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We don't have heatkits anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The point about the ARM design is you buy a specification for it and build your own chips the way you want to do it.  They're not even that big of an Intel customer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're the fifth biggest customer.  They account for only 4.3% of that company's revenue.  So it's even if it all went away immediately, it would be kind of a bad quarter for Intel, but not at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who's the number one customer, Mike? Do you have that?  I don't know. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who would be the number one customer for Intel processors?  Chatroom, that's your assignment.  We let you go.  Go ahead and be back to us.  Chatroom is smarter than Watson.  Forget Watson.  If you tried to play Jeopardy against the chatroom, you would lose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should patent the chatroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, in a sense, have you heard of local motors?  Local motors has essentially done that.  They have big car companies now coming to them to ask them to take their smarts to use their chatroom to redesign cars.  Wow.  Wow.  The chatroom, if it doesn't have knowledge, it gives us a punchline.  Who's the number one customer?  The NSA.  Or guesses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're doing a lot of that right now, too.  We thought you might want to actually research that, but that's okay.  Google giveth and Google taketh away.  In Android 4.3, a really nice feature that allowed you to install apps on Android, but switch little switches that said the app doesn't get to collect this data or that data.  The feature removed in Android 4.4.2, Google says, it was put in by accident.  The apps ops privacy feature is now gone.  So the idea of you putting in an app, but saying, hey, you can't have that app can't have location information or can't look at my contacts or so forth.  Now, obviously, that's going to break apps.  If the app expects that information, it could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You could fake them out and give them like, you know, always say, yes, I'm a dummy stuff, right?  Yeah, you can give them dummy data.  Yeah. And yeah, then they could learn to recognize the dummy data, I suppose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this is cool. I never saw this.  The apps ops.  It's a very neat idea.  So it's usually all or nothing.  You either accept the apps requests for all, you know, or you just don't install the app.  But the idea that you could give it granular permissions is just great.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And this is one of these trade offs that's been, you know, we've been trading on for a while.  So Facebook now gives gives you more granular choice of permissions for apps than it used to.  And this was this is like an education process for users to when we first started doing these kinds of things, you had to make them all or nothing.  So otherwise, people just ignore them. Right.  Or they've given too many choices. They just click away.  Right. So I don't want to do that.  Now, people are used to it.  Understand the principle than that. That's good.  But the challenge is still how do you understand this contextually?  What's better is with certain kinds of these APIs, if at the point where the app makes the request and you can understand the context for making the request, you can then give permission with an understanding what it's trying to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  IOS does that.  So if you install an app that needs location information, the first time it asks for location information on IOS, it will pop up a thing saying, do you want this app to be able to do that?  And you can say no.  Right.  So IOS does have sort of this kind of granularity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And there are bits and pieces that are a bit like that.  But the challenge is also is always explaining to the user what it is and not giving too many of them.  That was the, you know, the Windows, which was it, Vista that did this where every time you try to do anything, it pops up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  User access control where it will pop up every 30 seconds.  Are you sure you want to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the balance is you've got to understand what it's trying to do and say, you know, this thing is asking to read your address book.  You're like, okay, why is it asking me to read my address book?  What's going on there?  Or this is asking to send a message as you.  It's like, show me the message is going to send.  Show me the messages.  Other people have sent with this app.  Wait a minute.  They're all the same.  This app is playing me.  So there are there are, you know, there are situations like that where it starts getting interesting.  But, you know, to say we can't do this in principle is just that that's wrong.  You can do this.  There's lots of ways of doing it.  You can either make the APIs return errors or you can make the APIs return null data or, you know, make the API return null data.  Or, you know, minimal data that doesn't doesn't mean they can impersonate you or track where you are.  That's very doable.  And to say it's not is kind of silly.  And there are third party roms that do this.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And by the way, speaking of ads, Google now only charge for ads that people actually see.  What?  They were charging for ads that you couldn't see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, almost every media site was actually.  What?  MSNBC did this did this about two years ago where they were they were alone in the industry where only if the ad scrolled up to your eyes.  Oh, I see. So it's below the fold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not visible.  You'd still pay.  You'd still pay for it. That's a page load.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, and Chartbeat did some very interesting work about three months ago.  A beta works company or started where they track your use of a page pixel by pixel.  And so what they found was very interestingly, so advertisers for just that reason would presume that the ads that were down the page were less valuable.  The most valuable thing you wanted, of course, was the banner across the top.  What Sharpie found was basically that's a bunch of lettuce that people just scroll right by because they know it's always junk and they then get to the text and start reading down.  And so the ad that gets the most exposure is the ad that's in the middle of the text of a long story, not a slideshow.  Business Insider.  I freaking hate those slideshows.  Yeah.  Don't do slideshows.  And so an ad down here and an ad even at the bottom, if you've gotten there and read it and been engaged in the story, is more valuable than the ad at the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because it's at the point where you want to know what to do next.  Yes.  So you've got these sites to now have this, now you've finished reading that article, which of these six things you want to go to?  And there's services that inject those in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and that's fairly yucky stuff often.  I regret clicking on those links usually.  Yes.  With the outside, the outbrain stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The outbrain stuff particularly, because it's like, go to this clickbait link.  But the ones that are actually more stories from the same site are actually, if those are done sensibly, are often very useful.  But yeah, the outbrain stuff is like, oh, God, did I really mean to click on that?  I'm so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just met a fascinating company called, met them today, in fact, called Infinite Analytics.  Recommended to me by Tim Berners-Lee.  If he'd said, listen, I found an olive oil company you ought to talk to.  I'd talk to them.  And so very smart guys where they're looking at your social activity to use that as the basis for making recommendations to you in smart ways.  So recommendations and relevance are great.  But you know, outbrain, Upworthy, which we talked about last week, obviously Buzzfeed, the cynicism of them all, the clickbait cynicism of them all,  has just really gotten disgusting and depressing and tiring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's also bad because it incents people to use ad blockers and that kind of technology.  Just as, you know, Punch the Monkey ads did the same thing.  And that's really bad for everybody.  It's bad for people who rely on advertising for revenue because, you know, you have, if you're obnoxious enough and you piss people off enough,  then people will end around it and then nobody gets paid.  And that means a lot of journals and blogs and services won't will no longer monetize and they're gone.  Hey, thanks to Linton in our chat room.  Linton looked at the SEC documents for Intel and that's that's the best.  He looked at the 10Q and said that HP is 18 percent of Intel's revenue, Dell 14 percent, Lenovo 11 percent, lots more than the five percent.  They are still stuck in the PC world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, because no tablet uses an Intel chip or very few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The bigger services do, don't they?  Which say?  The surface is due. The bigger surface.  Surface does. Yes, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And of course, that's a laptop by any other name.  A laptop with an attachable keyboard is still a laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And these companies, especially HP, make a lot of servers.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  While we're on Google, Leo, to me a favor, pick up your Android phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. My Moho X, which I can talk to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I say, OK, Google, let's go caroling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, Google, now let's go caroling.  Will it work? Will it work?  It's searching.  Takes a while sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, well, here's what we get.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, it says, which carol would you like to sing?  There you go. That's what you want.  Yep. OK, so.  Which would you like? Jingle bells up on the house top, deck the halls, oh Christmas tree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, the one that's out of copyright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Which one's out of copyright? Oh, here we go.  It's karaoke.  Karaoke.  Ready? Everybody now.  Oh, Christmas tree, oh, Christmas tree, thy leaves are so untidy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In German, Jeff.  Dein Tafas a loch, bamm, bamm, bamm, bamm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is just the weirdest Google search ever.  And I want to know why they didn't do that for Ramadan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or Hanukkah.  Or is your dreidel song there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because they don't like Christmas carols.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right. If anybody thinks this is pro-Christian, they know there's another thing coming.  So if you say, OK, Google, now let's go caroling, it'll do that for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They should have a Ramadan Google app that watches you and makes sure you don't eat during the day.  Yeah, stop eating. You're eating.  Put down that cheeseburger. It's Ramadan.  I'm sorry.  I'm just joking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just don't direct cartoon at Mohammed.  Google is readying its own smart thermostat just like Nest.  This is, of course, more signals.  How hot is your house?  This is from the Information Jessica Lesson's new blog.  I paid for it so I can report on it.  It's called Energy Sense. Google is collecting volunteers to test them.  And apparently, I guess it did Power Meter before, which was a web dashboard.  I remember Power Meter, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does the chat room know where Google is finding these volunteers? Where do you go sign up?  How can we sign up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anybody? Chat room? Again, Watson.  What is the sound Watson makes when it's thinking? Thinking, working.  I've seen ads now. IBM is doing ads.  Watson was helping the NSA for a while.  Now they've got ads for other stuff Watson is doing.  Is Watson one thing or is it a platform? What is Watson? Is it Skynet?  Watson seems very busy. It's doing a lot of research.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a toolkit, isn't it? It's basically a toolkit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It can run on different computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would like to see. It's a Hadoop-based framework that tries to work out what's going on.  Watson is Hadoop? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How'd he do? Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd like to see Watson combined with one of these new Google Boston Dynamics robots  where Watson has to actually hit the button in jeopardy.  I don't think Watson would do as well if it had to compete for speed with the button.  Darn it. I want to rematch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You see those poor schmucks who hit the button like crazy and they never get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently the Google Play Store has some apps. These are called Energy Sense apps.  Sense energy efficiency to create awareness among users and raise events.  These are not from Google, but they are in the App Store.  I'm not sure if this is related to what Google is up to.  Amir Afrati writing for the information refers to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think this thermostat is just a tip of the iceberg for a larger push by Google  and lots of companies into both home automation and the Internet of Things.  Where it's not just thermostats and Nest, for example, has this incredibly great smoke detectors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I took my Nest out. Did you?  I did. I kept turning on the heat.  Sometimes smart things are not. They're too smart.  I just want a dumb thermostat when it's cold. I turn the heat on.  Did it save you any money? It says it saved me money, but how do I know?  It's smarter than me. I didn't put it in the new house.  You know where the camel's nose under the tent is? It's my Microsoft Xbox One.  It's pretty damn smart. I can talk to it.  The thing that's missing is the connection.  There's no standard for how these things talk to one another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The home automation market is an enormous market. Everything is moving.  Companies have to come install it for you or you have to be a home automation genius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or you have to buy those expensive plugs for every damn appliance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then there's the smartphone controlled world, which on Kickstarter is just an amazing thriving...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We should do a show. I want to do a home automation show.  Yes. You should.  You can use my house as an example.  There you go. Nice.  We'll show me locked out in the middle of the night and it's raining.  House open. House open. House open.  That's the problem. Everybody who has any experience with these things knows that...  Even the Hue lights, which I like a lot, the idea of the controlling lights via Wi-Fi, have a little flaw.  When the power goes out, they turn on full bright as soon as it comes back.  In the middle of the night, I wake up and the lights are on.  It's like, what? It's suddenly blaring bright in my bedroom.  I'm reaching for my phone trying to find the Hue app to turn off the lights.  The lease has a good sense just to flip the switch.  Yep.  Oh, I didn't think of that.  HUE uses Zigbee. Z-I-G-B-E-E.  There are a lot of things that do Zigbee, but there's other standards too.  It doesn't seem like there's any standard for any of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep. I have the feeling that Apple's iBeacon, their indoor so-called...  I think that's going to be a home automation play eventually,  because every Apple device of a certain vintage is an iBeacon transmitter.  You can walk around the house and know where you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google's for sure doing this, because A, they've got the speech recognition,  but also remember when they were showing the queue at that Google I.O.  and then they showed you waving your CD over it and they would know all the songs you had.  It seems like Google's got a lot of the pieces of this puzzle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The other signals you have too, a friend of mine who's a professor of EE at Rutgers,  talks about how every appliance, and this is well known, every appliance has a signature.  So looking at your power pattern, you can see what appliances are on, for how long, what time of the day.  That's already data that's there and available for the grabbing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's an incredible... I really think we should do a show on that.  I want to do a home automation show.  Let's talk about home automation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it requires a trip to the World's Fair.  Someday all your phone calls will be video calls.  Chromecast gets smarter. In fact, it may get ultimately get completely open.  Right now Google's the gatekeeper.  We mentioned last week all the new apps.  Now the latest word is that there will be an SDK early next year that will allow anybody  who wants to Chromecast enable an app to do so without Google's permission.  So stand back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was because I played with the old SDK and the problem was you had to...  The process was very complicated.  You had to register your app with Google and then you have to do some jiggery-pokery  to each Chromecast you wanted to play on to authorize that app as well.  And so to actually get it working was quite annoying and made it not worth doing to distribute anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think jiggery-pokery was the dance they were doing at Fezziwig's Christmas party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We didn't hear a thing you said Kevin after jiggery-pokery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you spell jiggery-pokery?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is obviously what I get from going to London for a weekend.  Public schools. It's public schools. It's all it is.  And then that's an Indian ism.  Is it jiggery-pokery?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Say it like jiggery-pokery. Then it makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you had to like register a thing with Google and that would take a day.  And you had to register a domain and a URL with them for you to put your page on.  And then you have to do some complicated thing where you log into each Chromecast and bless that URL as well.  So you had to bless it on the server side of Google and bless it on the client side to play it back.  And then you could write Chromecast stuff.  So having an open SDK would be a big win for that I think.  I'm excited.  The actual idea is actually very well thought out.  It's basically running a web browser.  You send it a web page.  And then there's a protocol for you to talk back and forth from the device you're holding to the web page that's being displayed on the Chromecast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's dial, right? This is an open standard dial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's kind of. It's got some overlayed stuff there as well.  Discovery and launch.  Yeah. But also they were using bits of WebRTC in it.  But also they had their own wrapper around that as well.  So if they're smart, they'll make it more, you know, they just use the WebRTC stuff as that gets more mature and use that directly.  But part of the value of it was that.  So the use case I was using it for was I had a web slideshow, you know, presentation app.  And I was sending that to the Chromecast so I can advance the slides from the phone or whatever.  So you can get around that whole issue.  And rather so rather than send saying clone my screen from whatever I'm holding to this thing, you can say go to this page and let me manipulate that page from the thing I'm holding, which I think is actually more useful than the broadcast your screen.  A little bit harder to understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google giveth and Google taketh away the gallery app.  The stock gallery app is no longer on the Play Edition devices.  Good riddance.  Good riddance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't like Fedez Lizzie stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So photos is the replacement? Yeah, photos is more like a Google Plus interface.  Yep, exactly.  But it is confusing because on many of my phones I have photos and gallery.  And then of course if you have a Samsung or an HTC you have your own gallery, the AOSP gallery and photos.  So gallery is the odd man out.  However, the Find My iPhone or Find My Android Phone device manager is now available in the Play Store.  You can install it on any Android device.  I can say, does it work like this?  OK Google now, find my phone.  The idea being that you would do that and then you would walk around the house saying that, looking like an idiot, all the cats looking at you going what is he saying?  And then when it triggers, oops, see it hurt all the other stuff I said, but not find my phone.  Find my phone.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I have to shut up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that makes this really loud annoying noise.  Right.  But it didn't.  Didn't?  Because you have your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Your phone can't find itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The one time I left my phone in a place where this would actually work in a seat cushion in my sofa, it didn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They've had that thing, they've had the Android device manager that as you do that, it's just a bit obscure to find, right?  Right.  You can use that now to make them chirp and jump up and down.  And they tell you where they are and they will, they can make them make noises so you can find them too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it also will show you a map of where your phone.  All of which is very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And of course I didn't set up my Nexus 7 got stolen before you lost it.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your non-working Verizon Nexus 7?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just now bought another one which now has 4.4.  Haven't heard anything from Verizon.  Verizon, by the way, meanwhile, is looking evidently to sell its only open spectrum, the LTE Spectrum, because it can't bear to be open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So then it gets them off the hook.  They don't have to adhere to those FCC rules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to argue the opposite with the FCC.  They've violated my rights by aging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They should be grandfathered in.  A My Glass companion app for Google Glass briefly appeared in the App Store for iOS.  And Android realized what, I mean Apple realized what it was and yanked it.  I don't know what happened to it.  Weird.  Yeah.  Google says that My Glass will return to the App Store later this week.  It's going to coincide with the latest monthly update.  So then finally you'll be able to use, you've had to use it with an Android device, right?  Yeah.  You'll now be able to use it with iOS.  Aren't you lucky?  It's going to be nice.  It's going to be nice.  It's going to be nice.  Google now shows images in your Google Mail.  If Gina were here, this would all be changelog stuff, but I'm just going to kind of roll it all up.  But don't worry, they're safe because it's proxying those images.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, there was so much confusion about this this week.  Wired thought that this meant that every advertiser could read, could see where you are when in fact it was the opposite.  The opposite, exactly.  Because Google was caching the images.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was a strange article.  Oh, misunderstanding was rife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'll tell you what's going on here in my humble opinion.  So up to now, if you use Gmail, there would be a button that said load images from the center.  You could say always load images from the center.  But by default, they would just be a box with an X in it.  That probably confused people.  So one argument that Google could make is, hey, we're going to, it's not going to confuse people anymore.  They'll see images, but we've sanitized them.  So what happens is Google re-encodes them to remove any potential malware, but it also proxies them.  So the loading of those images no longer notifies the center that you're looking at the email or gives that center any information about you.  However, I also have to point out, it means that newsletters and other kind of junk email that you get with images is much more valuable to the people sending it in the sense that you're going to see the images now.  You can turn this off in the settings, but if you all of a sudden, I don't want to see those images.  There is the security risk. That's gone.  But there is also the issue of, and I think Google's probably doing this because people who sent email newsletters were complaining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they also like features that they can do that a lot of other companies can't do.  Who can cache gazillions of photographs like that?  I think it's a good move because the vast majority of Gmail users probably didn't know that the existence of pictures in email can show the sender your IP address.  They can find out all kinds of other information about you.  Just like you're loading their web page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'm not clear if it's still possible for the sender to find out when you open it.  I think it is. They're banana tag type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I read something that it is the case that they still can. There is a way to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because on the proxy server we'll fetch it. So you'll see the first time you see the proxy server get it. That's what they said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Google will know. You'll see Google do it. But not on your behalf. Just on behalf of everybody who gets that email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no. Because the point is you put a unique URL for each one you send.  Ah, clever.  Which is the classic way you do email tracking. You send an image with an unique URL for each email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or even not an image. A one by one pixel.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now people should...  The other thing is that when they read the images, they don't just cache them as is. They parse them and rewrite them.  They re-encode them.  To make sure they're not malicious. So they can detect the malware ones and replace them with stuff that doesn't have buffer overruns and things like that.  And they can replace the ones that fail on their sandbox gift parser or whatever with one that is an X.  So that it doesn't crash lots of machines. It just crashes the one.  But they've been doing that for a while as part of the Google crawl architecture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So one criticism of this is that Google is in the advertising business and they're not in the email marketing business.  And this is seen as a move against email marketing.  And therefore against a competitive type of advertising.  Everyone should know that that's part of the controversy here.  And people should also know that this won't hit the mobile devices until sometime next year.  I believe it's already been enabled on desktop universally.  But not on mobile until next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I saw it on desktop. I haven't seen it on mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Mailchimp says this is better for them because when images are turned off, effectively Google hides every bit of information.  So they're getting more information than they were. Not all the information they'd like.  Or that they get if you use Apple's mail client or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My belief at this point is that marketers get less information about each user.  But more information from more users.  So they know when everybody opens it for example.  Instead of before a bunch of people opened it and they don't know if the non-openers never saw it or whether they never turned on the picture or whatever.  So now there's more clarity at least about a smaller set of data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And YouTube has changed its copyright policy so that every single video we've ever put up there is now blocked.  Thank you YouTube.  It's not as bad as that but boy it did very much increase the number of copyright emails we got.  We've got a number of videos that are now blocked permanently.  The company, Google, I guess has changed how the automatic content ID works.  In fact in some cases companies have blocked themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's really hammering. People do game reviews by showing a game.  And the game companies don't want these videos blocked.  These are fantastic marketing for them.  So who are they helping here with this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well it's audio content ideas.  So the game ones where the person who composed the background music in the game is then causing content ID claim against people showing video of the game.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I've just seen lots more takedowns and I think there's a lot of fraudulent takedowns.  The fact that a company was able to block itself shows us that the content ID system does nothing to validate any content claim.  So it's just a stupid system.  To me my reaction to it is this is why I don't count on Google as a platform.  It's not a good platform for serious content creators.  It's still the crotch shot channel.  Really I mean Google if you want to get serious about content this is not how you do it.  Yep, you're right.  I mean I'm a serious content creator and we cannot count on any video staying up on Google period ever.  And I can't imagine we're the only ones.  All right let's take a break when we come back.  A tool, a tip, a number.  And if you want to say something Kevin Marks you can do something too.

Transcript:  When you finally get to that point of acceptance there's nothing more beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These are like Mick Jagger.  The last video they find.  What does the fox say?  Say my name.  It's fun.  It's just an ad.  Google's great at these search ads.  But this is and then of course that kid that kid.  San Francisco.  That's a nice way to have.  Very uplifting.  And then you get the zeitgeist which tells you what people searched for in the year 2013.  Paul Walker.  Boston Marathon bombing.  Nelson Mandela.  Corey Monteith and the iPhone 5S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm still not sure.  Although I think if you search for what is twerking you'll likely to get some examples  which probably make it easier.  Hot searches for today.  The Georgia lottery of course because the mega millions was won by somebody who just  doesn't understand probability and still won.  Gosh darn it.  Justin Bieber says he's retiring.  Wait a minute.  Hold everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's had a long and productive career.  He's getting old.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well as we're going into Christmas it's time to do Google's 12 days of giving.  If you go to 12 days of giving dot with Google dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I typed 12 gays of giving.  That's a different search.  12 days of giving dot.  That's a long URL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's that's a weird.  Wait a second.  That's a weird.  It still goes to Google.  No it says with Google dot com.  Is that trustworthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  12 days of giving with Google dot.  There's no dot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's 12 days of giving dot with Google dot com with Google dot com.  Who owns with Google.  I don't know.  I hope I'm not.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No I think it's real.  If you search for with Google when you type in with Google you get Google.  OK.  Google apparently owns with Google and the certificate is OK.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just want to make sure I didn't want to find out tomorrow that I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microsoft owns without Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In your dreams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So it's funny because Apple is doing the 12 days of giving but theirs starts the day after  Christmas.  So what do we get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know what you like here.  Motivated a teen to go to school.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh you give.  See now I like that.  You give.  So this is that this is like that book app that Gina had us all install.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is something the university does to drive them nuts.  It's so hard to get rid of a tenured professor these days.  Do you.  Do you have a tip you would like to give us.  Mr.  Kevin Marks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not sure I have a tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anything you'd like to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I.  The thing that amused me this week was Dogecoin.  If you've seen that.  Is that what is Doge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this related to Bitcoin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  This is the new cryptocurrency based on the Internet meme Doge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What Doge the mayor of Venice.  Doge.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Doge the dog that says stupid things in comic sans.  Hang on.  I don't know that Doge.  You don't know that meme.  I am so out of it.  You're two memes behind.  I'm two memes behind.  This is the cute dog and it says you know much currency and has this little like cute dog  with saying nonsense thing.  It's the success to low cash I suppose.  But there's now Doge coins.  Someone has actually made a cryptocurrency based on this.  There's a Doge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So is Doge like the cat that says things funny.  Yes.  It's like it's like a logistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But is this the dog response to the funny cat.  It's a different idiom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a cute dog that has a Shiba.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is a Shiba Inu.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Know your meme is your friend here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's been it's been an interesting week for cryptocurrencies because Bitcoin had a  crash yesterday again and it's down to 500.  It's down to 500.  Chinese government shut them down.  There's all kinds of stuff going on like that.  But also someone notes Dogecoin and you can mine Dogecoins and I've now got 10 Dogecoins  because I was messing around with that.  So that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Someday those Dogecoins will be worth nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They don't actually have an exchange.  I think someone's got an exchange rate for them to Bitcoins which is like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently we're mining Dogecoins here at Twit.  The engineering department has decided to mine them with our spare cycles on our encoding  machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well I mean I was playing with this because the point is that this is this is like Bitcoin  was three years ago.  You can actually mine it on your own machine and see something happen.  But is it Bitcoin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it serious or is it a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's both.  It's a joke.  But it's a joke.  It's a fork of Litecoin.  It's based on the script stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like it is Litecoin's technology.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Interesting.  It's just called Dogecoin.  It's got a different pool and different.  Are we actually mining Dogecoin?  So this is this is like the crypto thing.  I mean the other the other one this week was in that area was Coinbase which is they got  venture funding for being a Bitcoin exchange that normal people can use.  And so I thought I would give that a try.  It's basically instead of being like instead of like using PGP it's now like using E-Trade.  So you have to still have to do lots of fiddling about to configure things.  But then you can buy Bitcoins and then they'll deliver them to you like several days later  just like E-Trade does with stocks.  So that they're trying hard to be the the E-Trade of Bitcoins which makes a certain  amount of sense things as people basically use them to speculate with.  This is nuts.  This is nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Talking dog.  And currency.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It was Ozzie's idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you have anything you'd like to tell us about mine?  I do.  I have a combination tip and pick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you don't recall the secret launch that didn't take place at Google for the Moto X  which didn't happen and you weren't there and I wasn't there.  You weren't there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  None of us was there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now we can get bamboo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's exactly the pick and tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now they told us or they didn't tell us.  They showed us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Guy Kawasaki had a wooden back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they said that they were going to have an unconditional return and replace policy.  That's right.  They said if you order a yellow phone and you don't like yellow then send it back.  We'll send you whatever color you want.  So can I send my Moto X back and get bamboo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is the question.  If you have a hundred bucks.  I thought there was a time factor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought there was a two week limit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what the limit is.  It is now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is now.  It says within I think 14 days.  So they back down on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Past the statute of limitations.  But if you've ordered one of the last two weeks.  I'd pay a hundred bucks to get wood.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would because look at it.  It's beautiful.  But it's white on the front.  You can only get a white front.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's only bamboo.  They originally showed all teak and all kinds of things.  But it's only bamboo.  Bamboo is probably the best wood for this.  Sure it's flexible.  It can also be used as a cutting board.  It's antibacterial.  That's right.  But I'm just curious for.  So there's a two week thing.  For people who've ordered a Moto X in the last two weeks.  And want a bamboo.  And you have a hundred bucks you want to spend on it.  Send it back and tell them you want the bamboo one.  And see if they'll do it.  And if they won't.  Let us know.  Because they told us that this was going to be an unconditional policy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would pay a hundred bucks to get bamboo on this.  Although I finally gave up an order to note three.  Because I want a really big phone.  And now you can get a.  They're back with the writing on the back.  You can get a signature.  They use a branding iron.  Made in California.  Designed.  Oh too long.  You can't do made in California though.  Look at that.  Very cool.  Moto X.  What are you using?  You're using Nexus 5.  Nexus 5.  Yeah currently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a nice one.  Nexus 5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nexus 5.  I'm surrounded by Nexus 5ers.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just had to buy a new Nexus 7.  Because I dropped mine in the toilet in England.  Which was kind of annoying.  We have a.  Don't do that.  My tip of the week is don't drop your Nexus 7 in the toilet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It gets wet.  And remember that commercial where every punchline is really?  The guy reaches down to the urinal.  Really?  Did you try to retrieve the Nexus 7?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh no I retrieved it.  And I tried to try it out.  But I went to buy rice.  There's not enough rice in the world.  It was a Polish supermarket.  And what I thought was rice was actually pasta disguised as rice.  No!  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No it will not work with Spetzl.  It will not work with Pastina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like very small like rice like.  And now he's got a virus.  It's actually really sad because it rebooted itself.  And then it died.  And they rebooted itself again.  And then the little light at the bottom came on.  And it just like stayed on.  And then faded out over a bit about an hour.  I'm trying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm trying to come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Andy in Germany says bamboo is less moist.  It has less humidity.  So it's good for the antenna.  And of course it's easy to manufacture.  And it's tough.  I think bamboo is perfect.  And it's sustainable.  Yeah it's sustainable.  God knows you can grow bamboo in about four minutes.  It's sustainable these days.  Ladies and gentlemen that concludes this week in Google.
