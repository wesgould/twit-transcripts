What are you doing in Munich?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm at Munich Media Days. I'm giving an address tomorrow about how to save newspapers.  Before that, I'm very excited for any German friends. I'm going to be on the Morgan Magazine on, say, day F, the Today Show kind of Germany, talking about the election.  The American election?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Are they very interested in what's going on over here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Any conversation anywhere you get going on it. I just wonder how the hell is this happening here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we've finally reached the point in the United States after the third debate where people just don't want to hear anything.  I would imagine because most people made up their mind, many of us, I just voted because I'm absentee ballot.  Millions of votes have already been cast. People are done. It's like whatever happens, we're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the people who go on CNN saying they're undecided are lying through their teeth. They just want to be on TV. Nobody's undecided.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Certainly, if you are undecided, you're in hot commodity right now. Everybody wants you.  Ken Bone.  Ken Bone, undecided. That's Matthew Ingram. He's decided to live in Canada. He's joining us now. Are you at home at your winter home?  I'm in Toronto, yeah.  Okay. Fortune.com. Sad to say your longtime colleague, Stacey Higginbotham, is not here.  Yeah, that's too bad.  Yeah, she's taken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And no offense, Matthew, but you're no substitute for her. Neither am I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Matthew always said great things about Stacey. I'd never met her. I'd read her baseline for years, but you were very-  She's the best.  Yeah, you said great things. And it was actually one of the reasons we chased after her for this show.  Yay, Matthew.  Because of your sterling recommendation.  I talked myself out of a spot. That's just the Canadian way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've done the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, she is great.  I was doing a radio play. I had actually auditioned for and passed the audition for a radio play with Francis Ford Coppola.  And we were down in the basement of the Flatiron building. It was really cool.  Nice.  And I was still a DJ in San Francisco, and I was interviewing Father Guido Sartucci, Don Novello, who had worked recently with Coppola in that car thing, movie Coppola did.  And I mentioned that I was doing that, and Novello had the nerve to call Coppola and take my job.  Nice.  So they called me and said, yeah, you don't have to come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All's fair in love and show business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Damn. See what happens? See what happens? Never, ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look where you are now. Who's heard of him in the last decade?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whatever happened to Don Novello? He was funny though, Father Guido Sartucci.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He got upstaged by a fake priest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. No, Don is actually great.  He is great.  I don't begrudge him that at all.  And the fact that I was able to sit next to Francis Ford Coppola for two nights and act for him was such a great privilege.  I didn't belong there.  And I was just glad to have tried to.  Hey, I forgot to mention our third partner on Crime Today.  Ann Newcomb is here.  Ann is always a welcome guest on the show.  He works during the day for a NetApp.  That's right.  By night, he is a maker and runs a makerspace in Venetia and a regular on All About Android, the new screensavers, many of our shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you make that headset there, Aaron?  I repaired this headset myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Both of these. This headset broke on both sides. I was doing this.  Right. And both sides went boing.  And so, you know, this is a little, this is a...  Is that Sugru? Are you using Sugru?  It's InstaMorph.  And you can buy it on Amazon or anywhere else.  And it's basically plastic that melts at a low temperature.  So you can melt it in, I think it's like 150 to 200 degree water or something.  And then you take it out and you can mold things or put do like I did and just kind of shape it around the thing that's broken.  And it's very, very strong.  So I highly recommend.  Better than Sugru or something like this?  It's better than Sugru for this because Sugru is kind of a little bit more moldable, a little softer.  It doesn't really harden.  Yeah. And this does. When it gets hard, it gets really hard.  And you just don't want to leave it out on your dashboard of your car or something like that because it'll, again, if it gets over, you know, 150 degrees or so, it's going to remelt.  Oh, that's not good.  Yeah. But I never take these out into the sun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, I'm impressed. So he's proving his maker chops right from the start.  Absolutely. Right from the start, ladies and gentlemen.  Wow. They're actually Google's been kind of busy of late.  The biggest story, and I loved the Google blog announcing it, is that basically Google fiber.  I mean, it's as dead as you can be.  Although the story from Google is more like, hey, isn't this great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was an amazing headline. Advancing our amazing bet by shutting things down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And coming from the guy who's leaving.  Exactly. It was almost her welly end.  It's kind of funny because at the end of it, he says, oh, by the way, I quit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's so great. This is going so well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm so sad about it, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a post from Craig Barrett, who was the CEO of Google fiber.  They had announced, or at least we had heard that maybe it wasn't an announcement,  maybe it was a rumor that they were going to lay off a significant number of people.  This confirms it. This blog post says we are not going to expand Google fiber to any of the markets that were on the list.  And I'm out of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it says it says our business is solid. Our subscriber base and revenue are growing quickly.  We expect growth to continue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But like I said, I'm quitting. Yeah. Verizon stopped fires as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like files that stop to do you think 5G does replace this at some point?  We had had this conversation when the rumor first came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think I think that was maybe it was Ben Thompson's strategic.  He's very good at this kind of strategic stuff.  I think it was he who said, yeah, this is this is Google finally acknowledging that it's too expensive to put files in.  It's it's it's never going to turn turn a profit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And he mentioned it again. I think it was today.  And he said, basically, Google over promised and had no concept of what they were going to have to try and build.  You know, you can't just roll out fiber.  This is a massive, massive investment of time and resources.  You need specialized people doing it.  You know, it's a gigantic thing that they said they were going to do.  It's no surprise. They basically admitted they can't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What if the real purpose of this was to get the other Internet service providers to wake up, smell the coffee.  And in fact, in the markets, Google did offer gigabit.  So did their competition Comcast and Time Warner.  And it did do that. It did do that.  So what if they're really accomplished?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But was that their main goal?  That seems hard to believe because they spend, you know, a significant amount of money.  Right. Just to prod their competitors.  I mean, that would be a pretty selfless act even for Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is really the work of the work of Ruth Porat, the new the new CFO.  All across the board throughout Alphabet, the story goes that Porat is is cutting is rationalizing these these moonshots.  I think initially, you know, Larry and Sergey had just a lot of money.  No, I seriously believe that they just you probably know better than anybody, Jeff, because you were interviewing them at the time.  But I feel like they just said, hey, we got a ton of money.  Let's do something interesting. Let's do something good.  Let's do flying cars. Let's do autonomous vehicles.  Let's do Project Loon.  You know, we don't care if we make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Matthew's right. I think there was some notion to influence the industry and they succeeded.  I mean, look at the AT&T, Time Warner.  You have Stevenson saying that their neutrality is a done deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's awesome. Oh, it's over.  Not it's a done deal. We accept it.  I think so, right? Wow.  Yeah, I guess. So let's talk about that.  We don't have to pay.  But before before we do, I do think that what happened to Google is reality set in.  They realized that ads weren't going to keep them.  They needed a second chapter.  And they've now with Alphabet and with Ruth Porat and with Sundar Pichai and Larry Page, they've all kind of unified to say, look, we got to find our next chapter.  We can't just frivolously create flying cars.  This has to be a business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although I have to admit, I regret or I'm going to miss that side of Google, the side where they just decided to do crazy, ambitious, even impossible things, even things that didn't appear to make a whole lot of sense.  Thank God we still have Elon Musk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So basically what you're saying is Sergey is now was.  Yeah, don't you? Well, what do you think, Jeff?  What do you mean?  In the sense that was was the creative genius and any kind of got pushed farther and farther and farther off and out.  Sergey is Mr. Moonshot.  It's I mean, Larry, Larry loves Moonshots, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the argument is just maturity.  Yeah, I think it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it is.  Well, maturity is boring.  It is boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Tell me about it.  Tell me. That's why innovation doesn't happen from incumbents.  Yeah, it happens from lean and hungry young graduates.  Like HGNT and Tom Warner.  Yeah, there you go.  All right. So let's talk about that.  It's kind of a big deal.  You know what?  I have decided I did mail my vote in, but I want to get it back because I'm going to vote for Donald Trump because he says he's going to stop it.  Right.  I don't know if the president can just by fiat say, no, you guys can't merge.  Pretty sure it doesn't work that way.  I think you have to get some agency to go along the FTC or the FCC.  Clinton says she's at least going to have an investigative committee, which is kind of passing the buck.  But what is wrong with AT&T buying Time Warner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. What isn't wrong?  I mean, to me, the biggest issue is that you're going to have just a massive centralization of control and a massive sort of acceleration of zero rating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Zero rating is just when somebody like T-Mobile does this, when a carrier says, oh, we won't count this against the bandwidth cap.  And so the presumption is that Time Warner is probably going to AT&T has announced that they're going to offer DirecTV now, which is an over the top streaming service, which will presumably be zero rated.  Right. It would just be effectively no bandwidth cost to you.  Remember, though, that in order for this to succeed, it has to go over Comcast's Internet service and everybody else's, too.  It can't just be AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. So that would make no sense for AT&T to buy all this content for 100 billion dollars and then say no one can have it unless they're on the AT&T network.  But what they can say, because we don't have a sort of consistent rule on that on zero rating, is they can say if you're on AT&T, you get it free.  And if you're not, you don't.  And so that inherently privileges content that's part of that AT&T package.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  AT&T would own all the content assets of Time Warner, not the cable business, because Time Warner already spun that off the spectrum.  Turner Broadcasting, CNN, Warner Studios, HBO.  Not Time Magazine. They also spin that off, but it would be...  Oh, yeah, the old...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Timing, where I work.  Timeluff, but they don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Spider-Man, Batman, and Superman. They don't.  Mad Magazine, Dickie Bartola told me.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, to me, the only way they can justify paying that amount for Time Warner is by using zero rating to...  There's no other justification for paying that much money.  They're paying a massive amount of money for Time Warner.  Significantly higher than the last bid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's also a hedge saying that...  I mean, just what media communications business is going to be good going forward?  If you're in the dumb pipe business, which AT&T is, then maybe you want some smarts in there just for hedging purposes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so that assumes that Time Warner has smarts.  Well, that's the next question. Yes.  So, sure, they have content.  And I was just saying to someone, I do realize that that's why they're doing it.  They're trying to make the dumb pipe as smart as possible.  Meanwhile, companies that are smart already are effectively getting pipes.  And so, I think it's actually a lot easier for a smart company with content to get access to pipes than it is for a dumb pipe company to become smart.  Aaron, where are you trying to get it there?  Where are the billion dollars changes at?  Yeah, Aaron, Aaron, poor Aaron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We got all these media types are jumping on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, this isn't up my alley.  The only thing I can say is maybe they really, really, really just want to run Netscape Navigator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well done.  I mean, they have to be somewhat influenced by the other dumb pipe companies.  Verizon's been snagging content right and left, including Yahoo.  Dumb content companies.  Not the best content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although maybe they're not going to buy Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You never know.  The template for this, though, is Comcast and NBCUniversal, which, by the way, sailed through, as I remember, sailed through regulatory.  Because it's all vertical.  Similar sections.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is vertical, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And in fact, they've been bragging, AT&T has been bragging, this is going to be a no-brainer.  It's all vertical.  And Net Neutrality is a done deal.  So we don't have to worry about that.  Ipso facto, you know, we're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So is either either there's consensus among the dumb pipe companies.  Crap.  This is going to be a commoditized business with no revenue upside.  We've got to find a way to differentiate ourselves.  Or it's one of those lemmings.  We're all going to jump off the cliff together.  And let's just see what happens when we get to the bottom.  Probably a bit of both.  Yeah.  Jeff, is this in any appreciable way different than Comcast NBCUniversal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a lot bigger.  Different level of concentration.  I was thinking about it.  And I think that everybody lumps these things together that they call content.  And I think that there's at least three different things going on here.  The business that I'm in, journalism, is information-based business, which is separate from entertainment,  which is a story-based business, engagement-based business, which is separate from social,  which is a connection and communications business.  And those three keep on kind of merging around and melding and people are trying to figure out what it is.  So you look at what they're not in is the social end of this business.  Facebook's in it.  YouTube's in it.  And what they're trying to be in is the communications part and the entertainment part.  The information is of no value.  That's why Time Inc. was sloughed off.  Sorry, Matthew.  That's right.  Matthew, you were for Fortune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're part of Time Inc.  I forgot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I kind of am, yeah.  You were sloughed off.  The part that was sloughed off.  I still have the epic stock.  I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have been very cavalier with Matthew.  It's fine.  I write about this stuff.  So you're pretty used to it.  So you're saying content, there's content and there's content and there's good content.  What would be the content?  If you were a dumb pipe business, what kind of content?  You would want video content, wouldn't you?  Well, I'm not sure.  What I'm saying is I think that you want something that's not content.  I think what you want is to enable people to connect with content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's what I'm saying.  I think what you want is to enable people to connect and communicate.  Social.  Communities.  You want social.  And none of what they're buying does that.  I think we do is we add social as a layer on top of content.  That's BS.  Social is its own thing.  The content is a tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Twitter is one of these should buy Twitter.  There's the social.  Well, no, for 20 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would say YouTube or Facebook and YouTube are the two that work plus Snapchat, Instagram.  You know who made an interesting play this morning?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I don't think it was widely recognized yet as a play for social as Microsoft.  Among the announcements Microsoft made this morning is a big new social network for Windows and Xbox based around its gaming platform.  And frankly, that's a very interesting play.  Look at Twitch.  Look at YouTube.  Look at the people watching gaming videos and chatting.  And what it is is a social network with something going on, which is kind of facilitates the chat and kind of keeps it interesting.  And it allows it does something really interesting because instead of having this kind of free form, everybody equal chat, you have a content creator, the gamer.  And you have them create a chat room around what they're doing.  So there's all these mini micro communities within a larger community.  It's been, I think, very successful for Twitch.  Amazon bought Twitch for that reason.  YouTube is trying to get in that business as well.  All of a sudden, here comes Microsoft, which owns the platforms.  It owns Windows and it owns Xbox.  Adding this capability directly to the platform.  I don't think it was really has yet to be recognized that that's the other thing Microsoft was up to this morning.  That's very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think to Jeff's point, I think we're already seeing that it's easier and possibly more effective for Facebook, a social network, to add content than it is for content companies to add social elements.  Yes.  They're certainly farther ahead than any media company I can think of.  And it's because they're adding the content into a place where people are already socializing as opposed to trying to do the reverse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But yeah, you know, the better how much would it have cost to buy Snapchat?  When?  Now versus versus Time Warner.  Twenty five billion.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot cheaper.  Better deal?  Than eighty five billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, better deal that valuation is mind boggling.  That's like astronomical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the problem with Snapchat and the thing that would make me nervous is there's no guarantee that it's sticky.  I mean, I think you're kind of there's no guarantee that Time Warner survives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I mean, a hundred billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you have some sticky stuff.  You have HBO.  That's pretty sticky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think actually HBO is the single biggest thing in there.  I think CNN is pretty important too.  Yeah, I know.  And that's and it's great.  But in terms of in terms of what they need to do with content, HBO, I mean, effectively they need to make HBO a competitor to Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does HBO own its content?  Does it or is it like NBC where it's buying content to combination?  It's trying to do both.  But they own Game of Thrones, right?  They own that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they're creating more just like Netflix is.  Yeah.  Because the original content is where you get the margins.  If it goes big, you keep it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the thing that complicates this is the announcement today that AT&T is going to do this DirecTV Now thing.  Yeah.  Which is very interesting.  There's already, you know, skepticism.  People are comparing the AT&T Time Warner deal to the famously bad AT&T Time Warner AOL deal, which fell apart.  And now still hurts me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I actually think I wrote something and I was this was partly for argument's sake, but I actually believe this may be worse.  Yeah, some are saying that.  Yeah.  Not necessarily financially, because that was a massive, massively overvalued deal.  But at least the intention of that deal was to kind of look towards the future.  AOL was at least theoretically more connected to what was the future.  I don't see how Time Warner is connected to any theoretical future that AT&T needs to have, other than just content to shove down a pipe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does it does it clarify AT&T's intentions, this DirecTV Now?  First of all, DirecTV, which was an AT&T acquisition a couple of years ago, is faltering.  So what they're doing is they're taking that brand and saying, forget the satellites, which is, of course, the most expensive part of that brand.  Forget the satellites.  We're going to do it over the top, an Internet channel, and we're going to do it a hundred plus channels for the lowest cost of any of these over the top players.  Thirty five dollars.  Now they don't say which channels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's going to be free if you're on AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because it's zero rated.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, I think that's huge.  I mean, said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have they?  What?  They said that?  Yes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Monday, Randall Stephenson is the CEO.  While talking about the acquisition of Time Warner, just let this slip.  It'll launch in November.  So that now with that information, is that change how we see Time Warner?  Is it really?  I mean, that's a way to get HBO on your DirecTV Now.  True, true.  And they definitely want to stream everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like they said, when they've been talking about DirecTV Now, they want to stream everything eventually.  And they want they may even do a la carte.  So it may not be a package of a hundred.  It may be pay for what you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And see prior discussion about sorry, see prior discussion about fifth generation.  This is going to be mobile.  Right.  So Comcast has a huge investment in and pipes in the ground.  You know, when I worked at my brief, brief period as an executive at Time Warner, the one time I went on the corporate retreat on the on the court company jet to Bermuda or some island, they had just decided to sell Temple Inland, which was a timber company, because we are a publisher.  We need to have papers.  Let's own the paper.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Pardon me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And and then they said, well, we're going to buy all these cable companies.  And I stupidly raised my hand because I'm schmuck and I was young.  And I saw aren't you just trading one poll for another?  Oops.  Yeah, nice.  Yeah.  The emperor has no clothes.  But but in the long run, right?  It's not that you weren't right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just might have been a cash flow.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I think this whole trend is especially relevant, especially the direct TV news.  And when you put it in light of what Comcast is doing with Xfinity charging, you know, putting a cap on people now and charging.  I mean, it doesn't sound like much, but I got the notice yesterday from Xfinity saying, you know, only one percent of our users will be affected.  By the way, you're in our one percent.  You're the one percent.  I'm the one percent now.  You're using more than a terabyte.  I'm absolutely using more than a terabyte because I'm backing up all my files to Google with Drive.  I'm backing up all my photos.  I'm streaming media all day long.  I'm not watching TV over the over the cable or broadcast.  Well, sometimes broadcast, but never cable.  And so I think that AT&T sees this trend and they want to get in on it.  It's going to be a huge competitive advantage for them if they can say, hey, here's all this free content that you can stream for free from us as opposed to paying, you know, Comcast $50 a month for just just just for the availability of streaming that content over other networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is AT&T's play for the future.  They understand that dumb pipes don't make any sense.  The content is king.  They're going to they're going to bypass.  They're going to go over the top and they're going to go over the go beyond the cable.  And look who they're aiming at.  This is the DirecTV Now website TV beyond your wildest dreams.  It's coming.  Leave your name and email here.  We'll hit you up later with the deets.  This is aimed at the sub 25 year old who has never had broadcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How do you do fellow kids?  That's all I thought of.  How do you do fellow kids?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is completely aimed at the new.  This is the future.  This is AT&T saying, all right, we're going to we're going to plan for the future and we're going to have each.  By the way, $35 a month and I get HBO and CNN.  It might be enough.  They have considerably more than that.  They've already got deals with Disney, NBC, Universal, Turner, AMC, Viacom, Script, Stars, A&E.  You know, of course, the big problem is you don't have the live locals.  They're doing this in the face of exactly the same plan from Apple.  Apple has yet to make any deals at all.  Fox and CBS just made a deal with Google, right?  For a similar virtual bundle.  You've got Sony's view, which is expensive.  It's not going to be zero rated and it's not going to be zero rated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like to me, this makes total sense to me as a consumer.  This is a great deal.  It's a cheap price.  You get a ton of content.  That makes sense.  But the fact that to me, it doesn't work like their whole model is not going to work unless without zero rating and zero rating is a hugely problematic.  Topic if they if they effectively privilege all that content that comes through DirecTV now or through however they're streaming it, then Stevenson said something like, oh, Netflix will be fine.  Well, the point is not whether Netflix is going to be fine.  The point is whether this model effectively cripples new services that might come along that can't afford to pay to be part of that package.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you going to watch twit if it counts against your bandwidth caps?  No, of course you're not.  Especially if you have all this other stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, obviously Netflix can afford to pay whatever fee they want.  They've got billions of dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, the incumbents are fine.  It's as you say, it's where it kills innovation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But if Aaron took out, Aaron, if you took out all of your entertainment watching out of that bandwidth hogging you do, where would you be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I bet it's probably maybe a quarter of that bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, when you get a four key, when you get a 4K TV and you start streaming 4K video, that's going to change.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And games, I mean, me and my kids are always on games all day long, downloading the latest games, which is a huge download right there.  But then just playing games constantly online bumps that ticker up even more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got to say by doing that Comcast is playing right into AT&T's hands.  Yep.  And I don't think there's any technical or financial reason they should have a cap.  I think that that's greed.  But boy, rethink this Comcast because here comes AT&T with an offer that says, well, don't worry, we won't count.  We may have bandwidth caps, but it won't count against the stuff you do.  By the way, this is a variety says, and I think this is probably everybody's an agreement at 35 bucks.  This is a loss leader.  For sure.  This is not.  This is so where do they make their money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  50% cheaper than at least a couple of the competitors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So how do they pay for this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's been shown that zero companies that do zero rating typically have much lower bandwidth caps than companies that don't.  Well, let's talk about this.  So they're going to hit you one way or the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These channels make a huge amount of their money, obviously, from consumer fees.  If AT&T devalues this content and it's buying channels that make money through consumer fees, that's not making sense to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's there's more.  There's another angle, too, which is let's say AT&T is is giving sort of privilege access to things that are zero rated through whether it's direct TV now or whatever.  What about when it goes to try and get, say, CBS or somebody like that to play along with or NBC to be part of a package?  Is Comcast going to say, yeah, sure, we'll license you NBC, Universal stuff or whatever so you can push it through your zero rated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the thing that scares me the most is that you start seeing siloing of content.  Exactly.  So if you want HBO, now you have to have AT&T.  If you want to watch NBC or Universal, you have to have Comcast.  Now, that's something where I have to think the FCC would step in and say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's but there's been threats of that for many, many years in many ways.  You know, the early days of mobile phones, they were going to have original content.  You couldn't get anywhere else.  Apart from some sports deals, it really hasn't happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's the kiss of death.  And I think customers revolt.  If the FCC doesn't do anything, then customers remember the music industry learned this at their peril.  The real competitor is piracy.  Right.  Yeah.  And so you do this at your peril.  You make this expensive.  You make this hard.  Fine.  I'll download Game of Thrones and you'll get nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's going to be really interesting to see what happens to this deal as it as it sort of goes through the process of closing.  If the FCC does decide to use this as a time to say something about zero rating, they've kind of hinted at it.  They said they're looking at it.  They said they're concerned about it.  If they decide to make an example of the steel that could remove a significant amount of the rationale for doing this deal at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, we knew that this was going to be a disruptive period of time that we were entering into this IPTV era.  It's been very ugly already and it's going to get uglier.  I mean, that's just what happens in disruption.  And what you're seeing is everybody jockeying for position and trying to have, you know, with a crystal ball forecast.  And it's interesting that AT&T has that verbiage on its DirecTV Now site.  It's really it's it says, all right, well, forget it.  Forget you oldsters.  We're going to go after the millennials and we want to own them for the next 50 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But does does AT&T have a great reputation with users of any kind, let alone millennials?  I find that hard to believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nor does Comcast.  I mean, frankly, none of these guys do.  Everybody hates Verizon, AT&T, Comcast.  Find one person that likes any of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so their only strategy is to lock you in somehow because they know they can't win you over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Meanwhile, Google and Apple do have good, you know, reputations.  They could play this game, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'm really looking forward to both of them.  And Facebook.  It's interesting to see Google signing those deals.  It's been so long.  They've been working on something like that for five years, but they've never been able to get the TV guys to play ball at the price that they want them to.  Is Twitter a player, too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, Twitter really wants to have you watch TV on Twitter.  And they're doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, they're just very limited.  Right.  And they can't they basically can't afford to do the things that Google and Apple can do.  They they could afford to pay 10 million to the NFL, but they can't afford to pay the billions of millions of dollars.  They're financially just not there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is actually a game of game.  Not Game of Thrones.  The Game of Nets.  It's really it is.  There is a vacancy and they're everybody's, you know, coming for it.  And winter is coming for users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and it really coming for TV companies, too.  I mean, that's why.  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't aren't the content companies safe here?  Isn't this?  No.  Doesn't this put them in the in the in the catbird seat?  No.  Well, they're not social.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It doesn't make them safe.  I think it gives them good bargaining power.  What?  So HBO needs to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  HBO needs to get social.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, what I'm saying, what I'm saying is that this one point with these three layers, right?  There's there's entertainment.  There's there's connectivity and there's information, which other information aside.  And you can't just add social to content.  So you that's why you do you do what the party is blowing it so far here.  I think it's YouTube.  If you do, anyone is going to own the young ends and give deets.  Absolutely.  It's it's YouTube and the other party that had that is screaming video, video, video, but is not showing a strategy yet is Facebook.  So that's the two that I think that they're scared of.  Now, whether they get their acts together and actually become the new entertainment medium because you can be both entertainment and social, that's the potential of where this goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Facebook is going to get there.  And I think that's why AT&T decided to do this and decided to pay so much because they're afraid that once Facebook starts turning it on and tries to become effectively a broadcaster and distributor and pipe that they will win.  They have they don't have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a card missing from their hand.  That's the zero rating card.  Right.  Only a bill only a bandwidth provider can do zero rating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you believe if you believe that TV as you know it is the the is going to grab most people's time and attention.  This is why I always call on my seminal experience for the VidCon.  Yeah, I'm going to go to VidCon every damn year.  Yeah, I can because it teaches me how people view.  I went to a session at VidCon with YouTubers on stage talking about how they had talked about their middle difficulties, whether that was anxiety or depression or suicidal or eating disorders or whatever.  Right.  And then the in the audience, so-called audience, were people who had experienced the same thing.  My point about social is it's not that you gee, I could talk.  I could have a game around Game of Thrones.  My point about social is there was a human tie of empathy there that simply does not exist in the one way.  And it's why podcasting podcasting benefits from that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think it's also if you accept that video, which is where I thought Jeff was going.  If you accept that video is becoming a lot more atomized and sort of disaggregated and linear television as we know it is sort of going away, whether it's through binge watching of multiple episodes or the reverse where it's micro micro chunks of content.  That's a game that Facebook is predisposed to win.  That is not a game that Time Warner is predisposed to win.  But don't you think people will want both?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think it's going to be mutually exclusive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think they will want both and they will continue to want both.  But there's more of one than the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But there are separate worlds that we pulled all three together and called the media and storytelling.  And they got supported by super revenue for advertising.  Yeah.  And what we're seeing is a new leveling of water in the new sea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it is still a vibrant ecosystem and there's a number of niches here.  And that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And actually I believe Amazon is going to be a player too.  Absolutely.  Amazon is spending a ton of money to develop original content.  I would not count Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just binge watched Transparent over the last two nights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've got some great shows and they are willing to spend to come up with them.  They're going after Netflix respectively.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well they launched a music service as well.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was just going to say how long is it before Verizon buys Netflix then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Netflix is one that everybody for a while there Disney was talked about.  Apple has people have talked about them by Netflix.  I don't think Netflix wants to sell, which means if you want to buy it, it's going to cost a massive amount of money.  Hostile acquisition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was just thinking between maybe if you combine Netflix with Yahoo, maybe you'd have something.  It's going to be a disaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of the things that's interesting.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you have Netflix minus 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of the things that's interesting about this AT&T acquisition is that they seem to have thrown price out the window.  In other words, at this point they're saying, you know what, no matter what it costs,  we got to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's why it feels like a Hail Mary pass to me.  It's a Hail Mary.  I think it is a Hail Mary.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there are those that argue that Time Warner is being undervalued and full disclosure from my days working there, I still own that stock.  Who's arguing that?  Jeff.  I'm seeing it.  No, I'm seeing it, which amazes me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, this deal is orders of magnitude larger than previous offers.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And on any multiple basis, it's way overvalued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what's frustrating to me is that Google and YouTube just don't seem to get the urgency here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, that's because they are the urgency, Leo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I do think Google and YouTube are in the Capra seat, but I don't know if that's forever.  No, it's not.  They better get their act together.  But they've got to, again, I think we're looking at, I'm not going to say millennials and kids, but I do think that there's a,  we look at our kids and our kids do watch certain shows.  My kid watches YouTube exclusively, 22 year old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  But, exactly.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that there's a world that's just not seen by media companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Amazon's acquisition of Twitch makes a lot more sense now.  And actually, did you see Twitch?  As usual, Jeff Bezos was prescient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twitch is rolling out shows.  So basically, there's a cooking show that they're launching.  So it's not just watch.  That's brilliant.  You know, so-and-so play.  They tried the Bob Ross thing and that went so well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're realizing people will watch content.  It was fascinating.  And do exactly what Twitter wishes they were doing, which is chat around content.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I don't think, so Twitter's too kind of broad and diffuse.  Like Twitch, it's easier to focus.  Twitter's too dirty and nasty.  That too, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, believe me, Twitch chat can be equally nasty.  Definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we've seen at least two companies suggest that the kind of trollies, you know,  offensive nature of Twitter was part of what kept them from making a deal,  both Salesforce and Disney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, you got the same thing in YouTube comments.  You got the same thing in Twitch chat.  All of these companies are going to have to somehow deal with this.  Twitch is very aggressive at banning channels.  If there's any nudity, boom, you're gone.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And YouTube comments have gotten better, have they not?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they got better briefly because of Google+, and then they just...  Google+.  Oh, really?  And then they went right back to...  Let's take a break.  This is a good conversation.  I'm having some fun here.  Jeff Jarvis is staying up late in Munich, and thank you, Jeff, for doing that.  BuzzMachine.com.  And what would Google do?  Regular poster on Medium and elsewhere.  And follow him on Facebook too, because you...  Between you and Robert Scoble, there's no room for anyone else in my Facebook feed.  I'm not sure what I think of it.  I'm not comparing you to Scoble.  I was about to finish that sentence, which is the value of your posts much higher.  Robert's just on a tear on Facebook.  I think the two of you have realized that this is the social platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I can't get off Twitter.  No, and lots of times your tweets are on Facebook, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why I'm saying that.  Yeah, exactly.  For me, Twitter has become a read-only medium, and I'm very happy with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff, do you cross post all your tweets or just some?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I stopped it for a while, but then I started it again.  I wish I had the chance when I posted any given tweet to decide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can do that with If This, Then That.  Yeah, but I don't bother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also with this, Aaron Newcomb, we'll have a little something more down your alley.  We're going to talk about the Google Pixel phone in a bit.  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  Because Jeff has to decide.  He's got his at home.  Should he send it back before he opens the box, or should he keep it?  Send it to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's Matthew Ingram from fortune.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Blue Apron.  If you are sitting here and you're at work and you're thinking, oh, what am I going to have for dinner?  This conversation is so common to me.  Lisa, my wife will say, OK, what are we having for dinner?  And then I'll say, oh, let me think.  OK, I'm going to go shopping.  And then by the time you're done, you say, can we just go to the Mexican and go have Mexican or Applebee's or, you know, and half the time we do.  That's not good for us.  It's not good for our pocketbook.  Fortunately, there's Blue Apron, which is fantastic on Blue Apron nights.  I know what I'm going to cook.  I'm going to come home.  There's going to be a refrigerated box on my doorstep with three different meals.  All the ingredients for each of them, including a recipe card that tells me exactly how to make it.  And 45 minutes later, without any shopping, I will have the house will be filled with beautiful aromas and I will have an amazing meal either for a couple.  Actually, if you're a single, it's great.  You get two meals, right?  You get dinner tomorrow night, too.  Or for a family, they have family plans with more ingredients and family kid friendly ingredients, too.  And what a great way.  Blue Apron's mission is to make incredible home cooking accessible to everybody while supporting a sustainable food system, setting the highest standards for ingredients and building a community of home chefs.

And you never get more than you need.  You always get if you need one eggplant, you get one eggplant.  You need one clove of garlic.  You get that.  I love the little bottles sometimes I get of sesame oil or soy.  It's wonderful.  They reduce food waste.  You got exactly what you want and you've got an amazing meal with ingredients that you may never have tried before.  And then after that, you now know how to cook that meal.  They don't repeat.  You get at least a year between recipes.  So go right now to BlueApron.com.  Pick a few recipes from this week like crispy chicken milanese with warm brussels sprouts, celery and potato salad or Thai green curry chicken and squash.  With yu choy, jasmine rice and cashews.  Oh, I'm going to get this one.  Roasted pork steam buns with black garlic mayonnaise and spicy cabbage slaw.  Seared salmon and fall vegetable hash with apple brown butter dressing.  Pick three.

This is what you want.  Not just family dinner, but family cooking.  Blue Apron.com slash twit.  Thank you, Blue Apron, for all that you do and for your support of our show.  I almost don't want to end the conversation.  I have a feeling we'll be talking a lot more about AT&T Time Warner and the changing landscape.  In fact, it's going to be probably a thematic part of the show for years to come as we watch this transition from broadcast to over the top programming.  Anything more you want to say before I do move on?  Any other thoughts?  Let's talk about some hardware.  I have put in my reservation.  You can't order it yet for the Jamboard.  I'm pretty excited about this.  Maybe it's just me.  This is a really weird product from Google.  It's a 4K display that ties into your mobile devices.  It's a portable whiteboard with touch and drawing.  And you can collaborate, but you don't have to be all in the same place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good ideas can happen anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me turn this down a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Those need room to grow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It almost feels like a concept product.  They aren't selling it yet.  It's 55 inches.  Microsoft is something very similar with Windows 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But this is more Google-y.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It feels more friendly and you don't really see an operating system around it.  I presume it's a Chromebook inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No margins, no rules.  Jamboard is designed for the way you think, the way you work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like this is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it just me?  It also has a camera on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a panel log to the conferencing system you already have in many board rooms and conference rooms.  I would put this in our conference room.  Look, it's got a little eraser.  Looks like it has handwriting recognition.  One cord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This plugs into the wall.  You must use, Jeff, this kind of...  You do a lot of these brainstorming meetings and things in corporate world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You must use these things, right?  I'm trying to talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not getting any ideas.  I'm trying to talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not getting any sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I'm probably gating you.  Yeah, I tried to.  All right.  I was wondering why it got so quiet.  Let me mute the sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You enjoyed it, didn't you, Leo?  It was actually very nice.  I enjoyed the piece.  Talking to yourself.  By the way, not cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  $6,000 or under $6,000.  Yeah, it just sounds like a niche product, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I sent this to my colleagues at CUNY and we all just said we want them for our classrooms now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Classroom, board room, conference room.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, definitely.  I would choke at my office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, especially since it does Hangouts as well.  I mean, since it's a computer, it's built in.  You don't have to worry about adding another...  I don't know if you've had this experience, Jeff.  I know I have at work trying to do Google Hangouts from your thing, and then you're doing video conference,  and then someone else wants to start a WebEx, and it's all confusing.  Having all of that stuff, the whiteboard and everything built right into one platform, I think is huge for schools.  And for business users as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cross platform, it's Android and iOS.  You can have two Jamboards in two locations and collaborate together that way.  I don't know.  I mean, it's not going to be a massive product for Google.  Microsoft has been making or trying to make something like this.  They bought a company that makes this thing, and I don't think they've yet to sell it.  I think that it's much, much worse.  Twice as expensive, at least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And one of the Korean manufacturers had it, too.  I forget.  It was Samsung or LG.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we've seen digital whiteboards before.  I've seen them for years.  First half of 2017, and it's specifically for G Suite customers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just don't know how many schools are going to be able to buy those things for six grand each.  They're expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But schools buy projectors.  They buy PowerPoint projectors.  You're right.  You're right.  And I think it's one of the reasons they emphasize mobility.  You don't need to buy more than one.  You can roll it around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My kids' class had to bring in an old computer because they couldn't afford to get a new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, believe me.  I'm in California.  There's no money for schools in California.  All right.  Other hardware?  The Pixel's here.  Extremely short supply.  Google just announced that it's going to be later in November, even.  Some people who apparently some people have ordered Pixels and were told earlier delivery dates are going to be pushed back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did they underestimate, do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or it's that or they have a hardware problem.  They have a manufacturer issue.  It's hard to say.  Verizon has them.  In fact, the reason I have a Pixel, mine doesn't come till November 8th through 10th, according.  The reason I have a Pixel is I sent Carson to Verizon and they had him.  He just went walked in and bought one.  So I've been able to play with and Jeff, you got you did order yours immediately at the event, right?  And you're getting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, my wife came out to the car as I was driving to the airport or going to work for the airport.  Did you want this box?  Oh, my God.  I was going to bring it and I thought, no, customs could be a lot of fun.  Yeah, I was going to unbox it here in Germany.  I thought that this will confuse the heck out of people.  So I left it at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a very good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you think of it, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google's charging too much for it.  It's the same price as an iPhone.  Exactly. Point for point.  And of course, we just saw the bill of materials.  I don't know how accurate those are from the supply chain folks, but I supply.  But the bill of materials is I think was 285 bucks.  It's a little bit lower than Apple, but it's not low enough that probably it could be a lot less expensive.  The problem is the fit and finish look and feel are secondary really to something like the iPhone 7.  If I gave you an iPhone 7 Plus and a Google Pixel XL to hold in your hand, I've done this a few times.  You just would know.  You go, well, this was much, the iPhone is much, much nicer.  The iPhone camera is as good.  Actually, it's a funny way to say it because usually you say it the other way around.  Oh, the Pixel camera is almost as good as the iPhone camera.  Actually, it's better than the iPhone camera, but it's missing two things that are really important.  Optical image stabilization.  And the iPhone camera has two lenses.  And those of us who have used it now are kind of hooked on it.  That's not the only phone that does that.  The LG has been doing it and the V20 does it and I think the G5 did it.  And it's really useful to have a second zooming lens.  But where this really beats Apple and everybody else, everybody else, including Amazon, including Microsoft, is the Google Assistant is phenomenal.  Give me a task.  I'll give you, I'll actually I'll do one right now because I'm flying out.  What time is my flight tonight?  Hmm, I don't recall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's useless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thanks. I can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When am I flying to Gainesville?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Delta Airlines flight 1960 from San Francisco to Atlanta leaves at 1030 p.m. today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where are some good places to eat there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I found a few places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So these are Gainesville restaurants.  So it remembers context.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  So it remembers what you asked just before.  Siri doesn't do that.  Make me a reservation at Embers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry, I don't know how to do that yet.  So that's one limitation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It has to be on open table.  So I don't know which ones of these.  Well, that's a problem.  Reservation, seafood, restaurant industry.  Yeah.  The recognition is phenomenal.  Yeah, you know, I can hear I'll do it.  I'll do a restaurant.  We know that does do this.  Make me a reservation for Central Market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's a result from search.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're not doing well.  What if you ask?  What if you ask?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Make me a reservation tonight at Central Market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's the top search result.  No, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's saying I have bad internet connectivity.  So maybe that's what's going on with this.  In the past, it's done very well.  It would say what time, how many, it would walk me through it, make the reservation.  Assistant, this is, it's orked for some reason.  I probably should restart the phone.  It's probably the Wi-Fi.  But it's very, very good.  And what's also notable, its dictation is almost perfect.  Even in noisy environments, it's been very good.  And it is only for the Pixel?  And Aloe and the Google Home.  But it will not be available, at least now, on any other Android device.  That's right.  Which I find interesting.  That's irritating.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But maybe they made the decision that they need the extra horsepower in that phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They want to make it more exclusive too, right?  So they can justify you paying that much for it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or maybe also that the servers, they don't want to, you know, this is a challenging thing to do.  They want to make sure it's a good experience.  Crumble.  Yeah.  There's a lot of reasons that they could.  And we've discussed this over the last few shows.  And I think we kind of agree that eventually Google will push this out to other Android devices.  Yeah, they have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've got to.  I mean, I'm assuming this is going to run on Google Home, right?  And that can't be as powerful as Pixel.  It is running on Google Home.  Yeah.  So it's not really a horsepower thing then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  The effort, the work that goes on is going back on a cloud.  It's not happening.  It's a gating.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we've often talked about really the main thing Google announced on October 4th was not the hardware,  but the fact that they're going to put Assistant everywhere.  This kind of universal Assistant is the future for Google.  Let me try.  What was it?  OK.  Somebody in the chat room suggested.  What are the reviews for Dr. Strange?  You know, this is something's really, it gave me a look up.  You know, I wonder if this might be server side.  So this is much, much, much better than it's behaving right now.  So that was the biggest thing.  It's not a bad phone.  I mean, it's not poorly made.  The screen is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's very fast.  Before we went on the air, Leo, before we went on the air, you said, oh, Jeff, you're going to love this phone.  You are.  And now I'm hearing.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In comparison to something you don't want, which is an iPhone 7, the hardware is not as nicely done.  There's features of the iPhone 7 I miss.  But compared to other Android phones, there's no question this is the Android phone you want.  The best.  Yeah.  Battery life is very good.  Not great.  Not perfect.  But pretty good.  I'm a little disappointed.  I was hoping for better.  I'm getting the smaller one.  This one is, Carson's going to get to keep this one when my smaller one comes November 8th.  And I don't know what the battery life will be like on that one.  I don't think.  Now, here's your question, Jeff.  Should I get rid of my 6P and replace it with this?  And I don't know.  I mean, frankly, I don't know if it's that much better than the 6P.  That's what I'm facing.  Imagine a 6P with the assistant, basically.  And by the way, the camera is fantastic.  Very, very good camera.  I mean, let's be honest.  If I weren't doing this show, you wouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I probably wouldn't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  No, you wouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm tempted by the camera and Google Assistant, I have to say.  I'm not buying it until the price comes down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm a huge Android fan.  It's outrageously expensive.  It's jaw-droppingly expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'm really surprised that they did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, if you compare it to something like I posted this on Google Plus and Facebook  and all the rest, the Honor 6X, which is a I don't want to call it low end.  It's got high end specs, but I'm sure it's going to be a cheap phone, let's just say,  cheaply made.  But it's a really nice phone or really nice specs on it.  And it's like 230 bucks.  5.5 inch phone.  It does dual SIM.  It does external SD cards, 4 gig of RAM.  And then you can go all the way up to 128 gig of storage.  I mean, it's got all the features.  And I know it doesn't have the fit and finish like people want, but you can get it for,  well, assuming, at least in China, the high end phone is going to be 230 US dollars.  Who knows what it will be if it ever comes to the US.  But it's just like, man, if Google would have made this, the Pixel phone, 499 or even,  you know, 599 maybe, I think they would have sold a lot more.  Now, who knows?  Time will tell whether they do sell a lot of them.  Maybe time will prove me wrong.  I don't know.  I mean, there's very good competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why did they go so high?  Yeah, that's a good question.  What is the rationale?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I personally think that they are trying to compete with Apple, right?  And they think perception is that if you're charging a lot of money, that that puts you in the same category.  It's a terrible way to compete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to compete by being equally expensive.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll jack our price up even though the quality is not.  And by the way, it's not waterproof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The speakers, they replaced what was really a nice speaker setup on the 6P with speakers on the bottom  that are easily covered by your finger.  You know, and you mentioned the Xiaomi Honor, but also don't forget Huawei, which built the 6P,  has a very good choice, the Axon 7, which is essentially a 6P.  The story, Ronamodio had this in Ars Technica, is that Huawei was tapped to build this phone.  But the turnaround time, what was it?  They ended up being HTC building it and they had to build it in nine months.  And so they didn't have, literally didn't have time to make it waterproof.  And it feels, I have to say that's credible.  That's credible.  So I think aside from a very good camera, which frankly these days is kind of table stakes for a high end smartphone,  the only real differentiator is the is the assistant.  But the Pixel launcher, I should show you that because that's the new launcher.  You can download that, can't you? Or not. Maybe you have to have a Pixel to use a Pixel launcher.  I'm not really a fan, but it does have one new feature that I think could be good.  It's something that they cribbed from the iPhone.  On the iPhone, if you 3D touch an icon, you can get a menu of possible actions.  And on this, if you long touch an item, it has to be, right now it's only Google and not everything for Google.  You'll get a little pop up menu.  For instance, if I long touch the camera, I'll get a pop up menu that gives me a choice of take a video or take a selfie.  If I long touch my phone icon, I'll get most commonly called contacts or I can create a new contact.  The problem with that is that there's very few icons.  And this was the same with Apple when in the early days of 3D touch, there are very few icons that support it.  But the behavior when it doesn't support it, and even some Google, like here's Google+,  is that when you long touch it, it puts it in the move icon, create a new screen mode, which is really bad.  That is not, I mean, that's terrible.  You swipe right, you do get the Google Now, as with Google Now launcher.  This you can't change. There's a widget at the top that is essentially just Google branding.  When you tap that, all it is is the Chrome search bar with some previous Chrome searches.  It's not particularly useful.  And on the right, you get temperature and weather widget.  And these are not, this is not removable.  So, you know, come to think of it, Jeff, send it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chat room says you can sideload Pixel launcher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you can get the APK for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like Nova launcher, but Nova launcher doesn't do that long press thing yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, if I play with it on home, if I play with this system on home, that'll give me some sense of it.  And by the way, just saw in Twitter, who was it who did this for us?  Stephen Sandoff said that Google has renamed Google cast Google home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, that if you have Google cast on your, completely confusing.  If you have Google cast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you're going to have a hardware item called home that has nothing to do with the application called home.  Yeah. Anyway, but I'll have the hardware item called home, which I want to play with.  And that will give me a sense of a sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. And Aloe does too. Aloe is assistant.  That's the other thing. And I'm really mad at Google.  They're messaging. It's terrible. Stories is it's chaos.  It's awful. So you're supposed to use Google, the messages app on this phone.  That's the default messaging. Hangouts. I know it's still around.  I like Hangouts, but it's still around.  They're deprecating it, right?  I guess. And then Aloe does not take SMS messages. So it can't be used as your SMS messenger.  It's crazy. That's what it should be across the board. Aloe should be your SMS messenger.  They've really bunged that up. So, you know what, Jeff, send it back.  I changed my mind. Now I'm getting more and more angry.  The 6P is a nice phone. It is.  It is. And that life is embedded in the 6P. It's the same as the 6P basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The 6P is going to go down in price now that the Pixel phones are out. So it should be a bargain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because I like Fi. I think having Fi, especially as you travel as much as you do, is great.  I have that on the 6.  Yeah, the 6P, if you're on the beta program, you've got 7.1 now. I got it a couple of nights ago.  You know, Google is becoming a frustrating company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I will say I tried just today to describe Google's messaging, like platforms and features and services to a normal person,  a mortal who doesn't read about this stuff all the time. And I failed. And I don't think that was me.  I think they eventually this look came over their face like, I give up. This is just way too complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We talked about it yesterday on Security Now. It's hammer time.  It's hammer time. Row Hammer, which is an exploit that takes advantage of flaws in memory that allows a bad guy to get to root access remotely to your phone,  is a problem on many Android devices. There is a proof of concept that's out to the newest version of Row Hammer, which affects modern Android devices.  The good news is as far as I can tell, I tried the tester on here at Crash, but as far as I can tell, this is one advantage.  The Pixel, because it uses DDR4, I think is immune to the Row Hammer attack.  However, that's the other reason why you really want a Google phone is security. They're the only phones that will be kept up to date.  The problem with Row Hammer, this Row Hammer attack is it's a hardware attack and is not easily mitigated, if mitigated at all, in software.  So there's no update. So you just have to hope that you have hardware that's incompatible.  And of course, all the older Android devices are vulnerable.  Watch the show, Security Now, if you want to know more details, because it's pretty technical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it true that they put the Google address on the SIM card holder?  They what?  They put the Google physical address on the rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why? Why did they do that?  Take out the SIM card. Take out the SIM tray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, there it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is the purpose of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You mean like the street address?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they put the street address of the Google headquarters.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On the SIM card.  So if I lose it, would they mail it back to Google?  Yeah, really.  I have no idea why.  Can you take it back there personally?  Here's this. John's just brought me a SIM popper.  Oh, I hope I'm not sticking it in the microphone hole. I hate it when I do that.  I could say something, but I won't.  It's 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, California 94043.  I didn't notice that.  Return to Cinder.  Why would you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I go back and forth on this. I agree. Why would you do that?  But at the same time, it's kind of cool, too.  It goes back to the days when people used to sign their name on the PCB on the inside of your Commodore 64 or something.  I think it's kind of cool, but at the same time, it's an Easter egg.  And it's like, yeah, why? I don't know. Maybe put something else there, but it is kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the first phone with Google branding on the phone, right?  And that was, by the way, why Huawei did not want to participate in the Pixel program because they wanted Huawei branding.  So they bowed out. That's why HTC came in at the last minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They could have said, you have too much money, you schmuck, but they didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know, Jeff. I hate to say don't get it.  But basically, it's a lot of money. It's a lot of money. It's way too much money.  Basically, my two phones are going to be the Pixel and the iPhone 7.  And, you know, neither is perfect. I've yet to see the perfect phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me ask you this. So as the Pixel is to a tablet, the Pixel C is to a tablet, the Pixel phone is to a phone, which one is a leap above?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pixel C is so disappointing, too. I love that tablet, but the hardware I love.  But it's not a particularly useful tablet.  I use it now.  I like the form factor. I like the hardware an awful lot.  They never modified Android in a way that made it as useful as it could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that a lot of this is Google realizing that the differentiation is in software now.  We're not seeing the type of advancements in the hardware anymore.  And so I was thinking about this over the past few days and I was thinking about the Pixel and how bummed I was over the price.  But I think that now the advantage is I'm going to get a Pixel because there's this software feature I really want and I can only get it on the Pixel phone.  I can't get it on other Android phones. I can't get it on Apple. It's really weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's basically signaling their dissatisfaction with the Android ecosystem that they've lost control of it.  Which is a real problem. That's no good.  Maybe this is your next phone, the Xiaomi Mi Mix, the bezel-less phone that's only available in China, although Marcus Brownlee and others have been showing it off.  It is a concept smartphone that you can buy.  91.3% screen-to-body ratio. Very, very little bezel.  It's big. 6.4 inches. This is bigger than the Nexus 6.  And frankly, I don't know. I know everybody's crazy about this, but where do you hold it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know. When I have to hand my phone to the airline employee to put on the thing, they're so delicate with it. I don't want to hit anything.  I like a little bezel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Little bezel. By the way, what's interesting about this is 516 bucks.  With an 821, the latest Snapdragon, 4 gigs of RAM, 128 gigs of storage, 16 megapixel camera, and a massive 4,400 milliamp hour battery.  Wow.  I'm sorry. It's 516 bucks. What did I say? 516. Much less. Much less than the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How big is the battery in your new phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  30... what is it? 3500? Is it? I think.  Wow. Wow.  And there's an 18-karat version with a 4... 18-karat gold around the camera and fingerprint sensor. That is going to be $590. It's still less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that one has 6 gig of RAM and 256 gig of storage.  Yeah.  See, that's what I'm talking about.  Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it doesn't have Google Assistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google. How much is the Google Assistant worth to you? I think, Jeff, you're right. Keep the 6P and you've got the Google Home. You can play with the Assistant.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  Wow.  That's a nice phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you... but I want... I need a little bezel. That's another complaint about the Pixel is the big bezel at the bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They could be disabling the touch sensor just around the edges. Like just a couple millimeters or a millimeter around the edge to make sure that you don't accidentally trigger it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Another good thing, I have to say the wallpapers on the Google Pixel are great. There's a live Earth wallpaper that shows current cloud cover and the current date terminator.  I bet it kills your battery though.  Yeah, maybe that's why my battery sucks.  Doesn't suck. Doesn't suck.  Marcus Brownlee apparently in his review said they are ignoring edge touches. I just don't want to touch the edge. And I like the Note 7 edge and the Galaxy S7 edge, which did have edge to edge on the left and right.  So...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Mm-hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  Facebook most secure for instant messaging services. That's kind of a surprise, but that's according to Amnesty International.  Which has an interest in this because of course they want to make sure dissidents do not get in trouble. So security is very important.  Amnesty International ranked all of the services. Apple came in second with iMessage and FaceTime. Skype, Snapchat way down the list.  And there won't be any privacy in the future according to Joe Wespi who is a technology researcher for Amnesty International.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So using their messaging app is a great idea, but don't post your stuff actually on Facebook.  Yeah, well I think that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because they'll delete it.  Speaking of which, did you see that AT&T has actually a little business, a little side business, giving your information to the feds?  Yeah. They've been doing that for a while.  They've always been cooperative.  Very lucrative.  Yeah. And we knew that they were...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So yeah, I went to a session today at the Suddeutsche Insight Club where Dan Gilmore interviewed Edward Snowden.  Oh, nice.  For a journalistic hackathon that was there. It was a small group. It was really, really...  Via Skype?  Of course. Well, Google. I think by Hangout. It's on YouTube. You can all watch it.  But that was his first soliloquy was about how basically the government had to come to the phone company to get stuff.  And the phone company finally turned around and said, well, what are we making as a business? Okay.  Great idea.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Capitalism at work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And AT&T denies, you know, oh, we're just... We got some dedicated employees. But according to the Daily Beast...  By the way, you always know that it's a profit center when they give it a brand name. It's called Hemisphere.  Yeah.  North, south, and east and west.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's too bad they didn't use one of those cool CIA codenames that are like dog catcher or...  Wind shark.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So obviously we know that telecommunications companies have to hand over records. They're often asked for this and they don't have much right to say no.  But according to Chris Segoian, who's an analyst at the ACLU and a really great security guy, AT&T doesn't have to data mine its database to help police come up with new numbers to investigate.  They're actually going well beyond what law enforcement is asking for.  And because AT&T has so much metadata, they don't give the law enforcement the access to it, but they'll analyze it for it. They'll mine it for law enforcement.  Yeah.  AT&T has three quarters of U.S. landline switches just behind Verizon. And it has cell tower data going back to July 2008, longer than anyone else. Verizon holds records for a year, Sprint for 18 months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And remember, AT&T was one of the very first, I forget the name of the program, but like decades ago.  Echelon.  Yeah. Was it echelon set up effectively, you know, access to their entire backbone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We know because a whistleblower talked about how AT&T had let the NSA put a bug in at San Francisco.  Yeah, he set the whole thing up.  Yeah.  Analysis is done by AT&T employees on behalf of law enforcement clients through these AT&T intelligence centers, 28 of them across the country.  They're staffed not just by AT&T, but by federal agents and local law enforcement.  Super.  Nice. And oh, you'll love this. When they send the statement of work to law enforcement, the government agency has to agree not to use the data as evidence in any judicial or administrative proceedings unless there's no other available and admissible probative evidence, because they don't want anybody to know this is happening.  Nice.  There's a non-disclosure agreement.  Sounds like a great business.  Adam Schwartz, who's an activist, a staff attorney for EFF, says, The first time I've seen an AT&T document which requires parallel construction and a service to government is very troubling and not the way law enforcement should work in this country.  Of course, the federal government reimburses the municipalities for hemisphere and that money goes into AT&T's pocket.  And it's warrantless. Did I mention there's no warrant?  Did I mention that?  Yeah.  They just say, yeah, save time.  We don't need a warrant. Just whatever you want. Anything you want.  Hey, Leo.  Yes, sir.  I think I'm going to go collapse.  Are you tiring?  All right.  I'm tired.  Let me quickly wrap it up with an after.  Do Basecamp and we'll just wrap it up. Why not?  Yeah, okay.  Just got to go do the German Today show.  Our show today brought to you by Basecamp and we know Basecamp.  You know David Heinemeyer Hansen. We've had him on triangulation.  His partner Jason Fried, they created 37 signals.  They've always been interested in making work more productive, but more than more productive, more friendly to workers, to you to make your work better.  They created Basecamp many years ago.  They've actually renamed the company a couple of years ago, Basecamp, and the new Basecamp 3 just came out and it is awesome.  Completely rewritten from the ground up.  It's a private secure space online where teams can stay organized, can discuss what they need to get the job done.  Forget email for this. Forget messaging.  It's all in one great tool.  Message boards, file storage, to-dos, chat, schedules, automatic check-ins.  The home screen, there it is right there, provides a more visual approach because it's car-friendly.  Visual approach because it's card-based. Your projects are there.  Teams, company HQ, that's the intranet. That's Jason talking about it right there.  You can easily access your assignments, your bookmarks, your drafts using the My Stuff link on your homepage.  You have a homepage. Set up teams to share ideas, ask questions, and collaborate on projects.  You can even brand your account with your logo.  So, you know, this really looks good.  Jason Fried is awesome.  We use it for our live events, to manage all the events from planning to execution.  Colleen loves it. She says it's easy to use. It's a great way for all of us to stay in touch, know what we're doing.  Kara likes those email reminders.  Are you forgetful Kara?  And it's easy to assign tasks and keep track of how those tasks are being handled.  That's what we've been looking for for a long time.  The whole idea, I talked to Jason Fried for a long time. I've interviewed both of them many times.  The whole idea is as your business gets bigger, if it's five people, it's easy to keep track of what everybody's doing.  But as it gets bigger, and I think it's for us, it was around 20 employees,  you need a better way to keep track of who's doing what, where they stand.  And this is the solution. It's just a low stress solution that gets the job done.  You know what I really like? Like I said, they're very humane.  Jason really thinks about how it feels to be the user, the employee that uses this.  You can set your work schedule in here so you don't get notifications when you're not at work.  So that you have your real time off.  Basecamp is awesome. You get a calmer, more productive workplace.  And I love the pricing. They don't charge per seat.  It's a flat rate, very affordable for one seat to a 10,000 seats.  It's incredible. You can sign up today with a free trial.  Go to basecamp.com slash twit.  You've probably heard of Basecamp. You may even have tried it.  But you've got to see the new Basecamp 3 free for 30 days.  Trust me, this is a huge and wonderful update.  Basecamp.com slash twit.  Jeff Jarvis at buzzmachine.com. He's a sleepyhead.  Always a pleasure to have you on the show. I really missed you last week.  We always miss you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, sorry I wasn't there. But I thought that it would have been Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you coming back? Will you be back next Wednesday?  I'll be back next weekend, yeah.  Good. Look forward to seeing you back here.  Lots more to talk about.  We didn't really get to the DDoS or any of that stuff.  But that's alright. I'd like to have more for next week.  We did have a great conversation I thought on the Time Warner thing.  And since a couple of you have been Time Warner employees,  it's kind of interesting to hear that.  Show you the scars.  In fact, guess who's still there?  At fortune.com. But it's the spun-off Time Inc.  Matthew Ingram. It's great to have you. Matthew I on the Twitter.  One T in that Matthew.  In the correct Canadian fashion.  Always a pleasure. Thank you, Matthew.  Aaron Newcomb, one of our favorite makers.  Don't forget the Benicia Makerspace.  You can follow him on Twitter at Aaron Newcomb or Google Plus plus Aaron Newcomb.  And I know we'll see you back here soon.  And all about Android or the new screensavers or whatever.  Floss Weekly too, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, in fact, I was just on Know How showing people how to build  sprinkler irrigation system timer out of a Raspberry Pi Zero.  So you can go check that out.  I just uploaded all the code for it to GitHub today.  And it should be posted now.  If it's not, I'm sure Brian or somebody will be posting that in the show notes very soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Next week, I hope Stacey will be back next week because I want to talk.  She's of course our queen of Internet of Things.  She's got the Internet of Things podcast and website.  And she wrote a very good piece in Medium.  The Internet of Things is not trying to kill you.  You should read it.  Make sure to read it.  And we will talk about it next week in conjunction with this DDoS.  It'll be great to have you all back in studio with us.  Thank you everybody for joining us.
