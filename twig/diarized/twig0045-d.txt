It's time for Twig.  This Week in Google, the show that covers the Google and the cloud verse.  And here with us, well versed in clouds, Gina Trapani of SmarterWear.org.  Hello.  It's good to see you once again, Gina, the author of A Fabulous Book,  which is now going to sell like hotcakes because everybody's using Wave.  Everybody's in Wave.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Everybody's in Wave.  She knew it all along.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  She knew it.  She said everybody will be...  You know what?  We didn't acknowledge the fact that Wave is one year old  because they announced it at Google I.O. last year, didn't they?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yep.  It is one year old and open to everyone.  And much better than it was a year ago.  True, true.  So try it again.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Also here, of course, the great Jeff Jarvis, author of What Would Google Do?  Blogger at BuzzMachine.com, podcaster for The Guardian,  and director of the Interactive Journalism Program at the City University of New York,  where he is right now at their Graduate School of Journalism.  What is the headline behind you?  You told us once before.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This one is,  People Shot Down by Soldiers in the Streets of San Francisco.  Oh my goodness.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This was the earthquake.  Yeah, this was the earthquake.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Hold on.  Wow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jeff's going to pull his...  Let's see if we can get a little closer.  He's got a framed newspaper.  Is that the Call Bulletin?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This was the Oakland Tribune.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's right, because the San Francisco Papers couldn't print.  Wow.  An example of the old media.  Yes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We used to print things on dead trees.  You know, I saw a very kind of disturbing article.  It's really not related, although I guess it is peripherally,  that because fewer and fewer buyers are buying,  I guess because newspapers are buying less groundwood pulp products,  the companies that manufacture pulpwood are now selling more and more  to book sellers or book publishers, book printers,  and more and more books are not printed on acid-free paper anymore,  but are printed on pulpwood, which will, of course,  disintegrate, turn yellow and disintegrate over a period of decades.  Isn't that depressing?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Not if it's all digital.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it's going to hasten the demise of the book.  I mean, I thought the book...  Yeah, literally.  Yeah, literally.  I thought the book would survive because it is a kind of a form factor  that has a certain aesthetic and a certain appeal.  And if anybody...  I mean, I have a library of books.  I love books.  I have books all over my walls.  I built in bookshelves, and I love that.  Maybe I'm an antique.  But the thought that they may disintegrate...  I think this article mentioned that something like one half  of the New York Times bestseller list is printed on groundwood.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Wow.  I'm surprised.  I'm surprised there aren't rules about that.  Yeah, who's going to make that rule?  Well, this book must be on paper that's going to last long.  Well, you know how Pogue does his citizen missing manuals?  He kind of, in the beginning, he describes the high quality paper  that he uses and the bindings, so the book stays open on your desk  while you tap the keys.  I would imagine that it's going to be kind of proud of the fact  that they were written...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it's more important now.  Yeah.  Pay attention.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think physical books are more about being on a bookshelf  and being sort of decoration, as well as things that we read, right?  But I have my books that I like to have on my walls and on my bookshelves,  and I have the books that I download to my Kindle  just because I want to read them quick and then they're kind of throwaway.  I'm going to research for my next one.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The need to underline, and Kindle just doesn't do it easily.  Nobody does it easily.  Just to underline and write notes on the side.  I'm buying hard books.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I was talking to a friend of mine who bought a used book on Amazon.  It's actually an interesting book, The History of the Vibrator.  And it said on Amazon, excellent quality was top of the list,  and she had been underlined.  But I think there's something...  There's some value to that, isn't there?  There's some information that's been added there,  and I don't know if that's so bad.  I love it that you can do that.  You can annotate. You can marginalia.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, was it Euler's Theorem?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Whose theorem was it that he wrote in the margins of his math book  that this should be provable?  I have a proof, and then it was never proven.  And authors' signatures, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I remember being in a bookstore in the village of Manhattan  and looking through, finding an old copy of a book from an author  who I really liked, and opening it up and finding that she had signed it.  And I was like, this is so cool, and it was like $2.  That kind of thing.  You can't sign an ebook, that's for sure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So let's talk about how badly AT&T sucks.  You say, Jeff, you call this cynical act.  Well, you know, when you think about it, listen to John Stewart, right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The service sucks.  There are two responses to that.  The proper response is to invest and make the service not suck.  The other response is to change your pricing  so you make your customers use it less.  That's what they did.  And the irony to me is, I've told the story, I think, here before,  that there's a guy named Tom Epslin who ran AT&T,  WorldNet, who took off the 1995, or put on the 1995 flat rate pricing  and made the Internet explode.  The irony is that it's AT&T that's putting the clock, the ticking clock,  the uh-oh, I better get off clock, back on connectivity just as mobile explodes.  It just shows what terrible managers they are.  And yeah, people come in and say, oh, it's flying to man Jarvis,  and this and that.  But at some point, if you're selling me a service that's not good,  if you're selling me a service I'm afraid to use, it just doesn't make sense.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So for those of you who haven't been paying as we have,  strict attention to all the latest tech news every moment,  of course because we watch that fabulous Tom Merritt and Becky Worley  on Tech News Today every weekday at 2.30 Pacific, 5.30 Eastern on Twitter Live.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And you said you weren't good at the show.  You're an asterisk.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  For those of you who weren't listening yesterday,  AT&T shocked every iPad owner.  You know, I gave my 80-year-old father-in-law an iPad last week,  and he sent me an email this week.  He said, because I said, get the 250 megs, you probably won't use them much.  He said, I use it up.  So he had to subscribe to the $30 unlimited AT&T plan.  Well, it's a good thing he did because Monday AT&T's announced,  we're discontinuing it.  They're going to charge $25 for two gigabytes of data,  and then an additional $10 for every additional gigabyte you download.  And now your grandfather didn't if you get your unlimited by Monday.  But to me, that seems like a cynical act.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  When does Apple drop AT&T?  What did Jobs have to say about that last week?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He didn't.  He bit his lip.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is that the signal?  And he touched his ear and then he went like this, and that means...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Walt Mossberg asked Steve Jobs at the D8 conference,  when's Verizon going to get the iPhone?  Steve doesn't answer.  He goes, trying to hold back.  I'm going to read the tea leaves, Gina.  It's my opinion that he was going to, he wanted to say, watch Monday.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And this, it's interesting, isn't it?  Now, maybe I'm nuts, but AT&T's plan changes Monday.  So the question is, who did it, who was it blinked?  Was it AT&T that said we can't afford to do this, we're going to have to charge you?  And then Apple said, okay, fine, we're going Verizon.  Or was it the other way around?  And AT&T found out and said, okay, well, so much for that unlimited plan that you begged us for.  Which do you think, Gina?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think Apple's in the driver's seat there.  I think.  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What do you guys think?  Well, you know, I put it in two ways.  If Apple picked AT&T, Apple sniffed the shark.  Right?  Because why did they pick them?  So they could have control not to get us better service.  Yeah.  Yeah, we got unlimited.  We only got it for a while.  You know, I think it's more of control freakishness.  I don't know.  And we're left with terrible choices now.  You know, it's not like Verizon's no better.  Verizon's had caps on forever.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Five gigabytes.  And you really can't buy more.  Right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And then Sprint is, I mean, I'm eager to hear Gina's review of the Evo because Sprint is unlimited.  But I can't use it in Europe.  And T-Mobile hasn't unlimited today, but I can't use it in America.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  T-Mobile gives you free, right now, gives you free tethering on a Nexus One with Froyo.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's the other thing.  AT&T is going to charge 20 bucks for tethering.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  And Sprint's going to charge 30 bucks.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, 30 bucks.  Although.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's still half what they charge for a MiFi.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, so on the Evo, the Sprint has the capability to turn on the hotspot.  So the Evo that we got at I.O. has unlimited data, right?  So you can use it as a hotspot.  But if you don't have to pay that extra $30, right, in theory, you can't use it as a hotspot.  But you can still tether like using PDA net or any other way that you could.  I mean, I was tethering before with Android 2.1, you know, just using PDA net and, you know,  connecting it with a USB cable to my, you know, how do they know?  Do they know where the traffic's coming from?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's my question.  I mean, Android could report back.  It can't possibly.  Well, Android could report back, right?  It could say tethering's on.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I guess so.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You got to fire up Wireshark, Gina.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, we should.  No, I mean, but how?  I mean, it's not like, I mean, HTTP traffic, right, is going to send the agent.  The traffic will look the same.  Yeah, the traffic's going to look the same.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Android would have to say, would have to signal to the carrier, they've turned on tethering.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Couldn't you tell because you'd see different browser types and things like that come through?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Ah, that's true too.  Yeah, but you could.  You'd have to do deep packet inspection.  You'd have to sniff the packets, which is kind of verboten.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  So we're saying that Apple said it was going to make the iPhone available on Verizon and  in response to that AT&T, you said, fine, okay, we're going to start charging for this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  One or the other.  Somebody blinked.  Somebody said, okay.  But the upshot for the consumer is, it's got to be.  Steve's going to take the stage 10 a.m., June 7th, Monday, Worldwide Developers Conference.  Quote, you won't be disappointed.  What's he going to say?  Is he going to say a Verizon iPad?  Is he going to say Verizon iPhone?  Is he going to say both?  He's got to do something.  He's got to be, look it, 100,000 Android phones a day now.  You know, Apple trumpeted 2 million iPads in two months.  100,000 a day is 3 million Android phones a month.  It's three times that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And did you hear what he said about Schmidt last night?  No.  I didn't see this in the video.  I was reading Ina Fried's live blog.  I guess they, Walt Mossberg had asked Jobs, like, what happened with Schmidt?  And Jobs said something like, they decided to compete with us.  You know, we didn't go into search.  Something like that.  That's his story.  He's feeling it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Steve was the kinder gentler.  Steve, hey, I wasn't going after Adobe.  We just made a technical decision.  Then they attacked me, so I had to get them.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, but I think that that comment says that Jobs is paying.  I think he's concerned about the Android thing.  I think that he's like, OK, we're on.  You know, game on.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is there any chance he'd open it up to all carriers?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He could.  That's interesting.  That's an interesting play.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If you're going to fight Google, then screw it, man.  Get your iPhones everywhere.  You know, why wouldn't he?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because if you give up the exclusive, then...  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There's no benefit to him.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Verizon's not going to say no just because everybody else is selling it.  They want the iPhone, I'm sure.  Don't they?  I mean, anybody would want the iPhone.  Look how the iPhone sells.  Why not?  Even if you're selling Android phones, give your customers every choice possible.  Now, by the way, it ain't just phones we're talking.  Android tablets.  There are, Steve Gibson told me, 45, count them, tablets.  Tablets being announced this week at Computex in Taiwan running Android.  So, Gina, you're going to get your wish.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm excited.  I'm really excited to try out an Android tablet.  This is going to be...  Where is this conference?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Computex is the big PC manufacturers conference in Taiwan.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, it's in Taiwan.  And so it's all the time...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, you know, Acer, Asus.  Yeah, it's all the Taiwanese manufacturers and lots of different designs we're seeing.  You know, kind of funky, interesting hardware, but SD card slots, USB connectors, cameras,  all the things Apple isn't putting on theirs.  I have to say, I've come around.  When you first said, oh, I can't wait for an Android tablet, I was saying, oh, but no, this iPad, it's perfect.  It's perfect.  But I think you're right.  I think an Android tablet could be just as good, couldn't it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think so.  And wire-free.  No wires, which is something else that the jobs talked about last night, right?  The fact that you have to connect your iPad.  Yeah, what's the deal with that?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Did he explain that?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  He said we need to get better at that.  I feel like he was really...  I was pretty...  Now, again, I didn't see this video.  I just read the text.  I'm not sure how it delivered it.  But I mean, the fact that...  I mean, one could argue that Apple doesn't really get the cloud nearly as well as Google does.  And I think that the fact that you have to connect your iPad to your Mac, you know, with the cord is a really good indicator of that, right?  So I think the fact that Jobs said, yeah, you know, right now there's a wire involved to sync your data.  We need to get better at that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is it still true that you can't use an iPad unless you have a computer?  Well, you have to...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  When you turn it on, it says, hook me up.  Right.  But people tell me there's no reason you couldn't do that at the Apple Store.  They would hook it up for you.  You would have to put an account in.  And then you can get music and applications without connecting it.  It'll never back up.  But, you know, I mean, you kind of be SOL.  You have to take it back to the store if anything happened to it.  But you don't have...  That's the thing.  Apple didn't have to do that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Whereas Android tablets like Android phones will back up to the cloud.  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The cloud, yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And you sign in and all your data is there instantly.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Tell me this, though.  I think there's a difference, is there not, if I get official Android and I get access to the marketplace.  If I get open source Android, I don't get access to the marketplace, right?  What?  Is that true?  Somebody told me that was the case for...  This is fourth hand.  It just made me concerned that if you didn't have a billing relationship through the structure,  a manufacturer can throw on open source Android onto the device.  But that you lose some things.  And I'm not sure exactly what.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, if you have a Google account, you have a Google check out.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.  So, okay, good.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That makes me feel better.  Well, so there's...  Okay.  So there's like the Android operating system, much of which is open source, right?  And so that's the operating system.  And that's open source.  And then there are some apps on top of it which are closed source.  Like, for example, the Gmail Native Client.  That's a closed source application, right?  So like, this is why Cyanogen got into all that trouble when he was distributing the other...  Oh, right.  He can't distribute the stuff.  Right.  Because you can't distribute these closed source apps.  So I'm not sure if the Market app is closed source.  That's a possibility.  Well, also the Gmail.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So the problem is if you get a tablet with Android, I'm not sure that's a sufficient answer.  I don't know.  But I think it's worth looking into as these things come out.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, this is going to be interesting.  I mean, if companies are creating custom builds of Android to install on their software,  you know, on their hardware, that's like completely...  I want to say Chromium, but that's the open source layer of Chrome.  I'm forgetting what the Android project is.  It's like a...  It's some acronym that basically says like, this is the open source version of Android.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it's like Darwin and OS X, Chromium and Chrome.  Exactly.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You're not going to get Froyo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're going to have Forking.  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, there's Forking.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's part of, you know...  That's open source.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Welcome to open source.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Welcome to open source.  You know, you and I both, Gina, now are using a Sprint Evo.  You got yours at Google I.O. and Sprint sent me a loaner.  Yes, I'm going to send it back, but I think I'm going to buy it.  But it has the HTC Sense on top of it, including the HTC apps, which are like the Google apps  proprietary.  I like the Mail app better, for instance.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Really?  Oh, that's interesting.  So I don't use the Mail app because I use the Gmail app, but their browser is a little  better.  I think it's the same.  Is it better?  It's a little better.  Well, it's named Internet.  It's not named browser and it had pinched to zoom, but the regular browser has it.  It has a couple of features.  Like it does a couple of things a little differently than the Android browser.  So I think that it is a different browser.  Oh, okay.  I hadn't really paid any attention to it.  I could be wrong about that.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Leo, have you used the Incredible?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I have only played with it.  I haven't used it extensively.  That's the hot debate going on.  It also has a sense.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And as I give up on AT&T and switch fully to Android and T-Mobile, God bless them, I like  the plan, but the service doesn't work for where I live.  So I've got to decide between the Evo and the Incredible.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I like the big screen on the Evo.  Really, it's a choice between Verizon and Sprint, I think, at bottom.  I think the differences are small enough that it's really more about the carrier.  However, this...  One of them has unlimited data.  Yeah.  Why?  For now.  Sprint's cheaper.  Sprint's going to be cheaper.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Sprint's been doing it for a long time.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I like Sprint.  And I think because they're an underdog, they can't change quite as easily.  This is the email, the HTC Sense email.  It has a couple of features I like.  It has threaded conversations, just like Gmail.  Oh, nice.  But it also has a VIP group.  You can add context to the VIP group.  If they're in that, they get a special mailbox.  Now, of course, I could do this with rules.  But they get a special mailbox, which means I no longer miss emails from my mom.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, that's really nice.  It's really sweet.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's really, really nice.  And now, Gina, now the question is, are you and I on that list?  Yes, you are.  That is the question.  You are.  You are on that list.  It's too far away.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, you are on that list.  Everybody I work with is on that list.  So these are the emails I want to see.  So it's little things like that I think are pretty nice.  It doesn't have a unified inbox, which is a little frustrating.  But I can always go to the Google app for that.  Because you still get the Google apps.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  These widgets, though, I really like some of these widgets.  I like the widgets.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And there's Flickr integration, too.  Yeah, I like that widget there with the pictures of your...  The favorites widget.  Isn't that fantastic?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  How's the battery life that everybody's been screaming about?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is a bigger battery.  It's about, I think, 12% bigger than the Nexus One.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I've heard people say it just dies.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I think with 4G it might.  Yeah, with 4G you have to toggle that off.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, most likely you don't have it anyway, right?  Right.  So I do the same thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In fact, I'll talk a little bit, if you want, about battery conservation techniques for Android.  Because I'd love to talk with you about what you do, Gina.  But I've really done a lot of research on this, trying to find the best battery life.  This seems to have about the same as the Nexus One, maybe slightly better when I do the same things.  It's certainly...  All smartphones now, you have to nurse through the day.  You can't get them...  They're not going to go all day if you're not careful, right?  This is the messaging app, which I really...  Widget, I should say, which I really like.  A better music widget, much more usable.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, the music widget is really nice.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's got Cover Flow, which even the iPhone lacks.  Or maybe it's the iPad that lacks it.  Of course, none of my album art survived the transition, but at least if I had Cover Flow I could do it.  You had it. Yeah.  I don't know, I like the Evo screen.  I think for us old guys, Jeff, the legend...  It's the same resolution. It's just a bigger screen.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's a bigger screen, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it's more legible.  It's the large text edition of Android.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That screen is just on the edge of being too big.  It's perfect, but if it was any bigger I would feel like, okay, we're now in tablet land.  Yes.  You can just fit it in your breast pocket.  Yeah, I mean, that really kind of pushed it right to the edge there.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But that's what they should do.  The Dell thing that's coming out, I keep on forgetting the name.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That one's huge.  You don't want to look...  I mean, you've got to consider the dork effect of holding something too big to your head.  Too big or too small.  I used to work with a guy, David Borman, he's now the bureau chief at CNN Washington.  And this was in 94.  And it was a real status object to have the world's biggest watch and the world's smallest cell phone.  And he had a Sony cell phone that was this big and had a little thing that came off.  And he's a large man.  And he looked like such a nitwit holding this thing to his ear.  And I noticed he doesn't carry that anymore.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The Android open source project is AOSP.  The real Riley tells me on Twitter.  AASOP.  AASOP.  I knew it was something like that.  AOSP.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  AOSP?  Oh, they missed a bet.  The Android open source project.  They should have made it the Android source open project.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  AASOP would have been easier to say.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Then they'd have an acronym.  Then they got an acronym.  So we're all mad at AT&T.  AT&T sucks.  We think reading the tea leaves, which is a popular thing to do with Apple shows, but this is a Google show.  We can read tea leaves too.  That means an announcement on Monday from Apple.  What do you think about this?  Google says no to Windows.  Now I knew about this because Colleen Kelly, our engineer, just went to Google.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And she said to me, and I didn't say anything because I didn't know if it was secret, they aren't offering me a Windows machine.  I said, what?  Because she's a Windows lover.  No, I can only use Linux or Mac.  Now it comes out.  Interesting.  That's the new policy.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  See, I just immediately thought that whole report.  I was like, there's no way.  There's no way that they're banning Windows.  So I think there's a big difference between strongly encouraging your employees to use a certain setup and like absolutely banning an operating system.  So I mean, if a Google employee said I need a Windows machine in order to do this kind of development or do this kind of testing, are they really going to say no?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is this a yes?  Yes, apparently they are.  Apparently you have to go.  Well, now again, you're right.  I don't know if this is official or not, but what I read is you have to go to a committee.  That seems so weird.  I have to defend my use of Windows.  It does seem weird.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It seems weird.  It seems like a really kind of uncharacteristically bad move, I think.  I mean, nine out of ten of the personal computers in the world run Windows.  Do you think when you're creating a product, even if it's a web app, it would be a mistake.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're right.  It would be a huge mistake.  You got to eat your own dog food.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You do.  You have to eat your dog food and you have to run IE.  But the world runs IE.  Right.  I mean, whether or not that that's a good thing, I'm not saying that's a good thing at all, but that's kind of the reality.  And so you've got to experience your product the way most of your users are.  So that freaks me out a little bit.  I mean, most of the world is not using Mac or Linux.  I mean, the Linux desktop thing is particularly like, really?  Like the sales and marketing people at Google are using Linux.  I assume that they're going for the Macs.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Front office has to use Windows.  You know me.  I'm a Mac fan.  Some would say a boy.  But even here at the front office, they're using Windows because they all use QuickBooks.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, maybe it depends on the department.  If the argument was that it was it helped provide the vulnerability, your basic salesperson doesn't have access to anything that's going to make the company vulnerable.  But your programmer is, no?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you know, the whole vulnerability thing is like, oh, the story that ran said something like, oh, because of the, you know, the China hack thing.  But it's like they're not banning Flash.  Right.  I mean, that wasn't just a Windows thing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Steve Brewer, that chance.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, he did.  It seemed odd to me.  But now that you say that Colleen is, you know, as a new Google employee was kind of given the choice of Linux or Mac.  She was shocked.  I'm surprised.  I'm. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So this confirms at least that new employees, because, you know, when you go to a company, you get a computer, are being offered two, not three, but two choices.  Yeah.  Now she's going into engineering.  Her job is video streaming engineer.  So it might make sense that an engineer for their day to day computer would be given one kind.  And it doesn't say that she can't run Windows and emulation.  I mean, I don't know.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  OK.  I mean, I don't know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We didn't get into great detail.  I didn't want to pry.  But I thought that was really surprising.  And then when I see these news stories coming out, maybe it's true.  And not to mention, you know, that there are plenty of security.  I hate to say this, security holes.  And when and when it's not, it's not.  It's and boy, Microsoft was pissed.  Did you see the Microsoft blog where they said, no, well, actually, we're more secure.  We're the most.  I love it when they do this.  We're the most secure operating system in the world.  Everyone knows that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Of course they did.  Of course they are.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Of course you are, baby.  I'm sorry we hurt your feelings.  Oh, that's terrible.  Yes, you're very secure.  It's the funniest blog post I ever read.  It's like, what world are you living in?  We're the most secure operating system in the world.  Everybody agrees.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I shouldn't make fun of them.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It is so much fun.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You deal with that a lot in the newspaper industry.  You know all about that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It does strike me that the karma is getting really nasty on the West Coast.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, we're angry.  You know why? California is bankrupt.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is that what it is?  We're pissed.  Apple versus Microsoft versus Google versus everybody.  Something in the water, I know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And Microsoft's in Washington state and they're just hands off.  They're like, no, God, you guys are crazy down there in the Silicon Valley.  You're nuts.  What is going on?  You're right.  And they're, you know, the campuses.  Now, do you have any, is there any credence in this idea that Apple planted a fifth column inside of Microsoft?  And the reason that Microsoft's consumer division has gone, this is Rob Enderly said this, I think.  The reason that Microsoft's consumer division has gone so bad is that Robby Bach really was a secret Apple plant.  That can't be.  Talk about smoking something.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  There'd be laws against that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't think that Apple would plant a fifth columnist inside of Microsoft.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I love how it got so very V.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's so very V.  All right, let's take a break.  Come back.  All right.  So we talked, of course, about Google and the cloud and everything going on in the cloud verse with the great Gina Trapani and Jeff Jarvis.  We will have more for you in a moment.  But I do want to mention our cloud friends.  You know, Citrix has been cloud forever.  The remote access is there is their bread and butter and has been for more than a decade.  In fact, I started using GoToAssist, their remote assistance product, is about six years, seven years ago on the screensavers.  The latest GoToAssist Express is so slick, so fast, so good.  You could try it free for 30 days right now if you go to gotoassist.com slash twig.  This takes support and puts it in the cloud.  So you don't have to walk down the hall to your users.  You don't have to travel around your users.  You don't have to even be on the phone explaining stuff to them.  You just say you got a problem.  I did this with my mom.  She was having trouble.  I don't know.  I think Quicken was storing.  She said, where's my Quicken data?  I said, Mom, I'm on chat.  I'm Skype with her, actually.  And I said in Skype chat, I sent her the link to gotoassist.com with it and had the special ID built in it.  She clicked it literally 30 seconds later.  It's quick download.  I'm fixing the problem and say, oh, here it is, Mom.  It's right here.  This is so great.  If you're in professional remote support or support, you need remote access.  And this is the one to get.  GoToAssist Express.  It has all sorts of nice features, eight sessions at once, unattended sessions, if you wish.  Your clients don't have to have it installed ahead of time.  It's so quick to install that, boom, you're fixing it right away.  It'll tell you what operating system, what security software, all the software running in the background.  It works on PCs and Macs.  So I'm on Windows supporting Mom on a Mac.  I mean, it's just incredible.  It's the modern world coming to support.  Try it right now.  By the way, 128-bit SSL encryption, of course.  Free customer service 24-7, of course.  Go to gotoassist.com, G-O-T-O-assist.com slash twig, T-W-I-G, and you get 30 days free.  There are day passes for the casual support enthusiast, like the family support person.  But I think the monthly is going to be the way to go if you're in the business of support.  Go to assist.com slash twig.  We thank them for their support of this week in Google.  I loved your post, Jeff, on the FTC report on how to save journalism.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The FTC and the FCC both have these projects going on, and I testified at hearings for both.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, they didn't listen to you, obviously.  No, no, no.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  At the FCC, I had the joy of beginning my testimony with the word bababooey.  No.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I did.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I did.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What did they do?  Did they even know what you were doing?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They snickered.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's good.  I think it's a younger, hipper crowd now.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Because I was making a point about why they should butt out.  Look what they did to Howard.  So anyway, the FTC has another one of these hearings or workshops coming up on June 15.  So they released a 35-page discussion document, discussion draft.  And it was shocking to me in a few ways.  What it really does is it equates the future of journalism with newspapers,  and it tries to then save newspapers as they exist, which of course is not possible,  because they have to change.  The FTC did not try to align itself with the entrepreneurs and innovators and disruptors  who were going to create the future.  Evidence of that, in the entire 35 pages, they mentioned the word blog but once,  and that was only to make a parenthetical reference to buying ads on soccer blogs.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's so freaking clueless. I can't believe it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Unless we descend into a nation of bloggers.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Bloggers, how horrible. They're all in their jammies.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  See, I think we're back at this now.  It's back into a world of the controlled versus the uncontrolled.  Yeah.  Institutional versus the...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I guess it shouldn't surprise me that this is how government thinks, but...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, administration wants change, and you go...  What it really is, is that it develops the...  It's circling the wagons around each other.  It's the old institutions helping each other. It's not right or left here.  One of my commenters on the blog wonderfully called it,  not the conservatives or liberals, but the preservatives.  I love it. I love it.  The document didn't talk about...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's not the FCC, it's BHT. I got it. Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The document talked about technology only at the very end,  where they suggested things like looking at new note-taking technologies.  It made all kinds of suggestions about extending copyright and limiting fair use,  which would be awful.  They actually had the idea there, proprietary facts,  which is worse than the patent office.  They looked at subsidy in various ways, all of which are politically untenable.  But they looked at subsidies in terms of...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They want to tax people. No, this isn't a plan, though.  They're not really going to do that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Somebody suggested, right. No, this is going to happen.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But tax us on what? Technology?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Super electronics devices.  So I, just to be nasty, called it the iPad tax.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And then that money goes to keep Rupert Murdoch's business going,  just in case you were worried about it.  I'm down for that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's an absurd, absurd document.  And it's just...  You know, it's the right wing that's coming out, smashing it, too.  But I think that both sides should be just appalled at this,  that it's not about protecting the past.  And so what we see here, I think, is a larger question for us in government,  is that innovators and entrepreneurs and technologists  have no lobbying muscle in Washington.  And to a great extent, we don't give a damn.  But there are issues that affect us and thus the future of the country.  And I think we're going to find ourselves a weakness here.  Look at Google itself, that had no lobbying in Washington,  messed up for a long time, finally did.  We as technologists don't have it.  It's a discussion that we've had, you know, Gina, many times,  as you say, that the hacks just go around.  The hackers just go around.  But I think this is going to be an issue for us,  because at some point, something dangerous could be done.  Copyright could be extended for newspapers.  Fair use could be brought back in.  You know, bad things could happen out of Washington.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it's scary.  Now, to top this off, Danny Sullivan, poor Danny Sullivan,  was the guy who came up with the story.  Was it on Search Engine Land or was it on his own personal blog?  I think it was Search Engine Land.  About this woman who is suing...

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's two stories here.  There's the story and there's the meta story.  And the meta story ties to what you're saying,  because Danny, who is a great blogger, really good blogger,  broke the story, but all the mainstream media picked up the story...  And didn't credit him.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And didn't credit him in the least.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And he even stole his screenshot.  Yeah, that's how he says he knew it happened.  He says the Daily Mail has the story,  and he knows that it was his story  because they're using the screenshot he made without attribution.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Somebody else did the same thing.  The secondary layer is people will then quote the Daily Mail, not Danny.  Yeah, well, of course.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And last night, I think Kara asked Jobs,  what about saving journalism?  And he said, well, we don't want to descend into a nation of bloggers.  Oh!  And that was my quote, lest we descend into a nation of bloggers,  because bloggers don't actually break news.  It's like, actually, yeah, Danny broke the story.  He got totally ripped off.  They used his images.  This is legitimate journalism.  He saw a legal brief that no one else spotted, right?  Or a friend of his spotted it for him,  and he wrote up the story.  So it's infuriating.  Jobs had me in the...  I want to really hate him, but I don't.  I respect him very much, and he had me in the palm of his hand.  He does... I don't know, it's like these Jedi mind tricks.  He presents very well.  But when he says things like that,  we don't want to descend into a nation of bloggers.  I just want to kick him in the shins.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, hey, it could be worse.  It could be a nation of podcasters.  Think what that might be like.  That would be bad.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Someone who's such a visionary.  I mean, for him to be so...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It doesn't surprise me, because he was very dismissive of podcasts early on, too.  He thought very little of them.  Although, you got to...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think this goes back to the control versus the uncontrolled.  That's why Jobs and publishers are embracing each other,  because they want a controlled world.  But Mattel wrote a great post about just that, Gina,  that he respects the hell out of him.  But there were like three times in the talk he just wanted to strangle him.  And Mattel's line was,  Steve, we started as a nation of bloggers.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, good point.  The pamphleteers.  Very good point.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's all we are.  So you were going to mention what the understory was to that metastory.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it's kind of...  The understory isn't that.  It's one of those, you know, haha, what a funny story.  The metastory is really more interesting,  but the story is that a woman...  A woman named A. Sullivan, Search Engine Land,  who broke this story...  Because you know what?  We do the same thing.  I try to remember to attribute stuff,  but I often forget to say where the story came from and stuff.  So I feel like I do that too.  You know what?  Part of this, Jeff, isn't it just kind of...  It's the link economy.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Everybody just kind of...  Yeah, but I think it's part of what I have to teach here at journalism school.  That the provenance matters in a few ways.  It matters so that the reader can know where the source really goes to.  A. B. It matters about supporting the journalism at its source.  Because if he or she who gets the links monetizes them,  then the links are money.  Well, and I am a little torn,  because I'll read about something, let's say, on Hacker News.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I'm tempted to give the link to Hacker News,  because that's where I read about it.  But what I usually do...  And you tell me what I should do, Professor Jarvis.  I usually trace it down to where...  As far down as I can go.  And you know, if it's a Huffington Post just linking to somebody else,  I'm not going to give HuffPo the link.  Right.  I prefer that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Go to the source.  That's the ethical thing to do.  Yeah.  And it supports journalism at its source.  But I think in line with that, we journalists violate that,  as Danny demonstrates, right and left.  So we complain...  The Rupert Murdoch and Company complain about parasites.  Well, they're parasites.  And one of the funny things, back to the FTC for one boring second,  is when they talk about changing fair use,  they recognize that every damn journalist uses fair use.  TV is made to rip and read fair use.  You bet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And if they restricted fair use,

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  it would probably cut off much of the journalism business.  You use a phrase that I doubt anybody under the age of 40

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  knows these days, rip and read.  But that's how I became...  That made me feel old, Leo. Thank you.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But that's how I started, too.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Gina, do you know what rip and read is?  I don't.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Of course she doesn't, Jeff.  Of course she doesn't.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because rip and read goes back to the days  when you would get as a newsman  or a reporter in the news station,  you would get your news from this thing called a teletype.  They put them in a separate room  because there were four of them,  UPI, AP, Reuters, and Bloomberg or whoever,  and they'd be going,  spitting it out on old...  Talk about ground wood.  This stuff still had pieces of wood in the paper.  Rolls of wood...  Paper, rather, made out of wood.  And you'd go in with a ruler  and a number four pencil,  the softest pencil you could find,  and then you'd roll the ruler across it,  you'd rip the story off,  you'd do very minor markup to it,  mostly you'd just pre-read it to make sure you could pronounce the names,

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  and then you'd go on the air with it.  Are you like Yoda? Have you been alive for 800 years?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What was this?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This was very recent.  Very, very.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, okay, it was 30 years ago,

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  but it was relatively recent.  I'm going out right after the show and buying some Grecian formula.  So...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you'd rip it and you'd read it.  But now, remember, these radio stations, TV stations,  newspapers paid Associated Press,  paid UPI,  they syndicated material to them,  so at that point, attribution was...  You wouldn't say, oh, from the UPI comes a story, would you?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, and it was also argued that, of course,  you broadcast buffoons  would just rip the paper up and read it too.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, okay, maybe, once in a while.  So I'm still doing the same thing.  I'm like, you'll report.  I haven't done any enterprise reporting  since I was a younger man,  much, much, much younger.  But Danny did some,  and occasionally a blogger will do some enterprise reporting  and come up with something,  and he certainly deserves credit.  So the story is, how responsible is Google  for giving out bad directions on Google Maps?  Lauren Rosenberg is suing Google  in Utah  because she Googled walking directions  for a trip in Park City, Utah.  Google led her onto a highway  where she was hit by a car.  Oh, geez.  The...  Let's see.  The person who hit Rosenberg,  Patrick Harward, is being sued, as well as Google,  for damages in excess of $100,000.  So she used her BlackBerry  to get these directions,  and it said, walk along about half a mile  along the Deer Valley Drive.  Well, apparently, there's no sidewalk.  It's basically a highway.  She got hit.  Her lawyer...  You know, we're getting mixed signals from her lawyer.  Her lawyer is saying, well, it was dark,  and she couldn't tell it was a highway.  But aren't you a little bit responsible?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  A lot. You're a lot responsible.  And isn't there a disclaimer on Google Maps  that says, you know,  directions are approximate?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Except not on the BlackBerry.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, geez. Come on.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They left it off the BlackBerry.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I didn't notice it was a highway,  so I just followed what Google told me  on my BlackBerry at night, and I got hit.  So it's their fault.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Google's never lied to me before.  You know what? This is just deep pockets.  You're going to sue wherever you can.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, the next one you're going to see is,  I crossed the street while watching my iPad.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You distracted me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  As somebody in the chat room said, there's no fix for stupid.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Computers can do a lot, kids.  Yeah, she's going to sue the chat room next.  It ultimately comes down to your human brain  to make good decisions.  Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I did a laser tag  battle with my kid  and his friends on Monday,  and I turned on MyTracks.  We were up in the woods in Loma Mar in the Redwoods,  and I turned on MyTracks.  Oh, I want video of that.  Well, yeah, there's no video, but the MyTracks  did a great Google Map.  I love that app.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I walk a few miles or walk or run a few miles every day,  and I turn it on. It's fantastic.  You can export to CSV. You can bring it into a spreadsheet.  You can do like kind of like  charge your mileage. It's awesome.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So here's the, this is the laser tag plot  of me running around with my gun.  Of course, we're in the woods, so all you see is tree tops.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That is awesome.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But I know from that app that I ran, you know,  .7 miles, averaging five miles an hour.  I mean, it's really kind of cool.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That is performance art right there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's kind of a random walk.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's a great idea, Gina. Oh, Gina, it's a whole game.  Use it to make pictures.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Make pictures, yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's an interesting app on the Evo  that's an HTC Sense app called Footprints.  Have you played with that at all? Were you supposed to take pictures  as you go around?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, no, I haven't played with it. Oh, interesting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's kind of a neat app.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Back a couple of years ago, Yahoo  built these custom bikes that had like  a Nokia phone kind of built  into the handlebars and it had a motion  detector, so like, you know, they'd written this Python  script so that when you were riding the bike, it would snap  a picture every like minute  or something and upload it to Flickr  with Geo tagged. So  a few people got on the bikes. I got one. It was really  fun. But somebody had done that. It was during  the Obama campaign and  had drawn like the letters  Obama in the city of San Francisco. By riding around?  It was so neat. Yeah, with the images.  That's crazy. That's a lot of work.  It was really, really neat and really clever.  And that's what that reminds me of. And you really could do that  with my tracks. There is?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now, if you do Google Latitude, and we were talking  about the kind of potential privacy  issues with Latitude, but Google now has  a thing called location history. Have you seen this?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes. I don't know how to  feel about it. Have you turned it on?  Do you happen to be using Latitude?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm using Latitude, but history  is disabled on my account. So  I guess you have to... What the hell?  What the hell?  I'm turning it off. The man who closed his Facebook

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  account is now voluntarily handing  over his location information to Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Just a tip, kids. Though if you want to commit  a crime, you might want to turn this off  before so that  it's not offered in court. But now

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I can find out what the best restaurant in San Francisco is

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  tonight. I'll tell you where.  We have a 530 reservation.  Can my daughter... Hey, when's Jeff...  When's Jake graduating? Not until

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  the 24th. Oh, wow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They go a long way.  Abby graduates on Friday.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You're still on farming time. Yeah, we're in

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  farm country. Gotta get out there in the fields.  Yes, yep.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Gotta cultivate that pot.  That's

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  next, by the way.  I fully believe that  come September, or November rather,  that there is an initiative  in California that will legalize marijuana.  I fully believe we'll pass. We need the tax money.  We need the money. And I think they'll make a very  credible case that everybody's already stoned in California  anyway. And maybe that will  calm down the Google Apple rift.  Maybe that's the solution.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We'll get your Google  cafeteria stash.  That'll be good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, you get the free food and then on your way  out as you head to the segues, just pick up  a doobie. I'm sorry.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Free bongs. 420 free bongs.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Anyway, Google... Geez, we have  gone downhill here. Google  location history. Keep track of your  latitude location history. So this  will show you everywhere you have  been ever.  Because your phone's latitude,  this is the weird thing about...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Why would you want that? I'm fine with it. I have  no big objection, but what's the actual utility  to that? Beyond Gina saying  because you can and it's cool.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just this like... It's kind of like  I started using Foursquare and I really like it because  I just have this... I think Cory Doctorow  calls it myware versus spyware. Just  being able to look at where you've been. There's something  compelling. I mean, it's very navel  gazey. There's something compelling about  being able to look at a map of the world and be like,  I have been... It's the big world map with the  pins on it, right? This is where I've  been. Everybody does that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Have you seen Check In?  This is the next stage because, okay, you got  Foursquare now, Gina, and then you're going to do  Gowalla, right? Uh-huh. And then you're  going to have... Pretty soon...  Foursquare's the gateway drive, right? Every time you start...  You get somewhere. My wife thinks I'm nuts.  I pull out my phone and I start going,  what are you doing? I'm telling  everybody where I am.  So, BrightKite, which is  the loser in this, right? Everybody's going to these new  game things. BrightKite has created something  called Check.in  that checks you into all of them.  Oh, boy. M.Check.in.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, so how many are there? There's  Foursquare, Gowalla, and Latitude.  There's Whirl.  BrightKite. See, I've never heard of Whirl.  I think I've heard of BrightKite. There's more all the

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  time. BrightKite was one of the first.  And then there's the Yahoo one.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, the Fire Eagle stuff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I want to call it Flame Out, but it's Fire Eagle.  Yeah. Yeah.  But that ties into your...  Anyway, you asked the absolute right  question, Jeff, which is why the hell  would you use Google Latitude? Because  basically what you've done is you've turned on a  homing beacon that everywhere you go...  At least you check in with Gowalla.  You don't have to check in. Or for you, Gina,  if you don't want people stalking you, you check in as  you're leaving, which is my recommendation.  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I like the idea of doing it every midnight.  You check in for what that day held  in the past.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A lot of these won't let you do that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That makes sense to me as a safety issue.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you're right. I think that's a better way to do it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Gina, you've gotten over your hinkiness about  Foursquare?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I mean, I'm completely private,  and I only friend people who I would  invite over to my house. So I have a very small  friends who are close, real  life friends. So I get a lot of friend requests, and I  ignore them. Unless I really know you, then I don't.  And I don't check in at home. I have kind of rules.  I often check in just before I leave.  I don't check in at home.  I check in at  places kind of far away from where I live,  and not so much at places close to where I live.  That kind of thing. So I have kind of like these  little rules. But yeah, I kind of got over it a little  bit. I started to try it, and I...  It's kind of fun. It's kind of fun. It's really fun.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Has any benefit come to you in terms of saying,  oh, I didn't know that she was there?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's the idea that these are like urban hipsters  who then kind of  coagulate, right?  Oh, Gina's at my favorite bar.  I'm going to go down. But does that ever happen? Because you're an urban hipster.  It doesn't happen

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  in San Diego.  It has happened at conferences like at Google I.O.  I can see where people were near  the convention center.  It happens in New York. So this is what I really like.  I can watch. I have a lot of friends in New York,  because I live there my whole life. And so I can see  kind of all the new places that my friends go to.  So I'm like, oh yeah, I really want to go back to  Shake Shack, you know, when I go back to Manhattan.  I really want to go to Sandbar. So I create this kind of  mental to-do list of like, oh yeah, my friends have been  spending time at this place and I want to check it out  next time I'm there.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Don't you want the proscriptive version of Four Square  then that lets you organize  the rendezvous?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Using Four Square to organize a get together?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, you can't do that, can you?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I will be here at this hour  rather than I just got here.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. Like meet me there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Meet up. That's meet up, right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, meet up is about organizing  meetings about  chihuahuas.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's interesting. Is there anything proactive that you could

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's kind of obvious, isn't it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Obvious to you, Jeff, because you are a big brain.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I mean, yeah, just upcoming

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  or Facebook events or  Facebook is how to do that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  All you need to do is take Four Square and be able to  manipulate the clock both ways.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right, and say I'm going to be here for lunch.  Don't show the world where I am right now because it makes me

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  hinky, but the more  I can post-date that,  the happier I am to share more.  Right?  Let me easily do that and then also let me do  it prospectively  and say at noon  today I'm going to be at Shake Shack.  Who else?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That would actually be a really good use of it.  And then there's a business angle too because at some point

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Shake Shack says if you can prove  that you brought ten friends,  I'll give you a free burger.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  See, now you're talking. That would be really cool.  That would be super cool.  I'm sure these are obvious

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  models that are coming along because...  Yeah, they're coming along.  Starbucks was giving a buck off  of Frappuccino to the mayor of  the local Starbucks, things like that.  That's not enough.  More and more you're going to see coupons and all of that stuff.  So a couple  of big stories we should whip through here  very quickly.  Google vice president  says Chrome OS is coming out in the  fourth quarter.  Really?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, you're...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know. I got Android. What do I need Chrome?  I don't understand why I need Chrome OS.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I want to have a small  device that's not a tablet.  It's a netbook.  I do not want Windows. It's that simple.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But Android gives you...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, I see. Why do I need  Chrome versus Android?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Really, if you like the browser, just sit in the...  Don't ever close the browser. That's all Chromium  is really, or Chrome is.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Chrome OS really was a bet on netbooks.  In a tablet world,  the netbooks already seem  anti- even though I love mine, they already  seem a little bit out.  It shows you the fastest stuff moves, doesn't it?  Things are really  demove. I don't know. Chrome OS on my  netbook?  I'm interested to see. I like what they  had to say. When asked  about Chrome OS  versus Android, they said,  we're going to put them both out in the market and see what does better.  Why not?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You got more PhDs than God.  You might as well just release stuff.  See what happens.  Got to do something with that 20% time.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The problem with that is if you start to get forked development,  people are developing for one platform, not the other,  or it's too expensive to deal with Google because you've got to develop for two platforms.  That's a problem.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  If you're developing HTML5, they work anywhere.  If you're building web apps,  which is what they want you to do at Google I.O.,  made it pretty clear they're going to work everywhere.  I do have to say, I think in one sense,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I agree with you, Jeff, because one of the  problems Android's going to face is there are too many  phones. They come out too fast. There's too many  updates and consumers go,  it's too confusing.  There's too many SKUs. Or worse, I'm afraid  I'm going to buy something and it's going to be outmoded before I get it home.  Or that's one of the

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  reasons, oddly, not to buy the  newest phone is because it doesn't have the newest OS.  Right. That's what's holding me

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  back on the I.O.  I want to ask a question here.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  By the way,  I haven't done the manual  downloader for you. What I'm hearing and what I'm  afraid of is that then I will not  get automatic updates hence.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know about that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't know about that either.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think you will.  I don't think it matters.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't think it matters either.  I wouldn't worry about it. Well, I mean, you could  wait for the over-the-air update. It's probably going to come soon.  They said the next few weeks. I'm surprised it hasn't come yet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, and it lies to me. I go there and I say,  update. No, you're up to date. No, I'm not.  There's more stuff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'll be honest,  as nice as Froyo is,  it's not something like you're going to go,  wow. Really?  It's definitely faster, but  day to day,

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  the keyboard was better.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know. Have you noticed a better keyboard, Gina?  I guess it doesn't have that weird loss of  doesn't have that weird thing where it starts to get crazy.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I use the

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Shapewriter. Oh, that's right. You don't know.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, I'm not even sure. Actually, I like the

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Evo keyboard better. It's a little noisier.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It is a little noisier.  It is a little bigger. The Evo keyboard is  like the keys feel bigger.  Maybe is it because the screen is bigger? I don't know.  But it does feel

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I've noticed with the Android keyboard  versus the Apple, because I'm still using both,  is that the iPhone has  spaces around the keys.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You can hit the middle space and not have it do something.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a lot easier. I'll be honest.  It's a lot easier to use the iPhone, I think.  The Evo is closer,  though. Much closer. And it has  some nice stuff like you press  and hold and it will default  to caps or you'll get the default punctuation.  So it's a little faster to type.  You know what 2.2 adds,  it's a little subtle, but I really like,  is if you type a word it doesn't know,  it will give you an opportunity to add that word to your  dictionary. Hallelujah.  It will finally know my name.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I've yelled at it four times in a row.  If I don't hit the red  thing, it'll keep telling me  you're wrong, Jeff. You're wrong, Jeff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know what I don't like about the Evo is it has arrow  keys on the keyboard instead of the little  trackball for the cursor movement.  I don't know if I like that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's not so good.  The magnifying glass thing that the iPhone OS does  is definitely superior here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Everybody should do that.  Maybe it's patented.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's patented, yeah. Yeah, I'm sure that it's patented.  It is definitely much better executed than  the select text mechanism

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  on Android. But I do prefer  the Android guess.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, the subjective  text is better. Definitely.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You can see very clearly what's coming,  what's going to be guessed and you can modify it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So Leo, you're probably going to buy

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  an Evo. I think so.  I'm told that the Evo is going to update to 2.2  pretty quickly, but of course we thought that  Nexus One would update quickly.  The problem with updating these HTC  Sense devices is they have to update  Sense as well. So it's kind of, it's not  up to Google, it's up to HTC.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Gina, when your month is up, will you  subscribe to Evo?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's right. You get the phone free  but you still have to pay for it if you're going to keep it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, because you get 30 days free service and then once the 30 days  are up, you're done.  You know, I'm in a contract, I just have to look up  to see how much it's going to cost to get  out of my T-Mobile contract because I have a contract

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  with T-Mobile. Oh yeah, I did the month to month on  T-Mobile. I paid the full  freight so I could get out.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh right, so that you could do that. See, that was smart.  Yes, I paid a lot of money. I paid the

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  penalty upfront.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So you paid, right. So I have to  look into it. I'm tempted. I mean, you know, the Evo is  really, really nice. It is nicer than the Nexus  One. I'm not sure if it's so  much nicer that I'd be willing to pay the extra and get out of the contract.  The old UVU homework. You have to get an incredible as soon as possible because I want to hear your comparison.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay, Tony upstairs has an incredible.  Like I said, I've played with it and love it.  And if I, you know, if we're  choice between the Nexus One and the incredible, I'd definitely  get the incredible because it's just a better Nexus  One, right? With the OLED  screen and everything. So really,  again, it comes down to Verizon  Sprint, doesn't it? Or Verizon  T-Mobile Sprint. Well, that comes down to the models as well.  Well, I mean,  if, look, if carriers didn't matter,  I would say this.  I think this bigger screen does make  a big difference. So if they get  this to 2.2, I would  and by the way, you don't have to use HTC  Sense. You can use the standard Google Launcher  if you want. So  you're not stuck, but you still get to  keep the widgets and so forth.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, really? How do you? Where do you

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  have that? It's just the default launcher.  So, you know, in the settings,  you can say what the program defaults

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  are. Yeah, yeah.  So you just go to launcher and, oh, interesting.  You go to applications, HTC

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Sense, and you say, forget  the defaults. And then the next  time you exit out, it'll say,  well, do you want to use launcher or  Sense? And then you can use launcher and it looks just  like the, you know, standard Google  experience. The standard Android. So that's kind of nice.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You have that choice. But you get to keep the widgets,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  which I like. The widgets I think are  better and I wish the HTC would just release  those for sale on the marketplace.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. Andy Rubin

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  said, told the Mercury News that  they're not, they're going to go to a once a year  update, which kind of does respond to that issue  of over updating  Android.  Is that a disappointment to you?  I think it's a disappointment. I'd like to see. Yeah, I want to

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  know the product's always getting better. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So here, Gina, I'm going, I'm  going scrolling down to HTC Sense.  And then  you've been here before. And then, you know,  right here it says clear defaults. Right, clear

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  defaults. Right, right. So

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  you force stop it  so that it's not running.  And then you clear the defaults.  And then now  when I hit home, it's going to say, whoa, do you want  to use Sense or Launcher? Wow, nice.  If you say use Launcher by default.  Now you have to redo all your  widgets because the Launcher doesn't know anything about.  But now we're back to a standard Google phone.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, okay. Okay. Oh, right.  There's a standard power widget.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is a Sense wallpaper. I like it. It's a live  map. This is one of the live wallpapers.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, nice. Yes.  I haven't seen that one. Yes, I love it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That must hog battery. Oh, God.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that must hog battery.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, you can leave the GPS  off and then it doesn't know. The map's wrong, but  at least...  Wow, it's a map. But it is a map.  In fact, it is wrong right now. I don't  think this is not where I am.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, I actually  I like to release early and often.  But at the same time, I think a once a year  release cycle is sane.  And I also, I mean, when it's once a year  and you're getting a new release, you kind of expect  it to be significant.  You know, God help Kevin Purdy,  my coworker at LiveHacker who's  writing the Android books. That's true. I mean, it's so  tough for him, you know, between all the different  handsets and all the different, you know,  builds and now, you know,  the different UIs. It's tough to kind of keep  up with. I mean, you know, the Androids,  you know, it's not a consistent experience. Well, that's Gina.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's because you write your code  by hand. See, when you handwrite  code,  it really, it just adds  a little extra work.  My suggestion, get a text editor.  This was my

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Memorial Day. I kind of like overloaded  on screen time. I just sat down  with my notebook and just started sketching  out code. It's very,  very satisfying to write in a notebook.  And I just want to write in code. And  I got a lot done after I did that  little jotting session there. You didn't type

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  the code in.  This is how Neil Stevenson writes his programs,  actually.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I was just defining interfaces. Like, I wasn't,  you know, I wasn't writing like the meat of the  body of the methods. This is thinking, though, which is  great. It's just thinking. It's just sketching out and thinking.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Sometimes we type too much and think  too little. So I don't think this is so bad.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think better with a pen. I love that feeling of like  the pen against paper. I still carry  a notebook and a pen. I, you know,  even though I've got my Android phone  and my laptop and stuff, I just,  you know. Daniel Book says you got to

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  get monospaced paper, though.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then someone said, I like your version control because I date  every page of my notebook. It's  531. You know exactly

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  when you wrote this. This is version 69  from 531.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Of course. That's  page 69. Oh, page? But that same thing.  Look at that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's so funny. She writes,  she thinks in Java. No, it's  PHP. Is it PHP? It's PHP,

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  but PHP 5. It's just like Java.  It looks so much like Java now.  Especially if you use PHP Documenter,  it has that same Java doc  format. And I'm using Eclipse.  So like if you open up on my PHP file,  it looks like Java. It's amazing.  Jeff, I apologize.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  A little geek out

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  moment there. Just ignore us.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Totally. But PHP file, like  extract file.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Interface is the whole thing. I'm loving PHP.  So yeah. Okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You don't hear that a lot. I'm loving PHP.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You don't. PHP doesn't get  the love it deserves.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  PHP. How many languages  do you speak?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  As many as I can Google  code snippets for.  There you go. That's the key, isn't it?  I mean, I  would say two or three that I feel  pretty proficient in. But I'm kind  of a copy and paste, teach myself,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  read the docs. And they're all variants of C.  So if you kind of know C, you know Java,  Python, Perl's not a variant of C.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, and program C in graduate school. So you can  you know, you can apply that knowledge

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  elsewhere. If you start with C, you're all right.  You're good. You're good to go.  All right. Let's  get our tip tool and  number of the week  and wrap this thing up. Boy, this has been a fun show.  I'll tell you.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This is my highlight of my week, guys.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You sent that in your email, Jeff, and I thought that  was very kind. Because frankly, we feel  so grateful to have you  and Gina as part of the network  and to be able to do this show with you. I  feel like I should be sending you guys  massive checks or something. I just  or at least a fruit basket.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You sent us a slanket.  That did it for me. Oh, yeah. I sent  you a slanket. You got me for years.  And you can't get

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  those anymore. They're valuable.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Limited edition slankets. I mean, come on.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think you should sell Leo Laporte branded  seat balls.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know what, actually, it's too bad Colleen left because  that was a project on her. Really?  Very, very long list. Yeah. We were going to  put Leo Laporte branded bounties  because I don't know, but  I don't have any stats to back this up.  But every time I meet somebody now, they say, oh, yeah, I sit on a  ball, too. It's like I think I've  I hope to God it's like not like Steve  Martin with the glasses thing. Like  it's going to cause some sort of horrible  spine damage in 15 years.  And all these people are going to sue me.  At least I'll have it to.  Your tip of the week,  Tripani.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This week, really simple. Everyone  knows that Google has a PDF  viewer, right? So if you get a PDF  attachment in Gmail, you can say you can click  on the view link and it opens up in this  browser based viewer.  Well, I got a couple of emails about this week. I don't think there was  an actual blog post about it anywhere.  But there's a new link there that says save to  Google Docs. So you click on the save to  Google Docs and it moves the PDF right into your  Google Docs account, you know, where you can save files.  So it's kind of simple one click way  to add PDFs to your Google Docs account.  Wow.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Gina, I've had the weirdest thing also this week.  Every time I've tried to open the PDF that's been  attached to an email and it would open up in that viewer,  it won't open up.  Really? No. I don't know why.  It's not like I get a new version  of Gmail or something. Yeah, did it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Was it not rendering at all or was it just like  white? Well, it just tells me it can't.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And so, you know, it's the new version  of Chrome. I don't know if that's what it is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I love Chrome. Strange.  I'm having a love affair with Chrome, I confess.  I just, it's so fast  and it just, I just love it.  Yeah, Chrome is pretty fantastic.  It loves it. I don't know what that's about, Jeff.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I just tried that before  although I was using Firefox. Now I'm going to try  it right in Chrome while you do your number.  And I'm trying to find somebody's, nobody  sends me PDFs anymore.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How do you get somebody to send you a PDF?  No, you work in my business. Don't send me  PDFs. Please.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm trying to find somebody's, nobody sends me  PDFs. Please.  PDFs let me control the look and the  feel.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  PDFs are pretty useless, right?  For the most part. But every once in a while you get that  PDF, like, you know, like manuals.  I used to very diligently file away  my paper manuals from my gadgets. You can  find them online as PDFs. You can save new Google Docs  account and save some file, you know, file a cabinet  space.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it's better than a .docx  file or something like that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, that's true. If you do a  search for has attachment in  Gmail.  Has colon attachment.  I love it when she does this.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's just so hot.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That will give you all your email with  attachments.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Not only that, it's suggesting, it's actually  suggesting has attachment. That's so cool.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Has attachment and then you can put  PDF. So I should say

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  has attachment PDF?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, has attachment space PDF.  And also you just PDF files.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Searching.  Okay, good.  Here's a PDF file.  Yep. So I can view it.  Now I'm in Chrome, the latest Chrome 4  Macintosh, and it views it.  Somebody's  resume. I won't show the rest of it.  But there's a save in Google Docs  link right there. This is really  sweet here.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So I'll be honest, I'm not a big fan of PDFs,  but I got like three separate emails from different  listeners telling me how excited they were that they  could finally save their PDFs to their Google Docs account.  So hence the tip.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Save in Google Docs.  Saving. Very nice.  And then it just shows up.  Your Jarvis of the Week.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Number of the Week is 71%.  Pew did  another one of its wonderful surveys. They really  are the  incredible source of great data  that we'll use in the history books in the future about how the internet was made.  So Pew looked at young people  on social networks and found that 71%  of young people, that is to say  young adults, 18 to 29,  have changed the privacy  settings on their profiles to limit what others can see.  And so all this argument that most  people just go with the default.  At that age, they actually  trust it less, they're savvier,  they do more.  Compared to 55% of people,  50 to 64.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's really good news.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it is.  And as usual, have more faith in our young than  media people would have you have.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Like me, because that's one of the reasons I quit  is I thought, oh, my kids don't get it.  I don't want to encourage anybody to use Facebook  because they don't understand how to make it private.  Good.  Well, my pick of the week is something  I've been waiting for for a long time. Audible has finally,  I don't know actually if it's coming from Audible  or from Google,  because it is in a Google code database,  has finally put out a beta of  Audible for  Android.  Android, and this is it.  It downloaded the beta. The beta is free.  You log into your Audible account.  All of your titles are there.  You can download them  right to the phone. You don't have to hook it up to a computer.  You can search by title,  by author, by length,  recent.  It has a lot of nice features.  This is actually, I think, one of the sweetest  Audible applications I've ever seen.  Audible News is there. You can even get  stats. Obviously, whoever  wrote this is one of us.  Yeah.  So, how many, and you get,  by the way, they've got a little game  in here. You can be an Audible master, Audible scholar,  Audible pro, Audible novice, or Audible  newbie. Newbie based on how much Audible  you've listened to. Smart.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Is it in the market,  Leo, or do you need to download the beta?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It is not. Look, they have  trophies just like Foursquare. They've got badges.  I love badges.  This is really,  this is very,

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I have been. Foursquare totally got me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, this will show your total Audible  listening time today, daily, monthly.  I mean, I've never seen an Audible app like this.  This is like the best app I've ever seen for Audible.  Your Audible titles, how many  you've got. This is just so cool.  So, thank you.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  In latitude, you don't know what you were listening  as you were walking in that place.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes, that's all I need. Let's do a mashup,  a Google Map mashup.  If you listen to audiobooks, you know  this already though. I, when I, if I  go by a spot that I was listening to  audiobooks, I know  what I was listening to and vice versa.  Isn't that weird?  It's very strange. The brain does some strange  things. So that's not just me. You do that too.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh yeah. Yeah, I've done it with you.  I've been listening to a podcast.  And this corner reminds  me that Leo said blank. You know,  it's weird. That is so strange.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I was, when I was memorizing  my lines for some of the videos I did for Fast  Company, I talked to my editor who used to do  some acting who said that when you try to memorize  things, you should put your body in a different  position or go to a place that you don't normally go  because your brain kind of creates  these like synapses, right?  Like, create these connections between those

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  things. So what they've done is  they've created a Google group for the Audible  for Android beta.  So it's free to join. You do have to join  it. There are currently only 381 members,  but I bet that number goes up a little bit.  Up right now, yeah. And  they've been putting out builds. The most recent build is  May 28th. Of course, there's all the usual disclaimers,  but it does seem to work  fine. And by the way, it does work over 3G  if you should choose.  So this is pretty awesome.  And this is  for only for, I'm sorry to say,  Audible in the US.  Audible UK DE  and FR. It's  not going to work for you, but they do plan international  versions soon.  Really a slick, I don't  know. Is it Google who did this? I don't know.  Whoever did this, they've done a great job.  And I haven't had trouble with 2.2.  I'm running on 2.2 right now. When people

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  rush to download that from our show,  then it will prove to Audible that this is a good market for

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  us. You know, that's right. Why aren't they advertising  on this show? That's a very  good point. They think that people  who use the cloud don't read.  Something. I don't know.  Jeff Jarvis  is the man behind BuzzMachine.com.  You should be reading this blog. I know he's just a blogger,  but look, he's not in his jammies.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He's also  written

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  some actual books. In fact,  his new book, you just signed the deal.  I can't wait. It's called Private  Parts. No, Public Parts.  It's the response to private parts.  In a way. You know, I just  put 2.2 together with that. I didn't realize  that's kind of a little play on the  homage there. A little homage  to Howard.  I hope it doesn't sue you.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The most public person there is.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Congratulations, Jeff. That's awesome. Isn't that great?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I cannot wait to read it.  I can't wait to write it. Yeah, you don't have to wait.  Read his blog. It's all there.  BuzzMachine.com. And of course, what would Google  do is the current book.  Gina's current book is  the Complete Guide to Google Wave at  CompleteWaveGuide.com. You must get  it if you use Wave.  The nice thing is it's a PDF, so you can  update it. Yes,

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  you can update it. And it's free  on the website, which also gets updated. That's a  wiki. And we're going to have  the EPUB file.  It's available on the Kindle if you search on  Amazon. And we're going to have the EPUB file  available very, very soon.  Yay. Yep. Yep.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And of course, Gina's  site is SmarterWear.org.  But you see her on Lifehacker and  Fast Company and all sorts of other places too.  I hope you will join us for the show.
