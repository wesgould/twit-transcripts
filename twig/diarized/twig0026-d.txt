It's time for Twig, This Week in Google, the show that covers all of the latest news from not only the Google but from the cloud.  Joining us now from Germany, where he is...  Are you there for the G7 Summit?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, I'm here for a conference called DLD run by Borda, which is the big publisher in Germany.  And it's really quite a good conference every year.  So here I am. Then I go on to Davos, where I hope to call in next week.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is really exciting. Jeff Jarvis, jet setter, blogger at BuzzMachine.com, journalist guru.  And that's, I'm sure, why you go to conferences like this.  Is this the same in Germany?  Well, I'll ask you that in a second.  But first, let's say hi to Gina Trapani, who's also here, another proto blogger, founder of lifehacker.com.  She blogs these days as smarterware.org as well as Lifehacker.  And has a crushed cup from a submarine.  Yes, that was cool.  It was pretty cool.  Gina was part of a...  I don't know why the Navy did this, but they invited a bunch of bloggers to go on a submarine.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It was pretty amazing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm so jelly.  And then you must have gone out because you wouldn't have have a crushed cup.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, we went out and we dove down about 600 feet down.  So, I mean, not only am I one of the few, you know, civilians who have ever gone down and out on a submarine,  but I'm one of the few women because women don't serve on submarines.  So it was pretty, pretty exciting.  Wow, that's neat.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think there was a Jerry Lewis movie about that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A woman on a submarine?  Something like that.  Wasn't it a pink?  It was like a pink submarine.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  God, I wish you hadn't dredged that memory up.  Who should play you?  I'm thinking Ava Gabor for the...  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  So, I've been on an active duty sub before and they cover up everything so you can't see it.  I mean, they have hoods that they put over everything and they never contemplated taking you out to sea.  So that's a big change for the Navy.  That's kind of neat.  It was huge.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It was huge.  We saw everything.  I mean, I had a video...  I was in the control room while we were doing the dive and I had a video camera going and they said to us,  hey, we'll let you know if something's classified and we don't want you to take a picture.  But I got tons of pictures and videos.  It was kind of amazing.  They were really open, much more open than I thought they'd be.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It just shows the power of the blogger that these groups are aware of the great PR value of taking a few people...  Because it used to be that they always joke about bloggers, oh, it's some fat guy in the living room with a neck beard and his jammies.  And it's really changed the attitude towards blogging.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Definitely.  Definitely.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think it's right too.  It's correct.  So what is the German attitude towards the end of the newspaper industry, Jeff?  Oh, Jeff, you're sitting on your mute button.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Hello.  Am I there?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it's back.  OK.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's getting rough here because they're trying to go after Google.  And there are those who are smart in this industry who are saying that's a stupid thing to do.  And there are those who are now kind of giving up and are trying to figure out what's what.  So now we've had the German government going after Google for antitrust, which I think is absurd, but that's started by the publishers.  Publishers are threatening to pull out of Google.  It's a bit of swords.  What's going to happen this week, Dave Drummond from Google, who's the chief counsel, is going to be here at this DLD conference with the top publishers,  including Berta and Axel Springer and others.  And I'm told that maybe there might be some conciliatory talk, but we'll see.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Neely Crows is back.  It's kind of interesting.  She was the European Commissioner for Competition and was the one who went after Google and Microsoft and others and Intel, too, I believe.  Then she retired and now she's being invited back to run technology to be the commissioner of technology.  So if Google felt a sigh of relief when Neely retired, I think she's back.  I don't know.  One of the reasons that they interviewed her, one of the reasons that they asked her to serve as the technology commissioner is because she's pro net neutrality.  She's got it seems like she's got some pretty maybe it's pro consumer ideas to the detriment of of big companies like Google and Intel and Microsoft.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They have, you know, they have different attitudes in Europe about privacy than we have in the US.  I wrote a column in The Guardian a week ago about what I said was the right to link.  And if you think about it, what's public is public.  And we in the public have a right to comment on it and link to it and talk about it.  And if you try to take away that right to talk about what's in public, if you enable Google, if you if you tell Google they can't do Street View,  because you might catch somebody going into an opium den.  Right.  What happens when a journalist catches a politician right into that opium den?  It's tricky, isn't it?  It's very tricky.  And the kind of knee jerk response about privacy and against America and against big companies, not saying they're all anti-American, but but there is a bit of a knee jerk response.  It takes Google up like tuna in the net.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Unfortunately, you know, that came up in Secretary of State Clinton's speech.  On Thursday on Internet freedom, she was saying we can't have anonymity on the Internet.  And then somebody quite reasonably stood up and said, yeah, but what about whistleblowing and, you know, battered women?  And she said, well, and then she said, well, you're right.  That's why this is difficult.  What was the reaction to Hillary Clinton's speech on Thursday?  Did they just see anything while you were there?  Not enough.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I mean, I left Friday to come here, so I didn't maybe see much.  I wanted to listen into it.  I didn't have a chance to, but I wanted more reaction to it.  The only thing I saw was the Chinese government of coming there and saying, how dare you criticize us?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What did you think of the speech, Regina?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I missed it.  I'm feeling I'm feeling very bad.  I tried to watch it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was morning time, our time.  It was breakfast time.  And I watched it as I was getting the kids ready.  And it was a very, very bland political speech, I thought.  But if you read between the lines, it was a little bit of saber rattling.  And I can understand why the Chinese government was a little perturbed by it, because, I mean, she called out China.  She said, you know, we can't be can't be hacking our companies.  And it was interesting, Jeff, because the Chinese response didn't come from a high ranking Chinese official.  It came from a guy who was like the director of the Online News Association in China.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I love that you're doing Kremlin ology now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it is Kremlin ology.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It is great. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So, I mean, it was it was on Xinhua, which is the official Chinese news agency.  So it was, you know, if you do the Kremlin ology, well, they didn't want to have a high ranking official say it.  But they wanted somebody to say it.  And they certainly provided the channel, which gave it the official imprimatur.  Yeah, it's interesting.  It's like they're testing the waters.  And really what he said was it's no it's not the US's business is no other company's business.  How China runs its politics, runs its country and runs its Internet.  And he said the US has no right to criticize us for how we run our Internet.  The implication being, well, look at how you know, look to your own the mode in your own eye or whatever it is, whatever the biblical quote would be.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, that's just the issue.  Is it their Internet? Is it our Internet?  Right. Whose Internet is it?  Back to that idea that it's no one's Internet.  Rebecca McKinnon, who covers China very well from her blog, talked about the idea of a the need for an Internet Constitution.  I thought about that.  I was going to blog about it.  I didn't. And I thought, I'm not sure I want a Constitution, but I do want a Bill of Rights.  And I think at some point we have to start to codify what we think are the rights of the Internet.  John Perry Barlow wrote a wonderful, rousing call to people of the Earth on behalf of the Internet saying that the governments should stay out of it.  Quite some time ago, it was actually written in Davos in the 90s.  And it was kind of the Declaration of Independence of the Internet.  And that took us to the point of understanding this is very different.  But we also do need, I think, some codification of our rights.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it's also caused some real infighting.  I know at the EFF where Barlow is a founder and a member of the board, because on the other hand, if the government doesn't get involved to protect net neutrality, who does?  It is a form of regulation.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a mess. It's a very difficult thing to talk about.  So a couple of stories in the Google verse this week, a big one, and I don't know if it's just a rumor.  Businessweek had it or if it's really going to happen.  My sense is it's true is that Apple is talking with Microsoft to replace Google as the search engine on the iPhone.  They want to have Bing in there.  Yeah, no kidding, boo.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So for a company who's so dead set on making the user experience absolutely perfect.  Does Bing really provide the best search experience out there?  I mean, this is clearly, this is true.  This is clearly politics.  It's a competition thing.  Yeah.  Sure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This could be, you know, for a long time, Eric Schmidt served on the Apple board.  There was clearly this nice, friendly, collegial relationship.  And then it's the phones that have finally gotten them at each other's throats, I think.  Yep, absolutely.  And, you know, the lack of multi-touch in the droid and now the Nexus One has to be because of Apple,  whether Google's afraid Apple will sue them over the patent or Apple asks them to,  but it has to be about Apple and it's a big liability on the Nexus One not to have multi-touch.  And then Apple's shot across the bow saying, we're going with Bing.  That's not going to make anybody happy.  That's terrible.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There's going to be revolt.  If they try to do that in any...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It might be good for Google.  It might be one of those things that pushes people away from the iPhone towards the Nexus One.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Don't you love Google being the underdog?  Yeah, not for long.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So are you still, you're in Germany.  Are you using the Nexus One?  I mean, it's a GSM phone.  It's a good phone for...  Well, nice.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Here's the problem.  I have a UK SIM with Orange.  I put it in when I landed this morning.  And it does phone only no data.  I was with Dan Dubnow who does GadgetOff and he had his T-Mobile SIM from the US, phone, no data.  That's a real problem.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's funny because T-Mobile is Deutsche Telekom.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  And for being here until Tuesday morning, it's not worth it for me to buy an on-demand.  I'll probably in Switzerland, I'll buy a Swisscom SIM and try that.  But no, right now the hotel Wi-Fi is 20 euro.  I'm not going to sign up for that.  So no, I'm not using it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and here's the sad thing.  And the iPhone would have worked fine.  I mean, you would have had to...  I have it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I have it with me.  I have not abandoned my iPhone.  I am loyal.  You got a reason.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And now you have a strong reason.  I mean, that's a big one.  I thought...

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that is a big one.  I thought it would work.  But even if the iPhone searched Bing by default.  Yeah, then what?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Then what?  You know, I put the Bing app on my iPhone and it's not bad.  I don't think people would...  To be honest, most people probably wouldn't even notice it.  And where would it be?  Would it be in the browser?  Would it be in Safari?  Is that where we're talking?  Or is it phone wide?  I guess there is a phone wide search that pulls up a Google result.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, there's the Google app on the iPhone, which is actually is better, ironically,  than the Google phone.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, really?  Do you think?  What makes it better?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Just because it's kind of all there.  So I can get from the Google app in the iPhone, I get maps and search and news and images  and translation and everything.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, Gina, you're going to have to school Mr. Jarvis, I'm afraid.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's just sad.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But the irony is that Google didn't do as good a job with its own app in Android as it did in the iPhone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's because it's not an app.  It's built into the Android.  Jeff, you've got to press that little search button in the lower right hand corner.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  OK, you tell me how do I easily get to news on the Android?  Well, look, I did that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I just typed in pizza by pressing the search button.  It finds phone contacts.  Yes, but it also has search maps for pizza.  It has Pizza Hut dot com website.  Search the web for pizza.  More Google results.  Let's see.  Let's see if there's news.  Wait a minute.  Let's see.  Here's Google.  Three additional results.  Let's see.  Well, Chris, maybe there's not any pizza news.  I should have said something more newsy.  But that so you would get news right away in the.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  So if I go to the Google app and I get my apps, mail, calendar, Docs, talk, Gmail, calendar,  latitude, Docs, talk, tasks, reader, Google 411 news, book reader, notebook, photos or kit.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I get all of that too.  I get all of that too.  Where?  Well, it pulled up the Google page.  That's why.  That's the difference.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it's not in the app you're saying.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the only thing is I think it's it's it's you know, if you if the irony to  me of this is that Google didn't understand the power of its own brand and its services  when it came to Android.  That's interesting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hmm.  I don't think they have a Google app.  Do they have an app on?  No, they don't.  No, because it's all kind of incorporated.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think it's in there, but we don't know where it all is.  Hmm.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, besides the widget, you know, the search widget, which comes on the home

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  screen, I turned that off because it does the same functionality as far as I can tell.  It's just pressing the search as pressing the search.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, the magnifying glass.  And it takes up a lot of space.  Right.  Yeah.  I mean, that's interesting.  I hadn't I don't search news very much on my phone, I guess.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Jeff's a more newsy kind of guy than you and me.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, he's a news guy.  I love him.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He does the local search.  Great, though.  I mean, it does.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And it does.  The other problem I'm having, since I'm doing my Android, my Nexus One thing, is battery  life has really sucked.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It takes some real management on the battery life.  For one thing, I don't know how Gina leaves her motion wallpapers on because that'll drain  your battery in an hour.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I guess I don't stray far from home for very long.  Yeah, no kidding.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  One thing you have to know is that black uses less power than white on an OLED screen.  So if you have any interface that you can change to white on black versus black on  white do, that'll hugely impact the power.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So I have my university office has crappy reception.  That could drain it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  When it's trying to look for the antenna, that really drains it badly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So another thing to do, and I leave this widget on all the time, it usually is on, I think,  by default is this this this the wireless widget, you could disable some of these things.  So whenever I don't need Bluetooth, I'll disable that.  I'll turn off.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think I can't disable, which I want to do.  If I want Wi-Fi at my office, I want to disable the cell radio.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, you can't.  There's no way to do that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, yeah, you're right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I guess you have to go to airport mode and then I turn it off.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, you got your Wi-Fi back on.  The only thing I'm told is you can say tell it to go to 2G, but you think you want to  be able to just turn off.  That's a good point.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You can't.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, the power control widget could could use that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It could be better.  It could be better.  Well, you know, this is all good input.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I've passed my return period, so I know.  You have.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So you're keeping it.  I'm going to blame you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jeff, I'll send you a check.  Your money gladly refunded by Leo if you don't come along.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Jeff, do you have you do you like the pull down window shade?  The notifications?  I did this week because of you guys.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I did go about four days before I got on the plane to use the Android, use the Nexus one  pretty pretty consistently.  I like the notifications.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think the notifications are one of the best features on here.  Yeah, it felt more comfortable.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It did.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So apparently I'm told there is a widget that will turn off the cell radio.  You just have to I don't know.  It must be a third party widget.  Yeah, I haven't seen it.  Let me just see if it's in my widgets.  I think one of the things that I like about it and you hit the nail on the head last week,  Jeff, when you said it's a phone for people like me and Gina who like to, you know, geek  around.  That was Gina's point really.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Geeks versus sheep is the cruel way she put it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, for geeks, it's really fantastic.  I was I was baiting.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I was baiting folks with that with that headline.  I think that's true, though.  Although, I said Android's for geeks.  It is for geeks who want to take the time to really learn it and poke around, discover,  you know, that kind of thing.  It doesn't have that instant grokability that I think the iPhone has.  You could make it though.  You could make it though.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If you were I'll tell you what, if you if I were going to give this to my mom, I could  set it up so it's identical to the iPhone with 16 icons on five pages, just the apps  she wanted, set the settings so she doesn't have to think you could make it like the iPhone.  The point is that you can get deeper than you can on the iPhone and you don't.  But I don't think you have to.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, the other problem is and this will this will change over time.  But I think you have to admit that the quality of the apps available is just simply better  on the iPhone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I would agree on that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But I don't know when it's going to take over.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think we're very close to an inflection point.  I'm starting to see now more and more people do apps.  You know, I just got the Zagat guide, for instance, which was something I used on the iPhone  and missed on Android.  It's out now.  You know, Four Squares out.  Guala is going to be out.  Evernote is out.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Evernote is out.  Comparable.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It is.  I think a lot of in fact, yes.  Yesterday I went I haven't used the iPhone in about a week and a half and I turned on  the iPhone just to see and look at the apps that I had on there and say, is there anything  I'm really wish I had?  Mint, but you know, you could still go to the Mint website.  It's not the end of the world.  There's some weird ones like the Sonos, which I use the Sonos Zone Player, which is a speaker  that uses Wi-Fi and has a wonderful remote for the iPhone not available yet on Android.  Audible.com is the biggest one for me.  I don't get the audible reader on here.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If anyone could get it on there, you can.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I'm pushing them.  They say they're going to have it before mid-year.  They are working on it.  But I think we're very rapidly getting to the point where there's a lot of quality applications.  There are now three very good and a new one, Handmark's doing a new Twitter application.  Twidroid has gotten I think very, what do you use for Twitter, Gina?  Are you using Seesmic?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We're using Seesmic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's okay.  It's not as good as Tweety.  I think that Android really needs like a good, like awesome, incredible Twitter.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'd revisit Twidroid Pro.  I tried it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I tried it, Leo, but I'm sticking with Seesmic in that comparison.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Seesmic is simpler, but Twidroid Pro has all the functionality, in my opinion, of any of the iPhone apps.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Gina, how much effort does it take to port an app from iPhone to Android?  Is it a complete, just from scratch, rethink?  It's a completely different development platform.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it's totally different.  From what I understand, I haven't done either iPhone or Android development, but it's a totally different thing.  Is Android Java or?  Android is Java, yes.  Java, okay.  Yeah, and iPhone is Objective-C.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's just like Mac development on the iPhone.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right, right.  Yeah, so it's a totally different thing.  You can't reuse code or port code easily.  And I just think the APIs are different, from what I understand.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  On the other hand, most cell phone development was Java until the iPhone, so there probably is a lot of stuff lying, code lying around that might be ported just not from the iPhone.  I don't know.  There's a great bunch of news apps, Jeff.  I have a whole page devoted to news.  I've got three news widgets here.  There's some good feeders.  I use Feeder, F-E-E-D-R, for feed reading, and it's really great for that.  Thompson, believe it or not.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Thompson is really good.  Thompson Reuters is very good.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think it's excellent.  And it has built-in delicious integration.  So this is something I couldn't do easily on the iPhone.  I can actually share a story to Delicious directly from the phone, as well as email, messaging, Twitter.  That's really slick.  So I've been very happy, in fact, with the news situation on the iPhone.  And because the OLED screen is so good, I read a lot more news on the Nexus One than I did on the iPhone.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm waiting for a Kindle app for the Android.  Yeah, there's another one that's missing.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's one I'd like to see for sure.  And you too.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that gets us to another story.  Of course, Wednesday, Apple's going to announce the God tablet.  And if they don't, there will be tomatoes thrown.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If Steve Jobs had any guts, he'd do it for Mount Sinai.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I have brought you the tablets.  He'd be cool if he came on stage with some big stone tablets and said, what do you mean?  With a big beard, Charles?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  This is the tablet of which I was speaking.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They better have a rotten tomato detector, though, as you go in, because I tell you, if they if they're not announcing a tablet, because this will upset everybody, there will be an uprising.  There will be an uprising.  I'm going to be I did get an invite, so I will be there.  We're going to do, in fact, full day coverage of it, because I believe.  What are you laughing at?  Team coverage.  Team coverage.  I call this.  Well, nobody else is going to do it.  So I got to do it.  I call it our obsessive compulsory coverage of the iPhone, the tablet rather.  We're going to do it.  Start at 830 a.m.  And continue coverage right through to 5 p.m.  that day, because I'm of the opinion that there's a very good.  Well, if there's nothing comes out, if it's iPod socks again, then I'm in deep, deep trouble.  But then we'll have some good coverage on really boring baseball.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's no, I'm worse than that.  A boring baseball game where it's raining and that all you see is the tarp and some sad people in the stands going,

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  how those guys work so hard on that, you know, socks that came out with socks.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Actually, I'll never forget going to Cupertino for a Steve Jobs announcement.  And he announced iPod speakers and iPod socks.  And it was the most horrible feeling.  But this, you know, that this is in fact, they're still leaking stuff to the Times.  The Journal today had yet another unnamed source from deep within Apple.  It's saying, you know, there's content deals.  Harper Collins.  I believe New York Times.  I think television networks.  I think this is going to be a very interesting device.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And I think that scares me a little bit, because I think with the New York Times going to its metered,  you know, lovely read of meter made this week, I'm afraid that we have media people thinking this is a great salvation.  It is indeed the coming of the Messiah.  And I think there's a lot of skewed thinking going on in media.  Oh, that was good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, there's Steve with the tablets, by the way.  That's good.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's a good one.  You know, I fear these content deals will be saying, OK, well, Jobs understands us and he saved part of the music industry  and he'll save newspapers and magazines now.  No, no.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm sure Steve would like them to believe that as he makes these deals.  But, you know, I think people wised up because the record industry made the deal with Apple.  Oh, iTunes.  How hard could that?  How much trouble could that cause us?  And I think everybody's gone, oh, we don't want to be the next record industry.  But what choice do they have, Jeff?  Oh, none.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, yeah, they have a choice.  My argument is that in media now, content is a magnet that causes relationships and you have to get the value of the relationship.  The idea of just selling content doesn't work anymore.  Sorry.  And the cost of content with things like demand media is going down to nil.  So the content business just ain't what it was, folks.  Sorry.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Don't you, though, look at a new channel.  I mean, this is what Apple, this is I'm sure the offer that Apple is proffering to these companies.  We can save you by providing a new channel that allows engagement, is easier to use, costs you less.  There's no dead trees involved.  We've got a monetization strategy.  We've got it's called the web.  Well, but I too, you could say, yeah, but look, iTunes transcends the web and controls the channel.  And people do not buy music.  I guess they do.  I mean, it's not necessarily a go to Amazon, but iTunes still is totally dominant in that sphere.  And it's not exactly the web.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's the Internet.  It's the Internet.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  But it's because the iPod became a must have.  Well, that's the that's the offer.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's the proffer is we are making the next we're making the iPod for content.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Are you going to carry a device just to read?  You carry a device to listen, but actually that device is not your phone, which you also use to read.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a big device to carry around, probably a very fragile device.  Yeah. I don't know if it's portable.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think it's my iPhone.  I read the New York Times, my iPhone.  I read books on the iPhone.  Well, I think Apple's content.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Apple's content to have you do that and a slate maybe in the living room where it replaces a TV, perhaps.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  How big is that going to be?  And are we in a Betamax world where, you know, well, you can read the New York Times in your slate, but you can't on your computer.  That'd be absurd.  What's going to do that?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You don't think the Times will do that?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I don't know what the Times is going to do these days, but that's playing to a very small, very limited audience.  It's very risky. It's risky.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  High cost.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  And don't forget the Times made big, big deal out of its Times reader on the web with Microsoft.  Yeah.  And I made I was consulting for them at the time at about.com and I made fun of it and I got in trouble for it.  Well, so what?  Yeah, I got a reference to a reference to reference.  Maybe you didn't want to say that.  Well, sorry.  That's what I say.  I'm going to say what I say.  It didn't take off the world.  The problem with this whole notion of the tablet is its editors thinking that it's going to let them regain their control of the experience.  And the link has already been too late.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Too late for that.  Too late.  No, you're right.  If that's what their hope is, that's not going to happen.  And I don't think Apple can offer that.  All they can offer is another channel, but not more control.  So the question then is, OK, you're still going to get people.  It's not I don't think anybody would be foolish to close off the Internet.  But wouldn't it be bad to have the Internet and something where they could control it better, control the experience?  But why?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The link is a wonderful thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, you like the link, but what about...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  OK, but Leo, the iPod did not lead to us.  We can buy an album on it, but it didn't strengthen the stature of the album, of the packaged music.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, it killed it.  It killed it, yeah.  Singles.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Same here.  It's even worse because you don't link from song to song.  I see what you're saying.  Right?  But you do link from article to article or piece to piece.  And that kills the packaged experience.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, if is the package experience all that they want?  I mean, they cannot think they live on an article by article experience.  Does that not work for them?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, the Times is going to go to the lovely Rita Mede made.  That's not going to work.  No.  So the idea is you hit so many articles in a month, then you get hit.  And my argument about that, some people criticize me, but I said that it's cock-hide economics because they're charging their best customer.  And the Internet is a relationship.  The Internet is a relationship.  You're right.  It's the opposite.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You have your relationship.  Yeah, you're right.  The more they read, the more it costs.  That's not what you want to do.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No.  So the people that Rupert Murdoch says are...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a scarcity of resource model.  It's a completely inappropriate model for an unscarce resource.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Can you go talk to them, Liam?  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's treating it as if it's printed on dead trees.  Oh, it's costing us more.  No, it's not.  No.  But then what do you do?  You charge the guy who reads only one article, and then if you read five, you don't have  to...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What do you do?  You have to find a job to try to get the best relationship you can.  Here in Munich, I walked today by...  I was with Barrington Day Thurston.  I'll tell you about that in a second.  I love Barrington Day.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We tried to get...  Can't be on lunch today.  I'm on Munich.  And I said, oh, I know.  I know where you are.  You can join us.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  So we went out.  So I said, you want to do it?  You want to do the Wurst thing?  So we went to a Wurst restaurant and sat down, and he had Weisswurst, the white Wurst.  And he ordered...  I know.  I had the Nurnberger Wurst.  And he ordered a sauerkraut salad.  Fun.  You know, and potatoes.  And the Germans...  They were sitting at group tables.  The Germans looked at what he was eating and laughed.  Finally, they explained to Barrington Day that eating that all together would be like  an Italian putting chocolate sauce on pasta.  Sorry, I forget where I was...  I don't know, but I like it.  Now you've made me very hungry.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I don't think chocolate sauce sounds so bad on pasta.  Which was the chocolate sauce and which was the pasta?  Anyway, it sounds like fun.  Give Barrington Day my regards.  Instead of saying hello back.  So the publishers, I think, is the pitch for Apple.  I think that's... and not just publishers of printed content, but television and networks  and music.  And I think that the argument from their point of view is, look, we're creating a new channel.  You want to hop on before the train leaves the station.  And I think these guys are going to jump.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What do you think the sales could possibly be of a tablet?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's the question.  And by the way, this has got to be an expensive device.  It can't be cheap.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So in addition to your phone, a smartphone, and to your laptop, what does the tablet really  bring you?  Gina, you lost that for the devices.  Or you lost you that for this?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, I'm not.  I mean, I have a netbook.  I have a Kindle.  I have my phone.  I don't know.  I'm still not clear about what the target audience is, what I'm going to do with this thing.  Am I going to...  So I'm going to keep this thing in my living room and watch it instead of my TV?  Can I hook it up to my TV?  Is this just going to be like, I can get shows on it?  I don't know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let me give you my prediction and see if this would make it more compelling.  What if it had Kindle style free wireless, subsidized wireless effectively?  So you never have to hook it up to a computer.  It just gets shows.  There's a $15 a month subscription to the top five shows on all the networks.  So it's kind of your television subscription device.  Yes, it hooks up to your TV.  It's like an Apple TV in that sense.  You can quickly hook it up to your TV or not, or you can carry it with you.  You might watch it in bed because it's going to be a 720p, very gorgeous, small, but very  gorgeous screen.  Big enough, I think, to watch it in bed, watch it in the kitchen.  It's a reader.  So your newspaper will also be on that.  Your magazines will be on that.  So if you can inform a UI that only Apple can design that would make it as appealing  as a paper...  I think this is part of the problem that newspapers have to solve.  The Times was trying to solve with its application for Windows and its Air application was how  do you make an electronic reading experience comparable to the paper experience?  Everybody loves the paper.  You can scan it.  You can turn the page.  So if Apple can solve that, maybe give you something that is as usable as a newspaper,  I think that's not a bad device, especially if the cost of the content subsidizes the  cost of the device and the wireless.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, but if you have a browser on it...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, you don't have a browser on it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You don't have a browser on it?  No.  Oh, forget it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Huh.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You might.  I think this is not aimed at people who use browsers.  Who's that, Leo?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think it's a crossover device.  I think it's a device aimed at people who don't have a computer.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, how...  No, really, seriously.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe you're right.  Maybe that's a foolish idea.  Is your mother a computer?  Yeah, she has a computer.  Everybody has a computer.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So is this like the Chrome OS Play, like the second computer, the secondary bicycle?  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  But I think...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe it has a browser.  But the browser experience...  The browser kills?  Yeah, the browser...  It doesn't kill it because the browser experience is not going to be as good as a custom design  interface for content.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But you know, we've all seen the video that Sports Illustrated did and the argument against  that is that they could do that today on the web.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  Well, in fact, look at these HTML5 examples we're now seeing, not just from YouTube, but  other companies.  They look great and they work in a browser.  So maybe you're right.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, I'm not excited about the tablet.  I'm probably not going to buy one unless Apple absolutely blows me away with the UI.  I mean, this is the thing that I'm most excited about.  It's got to be a UI.  What are they going to do?  Apple's UI, regardless of what a Google fangirl I am, Apple does some incredible work in terms  of interface.  So that's what I'm excited to see.  But yeah, I'm not like jonesing for a tablet.  I have a netbook.  So, you know, I don't know.  Maybe I'll change my mind.  Hopefully, maybe it will change my mind.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think they're going for the netbook crowd.  The problem is the netbook, one of the reasons the netbook succeeds is because it's 300 bucks.  And there's no way this is $300.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And it has a keyboard.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And it has a keyboard.  That's the thing.  I mean, am I going to type on this tablet?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think the bet Apple's making, again, this is all tea leaf reading or criminology, but  I think the bet Apple's making is that the keyboard is necessary for content creation.  This is a content consumption device.  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There's the heart of it.  Right.  We are all content creators now, not necessarily the whole world, but whatever we do, whether  it's email or a video or a tweet or whatever, you know, look at the frustration we all have  had with the virtual keyboards on our phones.  Right.  And, you know, many times I will think of something I want to tell somebody and I wait  till I get to my computer to do it.  Yeah, me too.  We are all content creators now.  That's the problem.  There is no such thing, I think, for anybody as content consumption.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The problem is that you add the browser, you add the keyboard, suddenly you got a laptop.  Yeah.  And we already have that.  So I guess that's your contention, Jeff, is that there's no market for this because  we already all have laptops and this is an imaginary market.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, that's where Google is seeing the world, obviously, that it's voice control.  Right.  When you get to voice control, then it obviates the need for the keyboard.  I picked up a magazine at the airport, I forget which one it was, I can't give it credit,  arguing that handwriting is dead.  There's no such thing as handwriting anymore.  And I agree with that because I have the world's worst handwriting.  And my kids had to take the keyboard early in life as a result.  Well, is there a point at which the keyboard dies?  If the keyboard dies, then yes, the tablet makes sense, except for the pocket problem  with the size of it.  And we're not there yet, though.  Is that Apple's huge?  Remember back, ladies and gentlemen, to the new...  The first tablet.  Gary Trudeau and making fun of the new...  Farm.  Yeah.  Right.  And the notion of taking handwriting onto the computer is never going to work.  So will audio input work?  Well, we're not there yet.  Maybe, maybe someday.  And who's going to be the better shot to do that?  Google or Apple?  Google has more samples.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, Google can own speech.  I think so.  I think Google already does.  I think to me, that's the killer kind of hidden feature in Android 2.1 and the Nexus  is this speech everywhere.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Of course, Leo, you are a radio person who are very easy to understand.  Unlike me, who talks shit fast.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I think you do speak carefully and say things like that.  But it works if you do that.  I've been dictating emails and mostly text messages very effectively.  But you have to enunciate.  The phone trains you.  Because it doesn't work until you do it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  My teachers and parents tried and as you can tell, they failed.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So what about the contention that Google's position in China now is far more risky than  it realized?  That Eric Schmidt might have been right that this is a mistake to the point that these  two handsets that were going to be announced in China, two Android-based handsets from  Samsung and Motorola are now delayed.  And the contention that this is you don't mess with the phone industry like that.  These guys are not do not take kindly to delays in their handsets.  And this could be disaster for Android going forward.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, the irony here is that the question I saw asked today is, well, people in China  buy Android phones without Google.  Maybe it'll just have Bing on it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And if Sony Ericsson says they're going ahead anyway, I don't know how they get to in Motorola  and Samsung do not.  But I'm sure that Google's smart enough to have had this conversation and looking at  the consequences.  They may have made a braver decision than even we realized.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Android is so customizable.  I feel like that they're going to be able to get around this.  But even if they have to change the default search engine to banger, by do or whatever,  I don't know.  I think that they're going to figure out a way to get around it and to release the phone.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I keep coming back to what Gina and Siva said last week here that this was about Google  protecting the cloud.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, makes a lot of sense.  But now, so you're saying so will Google pull out?  I guess is the first question.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I was taught years ago in negotiation, if you threaten someone and don't do it, then  you're doomed forever.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And China has in a way, admittedly a low level official, but China has said it in a way,  screw you, Google.  So now it's Google's move.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, and Google in a sense pulls out in a sense that doesn't that anyone can find Google.com  through mechanisms that's been talked about.  The problem is they won't get the advertising revenue, but advertising is hard to sell.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So maybe they're not losing that much.  You think that it's not a big deal.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Now.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, but how is this going to go down?  I mean, isn't Google just going to show uncensored results and then China blocks it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, no, I think what they said was that they're not going to.  They shut down.  Yeah, they're going to try to get the law changed.  If the law doesn't change, then they have to shut down because they're not going to  break the law.  Steve Ballmer at a conference on Thursday in Houston called Google's decision an irrational  business decision.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He threw one of the bus that he went forward and back and forward and back.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  According to Forbes, Ballmer suggested that Google's decision to no longer filter out  Internet searches objectionable to the Chinese government was an irrational business decision.  After all, Ballmer said the US imports oil from Saudi Arabia, despite the censorship  that goes on there.  Quote, the US is the most extreme when it comes to free speech.  Said Ballmer, noting, however, that even the US bans child pornography while France bans  Internet access to Nazi imagery.  Interesting.  You know, Steve has never held back from the opportunity to slime a competitor.  And it never really been, you know, I mean, come on, it's just Ballmer.  There's no Kremlin ology when it comes to Ballmer.  What you see is what you get.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There was a link I didn't put up on the on the feed.  I'm trying to find right now.  I'll fail.  But that maybe Google operating system that looked at Google's censorship of things  country by country.  And it does raise a good point.  You know, there's the Nazi stuff in France and there's Scientology.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And Google and eBay and Yahoo and everybody go along with the Nazi filtering.  Right.  But I'm going to use.  Oh, here it is.  Yeah, it's Google Blogistrope.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So in Google France, Irian88 is out and USZenu.net, which is Scientology.  In Australia, the Aboriginal Encyclopedia.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Google filters out ZENU.net results in the US.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It says here on Blogiscoped.  Let me see here.  Scientology sent Google a letter that complained about a particular page at ZENU as part of  the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, because it took what they said Scientologists say  was their own copyrighted works.  So Google said, oh, yeah, so, you know, the point is they're following local law in Germany  about the Holocaust and certain things.  The Holocaust Luger, the Holocaust Lives is filtered.  So I guess that's what Chyna is saying is you you you can't tell us what culturally we

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  don't want to publish.  You do it.  Why can't we do it?  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This is about the fact that they were being attacked.  I think that Google couldn't deal with the fact that they were a pawn, you know, that  that information stored on their servers that was getting, you know, get that they were  getting the hackers were getting access to the fact that they were available, you know,  to you know, that that the hackers could get information about these people through Google  services because they're available in China.  Does that make sense?  I didn't explain that well, but this is this is not about free speech.  This is about the attacks.  That makes sense.  Yes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So do you think then, Gina, that was a mistake to raise censorship?  I mean, part of the argument has been that this gave Google its its virtue points back.  But are you saying that that muddied the waters, that this was instead if they'd stuck with  the cloud defense, they'd be better off?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, I think I think I think it's fine that I think the way that they handled it  was fine.  I feel like they were really they were clear about the fact like we compromised up to  a point and that and then they you know, they did the surveillance that they there were  these attacks and we can't stand to both compromise and deal with this kind of, you know,  the attacks at the same time.  So now we're not willing to compromise anymore.  I think it was fine that they brought it up that way.  I mean, but obviously it's not a free speech.  I mean, if they felt that way, they would have done this, you know, five years ago.  It was definitely it was definitely the attacks.  It was definitely the attacks and for a bomber to make these statements when, you know,  Internet Explorer had one of the biggest.  I mean, Google did them a favor.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was IE's fault.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, really.  Bad business decision.  No kidding.  Ever.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a very good point.  Yeah, that's a good point.  Maybe if you would make your software more secure, we wouldn't have this problem.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We wouldn't have this problem.  Exactly.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I saw another link today in my search.  I didn't put up a front feed, but it said you should update your Internet Explorer this way,  that way, or just get rid of it.  I do recommend just get rid of it.  Get rid of it.  Throw it out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's what France and Germany said.  They said you cannot use it.  Microsoft did patch that on Thursday, by the way, that bug that bug.  That bug anyway was fixed.  You're listening to This Week in Google.  Jeff Jarvis is here.  He's in Munich right now for the Bilderberg Conference.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The DLD Conference at Borda.  OK.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I got the name wrong, but what the hell?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Bilderberg sounds nice, though.  It sounds like...  That's another one, I think.  We can put together tweets.  Yeah, it's nice.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I like that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Jeff Fulmer will start that next week.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And he's off to Davos next week, which will be fun.  Gina Trapani also here with her submarine-crushed cup.  And we're going to have more in just a bit, but I want to mention my friends at GoToMeeting  from Citrix.  GoToMeeting uses Citrix's top-of-the-line remote access to make it easier for you to  meet.  See, Jeff could have just stayed here and gone to the conference using GoToMeeting,  saved himself thousands of dollars in airfare, and been more effective.  We all have phone calls that we're on.  We wish we could show the person something, whether it's the PowerPoint presentation or  the spreadsheet of the website, or maybe collaborate on a document together.  And this is what GoToMeeting makes so easy to do.  You install it right now.  You install it right now.  In fact, you can install it for free by going to gotomeeting.com slash twig, G-O-T-O meeting  dot com slash twig.  Take a minute.  Before I'm done, you'll have it installed and running.  Then the next time you're on the phone, you say, here's what you do.  I want to show you this.  GoToMeeting.  And let me show you.  They go to GoToMeeting and boom, suddenly they're seeing your computer on their screen.  And you could share documents with them.  They can take control and they can show you something.  You could train.  It's incredible for sales presentations, product demos, training sessions.  We use it here for collaboration.  We use it on Maxwell's house.  Ray can show us his illustrations, his screenshots.  It just works.  It's in real time.  It's fast.  I think you're going to love it.  I want you to try it for free.  Go to gotomeeting.com slash twig.  Save some time.  Save some money.  Save travel, all that stress of travel.  Just use GoToMeeting.  GoToMeeting.com slash twig.  We thank Citrix so much for supporting our show this week in Google.  Let's see.  Google Voice Extension for Chrome.  That's interesting.  Gina Trapani, is that going to be your tip?  I don't want to steal your tip ahead of time.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's not going to be my tip, but it is super cool.  If you're using Chrome and Voice, definitely install this extension.  Puts a little button on the top on your address bar or your status bar.  I'm not actually sure what that's called in Chrome.  It's called the Chrome in Firefox.  The thing.  That thing.  Yeah, it's the Chrome in Chrome.  It's the Chrome in Chrome.  But it gives you notifications when you have new messages.  You can initiate calls and text messages right from that one button.  Pretty sweet extension for Chrome.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I have to say, to me, that's the best reason to use an Android device is just the integration with Google Voice is so wonderful.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This integration is fantastic.  Man, I don't use T-Mobile's voicemail at all.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It all just is basically visual voicemail with transcription from Google Voice.  Now, somebody sent me a note saying, oh, you got to stop plugging Google Voice.  I can't get it.  But I think they're sending out invitations now.  If you ask, if you go to voice.google.com and ask for an invitation, people are apparently getting them within a day or two.  And of course, once you get in a Google Voice account, you have invitations too.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I love the idea that this is my one number.  I'll never have another number and everybody can call that number.  When I switch phones, it makes it so much easier.  Love Google Voice.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it's fantastic when you get a new phone for sure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm a Google Voice fan.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I see people in the chat coming in offering their invites.  Wasn't there a service once where you could do that, where you could start to create a market and invites?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's still around, but I can't remember the name.  There was a website where you would go and trade.  Yeah, a market. It was such a cool idea.  Let me see.  What other stories?  Oh, France is getting involved.  Good old France is getting involved digitizing books.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And even making noises about perhaps doing it in cooperation with Google because, gosh, it is a big job.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It is a big job. In fact, they're only doing 300,000 books.  Google's done millions.  France, though, has committed a significant amount of money, 750 million euros, about a billion dollars to digitize its libraries in museums.  And I think that's to be commended.  But Google's got 10 million books.  They're going to take three years and they're going to get 300,000 books.  So they do need some help.  Wasn't France one of the chief complainers about the Google book deal?  They didn't want to.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You could have just stopped at the word complainers.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  President Nicolas Sarkozy.  I love France.  I'm a Francophile.  My daughter lived there for a year.  I go back there whenever I can.  But you're not far off.  Nicolas Sarkozy vowed France will not let itself be stripped of its literary treasures.  He says, in fact, he's criticized the library in Lyon for signing a Faustian pact to digitize books with Google.  So I'm glad they're doing it.  Look, this is this is this is absolutely, you know, the thing to do digitize this stuff.  The problem is we have to come up with a standard so that everything is interoperable.  You know, nobody owns it.  That's that's that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's the answer.  The problem was no one was doing it.  So we'll step into the void and then got in trouble because it went too far.  But no one was doing it.  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But if them doing it motivates people to start doing it, then great.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What is the status with the Google deal?  I mean, I know that there are the parties talking.  Are they all back at the table?  I know that the original agreement is moot now.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm forgetting that there was some shift to put it off for quite some time now because I can't remember.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But I but knowing Google, they're just going they're still digitizing, right?  They didn't stop.  I don't know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They do have agreements in force with universities.  They certainly can do any books that are out of copyright.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's the stuff in copyright.  And who owns that?  And it's really the orphan.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Even then, they were doing deals with you if they knew who you were.  It's really the orphan works, which is, again, a fairly tiny proportion of all this.  Right.  So it was interesting.  There was a story in the top New York Times today that among the top sellers on the Kindle are books that are free, the top downloads.  Really?  And so it had a young woman who wrote a book.  And if you want to get published in a big way and get noticed, just put it on the Kindle for free.  And you have a good shot of doing that.  And Chris Anderson, author of Free, linked to that, arguing that it was a substantiation of his model.  And so it makes you wonder that you get to the...  Of course, that book is by definition digitized.  But the idea that there's going to be orphan works going forward in any way is kind of limited.  Again, go back to the earlier discussion.  We're all creators and we now all have links to ourselves.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think unless you have a story that we haven't gotten to, I think it's time to move on to our tip, tool and number.  Any other stories going once, going twice?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I was interested that I just saw before we got on that Google is adding...  If you search for, let's say, a museum and put in hours or a restaurant and put in menu in the search bar, they say they're going to come back and give you those results directly.  I couldn't get it to work.  That was my tip.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, sorry.  Okay, shut up.  That's okay.  Zip it.  And that's okay.  I have others.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We need to use the Nexus One censorship.  Did you notice that, by the way, that when you say the F word, for instance, in the Nexus One to the dictation, it gives you hash, hash, hash, hash.  No, I didn't.  That's so funny.  I'm trying to take somebody, F you, and it goes...  You can't.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I haven't tried that yet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But what it tells me is that they're recognizing it just fine.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They just don't want to type it.  They're apparently very prudish.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, apparently.  I think it's just for you, Leo, because it knows you're an old radio guy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, maybe that's it.  It doesn't want to get me in trouble with the FCC.  According to Google, we filter potentially offensive or inappropriate results because we want to avoid situations whereby we might misrecognize a spoken query and return profanity.  That makes sense.  Yeah, that does.  So if you said fudge and it comes back with the other F word...  Grandma, I love your...  Fudge?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, now I'm thinking about it.  That makes a lot of sense.  I just thought it was funny.  In fact, I said it as it is.  I thought, well, they'll know what I'm talking about.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Leo, I know you're going to talk about multi-touch, the multi-touch browser in a minute.  I'm not going to steal your thunder, but another way to get multi-touch, the hard way to get multi-touch, you can now root your phone and install a ROM with multi-touch that will add multi-touch to the browser and the Nexus One.  And I haven't done it because Jeff has gotten to me and I'm committed to being just a regular user.  Doesn't root my phone.  But the instructions are on the Twig, on the friend feed.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I would.  Yeah.  And of course you have it on smarterware.org also, but I would be less hesitant to root my phone if I thought there were an easy way to restore it.  You know, I don't mind jailbreaking the iPhone because iTunes has a built-in restore and all you have to do is run that and you're back to the way you were unless you modified the radio or something.  But it looks like the only way to restore the Nexus One is to use somebody's ROM that's posted on the Internet and reflash it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, reflash it.  So there's no way to save a restore image.  That's interesting.  So I rooted my G1 and at that time there was a way to save the current state of your phone, but that might not be the case anymore.  Yeah, you know, I'm just kind of trying to hold it out.  You know, there are a couple of good reasons to root, right?  There's tethering, but you can do that with PDAnet without tethering.  I did that.  And now there's multi-touch.  But you know, there are more apps coming out now with multi-touch, so maybe you don't have to root for that.  I was really tempted.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But then I thought, you know, who knows what the quality of the ZLLs are?  And the one thing I don't want to do is have an unreliable phone because I, you know, and when I jailbreak broke the iPhone, it did really impact reliability.  So, you know, partly that's because I have to review this and I have to give people the I can't tell them what it's like to have a rooted one.  I have to tell them what it's like to have an unrooted one.  Right.  I'm not going to do that on my own, but also I'm just nervous if I could restore it, I'd be much less hesitant.  But also I don't feel like, you know, you could buy I bought I spent 30 bucks, but I bought PDAnet.  I don't mind that far preferable to rooting it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And I will say before we got on tonight, I had a problem with and I have no idea that was the PDAnet or not.  But my connection here, my hotel room was getting very confused between Ethernet one and EN2.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, that's on your Mac.  I think you could fix that on the Mac.  OK, but I think that inserted that.  Yeah, PDAnet does create a new network interface on the Mac.  Yeah, it does.  Yeah.  Well, let's get to our tool of I'm sorry, our tip of the week, Gina Trapani.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Sure. So the tip is Jeff brought it up just a minute ago in this week's this week in search on the Google blog.  They ran down a few new search tricks.  And this is just a real simple one.  If you add the word hours or menu to a search for a store organization or restaurant, you'll get the hours and the menu in line.  So the example they give is if you search for a computer history museum, Mountain View hours, you'll see the hours of the computer history museum, which is which I highly recommend, by the way, it's an incredible place right there in the search results.  So and if you search for a sushi joint near you and include the word menu, you'll get a link directly to the menu.  Now, I try to get the menu itself.  Then you get a link.  No, you don't get the menu itself.  You get a link.  So when you do the search, you see a little snippet of a Google map.  And on the right side, you see the name of the restaurant and the address and stuff.  And then right below that, you'll see there's a little light blue link menu underneath.  And most of the menu searches that I tried pointed to all menus dot com.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  So they've added all menus as a.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's the only resource of menus I've seen.  But maybe maybe it depends.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  My thought about this, you know, does this lead away like the thing, whether in Chicago and it gives you the weather in the search box.  Does this make Google more of a destination in this sense?  It's being like, yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, they're definitely moving toward answering your question without ever leaving the Google interface.  And there are a few other there are a few other tweaks they made this week.  They launched rich snippets for events and a rich snippet will, you know,  will give you kind of information about days and times right there in your results.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So if you search for concerts in San Jose,  you'll get actual concert listings and phone numbers to call and like who's going to perform that kind of thing.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. In this is what Bing does, basically.  And now it also will provide answers to questions in line.  So kind of taking on Wolfram Alpha a little bit.  So I really think that there Google is trying to become a destination or at least send you direct and one click exactly to what you need, like the menu link.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's how it should do it, I think.  It should.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think that these things, people don't really even notice them until, you know, until you search for weather and say, oh, there's, you know, it's raining.  Interesting. You know, so I think there's just little tweaks here and there.  But the hours of menu search, I think, is especially useful for mobile searches on your phone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I bet you most people don't even notice that anything's changed or anything.  They just say, oh, yeah, that's the result I wanted.  That's what I was looking for.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They've always gotten better with snippets.  You asked for this and we'll show you that portion of the Wikipedia page that hasn't.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But knowing that you can add, for instance, the word hours to the searches is something they need to publicize because that changes the syntax of the search itself.  Definitely.  Or menu. And that's really, I think that's great.  Google blog dot blogspot dot com is kind of a must read for us every week because Google is very good about kind of, you know, sneaking this stuff out.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, they've gotten really good about blogging about it, too.  I mean, all their blogs.  I read the Gmail blog, the voice blog, the regular blog, the reader blog.  I mean, they've really every product blog is pretty active.  Yeah, I have a Google reader folder for all the Google blogs.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a very, very good read for doing this show anyway.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And they're doing really well on Twitter as well.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, really? They all have Twitter accounts?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, there are a lot of there's a Nexus one Twitter account.  There's a Google Wave Twitter account.  And in fact, Wave launched something new this week.  It was very exciting.  Read only access to waves.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, finally, finally, finally, finally.  With reply only access to come because people were trashing waves by just junking them up with stuff.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So if somebody gets in your wave and starts, you know, putting the word not in everybody else's sentences, you just demote them to read only.  Go back and playback, copy it to a new wave and you're good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now, I'm looking for the main Google account does not have a list.  Somebody somebody a Google needs to make a list of Google accounts, a canonical list of tweet Google tweets, because I'm looking at the, you know, Twitter dot com slash Google.  And there's no list at all.  This would be a good place since you've got two million followers to.  Oh, yeah, they should take a Twitter list.  Just, you know, canonical.  I do that with Twitter, a canonical list of Googlers so we could find them all.  There must be one somewhere.  Maybe somebody will put that in the chat room if there's one.  Yeah, I'd like to find that your number of the week.  Mr. Jarvis, two numbers.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  First number is 48.  The next number is two point seven five billion.  The founders of Google, Sergey and Larry, are going to take a metered five year sellout of certain portion of their stock to diversify and do what people in their position do.  It will at the end of that period, at current value, they mean they get two point seven five billion in cash each.  Of course, that will change because there are also a lot of talk this week about how Google stock is very low.  Well, all tech stocks are tanking right now.  Google's a five fifty and part of this was kind of a knee jerk reaction, some were saying.  But anyway, at the end of that, they would end up with forty eight percent, the two of them.  Oh, that's the voting stock.  Their shares have ten times the voting power of common shares.  But Eric Schmidt has ten percent of the company.  Forty eight percent is hard to get around.  They're not really losing control.  However, they will.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The two founders will go to below majority control of voting shares until they make an amendment to the articles of incorporation that give them fifteen percent, fifteen times.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I was going to ask why why they would do that.  But is that true?  Leo, are you like they can they can do that?  Yeah. OK. OK.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, there's you know, you have to do it right.  There's ways to do it. They issue they make they make a shares, B shares, C shares and they make a multiplier.  I know because I got screwed by Paul Allen, but that's a long story.  I won't even get into it.  By the way, I got screwed by Paul Allen.  Paul Allen did it himself.  I know. Can't really complain.  He lost more money than I did in the deal.  Cop Mike says the Google blog does in fact have a list from July anyway of Google accounts on Twitter.  And there are a lot of them.  There are a ton of Google accounts on Twitter.  So I'll put this in the show notes.  Google accounts on Twitter include Google, Google policy blogger, Google books, Google calendar, Google Contacts, Google images, Google News on and on and on and on.  There's geo related ad related.  So 20 ad related developer and technical related.  There's people and there's even regional.  It looks like they've been.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What's the special in the restaurant today?  Tweet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that would be good.  I'd like that.  Let's see.  That must be that's somewhere else, I guess.  Google at work.  Google sites, Google toolbar.  Wow.  Look at that.  And I guess even though this article is posted in July, it's apparently they're adding all the time because they have an asterisk next to new ones.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, cool.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, that's great.  Good to know.  So I will make you know what I'll do.  I'll make a list on my site of all of them.  A Google list.  Good idea.  So two point seven five billion each.  That's nice.  Must be nice.  Wow.  I mean, it's kind of a staggering number.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They can each buy a jet now.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So we talked a lot about the Nexus one.  Probably ad nauseam for some of you.  But we all use a Nexus one phone.  And, you know, I mean, I have to say I'm using exclusively and no desire to go back to the iPhone.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And I sort of begrudgingly.  But yeah, we're working on him.  We're working on him.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We've had that we've had to bribe, cajole, threaten him.  But we've managed to convince him to not turn it in yet.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I turn him.  The iPhone is still my number one.  That's OK.  My heart.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's OK.  Our Gina.  And my contention is you just have to use this enough to really get to know it.  And I think people come around.  I'm just loving it.  I almost am too much in love with it.  I spend a lot of time special time just me and the phone.  You're correcting it right now.  Just me and the phone.  Scary.  So but one of the big complaints and it really is a big complaint is that multi touch while it's in the hardware and it's in the operating system is not in any of the Google apps.  And it seems like a huge thing to leave out.  And it really is.  When you go to the gallery, you just want to pinch and zoom the pictures and you can't.  They just don't go anywhere.  But I did find a very good upgrade to the browser.  Now, one thing you have to commend Google for.  Go ahead and try to change the default browser on the iPhone.  You can't.  Not easy to do just as on, you know, on his would be on Windows and Mac to have a different default browser.  And I am really happy with this one.  It's called the Dolphin browser.  It's been around since September.  The newest version just came out.  Supports multi touch.  Absolutely.  It is.  Now, there's a free version that is ad supported, but I paid a couple of bucks to get the full version.  It's it's probably using the same engine.  It's a very competent browser.  It seems to be exactly the same as the Google browser, except watch.  I can I can pinch.  I can zoom.  It's a smart.  It reformats very nicely after you do the pinch.  I have to say, it's a really nice browser, has a lot of nice features, including gestures.  It has a built in little magnifying glass.  I can see the page as a whole.  It also has share great sharing features in it.  It has a home page that I kind of like that gives you access to all the Google features kind of natively on the home page.  A very good bookmarking facility.  It has a read later feature, which is an insta paper.  It's kind of like the idea has a you save the articles into one folder.  Good, delicious integration.  It's a very nice browser called the Dolphin browser.  And I'm using it.  You totally can say this is you are the default browser has a huge number of setting capabilities.  I mean, you know, there's all sorts of settings built into this thing.  So very happy with it.  I highly recommend it.  If you want to assure yourself that, in fact, it is possible to to do multi touch on the Nexus one.  And I'm told this works as well on the droid.  Yes, you can.  And all you have to do is change the software.  And this is the one I recommend.  It's the Dolphin browser.  You can find it in the Android marketplace.  It's also themeable, although I haven't changed the theme.  I like it kind of simple theme.  A lot of nice features built into it.  And I'm downloading this right now.  Yeah, I mean, you know, well, what it is, it's great for when people say, oh, yeah, nice, next is when I could only had multi touch.  And you can whip it out and say, look, and I think that reassures people.  And I have that maps that makes a big difference.  You got to get it maps and gallery.  And it's you know, right now you have to root as far as I know to do that.  But I'm sure that I have to think Google at some point is going to make that shift.  It's available in Europe.  I don't know why it's not available here.  And as long as we're talking about applications, I know you're using seismic you guys for your Twitter application.  I mentioned that a hand marks got a new one.  But I really and I would encourage anybody who used ever used to droid pro to go back and reexamine it because it has now become not only very competent Twitter client, but I think a better Twitter client than even Tweety or simple tweet, which or bird bird was a bird feed, all of which I've used on the iPhone.  I really like this one.  I've been using it very heavily.  And it has a black theme, which is very important if you're using, you know, the Nexus one because that OLED screen gives you better battery life with dark backgrounds doesn't use any energy to do a black pixel on OLED.  But you know, the speediness of this is just of the Nexus one is just fantastic.  You're in lovely.  I am.  It's my new.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's great.  I'm going to revisit to droid.  I'm going to give to droid.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I would give it.  I'd be very curious what you think.  Because I went to seismic, but it's simple.  Twitter right, for instance, has the ability to have multiple.  This is important to me because I have multiple Twitter accounts.  Oops, let's go back.  And it and it handles it.  I think it handles it quite well.  So I'm in my main account.  That's the default account.  But if I want to go to another account, I just slide sideways.  And that it has a unified inbox, by the way, all accounts, which is very handy.  And then account by account, I can go through here like this.  And if you want to follow somebody, you press and hold them.  And then it says follow.  And it gives you the chance.  I guess I'm already following them.  But it gives you the chance to choose which account you want to follow them in.  So it handles multiple accounts very, I think, very nicely.  How about list support?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Can I give you just just a list?  Yeah, you know, seismic apparently has that.  But every time I try to look at just a list, I get a connection error, like no matter what,  no matter what kind of connection I have, wherever I am.  Let me try.  I have to go to an account that has lists.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let me go to my main account.  If you go to an account that has lists, you pull up the main menu and it says view lists.  Oh, these are lists I'm subscribed to.  OK, so I need to search for lists and other people's profiles.  OK, and then you can then you can subscribe to or look at the lists.  It has trends.  Very nice job with trends, I think.  I think they've done a good job, although trends have gotten really stupid on Twitter.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, really, really pathetic.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I am proud to say that Twitter has redone the suggested user list and I am now not only verified,  but I am suggested in their technology list.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Congratulations.  I saw that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What did you do to your followers?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Nothing.  And that's fine.  Actually, that's good.  Dave Weiner wrote a letter to Twitter's board saying, get me off that.  But it's not like the old SUL where you join and then you got a preselected a bunch of them and you just press OK.  There's there's 20 lists.  They did it right this time where there's categories.  You pick a category you're interested in.  There's a large number of people in each category.  It's a much more sensible way of doing it.  Nobody's going to get a million followers just from being on it.  And I think that's fine.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's a good thing.  It's a feature.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a discovery.  It's a discovery tool, which is as it should be.  We are out of time.  I can't believe it.  You must go back to your it's not pizza night now in Munich.  It's schlaff.  It's bedtime schlaff night.  Yeah.  All right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Have some schlaff.  I went to the sauna in the hotel and I went to a party.  And I came here and then I'm going to go to sleep.  Schlaff sleep.  Schlaff.  You're saying.  Yeah.  Oh, it's beautiful.  It's a nice hotel.  It's called the Charles Hotel here in Munich.  It's a new hotel.  The conference will be up at.  It's very nice.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, very nice.  Well, enjoy your stay in Germany and then we'll talk to you next week in Switzerland at Davos.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I hope I hope it all works well.  I'll be in the I'm supposed to be the lone guy as the as the big soiree goes on the last night of Davos.  I pour me sacrificing for the purposes of twig will be in the press room.  Don't do that.  We have to know it's fine.  It's fine.  I'll be tired by then.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's fine.  Will you be wearing black tie?  Because if so, Gina and I can dress up.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'll be wearing a black tie.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  OK, I've got to wear a tuxedo just to make you know, make it feel like I'm not missing the glamour.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Me getting dressed up is me not wearing a t shirt.  Oh, come on, I know you've got a closet full of ballgowns.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Don't deny it.  Oh, yeah.
