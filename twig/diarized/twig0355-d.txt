Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wi-Fi holds up. But phone lines, tin cans and string one way or the other. I'll be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll make it work. It's not the same without you. So welcome back. You're gone one week  last week. And I got the email that said is Jeff off the show?  That was a wishful thinking. No, no, it was like, Oh, tell me Jeff's not off the show. I said,  No, he's traveling. He'll be back. And I was watching yesterday, the new dot NYC shows that  which you're in beta, you're, you're workshopping, I think is probably the best way to go. We're very

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  much beta, but we're figuring things out bit by bit. Enjoyed it. Also, we're working on. You talked

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a little bit about the story you missed last week, which will bring back the Gawker teal story.  And I'm not talking teal the color. Also with us Kevin Marks, good friend of this show. Hi,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin in his garden. Yep. Kevin has I'm the pink one today. Kevin is a little pink. He's using his

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  wife's laptop. That's why don't knock it. We're very happy he's here. Kevin has worked everywhere,  including Google and Apple and British Telecom and the Bebe. And he's at Kevin Marks.com. And  also our newest regular on the show. And it makes me so happy to say that Stacey Higginbotham.  Yeah. But that was lukewarm, Stacey. Are you already tired of us? You're already you're done.  It's a little awkward. Yeah, Stacey on iot.com. She hosts a wonderful Internet of Things podcast  with our other good friend Kevin Toffle. We also love him. And we're thrilled to have you on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  show. This is great. I saw Kevin at at at IO. And he was just such a happy guy. He loves working at

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google. He's not he's a consultant, though, right? He's not an employee. He's a contractor. He's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  contractor. He was just surrounded by smart people. He was just a happy guy. It was just so good to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  see. Well, who wouldn't be happy working at home? Sorry, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, you know, it's like it's like any any job. It's like depends on who you who you're working  for and who you're working with. Yeah. Yeah. If you if you get you get a manager doesn't suit you,  then you probably better off leaving. I guess that's I guess that's the case. Unfortunately,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it just feels like Google would be like Magic land. But really, it's probably just no different

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  than Hooli. Google is very good on the whole. I think they're a very good employer in general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Is what is now Kevin's never told me or I don't think even said publicly what he's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  doing. It's public now. He works with Chromecast people. Oh, I know. So exciting. Oh, well, that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  explains why you on yesterday's IOT show, we're talking about Google Home, because the story is  the new Google Home air freshener slash Echo competitor is is really just a Chromecast with

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a microphone. That's right. It's got the same silicon base as the Chromecast. And we were so  Kevin and I basically were like, Hey, what does this mean? And it actually has a more powerful  kind of brains of the operation than the Echo because the Echo is using a TIO map.  And it's a DaVinci chip in this. And it runs at like about a gigahertz. And the  Chromecast, the current Chromecast is using the Marvell Armada Mini Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's geeking out. I know. I feel like you have to know this stuff for IOT. This is these are  the these are the Intel's and the AMD's of IOT. These are these are my peeps. Yeah. Now, I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  know how fast that runs, but it's got to drive an HDMI port. So it needs a little bit more.  So I think anyway, point is the chips basically, I think it was like 30 bucks, you could get the  TI version for like 30 bucks, the most expensive element of the Echo based on the tear downs we've  seen. And then the Chromecast chip, we don't know what the price is, because Marvell has not put it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  out there. But it's but the point, I guess, well, first of all, one question that always comes up  with the Echo is, how much money is Amazon making on this thing? Because they charge 200 bucks now.  You and I got it as early adopters for 99. But that went away soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's 180. And they don't when we got it for 99, we got a remote control and the thing and the  remote control is now 30 bucks. So if you want the full package that we got, it's like 210, which  I kind of want another Echo, but I don't think I want to pay that much for it. Well, now's now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  would be a bad bad time. That would be a bad time. Although, you get the whole. Well, maybe Jeff Bezos  was talking at recode right with Walt Mossberg. And he said he envisioned a world where you had  many of these like it wouldn't just be one. You might have a metal piece filled with units.  And then you you just remember who to talk to depending on what you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is like the nightmare scenario. It doesn't sound like the right thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be like plus microphones built into your house, basically, and your car. And, you know,  it's it's Star Trek time. And you're just going to say to the air, hey, blank, give me this. Right.  So the idea is the emulator. You use the echo emulator. I didn't get it working yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Egg was Echo Sim. What is it? I.O.  It's really designed for people who are designing Echo Tech. They call them. I don't want to use  the word a skills. That sounds bad. By the way, and I'm sure Stacey, you deal with this on your on  your IOT show. What do you do? Do you not say the trigger words? She who shall not be named. She who  shall. That's a little too long. I'm just going to call it. That is I'm going to say the skill.  And so the idea is you may log in with my Amazon account and I don't think it hurts for anybody to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  see what my Amazon account is. We can we can put these in your wish list. Yeah. You buy your wish

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  list. Yeah. Would you please. We can just say the magic word and they'll be ordered for you. So  I had to have to have to be on the Gilmore gang. I mentioned it and Keith's Keith's one

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  almost started ordering things. Mine will not do that. Let's say give it the path, the four digit

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  passcode. Right. You have to opt into that. I was OK. That was one of the first things that I did  since I have a daughter who has questionable taste in music. So let's let me OK. Everybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  uh uh cover your echoes ears. That's true. You can do a trigger warning.  Trigger trigger warning. That's good. I like it. We should make an IOT show called trigger warning.  What should I what should I ask it? Uh Alexa what time is it? It's as simple as you can get.  Oh you don't you don't. OK. They haven't got the audio on my computer set up. But  it looked like it did it. So this is for people who want to know what it's like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ask what the temperature is like in San Jose. OK. Do you have my audio yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll wait. OK. Let's try it. Uh oh wait a minute. I don't have to say Alexa  because I'm pressing a button. What's the temperature in San Jose?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In San Jose, California, it's 80 degrees with partly sunny skies.  Today's forecast calls for more of the same with a high of 86 degrees and a low of 57 degrees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the same voice and everything. That's great. So you can now. It's wrong though look.  It's wrong. OK. We didn't ask it to be right. We just wanted to talk to it.  89 and climbing. So here we go. Yeah. Well you're I should. Wait a minute.  What's the weather at Kevin's house? I didn't ask the right question. If it had asked. I couldn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  find a forecast for that location. That's that's actually better. So I was playing with something  an echo kind of tool for developers where you can basically program if you open the skill,  you can actually program it to respond a certain way. So if I ask is Stacy Higginbotham awesome,  then the echo will say yes. Yes, she is. But I found out when trying to make that happen  that it wouldn't recognize things like Stacy Higginbotham. So names were tough. I know I was  ready to like trick my family and get some self validation. It's not hard to write these skills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you tried this, Kevin? I mean, you're the programmer in the bunch. I haven't played with

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  these, but that was particular ones. I've had this mother bought things. So I don't I don't have  have one of the gadgets. So I haven't been that excited by that one. But well, I mean,  it's true by the Google one. The thing for me is that the thing I don't like about it is that it  is just voice. And I'm what I've what I've said for a while is that what I want is to say,  I'll ask it a question, and it'll show me the result visually. And so that it being hooked up  to the Chromecast makes a lot of sense. I've got Chromecast on my TV. So if I ask it a question,  it can flash the reply up on the TV. That's what the home shows it to you in the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, if you want, if you have that, I have the app on my Amazon Fire tablet, which I don't ever  use. So I just have it sitting next to the Echo. And so yeah, you do get a visual that way. In fact,  when you're playing music, you'll get the album art and stuff like that. Right. And it's the thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that struck me is that this there was a very old project MIT called put that there, which was,  which knew where you were in the room and you were the screens were so you could say,  put that there and do that kind of stuff. And there's oblong, which basically built that  for businesses so that you have as many screens as you want in the room. And it knows where they are  and you can you throw things between them with a with a one that's like a  Nintendo controller or something. And that's the thing, as we sort of gradually wire up the house,  that makes more sense because I've already got Chromecast in both my TVs. Having a good  quality microphone that knows where you are, which these these things are physically big enough to do,  it could work out which one I'm at and throw it to the nearest TV. The other smart thing it could do  is work out if the audio is coming from the TV or if it's coming from me based on where the sound's  coming from. So that's not that, you know, as you start to put more microphones and detectors in  this, it gets a better sense of the space that it's in. So sort of room level awareness becomes more

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a part of it. It's kind of the genesis of this conversation is that it was the Google Home,  which can do that, by the way, they demonstrated throwing something up on the TV is just really a  fancy Chromecast. And I thought that was kind of interesting, Stacey, that it's,  if you add a microphone to a Chromecast, you still have to have it. I guess it's still connecting to  a server at Google and analyzing what you're saying and all of that. But you don't need a lot  of processor on that thing just to recognize the trigger word. What would you would need?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You would need a couple things. You'd need a little bit of memory to kind of buffer so it can  start listening and play that back. You would need a signal processor. So I mean, everything  that has voice recognition needs a digital analog signal processor. And then let's see,  what else would you need? Boop, boop, boop, boop. Because right now the Chromecast doesn't,  you need all the mics and stuff like that. Chromecast doesn't have that. And then you need to  process some sort of algorithm that says, hey, I'm doing the math on where all these sounds came  from. And that person is over there. So orient that way. But yeah, you don't.  Speaker? A speaker?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the Chromecast has a speaker. Yeah. Well, the Chromecast connects to the TV,  so it has speakers. And the other thing that's slightly odd about these is you're playing music  through basically a mono speaker sitting in the wrong place in your room. Whereas I have very good  speakers attached to the TV that I can play music through already. So that's the other part. So why  am I buying the standalone box when I've got most of the pieces I need for this already?  But the thing that the Alexa did was put in multiple microphones so they could actually  spatially do spatial differentiation and do that kind of signal processing. You need to say...  That's one thing that I don't...  That's one person speaking. That's another person speaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Those array mics are amazing on the Alexa. That's something that I presume the Google Home  won't have. Oh, I imagine they could put that in there.  They will. That's not hard to do. It's not expensive.  I'm expecting, by the way, that that person crawling under me is connecting our Echo. Just  don't pay no attention to that. Yeah, right below you.  Pay no attention to the man under the table or the woman. That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you want Echo... So Leo, you're next home. You could install the entire house with array mics

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and get rid of the YouTube box. Yeah, but see, the mic... See that? I think,  yes, of course, but that's never going to happen any more than I'm going to put a whole home surge  suppressor in. It's just not... It's less practical. Somebody will do that, but much more likely what  will happen is you'll have, like I said, a mail piece and you'll have a few different things on  there and just use the appropriate trigger word. For instance, the Echo can read my audible books  and order stuff at Amazon. I doubt the Google Home will do that, but the Google Home could put  stuff on my TV. I doubt the Echo will do that. So Jeff Bezos is probably accurate when he says  you may have many of these. It's not... What you're talking about is a science fiction future that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  may be a little ways off. I think a trigger and an API. Yeah. Sure. That'd be better. Sure, that'd be

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  better. That's going to happen. You think so? Where I'll have a centralized server that'll know  which one to talk to. Yeah. Or there'll be one thing and you just tell... In a way, this is kind  of a disservice because... That's what Allo does, right? Oh yeah. Because you could just say, hey,  Amazon, order my books and that would happen. But if you've got to remember that Amazon  is actually her, Alexa, sorry. And then you have to remember that Apple is Siri and call her by

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  name. That's just really too much brain power. No, it should be... That's what Allo... That's to me,  the genius of what Google's doing is it's going to become an intermediary for you. You don't want to  order for Amazon. What you want to say is get me this book at the best price. Yeah. Well, also

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the other problem is for information, brands, news brands and information brands get totally  cut out because it'll just give you the answer. Well, but that's what's happening anyway. Nobody

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  goes to web pages anymore. All of this is change is shifting rapidly. Now, on the other hand,  Lisa says, why aren't we on the Echo's info list of... You can say, give me my morning briefing  and there's a bunch of check boxes with now a longer list of news sources. Why isn't our tech  news today one of those news sources? And we're going to try to get ahold of Amazon and figure out  how you get on that list. For a publisher, that's kind of like instant articles. That'd be a very  useful or an audio publisher, very useful thing to do. And what if people's brands start becoming...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right now, like you put design in for your masthead and all this, what if you spend a lot of  effort getting a very distinctive voice? Like my voice. Your voice would be ideal for... Hello,  Stacey. Oh my God. That would creep me out in the morning. I'm going to need coffee for that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you want the Barry White voice. Hey, Stacey. I see you. I want Sean Connery doing... Okay,  Stacey, I've got something for you. That would be cool. Well, that's what... I mean, that's  inevitable too, right? That TomTom did that years ago and Waze does it now. So then you have... Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so then maybe the New York Times gets some sort of weird... I don't know whose voice they can

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  commandeer, but... Not Saul Hansel's. That's all I know. Anybody but Saul? I'm sorry, Saul. I love  you, dude. He's not there anymore anyway. So... Should we say how many Echoes have been possibly  sold? That's what was... Yes. You threw me a Segway and I dumped over it. No, that's all right. This is  going to be the jump over the Segway show, I think. So Mary Maker, who is now at Kleiner Perkins,  Caulfield buyer. She's a... She wasn't an analyst for a long time and is now a venture capitalist,  has always has done for years her state of the internet deck and it is a 213 slide. And by the  way, when Mary Maker makes a slide, it is full of information. So there's a lot of content. I'd love...  Has any of you ever seen the speech that goes with this? You can... The one she does the code? Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yeah. I've watched that video. Yeah. I'd love to see that. All right. The video will be up soon.  Maybe not. Yeah, soon. Maybe already. I don't know. It was this morning, wasn't it? Stacey pointed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  us to one of the slides. Which slide is it, Stacey? 131? 131. That talks about the Amazon  Echo. And I don't know where she gets these numbers, but how many they've sold. And you know  what? It's... I don't know. That seems a lot to me. Four million. I feel like that's a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a pretty good install base. Yeah. I'm trying to think. I mean, Nest doesn't have that many

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in other IoT devices. This may be the best selling IoT device of all time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How many Chromecasts are there? That's a good question. 20 million, I think he said. 20.  It was in the keynote. I look it up, so I took notes on that. Yeah. And I think that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple TV is in a similar... So in one way, that's why we look at things like Apple TV and Google's  20 million Chromecasts as a wedge, as an entree into some sort of home automation system, because  those are going to get sold right now. 25 million. That's a good number.  That's a good number. Not bad. Apple TV's is roughly the same, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Echo hasn't been a consumer device until probably this holiday season. Until the Super  Bowl. Yeah. Yeah. Or the Super Bowl. Yeah. I mean, it came out last June. So almost a year ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is when it went on sale to normal people. And the ads, though, the Super Bowl ads were probably  its public debut, I would guess. Alex Baldwin. Alex Baldwin ordering cashmere socks. $400 cashmere  socks. I might add. The hair of baby llamas. The stupid router. The Google Round Hub apparently  is a Chromecast also. Or very similar there, too. So will it be able to do the things that  home is doing? Or is it just not loaded? Okay. Here's my... Yeah. Here's my... I'm sure they  can reverse that. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure they could. Here's my theory. It was like the Q or the Android.  What is the other Android? Dopey thing they made. Yeah. It was going to be... And then they said,  you know, let's make this home different. And sorry, OnHub. Bye. I think that this is going to  be another one of those Google abandonware projects. I'm sad to say. Well, it's a good way

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to do things in parallel. That's... Rather than say there's a strategy tax, there can only be one  answer. They'll still let several teams make different things and let the better horse win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's terrible for hardware. I mean, it's fine when it... I mean, it's not even fine when it's  software. But when you've actually purchased money for a thing and it stops working, people... That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  not... Well, I did not buy the OnHub because... When it stops working, it gets bad. Yeah. But I mean,  the hub should still keep working. There shouldn't be a reason for that to shut down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's going to work, but it was a very... It was a high priced, relatively average Wi-Fi access point.  And the only reason you, one would pay 200 bucks for it is if one thought it had promised that there  was more to it because it had all these antennas and all these weird... It had a speaker. It had  all these things in it that never really got used. It had a microphone that was used once to pair it  with your phone. Oh, it had a microphone in it? I didn't think it did. It had that audio pairing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  thing, I think. Well, maybe you... Maybe when they... No, no, that was... It makes a noise and your phone  detects it, I think. Oh, it was the other way around. Okay. So it had a speaker, but the speakers then

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  only used once. And so I think a lot of people bought the OnHub thinking, oh, there's going to  be some magic here. But I've learned my lesson. In fact... The magic will be a disappearing act?  Yeah, that's the magic. Bye. Because Ron Amadio reviewed it and he said, you know, this is kind  of a mediocre router. It's not very fast. Which, by the way, Google disputes... And I'm not going  to get in the middle of that one, but I didn't buy one. I'm glad I didn't. I think this is the...  There may not be a strategy tax to Google's strategy, but there is a tax. And that's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  user fatigue tax. Well, interestingly, when I said, why isn't there a microphone in the OnHub  router, the project lead at Google replied, we were worried about what people would think we were  doing with it, unless it was a clear use case. So there were actually... It was like a, oh, we don't  want to put microphones in things because we're already... People are already scared we're

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  surveilling them. They dumbed it down. That makes sense. I mean, when Google bought Nest, everyone  was like, oh my God, Google's going to know where we are in our homes. Well, as you pointed out last

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  week, Stacey, the Sonos has a speaker. The newest Sonos speaker has a microphone, I should say.  It does. It also has a speaker, but it has a microphone. It does. We're waiting for their API  to do something. To turn it on. Super cool. I don't know. I love the idea of talking to my house. I  really love the idea of somebody being my intermediary. I don't want to talk to Amazon  and then talk to Google. I want somebody to... And it probably will be Google, given their investment  in machine learning and AI. And search. And search, which is not a minor detail, to do what  Allo looks like it's doing, which is their new messaging app, which is you tell it what you want,  and then it figures out who it needs to talk to to get that done. That's a personal assistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it pulls up web content or apps or data or whatever the heck it be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. But I think part of that is that you do want not just a verbal response, you want a visual  response too. And that's the thing that... I think a lot of these bot things... Alexa is like about as  far as you can take a voice only response thing. And it works because there are a lot of things you  want to actually audio reply. So it works for audible and it works for music. And it works for  buying things you already know what they are. But if you actually need to choose what you want to buy,  then you actually want a visual display for that. And otherwise it sort of descends  as just being IVR. What's IVR? Chatbots? Like what you see on...  When you phone up Comcast and it... Oh, a phone tree kind of a stupid...  Phone tree kind of things. Interactive voice response is what it stands for.  Interactive voice response. And the problem with those is that they can sort of... They  can't really hold a conversation. They can pull out a few keywords. And partly that's  microphony and partly that's because they were designed in a different world. But a lot of the  bot stuff does descend into that. It's like I'm trying to guess what magic word will trigger this  action. Whereas Google is actually fairly good at understanding... Natural language, right?  Give it a few words because they've got the corpus of search for that and they've got a large amount

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of voice search as well. If there's a flaw with the Echo, it's that you have to know exactly  precisely what to ask for and what the syntax is. And it's often disjointed. Simply for Siri. Siri

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  basically has a bunch of specific voice commands and then some smart responses. And then otherwise  it throws it out to a search but it's not as good a search. So I think that what I got from that  keynote at Google was, oh, you think you understand conversation AI? Guess what we've been doing for  15 years. Right. Right. Exactly. So that was... Even though they were those products that were  vaporware, the technology underneath it isn't. Whereas the other ones the other way around.  Facebook is saying, oh yes, we've got Messenger and you'll be able to ask it things but actually  we've got a room full of people who are responding to it and that's why we can't expand its use  user base beyond a few thousand at the moment. I got an invitation to this. This is Finn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sam Lesson created this. So Sam, you may remember, did my favorite project that was killed by another  big company called Drop.io. Then Facebook hired him, killed it. He did the timeline on Facebook,  his wife Jessica of course runs the information. He worked there briefly but this is what he was  stealthily doing. And I just got an invitation to this. Finn fixes your phone and lets you live in  the future. Okay, so here's the problem. It's 150 bucks a month. A month. Well, I'm thinking  it must be a human on the other end. 150 a month. Wow. At that price. They probably fall back to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  humans. Huh? Yeah, M is humans. They fall back to humans though. So you do as much as you can and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  then you route it to a human. Right. So I'm very tempted. Unfortunately, it's iPhone only. So I'd  have to, I have an iPhone. I guess I'd put it on my iPhone. And I wouldn't keep it for more than a  month but I'm just curious what it's going to do. Should I join it just to be the guinea pig?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just like you have to ask us. Like you're not going to do it. Do it. So I will say there's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  couple themes that are happening here and it's worth like pulling them apart. One is the idea  that voice is going to be like the best way to interact in every situation. And I don't think  that's true. Because what Kevin is saying about throwing things to a screen does make sense in  a lot of cases. The other thing that we're talking about is it's worth clarifying how computers  speak in, not speak, sorry, understand when we speak, what they're actually doing.  Because it requires a bunch of different data sets. And in some cases, like  Google owns its own speech recognition engine. Amazon, I believe licenses theirs from Nuance.  So there's like little things there. And then when it actually comes time to saying,  oh, this is what I heard you say, which is one process, and then applying that process to some  action is completely different, like machine learning process. What Kevin was saying about  Google having all this data on search is really going to come in handy because right now the echo  can't, it has no depth to it when you ask it complicated questions. And when you saw Sundar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, not only that, Stacey. Oh, yeah. Sorry. Not only that, but also, I'm sorry,  this is the lag is making me rude. Google also knows you as an individual, it knows things about  you. And it's farther along in that antecedent problem, the natural language processing. So the  ability to have a real conversation is where the real war is. You have Microsoft, Apple, Amazon,  Facebook reportedly, all trying to do this. And I agree with you. I think your premise is right. I  think you're right that Google is necessarily far ahead. The piece that was on for me about the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google Home demo was that it, the video thing at least, implied that it knew everyone in the  family's calendar and would share it with everyone else in the family, which works with certain kinds  of families and goes horribly wrong with other kinds of families. Well, also, we know that it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  only works with one Google account. So this is a really interesting question, Mark. I think that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that video may not have been accurate. Well, they were implying it worked with everyone's Google  account. One account per home is what they've come out with. See, this gets into like a great-  So that makes more sense. Because the thing they did, the thing they got a consent decree against  them with bars was this presumption that the people in your address book are the people you  want to communicate with and therefore we should let them communicate with you. And that caused  all kinds of trouble with people who were trying to escape from abusive husbands and so on. And you  have the same problem. The other problem with talking to your house is that it assumes everyone  in the house wants to share everything with everyone else in the house. You don't actually  want necessarily your private messages appearing on the TV or being spoken to the entire house  because the context depends on who's there. And one of the advantages of everyone having  their own little screen in their pocket is that they can walk around and have semi-public conversations  depending on who they're living with. And even getting out of the family thing, you don't  necessarily trust your roommates with that kind of power over your life. So there's a structural  thing there that is the home model has this sort of conceptual, you know, 1950s nuclear family,  everyone knows everything about everyone else's life, implicitly built into it. And you know,  Amazon kind of had the same thing there. Their pitch ads are this like wonderful nuclear family  that shares everything. And the kids are usefully young enough for that to be plausible.  But once the kids get to 18, that doesn't really map. Here's if you have a vision of the future,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did just pay for Finn. And here's their privacy policy. Finn is a personalized information service.  The more information we collect about you, the more interesting and useful your experience will be.  We collect data you provide to us as well as data from the devices you use to access the service.  All of the information you provide to us may be shared with other users. Wait, what? Though we take  steps to remove certain information, they identify you in your contacts before it's shared.  If you're not comfortable sharing data with Finn as described in this policy, please do not use  this service. And then there's the actual, you know, legal 80 pages. But you know what, if you're  going to participate in this at 150 bucks, you're really kind of, you're buying in.  You're buying into this and you're well, I'm not gonna pay 150 bucks if Finn doesn't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  everything about me. True. Only once in life did I have an assistant when I started EW.  I didn't know I couldn't manager. I was so unused to having this idea. Yeah. Yeah. And so I don't  have that reflex of telling someone to do things for me. I used to be an assistant when I was

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  16 and they shouldn't have too many things to tell you. What do you mean?  After about a month, it was a friend of mine, we started out babysitting for this guy who was like  an oil attorney. He was always in Kazakhstan. I'm an oil attorney. I don't know how legit this was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do legal for oil. That's all you need to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But he would, like after a month, we knew what he needed. Like, you know, like, oh, it's Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Expensive. You intuit it. Yeah. The first month is painful. But eventually you get there, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And, you know, oh man, I was going to say something about  this, but now I can't remember. I'm sorry. I interrupted. No.  The family shared. Oh, sharing. Yeah. So here's, this is something that actually comes up a lot  with our show and the internet of things type stuff is the idea that the home should have an  email account, which we all are like, oh, that sucks. But when you think about all of these  devices, there's no way to share, you know, what's happening is as we move computer from these  personal screens to this amorphous vocal blob or even screens on the television, the idea is  you're going to have to come up with a model for sharing information and then figuring out who gets  what information. And we're going to get to sharing it with everyone first before we can  figure out who to share what with. Yeah. Yeah. Which is, you know, in a sense,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that's how a lot of these services work. We start a lot of the web services, we started out sharing  stuff globally, like blogging or, you know, like, live Facebooking your baby's births,  unintentional. No, no, I mean, like you would post events publicly, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Finn remind me to cancel you next month. Oh, sorry. I just didn't want to forget.  Do you think Finn will remember? Remind me. There's your test. So it's like, so Andy  Bowe is bringing back Upcoming. Upcoming.org? You're kidding. So Andy, so the story of that  is a long and pretty and painful story. Andy Bowe, who did, who's a wonderful guy, did Waxie Links,  had an invite system like Evite, right? Called Upcoming. Didn't Yahoo buy it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then he bought it back. Right. And so what he's just launched is they've revived the archive of  it. Oh, my old invitations. So all the old URLs that resolve now resolve again. So suddenly  all the links that were dead are alive again, which is kind of fun. Look at this. This is the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  front page. You crazy bastards. What have you done? Now I have to rebuild Upcoming.org. Right. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that's the... I love Andy. I put the link in the bottom of the spreadsheet, but basically,  oh, historical archive is live. There you go. So click on that.  I'm not a backer though. So it's, it's, it's, it's their public URL saying, I'll find you a URL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. It says for backers only. Wow. So he, he kickstarted. I tweeted something. If you go to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  my Twitter account, you'll see some upcoming links. Sorry. So he, so he, he kickstarted

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and got $104,000 to bring back Upcoming. That's nice. Yeah. And he's just brought back

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the archive. So suddenly all the upcoming links that have been dead for,  for have a long idea since Yahu Shat Dan are all back, which is kind of fun.  See if I can find one. Hold on. Because yeah, once you get into one, you can find the rest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I, I'm not, should I go to your Twitter and do that? Well, if you search for Kevin Mark's  Upcoming, you should find it. All right. And Twitter. And so what is the reason why would I  want to know about the parties you had 10 years ago? And he's trying to bring it. He is going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  revive it back so that it's, you can create new ones again. But the, but the first, the first step  on the process was bringing back the old ones. It's fascinating. Frankly. All right. Let's take a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  break and come back with more Kevin Marks is here. We're going to find out what, how he was  partying in 1999. But right now he's, he said his house, kevinmarks.com and the Indie webcam. We'll  talk about that from Berlin. What are you doing in Berlin? Are you there for a conference? Of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you are going. Ashleigh Springer. I've talked about before of Leistung, Schutze, correct fame is having  in a small event tomorrow about distributed content, which would be fascinating. I'm keen  already. Then I'm going to Google news guys to build out. And then I'm going to keynote a, or  open a Google play event, which is very interesting these days, given all the discussion we've had  about instant apps and, and such in London. And then I'm flying back next Wednesday and it can be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  right on the show. Well, have a fun time out there. And from Stacy on iot.com, it's Stacy Higginbotham,  our newest regular on the show. So nice to have you, Stacy. Our show today brought to you by the  thing I have in here that keeps me from losing everything. It's my tracker. And you know,  actually what I do is I put the tracker and this is such a little tiny thing. It's so nice  on my keys, but then I chain my keys to my backpack and that way I never lose either the  tracker. You got to check this out. thetrackr.com makes losing things a thing of the past. This is  the new tracker. Bravo. It is gorgeous. It's very thin, very light. And right now for father's day  through June 13th only, they've got a father's day sale and you use a promo code twig, you'll get a  free color upgrade. And when you buy two devices, you'll get two free say I think if my math is  correct, that's half off. Half off free color upgrade when you use a promo code twig. And two  devices get two free and you're going to want for because you want to put them on everything.  You want to put them in your keys, you want to put them on your phone, you want to put actually  don't need to if you have it on your keys, I'll tell you how it can keep track of your phone.  Put it on your remote control, put it on your doggy on your kitty cat, they're light, they're easy.  And what's neat about this, it's got a battery in it. So you don't have to recharge it battery  lasts at least a year. It's so it's always on. If you if you've misplaced your phone, you press  a button on the tracker, your phone rings. Even if the phone silenced. When you of course, the  tracker software is on your phone and it's paired to your tracker. If you will lose your keys or  whatever the trackers attached to you just look on the tracker app on your phone and it'll tell  you where it is. It records your items last known location on the map. But this is the thing that  really the secret sauce that really makes tracker cool is their crowd sourced GPS network. It's a  largest crowd GPS network in the world with a million and a half devices. If you scroll down  on the web page, Carson, you'll see the map of all the tracker devices out there. Now, if you  with any tracker user comes within 100 feet of your item, it's going to ping you you'll receive  a GPS update. It's like it's like having buddies all over the country saying, I saw your keys here.  They partnered with companies like HP allowing companies build trackable products right into  their stuff. And that'll utilize the scale of the trackers crowd GPS network. So there'll be laptops  with tracker in them and so forth. It's Bluetooth le. That's why the battery lasts so long. They make  water resistant cases as well. So you could put it in your pet's collar. You'll never lose a thing  again with the tracker. The hardest thing you'll ever have to find the website. But I'm going to  spell it for you. Make it easy. T H E T R A C K R. There's no E. The tracker.com and don't miss again  that Father's Day limited time sale through June 13th only by two devices. Get two free and just  for you use the promo code twig and you can get the color of your free color upgrade on all of them.  The tracker dot com promo code twig. Love my trackers. I got many of them  continuing on this week in Google talking about not just Google but  well lately a lot on iot. I'm sorry Stacey to be stepping a little bit into your

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh no, I thought that was just for my benefit. So I'd have something to talk about. Not at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What else in this Mary Meeker slide this 213 page slide deck? I love this. iPhone sales may have  peaked in 2015 while Amazon Echo sales begin to take off. That's interesting, isn't it? She talks  about cars and you pointed out Stacey, you said one of the interesting things is the auto industry

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  may be coming back to the U.S. Yes, because we obviously went over to Japan and now we're  moving back to tech and she pointed out like Uber and Google's all of the AI there. It's actually  kind of cool. I also I liked the Ford in the effort to create new metrics around automobiles. So instead  I love tech metrics because they're always so hilarious to me. They're like we'll make up  something that works for us. But instead of cars sold, Ford's talking the CEO of Ford is quoted  in there is talking about the amount of miles driven. So are they driven? But it makes sense  if you're thinking about like car sharing, Uber or even things like Ford has this app, the Ford  Pass app where they just want to be like a concierge for your travel experience where it  helps you find parking and all these other things. So I thought that was kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We had a really great interview this morning with Kevin Kelly. It's a triangulation we're recording  for some time in the future and we talked about the book, his new book. I love Kevin Kelly,  one of the smart guys, just really fun to talk to. And his book is all about the technologies  are going to change in the next few decades and embracing those technologies like autonomous  vehicles, like Uber. It was just it was fascinating. And so a lot of these trends that  Mary Meeker is talking about right now are if you extend them out, going to change our life  dramatically, he says the biggest change and I have to say I agree with him, is that intelligence  will be sprinkled into our stuff in a way kind of similar to electricity. When electricity  and power generation became widespread, there was this massive era of innovation because people  took their existing stuff and said, well, what happens if we electrify it? A farmer would say,  that pump, you know, we could electrify that. And he says, you're going to have the same kind of  explosive growth in the next decade as we start to put machine learning and AI into stuff all around

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  us. Isn't that interesting? So we talk about that again, IOT related and like I love visualizing what  my house is going to look like in 10 years. And if you think just around like intelligence into  things like thermostats, you're not going to have thermostats on your wall, right? People may not  carry, yeah. Yeah, people may not carry keys. I will make the controversial argument that you  could actually build things without windows, like apartment buildings without windows. That's so  dystopian, but in a place like China or where air quality is crazy, bad, you wouldn't, you may.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not the fix for air pollution I would hope for. Oh, just get rid of windows. Never go outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if you think about self-driving cars, this is kind of crazy. But if you could just call a  car when you needed it, you don't actually need a garage because you won't need a necessarily a  place to park your car. You could think about a model for cities or apartments where you have  like a parking garage down underneath that has access to maybe fewer cars, but you don't own it.  And if you've got a home, maybe there's like a neighborhood, I think about like neighborhood

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  mailbox centers. Well, why do you think Uber and Lyft and DD are investing so heavily in autonomy?  The last thing they want to do is have drivers. I mean, for one thing, these are  taxi companies that don't own any cabs. And now what they want to be is taxi companies that don't  own any drivers either. That's where the real money is. But then they will have to own the cabs,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  though. They will have to own the cabs. Then they'll have to own the cabs, you're right,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but it's cheaper to own hardware. Messy people driving them. People are messy. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's a bit. It's also a land use thing. So there was somebody sent out a stat this week  that 14% of land in Los Angeles is parking. Oh, that's in the slide deck. What? Yes. And 40% is  freeway. Yeah. Yeah. Get rid of both of those. But 14% is a huge amount if you think about it.  That's I mean, it's partly because it's a very spauly city and they don't put underground car  parks. But that's if you have, A, if you have better transit, that would help. If you have a  transit system like London's, then you don't need that much parking. But also, if once you start  being able to build vehicles that don't need to park because they're going to be reused by somebody  else, then that frees up that land as well. And that's one of those interesting theoretical  future things of like, well, we can get all that land back and build these little windowless  apartments that Stacey's talking about. And suddenly you could live in LA in a tiny box  and go to the beach whenever you feel like it. You could go to the beach with VR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And then we don't have to go outside. And so it'll be kind of like escape from New York with  snake Bliskin and a bunch of people who don't want to be inside. Now, did you guys? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know about Iceberg Homes? Have you heard about this? No, what's this? This is the other  strange London real estate trend. I hear they're melting. They're building  in the richer areas of London, they're building strange underground homes underneath the existing  ones because they're not allowed to build upwards, but they can build downwards. So Bill Gates did.  These sort of strange Russian oligarchs have like three stories of basement.  That is just creepy. Yeah, that's evil genius layer stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't see in this report that this is not evil genius layer, but I was looking for it and I  didn't see it. Stuff on VR, which kind of surprised me given all the bets in virtual reality that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  people are making. She didn't talk about that. You know, I'm starting to wonder if VR is going to be  all that. I love it. It's fun. We talked Sunday, Stacey. We talked about  VR sickness and the fact that it may be intractable. Oh yeah, that's right. That was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't just dream that. We were on a show together. Believe me, it's all going to be a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  blur any day now, Stacey. Like, dear God. I'm always on Twitter and I can't take it anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we were talking about an expert on VR. Guy had been working for decades with the  Air Force and simulators. Said, this isn't an accident. Technology is not going to make this  go away. It makes people sick because they're focusing. Their brain thinks that something is  at one distance and their eyes are telling them it's at another distance. And our cavemen bodies  are designed that if your eyes tell you one thing and your brain tells you another thing,  that you're hallucinating and you should throw up those mushrooms you ate. And so that's why you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  get nauseated. But the point is that there are two things to that. One is that there's actually two  ways we judge visual depth. One is by convergence. Right. But the other thing is there's two ways,  even with stereoscopy. So one is we judge depth by our eyes looking at the view and deciding how  far away it is. The other thing is that we move our head back and forth like that and see what  moves. And historically, VR has not been fast enough to let you do that thing. And Dana Boyd  did some great research on this. And there's a gender difference in how men and women perceive.  She said women really have more trouble. Women are more likely to try and do that. And that the  old VR systems wouldn't let you do that. And so they were more likely to be nauseated by it.  So you do think it's fixable? So it's fixable, but it needs to be, the lag time needs to be  low enough that you can actually use that mode. And the other thing, this also comes into when  you're shooting the VR video. This is the reason you have the 16 camera rigs, because that enables  you to do that kind of thing with your head, because you've actually got different camera views  you can interpolate between. Whereas if you've just got an omnidirectional lens, like the cheaper  ones, then you basically just got a sphere and you're looking around inside the sphere. So really  you're looking around with one eye and looking around a sphere, but you're presenting with two  eyes. So that is a subtle difference. The other thing that potentially will fix this is the  Magic Leap and the other ones that are doing this sort of diffuse field stuff where they can actually  overlay at different distances perceptually. So that is more speculative tech and harder to do,  but that implies that you're not having to be focused at infinity, but your eyes being converged  because you can actually make stuff appear where you want it to appear in 3D space. So he's right  in that the existing systems have not bothered worrying about that, because as he says, they  were putting them for fighter pilots and the fighter pilots are sort of pre-tuned to not get  nauseous because when they're spinning around in circles and so down. But also it's like modeling  the perception stuff and saying, can this stuff be fixed? Now I agree, yeah, it's a practical thing  that a lot of people do get made nauseous by or disoriented by these existing rigs and it's going

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to take some work to get that right. He also says that VR sickness in a percentage, and this is an  Air Force and Army study, the military thought it was about 10%, takes 24 hours to dissipate  and their recommendation is whatever you do after you end your sim is not pilot a plane or drive a  car because you're going to drive in the sun. So that's not good. Anyway, I wonder if Mary Meeker  knows something or if she just decided not to talk about it. I don't know. She didn't want a 400  slide show. Yeah, maybe she just ran out of slides. Do people care about their privacy? She asks,  or do they care about who has their data? This is slide 211. So I have a feeling the answer is going  to come quickly. Interesting. I guess she doesn't have an answer for that. At the end, she asked a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  question. You know, Pew did a study on this, gosh, maybe a couple months ago, and they talked about,  they offered people different scenarios on when they would share their data so people were happy.  I'm not even going to make them up because I can't even remember that far back, but there is data  on some of this. And there's also studies that show that people will give up, you know,  their social security number for a cookie. So... Well, their password for Mosbos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really? Their password for... Peanut butter, I get it. This is from January, the state of privacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in America. I really love these Pew research. 91% of adults agree or strongly agree that consumers  have lost control of their privacy. Americans express a consistent lack of confidence about  the security of everyday communications channels. Why wouldn't they? That's all we're reporting on  lately is how credit card companies and government agencies are being hacked. Incidentally,  those are the two that they have the least confidence in, you know, in terms of worried  about keeping records private and secure. Telephone company, cellular company, email  provider, cable TV company follow. For most Americans who are making decisions about sharing  the information in return for a product service or Mars bar, the context and conditions of the  transactions matter. This is what you were talking about. It depends, is the, you know,  the answer. For instance, 54% of Americans say it'd be worth trading off having surveillance  cameras in the office in order to improve workplace security and help reduce threats.  But a smart scenario, I mean, a smart thermostat that might save your energy costs and returns for  insight about your comings and goings was only acceptable by 27% of adults and not acceptable

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  by 55% trouble for Nests. I still see that as as techno panic that that will change as you see the  benefit as you save money. What's your pocketbook? People will say, and they know they're controlled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree with you. I think the most important takeaway is that is that they're paying attention  to who's got the information and what the, what the outcome is, which I think is, is positive.  That means that there is that calculation. They're not saying under no circumstances,  they're saying, well, given the right circumstances, I'd be willing to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think a lot of people don't understand though, how much information they are giving up  or sloughing off in their kind of digital lives and how that can be kind of re reconstituted to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  find out who they are, what they were doing. And I think, well, they're learning and I think that's  what's scaring them. That's probably where the techno panic's coming from. Yeah. Well, and also

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the way they ask that question is a little crazy. That that makes it sound like Nests is your parent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, now if we could follow you around, but make sure that you save energy, would that be okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm like, if anyone's monitoring my comings and goings, I'm like,  it's just a thermostat and Google. And no, no, Nests does not share their data with Google.  They're very, they are very clear about that because everyone's freaked out about Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. That's what makes me saddest about that story. Go ahead, Jeff. I go back to the story

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  from some years ago when I visited Google office in Munich and they handle privacy there and no  one complained to them about priority inbox because the service return was so valuable to people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although I will admit whenever I'm hunting down rumors or gossip about Google,  I don't use my Gmail account. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  will it make you feel better if Google's assistant has a backstory?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I saw that. I love that they're using Pixar people because everything Pixar creates is so  warm and fuzzy, but I thought that was really the head of Google doodle, Ryan Girmick and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  former Pixar animator Emma Coats, according to fast company or two of the artists crafting  the personality of the Google assistant. Well, I'm glad. I mean, we want it to be her, right?  Well, I don't know. Should we do? I think this is Sean Connery. Sean Connery.  Hello, Stasher.  Go out for a little walk. This is like one of the personalities, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's we're going to get actually to get Marvin the Paranoid Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're right. I'm sorry, Jeff. What did you say? I had a pain all up and down the diodes on my

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  list. Well, if you're going to give it a backstory, why not give it a name?  Oh, I'm sure they will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Why give it just one? This is this. Again, I'd rather just say, hey, Amazon,  order me some stuff. Hey, Google, find this for me. But like, if you're going to go through the  character development, and that's creepy as all get out. Let me let me pick my character because  I am sick of telling ladies what to do and having them like, I think it's kind of job. I don't know.  Oh, what was that?  Jarvis Jeeves. Yes, I could do Jarvis.  I like that one. I'll take that one.  But I just and who was it some VC was writing about how the echo made his kid rude. And it's  kind of we're thinking about because you're creating these characters. And I don't think that,  you know, kids are going to like suddenly stop being or, you know, go feral on us because of  this. But I think it's worth thinking about like, anthropomorphizing these commercial constructs,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  basically. This is an interesting thing that Kevin said earlier, Kevin Kelly said earlier in our  conversation is there's a tendency to kind of think of robots and AIs as slaves. And maybe even  an economic incentive to treat him that way. But he says, you know, what comes up is do we even with  a machine? Do we really want to treat a machine like a slave? And that raises ethical conundrums,  especially if, as people are doing, they're teaching robots to protect themselves by  having pain, you know, it would be analogous to pain. I don't know if it's pain like we have pain,  but pain protects us from accidentally burning or severing a limb, because we feel the heat.  A robot needs that same kind of pain to protect itself. Now if it feels pain, now is it okay to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  enslave it? It wouldn't feel pain. It would just be like, hey, this is hotter than you can technically

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  stand stop. Right. I mean, so this is what Blade Runner was about, says Reverb Mike, it was,  wasn't it? If you there was these are slave, these are these are robots that you're putting out there  in the mines, except that if you give them a past, now they have memories and suddenly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so yeah, you've gone off the anthropomorphizing. I can't say that much anthropomorphizing.  Yeah, although, so if you're concerned about this, read the profile in the New Yorkers  innovators issue on Sphero in using it to teach kids to code because at the end, they start talking  about like, the next gen product is going to be more like a pet for kids. And he is like,  the writer concludes with like, Hey, I'd be cool with this as long as I can turn it off. And the  CEO was like, yes, but if we do our job, you won't want you'll feel bad doing that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We talked to the founder about that, actually. Yeah, go ahead. Then half of this is the, the sort

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  of the other odd thing is that we trust the answers to come from the machine more than we trust the  answer to come from people. So, you know, the sort of this topic version of this is when they set up  scheduling software for companies that this became very, very bad for people because it was just  scheduling for the purpose of the business, not for the purposes of the people. And it didn't have  a model of, Oh, it would be a bad idea to change someone shift around every day. Because then they'd  have to make childcare arrangements. And because the computer was giving this answer, people would  accept that, Oh, the computer's given us the right answer, even though it had a model that wasn't,  wasn't functional. So the other half of this, you know, what we'll ask, we'll ask Google where this  is right or not. You know, Google gets things wrong every now and then, you know, Alexa, I got my  temperature wrong now by, by 16 degrees now. It's 96. 96. She didn't pull it from there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She wasn't sitting outside. Yeah. Local, local, super hyper. What is it, Jeff? You'd call it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  hyper local weather. If I was in one of these windowless parts, should I go outside? It says,  yes, 81 degrees. And I come outside and it's 96. Okay. But by that time we're going to have

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  sensors throughout your apartment. They're going to know you'll eat. That'll be fine. I'm not worried  about that. But the data, the data in people trusting, people trust what these things tell them.  They trust they're more likely to interact with something and forgive something. Like,  once you start a transaction with, you know, an AR human seeming character, you know, you're  probably going to keep going with it. And that's great benefit to the company. You'll share more  information with it because you'll trust it more. I don't know. Yeah. It's, it's a little scary.  I mean, do you guys say thank you to your echo when they, when she does something for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sometimes. Yeah. I'm constantly doing it. So yeah, I started in jest and now I mean it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. You're like, Oh, thanks for turning off my legs.  If you tell her that she actually will say you're welcome. I believe that's smart. Right. So that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  an interesting question. Do you get bad in German? You can end up with this thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Showing British in a loop that never ends. But isn't that okay. So here's a question. Is that  smart of Google to do that or Amazon to do that or not? Don't on the one hand, they want you to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  anthropomorphize, right? Right. Or no, maybe they don't. Well, the other thing is they want these to  be transactional conversations that in a human sense. So the point of the stuff Google was  demoing was that they can, they can maintain a sense of what you're talking about across more  than one interaction. And so in a sense saying thank you is a way of saying I've closed out this  interaction. So that would, that would be a useful signal as well. Well, it's like a copy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  or 10 for that's what it's like. It's Roger, Roger, Roger. Can't call it Roger, I guess.  Jeff, I'm sorry, you're left out because of this lag. Go ahead and say something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want no, I'm trying not to join in because I don't want to join in. It's the rude moment. So  no, I'm fine. I'll, I'll, I'll jump in. I'm just, I'm just trying not to do what I usually do in

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  these cases. Oh, be rude. We miss you. Where are you? Jeff? Who took? What did you do with Jeff?  Oops. Just dropped my memory card. There are holes all over the table. Let's take a break.  Come back with more women. I'm, I'm, I'm receiving an important notice from this  two year old in Alexa. We finally found this. So a week ago, I asked for this.  Here is a two year old, a little confused. Oh, you sent it to me. Oh man, I can't, I don't, I'm,  let me do an ad and then we'll see if we can find it. Thank you.  Our show today brought to you by Carbonite online backup. If we do have a lot of stuff on our  computers and we do, what are you doing to protect it? I hope you're backing up, but you know, think  about it. If you're backing up to a hard drive in your house or in your office, are you really backing  up? What if there's a fire or a flood or a sinkhole opens up and your house sinks in and disappears  forever and you were working, you come home and there's nothing left of your data, but a giant  hole in the ground. Then what will you do? What will you do? Well, if you have carbonite automatic  cloud backup, you just go to carbonite.com and say, here's my stuff carbonite for as little as  $5 a month. You can back up everything on your Mac or your PC. If you're in office or you have  servers, they have plans for you too. And the thing is it's, it's exactly what you want. It's automatic.  You don't have to think about it. In fact, you pay once a year and then just forget it. You got  peace of mind. You can see your data if you want to see, is it backing up? Is it there? You can log  on to any computer on your carbonite, to your carbon account on any computer and there's your stuff  or use your free apps and then you'll see your stuff. You can restore it anytime. Even if you  didn't have a disaster, it's actually a great way to upgrade a computer. You get an or get a new  computer, just move your carbonite account down to your data. You're good to go. It's continuous too.  So you change a file, boom, it's backed up. This is really important for ransomware.  So if you, you know, if you're a Windows user, you got to worry about this. This is a plague.  Viruses that get on your system, encrypt your data and then hold it up for ransom saying,  send us, you know, 40 bitcoins and we'll unlock your data. Well, you don't want to send them money.  You want to have your data. Don't be like that hospital in Southern California that paid  ransomware hackers $17,000. Not to mention the privacy violation fees, the HIPAA fees  that they're going to be paying all because they didn't have a good backup solution with carbonite  because you've got versioning. You just say, Hey, I don't, don't restore that version. The one before  it. That's the good one. And you're good to go. Carbonite is awesome. And it's always off site.  That's the other good part. Nothing can hurt your data. It's safe. It's on vacation. It's got its  feet up. It's relaxing in the climate controlled operations center at the carbonite cloud. Just  taking it easy. When you need it, it's ready to go right back to work for you. Go to carbonite.com  and try it free right now. Do use our offer code twig. That way you'll get two months free  when you purchase no credit card needed for the free trial.  Just give them that way. You don't have to worry. Oh no, it's done. They don't. They don't have your  credit card yet. But if you do decide to buy, and I think you will use the offer code twig two months  free, the only way the way to back it up, if you're going to back it up, do it right with carbonite.  Kevin Marx is here. Jeff Jarvis, Stacy Higginbotham. We're talking about the cloud,  the Google, the Facebook, the chat bots. What are progressive web apps, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I don't know if I like it. So that's what I'll be able to, Kevin will get to this too,  but I got wowed by that at IO. If you go to Washington Post only on your phone, not on  laptop, unfortunately, if you go to WashingtonPost.com slash PWA, you will see not only AMP at work where  it's lightning fast, but you'll also see that the thing basically downloads an entire kind of  edition of the Washington Post, and you can use it offline using something they call service workers.  That is a middleman between the browser and the server that can do things like cache content.  And so I don't need to go to the Washington Post app anymore. If I use the PWA, it's really pretty  damned amazing. And so I got all confused after IO, as we talked about it on that day from IO.  I was talking to somebody from Google today, in fact, in prep for the event I'm doing next week.  And by the way, Google does not pay me to do events. They pay expenses, but they don't pay  me anything. I'm not on the payroll. And he said, yeah, we recognize it's, what are we doing?  We killing the web? We're making the web better. We're killing apps? We're making apps better.  The combination of PWA and instant apps is very confusing for how we kind of just things up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So these are articles. So I tap it, boom, and it's in there. Boom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you can swipe left and right to get the next one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, and it's there right away too. That's actually a great experience. Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's navigation at the top. You can go to another section.  So now put it in airplane mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, really? It's not going to work anymore, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, ye of little faith.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  The ones it's already loaded.  So it's pre-cached. It's prefetched all this stuff.  Pre-cached. Yes. So if you click on those.  Wow. But it's done a lot. I mean, all these articles are still live. And I'm off.  Oh, wait a minute. I'm still on LTE. Hold on. Let me completely turn off everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Basically what happens is it grays out the ones it hasn't got cached.  Okay. Okay.  So if you go back to the top.  Go to the far right of the navbar.  You'll see that there are some blue ones and some blue ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Offline, offline. But it did get tagged.  But it got a lot of it.  It got a lot of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because you click through a bunch of tabs, it's got a lot of stories.  And the nice thing is the stories are really small because they're stored in AMP.  They don't have advertising on, which is the other reason this thing is so responsive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Right. No ad tech really can make a difference. Why would Google do that?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So I'm...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they'll add that in.  Oh, they'll add that in? But will they?  Oh, of course. Of course. Oh, this is AMP.  You can AMP add content. It's just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They can add ads back in. But the point is, you know...  And also, you don't need to log into the Washington Post to see the stories,  which is also another improvement over the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because my subscription has expired. So I'm very happy about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But basically, this is doing a combination of things.  It's the AMP thing, which is putting the pages into this very compact form  that's designed to be dynamically loaded.  And it's also the service worker idea,  which is the progressive web app of being able to do stuff offline first.  And there's two very good talks about this on the IOS site.  And I'm going to try to remember people's names, and I can remember their Twitter handles.  Jaffa the Cake and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's his real name, not his Twitter handle, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's his Twitter. And slightly late. So, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Slightly late and Jaffa the Cake.  Slightly late is Alex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What the hell is Jaffa the Cake?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no. Look, if you have a Twitter handle, that's fine. That's your name.  As far as I'm concerned, we can't be expected to remember your real name, too.  He's looking it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jake Augebald, yes.  Is Jake Augebald the Jaffa the Cake?  He's Jaffa the Cake. And slightly late is Alex.  So, anyway, the point is what they've done, what they've been promoting with this,  and the infrastructure being built into web standards for the last few years,  is that the idea of the service worker is that it can run when the browser window isn't open.  So, it'll run in the background.  And that lets you do various things.  One of the things it lets you do is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Download websites you never intend to go to before you get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No. It has to be within the same domain.  So, it has to be within...  Okay, okay.  It can't just go into an arbitrary bureau. It can only work within...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not a fan of prefetching, though. Right? I mean, that's especially on a mobile bandwidth  where you may be paying by the bike.  But that's the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's very light.  It's light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  If you're just fetching light pages like this, then it makes sense.  Yes, if you're prefetching ridiculous giant images or ridiculous ads,  then yes, it would be bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other thing it does, even when you're not offline,  if your connection is horribly slow, it'll make the experience better.  Right.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. So, the point is that it lets this thing, the service worker can run,  and it can intercept all the URLs for your site and check its cache first.  So, when you first run it, it caches the skeleton of the page.  And then, as you were clicking through those different tabs,  it was loading all the stories within that tab and prepopulating the cache with those.  So then, when you went offline, they were there already.  But the other hot thing that means if you're on the bar and you're going underground  and the thing's disappearing, you can still carry on reading it, it still feels responsive.  And so, that's a part of the point is it's in control of the cache.  And if you design the apps carefully, then they will run offline as well.  The other thing it will let you do is because you can receive notifications,  and then it can wake up and show you the notifications.  And then, the other thing that it lets you do is install it on the desktop as if it was an app.  It will prompt you to do that if you've used it a few times.  So then, you get an icon like, you know, get the Washington Post icon  like there on the bottom right somewhere there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you got that not because you downloaded an app,  because you'd read enough Washington Post pages that it decided you wanted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you can manually do it. I think I manually did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it would do it automatically as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It would do it automatically, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, I'm not sure I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, it'll give you a prompt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  So if you open it several times.  That's the prompt we already hate where you go to a web page and it says,  it'd be so much better if you had the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but in this case, all it does is put the icon.  You've already got the app.  So there's no actual download in the app delay.  It just puts the icon on your home page.  So if you keep using the Washington Post thing,  eventually you'll get a little pop up at the bottom.  And it'll say, do you want to keep this on your home page?  And you go, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're Mr. Open Web, so you're okay with this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, there was a certain amount of fuss about it this week,  post I.O., because debating about when they can be full screen  and what happens to URLs then.  They're still trying to work that piece out.  So the challenge is once they're full screen, then you lose the URL bar.  Oh, the other thing that's different is that on Android N,  on Android M, every web page shows up in the previous list thing,  the bottom, the little square, if you call that button.  With Android M, Chrome shows up as a tab on its own.  And then inside Chrome, it has its own tab of the pages  that are inside there and open.  You see?  It's a bit hard to do this, but I'm facing the other way.  Once these apps are installed, they get their own position in that  previously visited thing.  So the Washington Post is there as a first class app in that list as well.  So that's it's blurring the distinction between what's an app and what's a web page,  but it's doing it in a useful way in that it lets you start from a web page  and progressively enhance it with these features.  So the thing still behaves as a web page, but when you go to it on your phone,  you get this extra useful behavior.  And the offline stuff works in the service workers works in Firefox  and in Chrome on the desktop as well.  And in the Samsung browser and Opera, because those are all based on the same code base.  And as yet not in the Safari browser, and it's projected to come into Microsoft's browser Edge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And also, I talked to somebody today from Google about instant apps at the same time.  So as you remember from IO, you go to a web page, it has a link now.  The URL can go straight into an app and pull it up.  And so I asked, what's the value to, let's say, media?  And he said, well, this way you could have a deep experience like 360 or something else  you couldn't do on a web page or transactions or your app.  You can now pull onto the web.  And so the question is, does this make apps more likely to download the app  because you enjoyed it or less likely to download the app because you don't need it?  Don't know yet.  But I think at some point you're not going to know whether you're in an app or the web going forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  I mean, that's to me, the end game of this all makes sense,  which is that this is kind of all part and parcel of the same idea,  where you just get what you want and there's no more siloing.  It's just you get what you want.  I just worry that it is it going to only be the big publishers that benefit from this?  How? I guess if you're on WordPress.com, you'll be all right because they have instant or whatever it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was going to ask how hard is it for developers to implement?  I mean, because one of the issues for publishers is they're like, oh, we need an app,  we need a web page, we need this kind of app.  And now they've got to support Facebook.  And now this, I mean, like,  This may take away the need to do an app.  Well, yes, yes, I see that for the limited number of people.  It's for people on Android.  Yes. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  No, I think PWA will work on Chrome anywhere, but it's an absolutely works on Android.  I think.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Apple people don't really use Chrome because it's not the default browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But also work on Chrome on iOS because Chrome on iOS isn't really Chrome.  It's WebKit.  Yeah.  It's browser wrapped in WebKit.  So we're going to have to wait for Apple to put this in a WebKit for it to work on iOS.  Yeah.  Which, you know, it's a web standard.  They may pick it up.  It's it's it is an advantage thing, but you don't know with Apple.  Apple doesn't have a publisher app for these things.  So we just need to keep asking them for it.  In terms of how hard it is, it's not actually that hard to do.  Various people in the indie web community have been working on,  like, how do I add these kind of progressive web app stuff to my app?  And how do I make it enhance to my site and have make an announcement?  And it is there.  The minimal version of it is fairly straightforward.  Just adding the caching thing is about a page of code.  You have to think about the logic a little bit to make that work.  But it's a doable thing.  And it's something that I'm starting to see people are sort of putting it together as part of their  of their web presences.  And it's not like, oh, I've got to spend three months learning a framework.  It's much more like, oh, there's a few straightforward calls that I can create a service worker  and I can write some fetch call, some fetch tracking to see what I want to cache,  what I don't want to cache.  So it's some code, yes, but it's the kind of code that you can embed into things.  So I expect we'll start seeing it in things like known or WordPress or these other tools over time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good.  Stacey and I don't really, I won't speak for you, Stacey.  I have no idea what you're talking about.  I can't tell if this is good or bad.  I really can't.  I mean, it's on the surface of a good because everything's fast  and it works kind of off-line.  It's a good experience.  It's a great experience.  I can't tell if this is good for the web ecosystem.  I depend on you for that, Kevin Marks.  And if you like it, I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's one of the interesting things is Google launching these two sort of complementary  things at the same time, which was the instant apps and the BWA.  Yeah.  And this is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How are they?  How is instant apps?  Instant apps is the idea that when you need an app, let's say OpenTable that isn't installed,  it just takes enough of that app to do what you need it to do.  It seems to me to be most useful with a bot.  It's a packaging model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the point of that is that it's triggered by a search result.  Yeah, it's a URL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or it's also a URL to an element that is in an app that is in a different experience.  So you can now basically deep link into and pull from an app.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which we'll...  Present an experience.  Which we'll...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's actually making it more functionally useful.  So part of this is what this is trying to do is to get away from the,  I've got to download an app model to the, I can link to things with URLs and things will work.  And these...  Right.  And it's like URLs as the power.  And we had a bunch of attempts at this last year that involved, oh, I'll root all my URLs  through Facebook or I'll root my URLs for Apple.  And this is stepping back from that and saying, I can root the URLs  and they will get directly to the application in one of two different ways.  Now, the progressive web apps, it's directly URLs.  You're loading a web page.  And then in the background, the web page is caching some stuff and doing some more work.  So there's still an initial URL load.  With the app stuff, there's a bit more magic you have to do to set up the apps  and feed them into the search results so that they will show up there.  So there are fewer of those that exist.  And plus you've got to refactor your app and create it in such a way that it can be loaded  in smaller pieces.  So there is significantly...  There's this...  You've got to change...  You've basically got to still build an Android app and you've got to build it  in a particular way for that to work.  Whereas the website one is, I've already got a website.  I can add some code to the website that enhances it in this way.  So, you know, it depends what you have.  If you've already got an app, then you may be better off starting with the instant app stuff.  If what you've got is a website, the progressive web apps will make more sense for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about all the apps that want you to go...  I mean, like, I can't tell you how often I'm like, oh, download the app.  Nope.  If you don't have like Yelp, for example, if you don't have the app, you can't read a lot of reviews.  So is there an incentive for them to do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because it'll...  It's sampling, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The idea is...  Google says is, can you get enough...  Wherever you measure the engagement, do you get more engagement?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the question is, why is Yelp doing that to you?  Basically, that's Yelp being annoying and driving you away part of the time.  So they have built a model that the app installs the thing they want you to do,  and then they're trying to entice you to doing that through some other way.  So this gives them two alternative pathways to that, which is they could install part of the app  the app thing, or they can make the web part of Yelp more productive and useful.  And the challenge is, what Yelp actually wants is probably to be on your phone so it can sit in the  background and work out where you are and sell that information to people to throw ads at you.  Right.  So that's probably why they want the app installed.  I don't know.  I haven't got Yelp installed.  I don't know if it tracks you in that way.  But my guess would be part of the reason you want to have an app running  is that you can do that kind of surveillance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So in this, it gives more power to Google because then...  Or because it's going to give the data, they're going to collect more of the data.  You're going to be less inclined to actually download.  And I'm fine because I look at everything as a consumer, and I hate downloading apps  to get a piece of information.  But if you're a company building based on trying to sell my user data,  that's going to put you in a bind.  Yes?  Yes, possibly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does Google get more or less?  Say again?  Does Google get more or less data?  One thing that they said to me today was that if you're using instant apps,  that will prevent you from doing two things.  One is notifications because you didn't really sign up for the app to get notifications.  And number two, the developer can't get the IMEI and other data that they could  otherwise get if you downloaded the app.  So they're protecting the consumer there from giving over information for just  getting a chunk of the app as if it were a web page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  But then that means someone who wants to get that data, like a publisher or a  app developer, isn't going to really want to do this.  They won't want to build their app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unless you sample, quick question.  Unless you find that the sampling, the reach you get, if you get four times more  people to try it at all and a quarter of those download the app, are you net ahead or not?  We don't know yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  And that's the same thing, that's the trade-off I was saying about the  Washington Post app.  The Washington Post app is great because it's so much better than the  Washington Post experience as a person who doesn't subscribe to Washington Post.  But also, part of the reason that AMP exists is that the publishers have sort of  shot themselves in the foot with, or shot us in the foot every time you open the page.  It's like I've opened a page and somewhere like in a third of the screen is the thing  I was trying to read.  And then everything else is covered up by ads and click this to see the actual story  and here's some more outbrained nonsense at the bottom.  And the actual thing that I went there for isn't there.  So this is solving the user experience problem very, very well.  But it hasn't yet provided them with a parallel revenue stream.  Now, the thing is, those revenue streams are going away.  That was another thing that was in the MECA thing was number of people running ad blockers  on mobile is going up very strongly because the mobile experience has been destroyed by this.  And also because a big contributor to your mobile data bill, particularly if you're in  a place where you have a mobile data bill that's not bundled, is all this rubbish that's  downloaded in the background that is just trying to sell you stuff rather than the thing  you're actually trying to download in the first place.  So part of this is trying to remake that bargain in a way that's useful for both parties.  And the challenge is remaking that bargain so that the idea isn't, oh, we'll surveil you so  we can get another point on our advertising thing.  Because the other half of that is the surveillance space don't actually perform that much better.

Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to take a break because Jeff has to go and I don't want to lose him without a number.  So if you can give us a few more minutes, Jeff.  Oh, absolutely.  The back of the book, the numbers and the tips.  And I've got a little something with a grid on it to show you.  But first, it says Google.  Hmm.  A word from my new clothing supplier.  I love the Ministry of Supply.  Actually, these are, you know, I find these fascinating because this is clothing designed  by MIT graduates.  You know, this is high-tech clothing, a performance professional menswear company  that launched at MIT a couple of years ago.  They make work clothes, business clothes that are engineered by MIT-trained engineers to provide  technical benefits.  Body temperature regulation to keep you from getting too hot or too cold.  Sweat-wicking fibers to keep you dry.  Stretch so you can move freely.  Take a look at the Aviator 2 suit.  That's on the left there.  Ministry of Supply co-founder Jihan broke the Guinness World Record for fastest half  marathon in a suit.  He was wearing the Aviator 2 suit because it's a suit.  It looks sharp.  You can wear it to work.  But it's designed around a human body in motion, not static form like traditional suits.  Instead of woven fabric, it's got this really nice and I actually love this because I have  some shorts made out of this same material, warp knit material.  It's exceptionally lightweight and flexible.  And it's very practical.  You should get some of these, Jeff, because you travel a lot.  Yeah, I'm hooked.  I'm looking.  Stretchy material retains the structure and shape while enabling extreme movement and  flexibility.  Their clothes are easy to maintain.  They're wrinkle resistant.  You can wash and dry them at home.  No need to iron.  No dry cleaning.  For a traveler, these are awesome.  But they look sharp.  The Gemini dress shirt.  I got that one right here.  This is a traditional cotton dress shirt.  For men.  But it's a little bit.  It's blended cotton.  So it feels like cotton, but it's got temperature regulating phase change materials in it.  This is a NASA invention that stores and releases body heat based on the surrounding climate.  What?  Plus they have like things like laser cut ventilation at the underarm.  So your air keeps flowing there.  You keep cool.  It's a dress shirt that looks completely classic.  Looks beautiful.  But it is high tech.  It keeps you a steady, comfortable temperature all day long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ministry people from MIT could be fashionable.  They are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's a kind of fashion.  It's kind of like Pied Piper fashion.  It's like a cool Silicon Valley fashion.  Look at this.  I love this sweater.  They're telling me I should pronounce this Merino.  Merino wool sweater with coffee.  Is in the fabric for deodorizing.  I don't know any nicer way to put this.  It's a beautiful.  They have tees.  They have sweaters.  Ministry of supply dot com slash twig.  If you use the offer code twig, you'll get 15% off your first purchase shop.  Now the offer expires at the end of the month.

Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week, my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the Atlantic did a piece a couple days ago on how many stories  two newspapers published every day.  Oh, I saw this.  The Washington Post.  Mind boggling.  It is.  It is.  And it's, well, I'll give you the numbers first.  Washington Post publishes an average of 1200 stories, graphics, and videos per day.  That is to say chunks, but elements.  The Post editorial staff produces about 500 stories per day.  I think the Guardian runs around three, four hundred.  New York Times says they produce 150 articles a day during the week.  250 are weekends plus 65 blog posts a day.  Three hundred thirty basic graphics a month and so on.  So time is roughly 230 pieces of content per day.  That number has risen by more than 35% in the decade and so on.  And the point here is that that's a fine thing.  They produce all kinds of stuff, but no human being can read it all.  What do we do with the architecture of news sites?  We still have a home page that promotes maybe 2% of that amount.  And we look at it and think, OK, I know what the Post had today.  Same with the Post app.  Same with the Times.  All of them are the same.  The structure we have of getting people to the news they want is antiquated, irrelevant.  Mass media, one size fits all.  And even the editor, how do they expect us to say that we're informed know what's what based on this?  So it's just a little eye opening about how much stuff we produce.  Constantly, it's almost as many podcasts as you make in a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, a lot more expensive.  I mean, imagine the cost of that newsroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of it's I mean, a lot of it's content that you can churn out in like 30 minutes.  It's just a me too.  Yes, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know the journalist speaks.  Yes, you're right.  It's wasted effort.  It's wasted effort.  Well, maybe not.  It's kind of like demand media for the Dead Tree set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you want traffic.  For traffic's sake, you do what Stacey says.  Yes, you just rewrite everybody else.  Yeah, it sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You go in terrible circles.  It's like we now each story has 20 versions.  So we had that with that Google stories like we linked to one version, but the actual story was somewhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The from the chat room comes a number.  Theranos.  Elizabeth Holmes, who's the founder of Theranos, was listed as the richest woman in the world  in the latest lists of rich people, but has been downgraded.  Time magazine has downgraded her because it was based on the value of Theranos stock, which was  she has 50% of what was $4 billion.  Now that there is 9 billion,  9 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it Forbes or time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, for Forbes.  No, Forbes.  I thought it was Forbes.  Oh, was it Forbes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, I was just, hey, I'm going by the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's get our story straight here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There it is.  The Forbes has downgraded her.  They've revised her estimated net worth from $4.5 billion to nothing because unfortunately,  Theranos is under investigation and the stock is, I mean, the company,  it's not a publicly held company, so it doesn't have a public stock price, but  it's kind of widely thought that the value of Theranos is not quite 9 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But also the money she's taken has liquidation preference, which means that  it's gone below the point where she can get any money out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't go to her.  It goes to the investors first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Before we attack Elizabeth Holmes or this, let's just say this just makes a mockery of  these lists to begin with.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's made up anyway.  True that.  Yeah.  True that.  Thank you.  Stacey, you got anything you want to share with us?  A tip, a product, something you like?  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So people may know about this.  I just found out about it because actually I read about it in the New York Times, which is  a surprising place to read about technology from new technology, but it's an app called SideChef.  And it's awesome.  I like to cook and I always download stuff.  I don't download it.  I do it from my iPad, usually in the kitchen.  Then I'm constantly wiping my hands off to touch the screen to get to the next thing.  So what this does is the recipes are pretty limited, but you set it up.  It does a slideshow for when you add each ingredient and you can actually use your  voice to say next and then it'll just move right ahead.  So I love it.  I can show you on mine if you don't want to log in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this looks very cool.  Yeah.  Show us your screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  Here we go.  This is...  Can you see that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's too bright.  It's very bright.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Pull up the thing from the bottom and then slide the thing over in the...  There we go.  Pull up the thing from the bottom and slide the thing.  Are you an iPhone or Android?  I'm sorry.  I'm on an Android.  Pull the thing down from the top and slide the thing over.  It's all the same.  Top, bottom, it's the same.  I was like, what is the top and bottom?  Well, on an iPhone it's at the bottom.  It's a similar thing, yeah.  It's a similar thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that better?  Sort of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I can see it.  Okay.  Wait a minute.  You're making a grapefruit bourbon cocktail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, because they're fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is what it does.  Hold on.  I'll buy the water, one half cup, and sugar, one half cup in a pan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it walks you through it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, and I'm trying to put it in front of my screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Left is right and right is left.  Up is down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  So it gave me that.  It told me it read it out loud to me.  Next.  I don't know if it'll do it.  Next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, hold on.  I understand the idea.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So if you're talking too much, you obviously is going to get confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But oh, no.  Each time you do a recipe, you have to turn your voice activation on.  Okay.  Each time?  Yeah.  But you do this like once a day, right?  Right.  So it's using a battery power.  This is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I see.  Yeah.  This is great.  Yeah.  So the idea is a hands-free cookbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  And if they, I would love for them to integrate with more recipes.  Like if they put this on all recipes, I would actually pay money.  Me too.  That would be.  Yeah.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because I don't, I no longer, I just, I don't, I have a hundred cookbooks and I don't use them.  I just, I can look it up on the web.  And then, but this is nice because it walks you through.  It's like a little side chef sitting next to you.  I'm installing it right now.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So try it out.  See if y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's free.  What?  But if I'm serious, I would pay for, this is like total utility.  Totally would pay for it.  If it had more stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  2,500 is pretty good.  Does it have like the basics?  Or is it like all weird stuff?  You know what I'm saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I eat a lot of weird stuff.  So.  One syrup combined with water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One half.  It's talking to me.  Continue to make your grapefruit bourbon beverage.  It's an idiot drink.  Kevin, do you have anything you want to tell us?  IndieWebCamp, what's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, there's lots of IndieWebCamp news this week.  So IndieWebCamp.com has the details, but there's Homebrew Website Club tonight  in San Francisco and Los Angeles, I think.  Not in Portland this week.  There was one in Yerterberg and Brighton, but those are done.  Also this weekend coming up is the IndieWeb Summit  in Portland.  And that's a two or three day conference, depending on which bits you go to,  where you gather with other IndieWeb people, discuss your website and things you want to build,  and then build them and share them.  So that's this weekend in Portland.  If you're in the neighborhood or can get to Portland this weekend,  there are still some places available for that.  Very nice.  Yeah, there's a link at the top there says IndieWebCamp Summit June the 4th.  Yeah.  And you can...  And this is the schedule.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm dying to see your swag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You want to see my new Google case.  Well, first of all, we talked about this the other day.  These are those cases...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One more thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, go ahead.  Oh, sorry, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry.  So the other thing is that WebMention, the specification for telling a website  when you've linked to it, has got to candidate recommendation at the W3C.  Wow.  That's wonderful.  We've already built a bunch of implementations of it,  but now we're out seeking more implementations.  And the best way to test that, there's a site called WebMention.rocks.  And if you go there, that will tell you how to test your WebMention implementation  and send and receive them and show you if it works.  It's a validator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's awesome.  That's...  Congratulations.  That's a big deal getting W3C.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we're working through that.  And we've got other stuff coming through the social web working group.  There's a social web face-to-face in Portland.  Next week as well.  Trying to get more of these down.  WebMention is the first one to get candidate recommendations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So WebMention is kind of like a track back for the 21st century kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  So basically, if I post something and link to you,  and you have WebMention on your site, I call it and say,  hey, I've linked to you.  And then your site can go back and see what did that link mean?  Was it a like?  Was it a reply?  Was it RSVP to go into the conference?  That kind of thing.  It's a way of sending the information between sites directly  without having to crawl each other.  And we've already got something like 20 implementations done.  And we're working to bring them to some of the larger sites as well.  But it's definitely...  It's at a state now where we're reasonably confident with how it works.  We want more of us to try it out.  If you're coding, do do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very good.  Good.  We talked...  I don't know if you were here or not, Jeff,  when we talked about these cases.  They're on the Google Store.  Yeah, you ordered one.  And I ordered one.  There's a couple of different ways you can do this.  I got a map one.  This is Paris.  You know who spotted this map?  This is from Google Maps.  You know who spotted this?  Paul Therese.  Is that Paris?  I said, what?  How could you know that?  He says, because I got the same map on mine,  except his is blown up a little bit more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the periphery.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right there.  There's the...  Yeah.  And then there's...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So the idea is you specify the map.  You can make it anywhere you want.  It could be your home.  These things come with a NFC chip built into the back.  So let me pry this off my...  This is for the 6P.  I don't know if they...  Do they make them for the...  They must make it for the 5X.  But...  I don't know.  I think it's the 6P.  I think it might just be the 6P.  Oh.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My girlish hands cannot handle these giant phones here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.  It's kind of like...  It's...  They're discriminating.  All right.  I won't take that one off because I can't.  But this is the Jeff Koontz one.  Remember, they've used artists in the past.  Who was it last year?  I can't remember.  But I decided to go with Diana because that's pretty.  Princess of the Hunt or whatever she is.  And then here you can see very easily there's the NFC chip.  Now the idea is you press...  There's a little raised indent on here that you press it.  But you have to press it really hard.  And then it will...  The live case will launch the live case app on your phone.  And then you can have an appropriate slideshow of classical art or maps or different wallpaper and whatever.  But my experience has been...  And Mary Jo said this as well.  She has...  You got to press it like hard and see it's not even seeing the tag.  And don't get it for that reason.  It's kind of dopey.  But it's a nice case.  This would look better on a whiter 6P or maybe the gold 6P.  It doesn't look so great on the black one because it's such a light case.  But there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I think it says Nexus 5X 6P or 6.  Yay, Stacy can get it.  But I think...  I'm reading that in German so I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not sure if I would recommend it.  I would recommend it as a nice little thin light case.  I'm not sure that the live case feature works all that well.  Because you see I pressed it and it got nothing.  And you also have to press it really hard.  So it seemed like a good idea at the time.  I'm afraid I'm going to break my phone.  There we go.  Okay, see.  So now I get to choose my wallpaper.  I can say, okay, I'm going to have this be the wallpaper.  Tap that location.  And it should change it.  But I don't know.  Yeah, that feels real gimmicky.  I'm on marshmallow.  So I mean not marshmallow, nut roll.  So maybe it's a nut roll issue.  I don't know.  And you can have the locations of the places that you want to see.  And it's kind of dopey, isn't it?  Well, we had to try it out.  Stacy says I don't want it anyway.  That's what we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've got a clear thin case.  That's all you need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think you almost don't need a case on the 6P and the 5X.  They're pretty robust phones.  Unlike the Galaxy S7, which is made of glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I drop my phones all the time.  So I case them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe if you had a few grapefruit bourbon drinks,  it wouldn't be such a problem for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That could be my problem.  Actually, I want one now.  I was going to switch out the bourbon for gin though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Grapefruit gin.  That sounds perfect.  It's hot here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where is here again?  Where are you, Stacy?  Austin.  Austin is really hot.  Hashtag my live case.  Don't buy it.  Okay.  Thank you, Stacy.  Thank you.  Stacy Higginbotham.  Stacy on iot.com and of course the iot podcast with Kevin Toffle.  And that's every Tuesday.  She's on our show.  I'm happy to say every Wednesday.  Great to have you.  Welcome.  Also to Jeff Jarvis who is here every week.  He can make it.  He's in Berlin today.  Be back next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hope I'll be in next week.  If the United Airlines cooperates, I'll be there.  Always a question.  I'll be rushing into the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, good.  I look forward to seeing you again.  You too.  Kevin Marks, indywebcamp.com.  Where it is how hot?  Raise it a little higher.  96 degrees.  Is that your body temperature or the weather?  That's the weather.  It's cooler in Austin.  96.8 degrees in San Jose.  Oh my god.  Well, stay cool.  It's going up.  It's going up.  Pretty soon to be 98.6 and you can take your skin off.  I don't know what that means.  That's meaningless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
