Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How's it going Jeff? Hey, glad to be here. I was off last week, but I'm delighted to be back  Excellent you're back now and then I get the pleasure of podcasting with you next week at Google IO

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll talk all about that here. I can't wait for that. I know I'm really looking forward to next week also  Joining us here Stacey Higginbotham. How you doing Stacey? I'm doing well  It's great to see you again creator of the iot podcast at iot podcast.com  The Internet of Things newsletter at Stacey on iot or sometimes when I on iot.com when I look at that URL  I want to say onion  Stacey onion.com  Stacey onion.com, but that would make no sense whatsoever. It's just like a mind trick my eyes play. I have layers. Yes  Layers upon layers of Internet of Things things  Good to see you guys. There's been some big news and Stacey  I have to imagine the Amazon news from yesterday is probably top of mind for you being the queen bee of  Internet of Things. I don't know has anyone ever called you that before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, normally they just say that i'm the queen of various things but i'm okay with being you know a bee  Okay, so you know the connected zarina. Oh, I like that jeff  You are you are now my official like herald guy who gets to name me. I don't know why this was my herald face

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That makes sense to me  uh  So you so we were just talking prior to the show you are in the amazon echo  Eco the amazon echo system does that work? Oh, yes, see what we did there  Um, i'm not i'm in the google home world jeff. I think you're also in the google. I too have google home  Though I did order I did order you ordered the new what is it the echo show?  As they announced yesterday the echo show which is a screen a touch screen device  built with amazon powered underneath  So it does all the things that your standard  Echo device has already been able to do with all the the kind of recipes and stuff like that that that work underneath  Um the layer but skills. There you go. That's that's the word in this world in that ecosystem  Uh, but also the touch screen which allows you to do things like I don't know video call like in the future  What do you think about this stacy? Did we I mean we had kind of heard that this was going to happen at some point  Is this an answer to a call that you've had for a while now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  so  We did hear this was going to happen. It should be about oh and I should tell everyone who's excited about it  It's june 28th that this will be out. Yes. I already ordered mine  and  Actually, I tried out the calling function because to me  Less so the video calling but being able to call people from my echo is actually a really kind of cool thing  Um from my perspective so just being able to say and I have my echo on my desk and I was trying to think  I was going to call you guys on the air  but  But y'all aren't available. So now i'm gonna see  I'm gonna try to call right is it only echo to echo?  It is for now only to echo echo now if you have the echo app on your phone  I can call you from there, but I may need to already have your phone number in my contacts for it to work  I don't know  There's a lot of experimentation. I haven't done because I only got it this morning because i'm on android ios people got it last night

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Surely google will do it in the flash

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, I would think so they have I mean  Basically what you need is they're just piggybacking on my phone. Yeah, they use my phone number  So there's no reason google shouldn't be able to do it  Anyway  the show itself has the camera and what it it basically  I'm very excited about it. I'm a little concerned because the camera can't be like there's no shutter for the camera  This is my turning off the camera by flipping down the little shutter privacy shutter  So that's going to always be on I think that's going to give a lot of people pause  But maybe video calling will be significant enough that they're like, whoa

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did they include a a shutter?  Slider cover sort of thing in the um, what was it look? Yeah, they did not so amazon's basically making the bet

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  well  So it could be that they're just trying to find the right form factor for everyone  So you can put an echo in lots of things. I will say that i'm a little there  There's a company called nucleus that makes a echo based  Intercom system that you stick on the wall and basically what amazon has done here  kind of  Kills the need for that device. So i'm a little like in

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much was that was the cost of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  200 per or 150  Almost  Yeah, if you buy if you buy two, it's like 150 each I think  But amazon the alexa venture fund was the largest investor in the nucleus  So I talked to the ceo and he's he'll be on my show tomorrow  But he kind of looked at this as a betrayal of I mean he looked at it. It's like yeah great business decision  Big betrayal of the platform right there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you happen to ask him if there was any sort of like non-compete clause in their contract at all that that would state?  Because amazon was funding so much of their product that they're  I don't know that there were any rules built into their contract that would prevent such a  Thing because I mean the the products muried each other so closely

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, I did not ask him about that. I imagine he wouldn't have signed that nor would amazon have signed something like that. Yeah  I'm, not sure if amazon who who you think would have signed it, but I can't imagine that actually happening in business

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you're just buying equity. I I mean, you know, it could be you know, it could be a clause in any contract

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I just can't imagine it making it through the yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, right  Yeah, I mean he um, I read some interviews  With franko who is the ceo of nucleus and I mean it was it this has been a product for nine months now  Right around there five point six million dollars in funding  Um, and he he's calling this kind of a wake-up call for amazon partners to just be like look  You know this this was this was our big thing that we had a really great thing going here  And then suddenly you wake up you hear the rumors, but suddenly you wake up and you realize amazon's basically just uh,  You know taking your great idea and ran with it at the same time  It also seems like the obvious next step for a device like the amazon echo  um  So, I don't know. I don't know where to go with that. So the the screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The screen is an obvious thing because when you have voice  It is horribly inefficient to get a list of things like when I ask  You know, I the other day I was asking for comic book stores near me  And the echo was like started listing them and i'm like, ah too much information. It was it was a stupid request  uh, so  That makes sense  It makes sense if you think about video calling once you think about adding voice calling now  We were always kind of like could it could that be retrofitted? Apparently it can  and  you know, this is  It's obvious, but it's still kind of like dang  Dang jeff bezos, you're just merciless which we knew  Right, um, I should tell people it doesn't do 911  Um, they actually make you sign that away when you when you log on it's gonna say hey you acknowledge it. You can't do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So no help. I've fallen and I can't get up feature

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You could call someone who has a landline and they could call 911. I can't even does does skype do 911 now?  No, I don't think so. Even cell phones are really bad at 911 because you know years after we've  succumbed to the fact that nobody has a landline  We still don't have  Good e911 capabilities  Go government  Actually  Just last week or maybe the week before the fcc won a jessica rosenworcel who was one of the former fcc commissioners  She actually shouted shared data that said for the first time ever  Landlines were there were fewer landlines in homes than mobile phones. So more homes than  More homes had mobile phones as their primary phone as opposed to a landline

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right 50.8 percent of households only mobile in the second half of 2016. Wow, that's up from  48.3 percent a year earlier  Uh, and 6.5 percent only have landlines. Meanwhile, i'm moving  I have an appointment with sonic to get their internet. Finally. I've been on comcast for quite a few years  Finally having sonic install  They can only serve my house with fiber to the node not fiber to the home  So it's piggybacking on at&t's network  But that's you know sonic in the in the mix is better than no sonic in the mix as far as i'm concerned  um, but  Comes with it whether I want it to or not as far as I can tell I get a landline again. So  I get a phone of some sort. So uh, we've been without a landline for years and now suddenly we're getting one again  What's the speed? We don't even have a jack  The speed is 20 megabits  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pretty decent. So so i'm told verizon is gonna offer near gigabit  Both ways. Oh, wow  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well phios already had gigabit  both ways  uh  Didn't haven't they announced that  Or is that really new?  I don't know. I think it's but sorry i'm like wait a second. I thought they already had gigabit  I haven't gotten it yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, no, uh, no apparently they hadn't look at me. I am wrong. Sorry. No, no they had they've announced it. Yep. Nope. Nope  There's in files because it's 80 bucks a month for files gigabit. Okay. Oh, that's relatively cheap

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really nice though, that is pretty inexpensive maybe i'll finally come in okay on the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was gonna say imagine our our lag then

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lagency will be negative lag at that point

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Your computer can't handle it exactly your ancient smoking. It'll be on fire. You don't want that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, so the echo show you've ordered it stacey. You've ordered it. Uh, jeff. I ordered it  What so what what is your use case for this jeff you having not?  Already bought into the ecosystem

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not gonna be in my closet taking pictures of my clothes. I'll tell you that for sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, it'll be in your kitchen taking pictures of your food. I don't know. It's I I want to play with it journalistically

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to see I want to take it at school and and and I think  You know, it's kind of weird that it's a voice has some real strength as a as a uh, uh  Interactivity mechanism, but there's no visual. So now if you put voice and visual together, I wonder what that's like versus keyboard

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, like we're talking together  Right. Like actually yes, like what we're doing right now. Wait a minute

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's really weird no, but I mean it is it is a little different like I was thinking about this yesterday when I think  About when I was a kid  Thinking about the future the air quotes future. I definitely thought and the future we won't have phones  We'll have video phones which we kind of have right like for the last few years video calling is is no longer this obscure  Weird thing we're used to it  However, at the same time we don't use it nearly as much as when I was a kid  I thought we would in the future in air quotes, but something like this could actually get used a lot if you have a single console  Which I mean it has a lot of purposes, but it makes it really easy  Low friction to just go over to it and bloop. Hey mom, how's it going? Oh, I see you're busy  I don't want to bother you right now or whatever the case may be  You know versus like I just I don't think of picking up my phone and going I need to call someone  I'm going to make it a video call for some reason. You know what I mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It takes the device out of the equation  Yeah, it go you go from thought to action without any friction in between any extra steps  So it makes a lot of sense from that point. You're like, oh I should call my mom. Hey

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's gonna call mom, right and we just called mom on a lot of people's devices

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My echo is on mute, but I have an echo and i'm like sitting here. I could see if kevin will take my call  He might ignore it though  And you've so you've tried these calls at this point  Yeah, so kevin and I talked this morning we did a call this morning  Do you want me to see if I can call him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I I think that's what we do here  If we've given the opportunity we make on the fly calls for sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a lot call kevin tofel

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this is happening on your dot

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it goes green I don't know if you can tell us it's ringing okay. Yeah, I can see that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that a new color for that go it is a new color for that not used to seeing the green. Oh  I don't think kevin's answering he's watching he's like i'm not picking up  It's like no way i'm not picking up  I've been back. It's been a long time since he's been on the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's probably like nope. Yeah, I don't think so  Although here so this gets into another thing. I couldn't find a way to mute it  Which means suddenly we've got  If you have my phone number basically you can tell to call my home now in a way that  You could do when you had like a landline. Oh, oh it's ringing  Okay. Oh  Kevin tofu's calling me s l answer  Hey kevin i'm on twig and so are you I just wanted to show off the calling  Okay, was this irritating to you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, this is fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hi, kevin having a phone ring. Hey, we can't hear us. Yeah, you can't hear us

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. Thanks kevin. Bye kevin  See you next week at google i.o

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  hang up

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, well there it works and and I think you know  Another interesting part and you you mentioned this a little bit earlier is is not just these devices  It's in the app  So if you just have the app installed that app, I mean up until now that app has been all about managing  The hardware right for the most part now. It's like that app is becoming also  A messaging service which is kind of interesting but you're locked into amazon's messaging service. So it's yet another  Yet another trail  To to venture into if you're if you're getting into messaging

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Indeed and you're not but you're not sending these kind of messages and i'm sorry  Karsten at the beginning of the show  We should tell everybody  In the podcast to turn off their echoes turn the mics off on their echoes if you haven't done that already now might be a good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  time

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm a bad person

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will oh man. We didn't you didn't prepare people for that one. Uh, so, okay, so speaking of google  So we have amazon's announcement here  Uh nucleus by the way one comment before we move on that that I think he made  In that interview. I can't remember if it was that interview or a different one  Is that they believe and obviously amazon feels this way too that this is the trojan horse for this category is calling  is that  We've seen a lot of a lot of pickup in home, you know voice controlled speakers and in that market  Uh, I think there was a study  What is the study here it's uh  E-marketer forecast says that amazon will have 70.6 percent of the voice enabled speaker market in the u.s  This year google home 23.8 percent, but that those  Who buy one don't buy a competing one. So there's a lot of lock in there  Uh, it's not common for one person to buy  Devices on on both sides to have both an echo and a google home. So jeff you're an outlier  Um, but also but well and there you go. See i'm the only one that doesn't apparently, uh, so i'm the outlier  and uh  and that  Calling is going to be what moves these even further into the mainstream that it that it  I don't know justifies the product existing in people's homes. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it's it's also intended as a network effect

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it's the network effect, right?  If I buy one i'm gonna tell presumably my mom and say mom you gotta get this because you can just shout  Call stacy. That would be a terrible idea, but um

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or you could just drop in  That's another feature, right? Yes drop in feature. We do not want to forget the drop in feature, which is basically a way for you to  Select someone to opt in that that person can drop in on your video feed at any time that they choose

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Am I misunderstanding this? No, that's that's gonna do it. I mean this is this is for families  I mean, this is like what I would have in my house  It's the same thing of like people who check in on their family through the nest cam, right? All right  I mean, that's a good way to do it  That's a good way to think about the sex industry  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This just took a dark turn. I didn't see that. Oh man  Okay  I see the family example  Yeah, well, I mean I guess so because you know, like I have I have a ring  Outside and it's got a video feed on it. Obviously someone rings the doorbell ring by the way as a sponsor  Just a full disclosure, but uh, someone hits  Hits the bell I get a notification on my phone and I have the ability to jump in on the video feed  And yeah, there have been many times where I get that I look at it and I know hey my my kids and my wife  They just arrived home. Okay, cool. You know, I know that now for whatever valuable reason that is  But I guess it's kind of the same thing. It just happens to be in your kitchen or the kitchen of  Let's say your elderly parents is one example that I that I saw  Uh put about so I guess I kind of see that just and speaking of rings weird

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Your ring will be integrated into the echo show the video from your ring. Oh, really? Oh, that's so if you're upstairs  And you know, you've got one upstairs in your phone or not your phone your doorbell rings and your phone somewhere else  You can just be like boom

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's on the video will pop up? Do they also imagine it's an intercom within the house?  So that's a weird, you know, I I did see that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, I haven't figured out how to do that yet again  Everyone everyone leaves me during the day so I can't make my husband and daughter play with me on all these devices

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So i'm like, ah, you have to list your dog, obviously

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, she's smart, but she doesn't she's not very obedient. I don't know if you notice that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How to talk to the amazon echo?  Um, yeah, that would be that would be really cool to be able to talk between devices. I suppose if you had a large enough house

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Probably need a house. Otherwise it also I should say they're also talking about working with your arlo cameras  So if you've got the net your arlo cameras, you can actually see like what's going on outside your house or at a camera?  Wherever one of your cameras is so suddenly you've got this security console basically that's on your kitchen, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Accessible at all times anyone can walk up to it tap it and get going nice  Um cool. So so then I was gonna segue a little bit earlier  um  Do we think that google's working on something similar?  I mean they have to be right like it's they have to be it's obvious that you need a screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah  Stacey's grinning

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I so I think you need a screen. I don't think it actually has to be on the device  And that's where I think this gets really interesting  Like I I was kind of disappointed that amazon didn't say hey, you know, it'd be really cool  Let's turn whatever  Let's say I ask the echo for something like the list for comic book stores  Instead of telling me what has she realized that is a really lengthy thing and just sent it to my phone screen, right?  and and  To be sure today that happens in the app, but let's say the same way when you send a google like when you're on  Uh when you're on maps on your browser in your desktop  You can actually send directions to your phone and you get like a notification it just pops up and it's like  So imagine you got a notification with the list of comic book stores, right or  You got it on your television screen if it decided that's where you want if you told it. That's where you wanted it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there so stacey. I was wondering about that. What's the installed base of chromecast versus amazon fire?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Any idea gotta think chromecast is higher. I don't have it. It's way higher

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So so if you look at amazon versus google on this, so if if you're right jason if google is building it  advantages  Um, it's interesting that amazon the video they showed was a youtube video  So they're acknowledging, you know the the rest of the world. Um  but uh  So google has the advantage of chromecast. So whatever it does can communicate with that  It has your photos  It has your email  Has your contacts?  Uh, it has a phone service already  So you want to get to my crazy idea? What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You ready for this you guys all right amazon should relaunch their phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Boom fire phone 2.0, but don't call a fire phone call it the echo phone. Yeah, right integrate it with the with the echo  sphere

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know. So so because this is what i've been thinking i'm like, oh, you know if you're going to build an ecosystem go all in  um  I don't know  Some people really liked the fire phone too and it ties back into all their shopping because  and again  When amazon if you buy this and they have access to  A camera looking in in your home, especially in your kitchen  Think about all the data they can start gathering. They're going to know what products you eat  What products you cook with?  They're going to know who's in the kitchen with you and you know, that's  Yes  Yeah  Probably not  I mean from a privacy standpoint the the only nice thing about amazon is  They don't share that data with anyone. They want you they want all that data so they can tell you what to buy  They don't want to give it to anyone else  So yay for that. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean I could actually really see amazon trying again with the phone if if the fire phone wasn't such a spectacular  Failure as it was or at least as it was reported  Widely and and seen by people I can understand why amazon's hesitant but I could see what's coming back

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But apple went and made the ipod really useful. I mean, I don't know. Yes. I think it was a spectacular failure, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it but it is I mean it is an obvious category  When you think about what amazon is doing from a technological perspective around  The echo  The capabilities of the echo and their fire tablets fire tablets is basically, you know  Usually you think of tablets going kind of hand in hand with you know, the smaller form factor phone  Uh, the only reason amazon doesn't have a phone right now is because the fire phone didn't work so well  But maybe it was because they they hadn't learned certain lessons that they know now  Maybe they could do it again and they could do it. Right? I could totally see if they just put out an android

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know go ahead and put out a full android phone but add other features but you know, then again, all right  So stacy, let me think about it  Why do they need the hardware?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  um  They would need the hardware to have control like if they can't get their app on a phone basically, so I guess any android phone  Let me ask you this and and i'm not trying to answer your question with the question  But why do they have for like all the amazon video stuff you have to download a separate app store to put that on your phone  Is that just drm based or is there some other deeper technical reason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've not known the reason yet. It is a pain by the way when I have to rebuild a phone or a tablet. It's royal pain  So I don't make it obvious or easy

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so I I actually don't know if they need the hardware or they just do that for  I mean, I mean I'm not sure if they're  Making my life a little bit more difficult in your life a little difficult  but um  It gives them  It gives them more data  It gives them a place to automatically send stuff in the ecosystem. I guess it gives them better messaging  Uh, I don't know what else it gives them you on the go so you could talk to I mean you could do that through the app

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean what's more personal about a person than how they use their phone particularly if amazon's goal is to learn more about you  And help you buy things through them  Having a phone on your person is incredibly valuable to gathering that information in the same way that it is from  You know device in your kitchen is is informative to them about what you know  What items you need when you're in the kitchen that that you might be able to buy from there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's i'm like actually what's more personal than that. I would argue that all the data that's coming from my home  Because there's a lot of stuff my phone doesn't see that my house does that's true  creepy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This coming from stacy did you did you order the um, uh the amazon, uh camera thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I put my less myself on the invite for the look which is the style camera. That's right. Yeah. Thank you  Okay, and then the show  I also I I bought that or I ordered it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they allowed they allowed you to do that yesterday with the with the look you had to do a pre-order  And I just realized there is a camera cover for the look  It's the closet that you put it in when you close the doors, which is what they showed in their promotional video

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm like I change in my closet that thing's not going in my closet  I I I really honestly so like  I'm very concerned about the show like as I think about it and  I obviously have to try it because this is my job and I will but  I don't really know if I want an always on camera that's going to be sitting in my house  I mean I do know that I don't want that actually and they haven't so far given me compelling value to be like  Hot diggity, let's leave that sucker in all the time, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's I mean, yeah, it's just  There's just that disconnect of an internet connected device with an always on camera that resides in your bedroom  Which you know one of its main purposes is to allow you to dress in front of it  And it can tell you whether you look good or not. You can think of a million reasons why that sentence  Does not compute for a lot of people  From a product standpoint. I have I have a really hard time thinking that a product like the look could actually gain traction  But I guess there are people out there that that don't care. It's the benefit outweighs the potential

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So  Someone is saying that the amazon the camera is not always on on the echo show  And I don't know if that's true or not  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is it a queuing sort of mechanism in the same way the way it the way it listens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the way it listens is it just turns on when it hears its wake word  So if it's just waiting for the wake word, well, there you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there's still there's still that thought there's still that creeping thought in your mind, which is  all of those other things that I said internet connected video camera in your bedroom like that just  People are people are very  wary of security issues in in this day and age and  I just I don't know. I would be very hesitant to bring that into my bedroom  You know that type of a device just doesn't doesn't compute for me  But maybe once you have it and you experience the benefit it wipes all those fears away. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know  See, I don't know how drop-in would work though. If it wasn't always on I guess it just turns on when someone requests a drop-in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's my understanding but so

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean it's basically basically i'm given access to just yeah literally control your camera to control your camera to tap into your  camera feed when I want to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right. Well, there we go  Yeah  No one's getting that power except for me or my husband while we're away and maybe and maybe that is what amazon's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Intention with that is is yeah perfect example, right?  Like you you might actually want to be able to to drop in in that very specific example  It's easy to stretch it out though and be like and think of a million scenarios why you wouldn't want that  That capability but it's opt-in so you can choose and I guess that's the power

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, i'm gonna let everyone  Everyone know that when you have a connected home  Affairs are not really possible  Just putting that out there  Everything from sleep sensors to always on cameras to your car tracking you it's just it's it's not doable

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Divorce rates are going to plummet because people are going to be forced to be  good

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was going to say our marriage rates will  disintegrate and divorces will increase because now people will have

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because the the influence of those tracking devices isn't enough to keep them from doing it anyways and getting caught  Exactly  Um and and before we kind of get out of the voice assistant realm  Uh, we also heard like they're coming at us fast right now harman kardon has the invoke speaker which is uh, cortana  powered  uh home device  So they're getting in on the on this game using cortana underneath  Underneath uh, and I don't know if that's an official announcement yet. I think we're still still waiting to hear more about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They showed it at ces  Oh, did they?  I missed that they talked to maybe they didn't show that was the lenova one, but they did talk about it at ces  Oh, okay. So because yeah, everyone was excited about this. I was like, I swear to god I have seen this before

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hadn't even heard of that but i'm excited to use cortana  in a home assistant kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I just i've knit well just in general I don't have any  Any pcs anymore and kevin has told me that cortana is actually really good. So  I would like to use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you did have windows 10 pcs, then you could potentially at some point. I think it's this this september  microsoft apparently has plans to um  Roll out something called man. What is it? It's uh,  It's their own control  through  Through windows 10 pc. So instead of instead of it being  Uh having an actual voice assistant in different rooms  Any windows 10 pc throughout your house becomes?  The kind of hub that controls your smart home taps into hue nest nc on all those does void  video and voice calls powered by cortana, so it's basically your windows 10 pc becomes a a amazon echo or google home, which

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know kind of you saw the was another rundown the uh, the raspberry pi

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google home. Oh, yeah that well that ties into this as well. Actually, that's the very top of the doc  um the yeah, that's the uh ai  ai y ai yourself  Which this kid is a a product of the magpie magazine. It's like a  It's included with the latest issue of magpie magazine. It includes the cardboard  It includes the cardboard housing so it's like a box essentially a speaker  Uh wiring a stereo microphone. There's an arcade style button that goes on the top  So essentially this taps into the assistant sdk that google it doesn't listen for your voice

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have to hit the button instead. It's like exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly, you slam that button which is probably pretty satisfying actually just go pam and then uh,  And then give your your voice query and you've got assistant in a cardboard box as google loves to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I would say that's kind of gimmicky fun  But anytime you have to touch something  That kind of sucks up the magic of voice like I said it with the tap  I know that some people use the tap and that's great, but  having to touch it kind of  Why?  Yeah, it's not having said I love buttons. I will push buttons all day long

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's like an arcade style button so, you know, it's got a satin click to it it's like bam  I also saw that the the um, the ai y kit is being used in a number of different ways somebody else created a candy dispenser  Out of it, so it's basically an assistant powered candy dispenser. How is how is this ai?  Uh, that's that's a really great question. I think it's just using the the assistant sdk to pull it off  I don't know exactly noise. Okay, fine. Yeah, um exactly  How they're doing that but they created a housing for it  They mounted the hardware in there  They created a sensor so that it actually you tell it whether you want a little bit of candy or a lot of candy  And then it detects when the cup is under there and dumps a bunch of candy in your cup. You know, we all need this  It's important stuff right here  This is the future of artificial intelligence

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now what would be even better is if when it was done it reordered the candy from amazon through the dash replenishment service

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah, yes, I thought you were gonna say that if it if it's sort of the colors  I thought that too. I was like it gets rid of all the green m&m's or whatever the color i'm waiting for more candy

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm like, I don't care what color it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll try to be the google's arena that day

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you guys think we're gonna see I mean obviously  Android oh  Similar to last year with n we knew about it kind of going into google i.o and there were things that were revealed  at the show about  the android release  Um more or less, you know more than what we already knew going into it  So i'm sure we'll see some stuff around that  Do you guys have any big big predictions or things you hope to see from google out of this i.o?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How about a brain to?  Oh go ahead  I was gonna say how about a brain to computer interface?  Dun dun dun

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's just well facebook was talking that yeah, they could I know  That's right, jeff you have a serious one though, you should well, you know me I want I want a new chromebook pixel  That'll never die that'll never go away that'll never go away I want I want a  Pixel c I want google hardware oddly. I like google as a hardware company. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think it knows minor but do you think google's gonna undo their their previous decision to not  Have any hardware giveaways and be like, yeah, we changed our mind here. Yeah. I don't think i'll give it away

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think we'll see some really cool stuff on the machine learning side. I don't know if we're gonna appreciate it  But we definitely will see it  And then i'm actually looking for some good cloud case studies just because I know they did their cloud stuff already  So maybe they won't do that here but  I would like to I feel like google is actually making some good strides in areas that it hasn't talked about yet. So  Just based on conversations i've had so i'd like to see them tout that a little bit more

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, let's see here there's gonna be a lot of sunburns we'll be at the shoreline amphitheater  Although I think in the weather is not looking to be quite. Oh really as balmy as it was last year  It's a little bit cooler that might not be a bad thing though  Uh, where the hoodie? Yeah. Yeah, definitely bring layers. It's weird. It's like 65 degrees outside and and cool today, which  I want warmth. But anyways, um bigger rooms come to texas  Sure, there are a lot of places I could probably go and then I'd and then i'd be like, okay  I have the warmth. I have too much of the warmth  Maybe I changed my mind and I want to go back to the cool. I just can't make up my mind

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the problem 64 and no it's wednesday thursday 69 and 75

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not too bad  75 friday 75 will be about perfect. I think because we're out there wandering around it gets hot really fast  Having it a little bit cool is actually probably going to be pretty nice  Um, they say they have bigger rooms more people to facilitate for the rooms by the way, they updated their google i.o  2017 app  So if you run that app, you can reserve seats now this year. They're doing things a little different  You can actually reserve your seats. Wow, that's nice  So I would recommend definitely jeff. I would recommend taking a look at the the talks that you want to go to  Log into the app and it'll give you the option to um under your id to reserve a seat  I'm curious to know how they how they'll track that when you're there. So what you do so pardon me for what i'm about to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're pardoned  When you have one of  These at davos  Okay  These are the greatest name tags on earth because lotus it's not a very long thing it fits around it never goes the opposite way  And then you you're registered for the session and you just hold this up and fc  To a thing and it tells the binder green light let them in  That makes a whole lot of sense and then those who didn't get in there's always some who don't show up  And then they start letting people in right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and they did and google did mention that they were going to leave  um a certain number of seats in in all of the talks for um  You know open for drop-ins and stuff like that. They weren't giving them all away to reservations  I didn't have any problems reserving for any of the talks. Now that you said this on the air now i'm never gonna get

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think you're probably okay a moment. He's like, I think you're probably okay right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a feeling beginning of next week is when things are going to start going crazy where people are like  Oh, I never actually reserved. I better do that now  So anyways do check that out though jeff because I would hate for you to not get into things that you're that you're looking forward to  um  Wearables is is wearables a passing fad at this point and it's like and who cares?  At a google i.o

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so I think so  What about um, I I think answering facebook's ar craze with  Google ar will google stick with 360 or will it start to also  Considering its strength in a in ai go to ar

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there was um  There was a rumor  last year  uh  That google was working on its own actual standalone hardware  For this stuff, I don't know if that was for ar or vr  But I wonder if that ends up materializing in in some sort of way. But again vr  Like I wonder I also have to wonder how  How that's working for google they did daydream  Daydream is very limited as far as what devices you know are compatible with it and vr just as a trend right now  Seems to be cooling off  Man trends don't last very long in technology. It's like two years and they're done  Um, so I wonder how much of an emphasis they'll actually place on that. I know facebook's all in facebook continues to to beat that drum  Yep  um, so maybe google's there as well because  You know their biggest competitor is  I would love to see what what google would do around ar  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, maybe they'll tell us what they're doing. They they showed off the jacquard coat with levies. Oh, right  At south by maybe they'll  I don't know show something cool there  Atap so yeah wearables from atap which would be way cooler than like a new

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Android wear watch here's a new watch. It's triangular this time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So by the way, just so the keynotes don't till 1 pm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's that's not correct. It's I think it's 10  Uh 10 am I believe oh, so it's doing that would be one thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's adjusting the damn time. Oh man google. I hate that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do too this gets me I can no longer make I can't make appointments when i'm on the road because i'm like  I just don't know what time zone anything's in  And I know it's because google's smarter than me, but jebus it's it's really tough

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I cannot find the option to say don't do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It doesn't ask you it asks me every time I switch time zones

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no, it doesn't ask me and I don't know how to take it. I'm and i'm unhappy. I'm just unhappy. Oh man

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it only that jeff?  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't do enough traveling. I have ran it. I'll tell you what's gonna make me well later. We'll talk about what's gonna make me  Yeah, really unhappy. Oh boy

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll look for that setting in the meantime

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh  tablets convertibles  I feel like there's you know, there's still that looming question around

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They could announce a convertible chromebook. Yeah  Yeah, I think they could do it  Like a google branded the samsung is  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know i'm waiting. I mean, I love my my chromebook pixel. It's the first generation one  I'm still using it not today and we'll talk about that here in a few what I am using but  I'm still a big fan of chrome os. I use it every day here at work  I would love to get another chromebook and and kind of that I could actually run android apps on because this first version  Doesn't do that. I just haven't seen one that i'm like, okay, that's got to be that's the one that I have to get  Uh, so i'm right there with you jeff. I hope google finally gives us  A uh a googley option for that. Yeah  Would love to see that  Uh, what else google home, you know, they're probably going to talk about google home to some degree because that's been such a  uh  That category is on fire right now  Uh, yeah, I wish so

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know a lot of people have been talking badly about  google wi-fi

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oops. Oh man. I love google wi-fi

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay. Well, so  I i'd love to see like, you know  Their whole home strategy if they could talk about that, but I doubt that's going to happen like oh I want to see an update on  Brillo  Hello, which is their iot kind of um  operating system for devices i'm like  Sophie wants out. I know i'm like our next ad read i'm gonna let her out

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm trapped with this boring podcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I tried to offer her out beforehand. I told her she was not going to enjoy it, but she would not go

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Forewarning sophie. We're starting a podcast. You might be a little bored

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  last forever  Free sophie free sophie free sophie. Okay. Okay here i'm gonna go let her out now. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, look how happy she is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  thanks  If sophie knew how to control the uh, the amazon echo in the house, maybe the echo

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you insist I should go. Oh, I actually didn't want to go

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You  I think sophie's disappointed that you weren't like  Going going with her. Oh totally. Yeah, she's like, well wait

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're still doing this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Man this podcast thing. It's it's relentless. God you're going forever  Geez  I was I was actually trying those two guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was thinking about having I was like, oh what I need  Is an automatic door kind of functionality that i'm sitting here trying to imagine how I do this  That wouldn't you that's well, of course I would  I have an echo dot right next to me. I know that's what I was thinking

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I was just saying when you ran over there if only sophie knew how to talk to your amazon echo  Uh sophie could you know do some sort of a bark or or something and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that would be a cool hack wouldn't it that would be pretty awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it's it's doable. I just have to get the lever down and there are things for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What about the bark as a as a as a as a prompt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That might be a little harder

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm like  Is there a way to record it and then have that be the prompt? I'll have to go look at that  If anyone knows in the chat room, feel free to share although  Oh, she's I don't know if you can see her shadow moving out there she was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, should we let her back in now soon you're gonna get the scratches on the door

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, she she won't scratch the door. She'll just lay there and when I pop out at whatever time we're done  She'll be like, can we play down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dang it now I want a dog  Someday soon someday you want mine  I would never take sophie away from you  Sophia's adorable though, I will say uh, we will we will be getting a dog here shortly. We have dog fever in our house  So, okay so transitioning away from google i.o  How about this because this was kind of uh in the news a decent amount a couple of days ago fuchsia  which is this  strange  I don't know. I don't know really how to explain fuchsia other than  It's this open source os that google is developing. It's open source, which means they're developing open source  Oh, I didn't know that  They're they're developing it out in the open. The code is out there  So you can actually check in on it and see where it's going google really isn't talking about exactly what it is  they've given little clues here and there that it's you know powerful enough for  Modern phones personal computers with fast processors lots of ram and peripherals which kind of covers the gamut as far as that's concerned  Uh, but they I guess they've been working on this project for more than a year last august we heard about it  um  You know we started to see kind of code popping up here and there it appeared in the the open source repository  And if you put it together, you got a command line. Well a gentleman by the name of kyle bradshaw  We actually had him on tech news today yesterday and interviewed him on the show yesterday  Uh, I guess he's been really kind of interested in what fuchsia actually is  And so he's been checking in on it every once in a while and he spent a little bit of time  Getting pieces of it working on an android device. Meanwhile fuchsia is not it's not based on linux  but  It's uh, it's written with the flutter sdk, which is a cross platform  um, which is cross platform and so he could take pieces of this and  Simulate essentially the user interface of fuchsia at least at the point that it's developed to right now system ui  Apparently is called armadillo lots of weird little words there  weird little names for things but  Fuchsia itself is based on its own microkernel called magenta. Like I said, not linux  but he was able to kind of thumb through there and put it together and put a video out and  People are just asking themselves like is this the next android? What exactly are we looking at here?  Do you guys have any theories on why fuchsia exists so openly yet?  We are so completely in the dark as far as what it actually is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was really hoping you guys would tell me because I was I was I brought this to the i'm like  Oh, i'm gonna finally learn what this is about. All right, let's get to the bottom. I'm sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it a way to get rid of fragmentation? Is it a way to restart but it's open source, I guess  I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I think there's that could be part of it. Um  I mean, it's such a tall order to think about where google has  Brought android what like what android is in the marketplace is so it's so dominant. It's on so many devices  yet  Google needs to do something right the update problem is  continually an issue  um, there are  Regularly emerging issues around the fact that there you know, there are pieces of the linux  Code that you know, there's licensing issues around certain parts of that that google wants to get away from  um, so you can see why they might want to do something like this, uh, but it just seems like such a  Such a big task to pull it off

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's what google does. I suppose so big  I'm like they have not shied away from a big task even even failed at it. Um, I wonder if  Because there's always been rumors for years and these are just rumors and they're not even credible enough that like I would write  A story about them that google is looking at doing its own chips  For phones much like apple is done and that would help with security and solving some of the fragmentation issues or give them more control over security  um  What I don't know is if you  If there's anything built here that might signal something along those lines because it it would make sense if you were going to optimize your  Hardware, then you would build a new os to optimize around that too. Oh, wow. Yeah, that's right  But that's a pretty big that's like one of those leaps where you're just like  And here I am. We're all smoking weed together and we'll come up with this, you know, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not even april 20th  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I I was like but it is 4 20 but it's not it's 4 30 my time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your time zone, uh  Yeah, yeah, I mean I think it's all it's all guessing right now what you see from the ui  Or what you see from the demonstration that kyle put together is really just the user interface touches  Kind of falls in the material design realm things look very cards based and it uh has a focus on multitasking  There's parts of the demo where I saw where it's really easy to take  This window and smash it together with this window and everything just kind of grows and instantly splits into into two sides of the screen  You can throw a third one in there and it just it all morphs together in a way that makes it look like it would be  Good for kind of like on the fly multitasking, which might be good for a desktop environment. Let's say just as one example. So  man, I  I I I hope at some point google kind of  Comes out with some sort of an explanation as far as why this exists out in the open  But at this point, it's really just this thing that everybody's watching with curiosity going. I don't know  Uh, it's cool though  What does it mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And maybe that's all it is maybe this is just google like  They're throwing this code over the wall. Let's see how long people speculate about what we're gonna do with this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, maybe people can tell us why we're making this  Maybe the people out there can give us a hint as far as what we should do with this  Uh, yeah, so we'll we'll see what happens ron. Ron amadio did a really nice deep dive on what he saw and his takeaways  so if you want to check that out go to ours technica.com and you can  Find that walkthrough ron's always really good at  at uh  reading the tea leaves

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I was hoping he was gonna be here to not know no displaying  So yeah, call him on your on your amazon. There you go. I bet he has one. I bet I don't have his phone number  I can't just randomly cold call him nuts

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can ask him next week

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, this means phone numbers aren't going away

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, oh nuts, what other google stuff i'm looking through the doc here  Okay  There's like little little pieces waymo waymo waymo, yeah, uh they have uh apparently  Their efforts in autonomous vehicles have skyrocketed they've clocked more than three million public road miles  Uh, they have added a million miles in the last seven months partially because they added a hundred new minivans to their fleet  Uh just back in december back in december a hundred new ones on the road  uh, so they're just  They're I mean they're blasting off this this whole self-driving thing's gonna be here before you know it  Do you do you welcome or do you do you worry?  Do you worry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are you guys i'm hoping that i.o we got a car under every seat  Oprah like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Every seat is a car you walk into the room. You instantly know you're going away with a car

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like it'd be it'd be even more awesome if they had little jet packs underneath and you could just fly around with them like  It's like cool dome over your head and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's that's uh alphabet  2050 that's that's a little ways away. I feel like 2035. Okay, I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  2050 i'm not sure if we're all gonna even be here so we might as well get our flying cars before that's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true. That's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, yeah, i'm always oh, sorry. I was gonna say i'm pro self-driving cars. I'm like bring it bring it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, i'm looking forward to it, too  I keep I keep hoping that at google i.o. I know it's probably a long shot  Well, and definitely now because I think google or alphabet is distancing itself  Uh publicly from from its boston dynamics investment. I keep hoping that one day at google i.o. We're gonna  Have the chance to interact with a boston dynamics robot

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What what but they have they have sold or haven't sold? I don't think they've sold yet. They've they've not got rid of it  They've said that they wanted to apparently there are no buyers

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because they're evil

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a google or the robots the robots

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  those robots  I know I have I have seen big dog in person. Oh, seriously. Oh, yeah, big dog is scary as  Yeah, he's scary  Like he was not moving but like it's a big robot and it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you imagine that walking out on stage and i.o that'd be the best thing on earth  Can you imagine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or maybe larry or surga instead of like skydiving into the event they ride in on big dog

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, there you go. See though last year larry and secretary weren't there, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't recall that makes even more exciting. Come on. It was just sundar. I think yeah it was it was just sundar

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're busy making not that it's just sundar. I don't mean to say that it was sundar alone  That's right. Right exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, yeah, they're too busy working on their flying cars

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Basically and running from robots. That's apparently like comic relief

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think apparently so, uh, any any other google news in here? I'm looking I think uh youtube  Oh, yeah youtube. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Every tech company has decided they must be an entertainment company. So I thought  Where's microsoft though? Because in facebook what's I guess facebook well, they went in on vr but that didn't work out. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, i don't know what's happening facebook has something too. So first so yes, so first of all youtube  Uh bloomberg had said the alphabet is going to announce an investment in they say hundreds of millions of dollars  more than 40 original movies and tv shows starring  Well-known stars like ellen degenerous katie perry in different shows. These aren't youtube red  Style like this isn't youtube red content. Although they are, you know, still planning to support youtube red youtube red, of course is the paid  Uh service and they have exclusives to just youtube red. This isn't a part of that. This is free  Ad supported content with big name part of the reason for that part of the benefit for that part of that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that with havas and the guardian and the bbc having walked away from youtube some advertisers are coming back now, but uh youtube needs more  Uh safe content on which to put its ads

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's smart jeff. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I believe you so I think it's a motive. So so we've leo were he here?  um  You know, he would argue that google is in the content business and I said no, no, no  They don't own any content. They're not doing any content on youtube. They're just a platform. Well  So I think this is going to be this also raises a few interesting difficult things where google does really start to become a content  company

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, like if i'm searching for ellen, do I get the most newsworthy item or do I get her show on youtube?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, right. Well, and they're all venturing into this space like touching on what you were talking about a few minutes ago stacy  Facebook  Also has their own kind of slate of premium  Shows that they're working on sources told business insider  Facebook  Is working to launch its own original content offering sometime next month even two tiers of content marquee tier for like longer big budget  Uh shows and then a lower tier that's for shorter inexpensive shows five to ten minutes refresh every 24 hours that sort of thing  Uh, so they're all kind of walking this weird line of going moving from platform  You know into kind of the content business. There just must be  I don't know. There must be a lot of money to be made from advertisers  willing to advertise on content that they can control I hadn't even considered that aspect jeff as far as  Making sure that they have high profile content that advertisers feel safe  Putting their ads on because that's a big issue right now, especially on youtube

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I guess also on facebook and the money will go straight to youtube rather than to outside  The problem is i'll be at vidcon in june  And i'm going to imagine there's going to be a lot of youtube creators there who are really nervous now because  If they're a little bit edgy or if they're not big enough to be kind of guaranteed safe  uh advertisers  Google acting on be advertisers  Be half  Will not place ads or replace fewer ads on their stuff and and and so that's the problem with that  of course is that it uh depresses the  Innovation and creation of fresh new voices and content and diversity of voices  So this is what fake news hath wrought

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh fake news, did you see that google is planning a  12-acre high tech city in I think it's morocco  In toronto Toronto

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saw I saw the headline and I did not I want to move now. I know this is this is  Larry's island  Remember remember a few years ago when larry was gonna was why don't we write? Okay now I remember yes  Yes, so it's actually on lake ontario. So maybe it is larry's island

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Who knows? So yeah, it's sidewalks labs effort to build a smart city  Pilot platform  I mean this is kind of cool, but it it it's also kind of it's cool because it's so googley and they're like, yeah  I see nothing wrong with developing a little tiny city, right?  but it's also  imminently impractical unless like we have giant earthquakes or fires that take down our  city infrastructure, so maybe they should do  Work and focus on different technology. I don't know or maybe they're thinking about places like dubai and china  Which are like screw it. We'll put up a new city in the middle of nowhere  I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  Details of the proposal. Let's see here 12 acre strip in downtown, toronto  and uh  Yeah, I mean this this absolutely it ties into kind of what what they were talking about a few years ago making this high  Highly technological city. I mean, okay, so link nyc that's that's through new york  New york city, that's that's the wi-fi kiosks, right? That would be part of this plan, right?  What what else what else would happen in in google's? Oh, I think smart buildings

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, I bet smart buses

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, oh  Well or self-driving  people movers

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In that 12 acre space, right? Well, so not just for transport but also as information gathering devices  So both to understand real-time traffic patterns or even pedestrian patterns weather  uh  State of the streets all of that can be garnered gathered through buses running around actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can do robotic food delivery

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So and of course smart street lights

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because you can't be a smart city without smart street lights

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How are they smart

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's so dang smart about these street lights an led with a bunch of sensors in and then you've got software that grabs the data  And does stuff with it like hey, there's a lot of people around we should make the leds brighter  So we can light the crowd. It's called dynamic street lighting. Oh  Oh, yeah, it exists in like cool. I had not heard of that  Oh, yeah, that's a good idea  Well, there you go. That's that's something they do move to toronto  Well, I don't know if they do it in toronto, but they they do it like europe and I think  San diego may have a pilot project for dynamic street light if you google dynamic street lighting, you're going to find lots of places  nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is cool  Okay  I have something very fancy here. So I so we've been doing the show about an hour now  Which means I have lived an hour of my life using  the samsung dex  Which I have right here. It's this little hockey puck looking thing with all sorts of cables

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Flowing out of a lot of wires

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is uh, so so I have the samsung galaxy s8 plus, which is a very big phone by the way  I've been using it for the last couple weeks very nice. I have my issues with it  But for the most part I like it, but the new samsung devices are compatible with this hardware hockey puck down here  Called the samsung dex. I think it's 150  $50 I believe if you want to buy one and basically the whole idea here is that it turns the phone you already have  Into a desktop computing environment  Uh, you know, it's coming hdmi out to the monitor. I've got my keyboard my old school keyboard here on the desk  My mouse my my wired mouse  Ethernet can plug into here. Although i'm using you know, the the wireless internet through my phone  Already I plug it in here and then carsten I think you have the video feed  And i'm i've been running the show so far off of samsung dex  So you can see here's my dock with with all my little fancy notes and everything i'll go ahead and minimize this  And you can see the uh, the desktop environment that and this is all being run off of the samsung galaxy s8 plus  So the idea here is that you have a computer with you at all time. Maybe this is perfect for the uh,  You know the road warrior  um  I don't know if it's perfect for me necessarily, but I think a lot of people want to see this sort of category  work  Where you know, maybe it's the future that you that we just use our phones as our computer  And I gotta say in an hour's worth of using it  I'm pretty impressed like they've done samsung has done a pretty pretty decent job  Of jumping into a desktop environment and having things move pretty fluidly as you saw with the browser  This is samsung's internet browser. I mean it pulls up the desktop version  Of of google docs if I was to pull this up on my mobile device  The mobile version would normally appear and it would be a lot different  Than what you see here  This is what I would get on my chromebook pixel if I was to pull up the site  Some things don't necessarily work like normally I should be able to hover over this field that has a note in it  And have that note appear in a little pop-up window  Which is how I like to do things with it with the shows and everything the only way I can figure out how to do  That is to insert note and there's my notes for that particular story  So i'm sure there are little things like that's considering especially that dex only launched a couple of days ago and reviews hit yesterday  But it's an interesting piece of kit nonetheless and we've seen a lot of  A lot of uh, I don't know a lot of oem's or at least a decent amount of them including microsoft  Try and pull this off the verge had a had a review of the samsung dex and they basically say  That uh, this is  You know not that  Not that continuum is amazing, but this is better than continuum for the most part  This is definitely ahead of microsoft's continuum  Uh in in a lot of ways  Uh saying it's the best version of this that we've seen yet a good a good proof of concept  Jeff i'm curious to ask you because I know you I consider at least in my brain  I consider you a road warrior of sorts you have  You you have reasons why you prefer the chromebook pixel over other here's my million mile

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  certificate I just got

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Congratulations then yeah  Then I think road warrior probably applies  Yes  Um, is this does this fill a void in in your life?  Like is this is this a solution to a problem that you've ever had the dex? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well, okay, so  I ordered that other thing that we talked about a couple weeks ago  Which you put your android phone on and it has a little kind of laptop and it makes the laptop work  oh  What is that? Oh, you didn't. Oh, yeah. In fact, I tried to cancel it and  That's what I do and they said I couldn't uh, it's called the um  Uh sentio. Oh, I did not hear about this. Uh, oh well, mr android you need to look at this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Was it a kick? It was a kickstarter or an indiegogo. I think so. Yeah. Yeah, so a little warned me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, so you you you hook up right you hook up your um phone and  The device is dumb except that it it it so it's it's dex  but mobile

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So  Okay  So instead of instead of dex like dex is firmly entrenched in the idea that it is to be a desktop

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Environment. Yeah, you have a monitor. You have to have a monitor. You have to all that stuff  So dex is not really mobile to me at all, right?  I can go to the office and use my phone. Right? Whereas this thing is mobile  so  I thought okay when I travel, uh, now I carry the pixel c  What if I carry this and my phone is everything everything  So I thought oh, it's not a bad idea except today in today's news  This is what i'm mad about. This is what i'm angry about. This is what i'm disgusted about  This is what i'm having to fit about beyond the fact that our democracy is falling apart, but we'll leave that aside  So reports are that u.s officials are going to ban  laptops  Tablets and such on european flights now

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow, really?  Yeah, it's on the rundown  Under other and this is extremely upsetting so I wouldn't even be able to carry on the sentio  I hadn't even heard about that, you know, or you'd have to check the sentio you have to check your laptop

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can't check your laptop. That's awful. They're gonna get broken exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They tell you not to check your laptop when they make you check your bag if you have to gate check it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  exactly  oh  This is bad. This is really bad. My my real theory of this is this is american isolationism  This is this is putting this is the sort of putting up a wall of mexico. This is a laptop wall with the world  Uh the amount of money that's going to be lost in travel both ways europeans coming here middle east people coming here and us going there  Is going to be huge. It makes imagine trying to i'm supposed to go to australia  24 hours flying

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Australia isn't in europe

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think they're going to do it the rest of the world as i'm saying. Oh, okay. I'm like like jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have good news  It's further

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  The good news is you might be okay on that trip to australia the next trip to australia might not be so lucky

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So so my plan was I thought the sentio if it worked. Yeah  Was that my phone carries everything so right now I have you know, I have movies on my  Uh pixel c  Or shows actually and then I have all my stuff on my phone  So I thought okay, i'll just carry the phone and it'll be everything and I use the sentio  But not now. Hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  um  So the pixel c is a convertible. How does that factor into this laptop rule? I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure I don't think you can take tablets either. Okay. All right  All you can have is a phone which I you know, I I'm sorry. I watch movies on the phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, man

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then and then I was gonna think okay, I can carry a keyboard. No, i'm told somebody's that the batteries and keyboards were kicked off  a middle eastern flight

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Problem is we're just being too productive on airplanes. There's no way you can work

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you think you saw angry people on planes before?  Angry bored and bitter people on planes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What did we do before laptops and tablets on planes?  We got angry

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We shocked we got drunk is what we did. Yes, that's true. We drank ourselves to sleep basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll wake up on the other side. That's how I get and we used to smoke

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I remember traveling as a very young child on planes where people would smoke so, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, it sounds much more clever  British Airways had the stupidest system. I remember that it was rather than being uh forward, you know smoking back non-smoking whatever after  It was right hand side was smoking left hand side was non-smoking

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, that makes a lot of sense there was no no long curtain that split the no no spit in your eye

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow, that's awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, so so the the so the watchman called there the your your your device would make sense to me  If you had wrote if you had a hoteling in offices  And  You could just put your thing in right in in an office  That makes sense  I don't see a huge need for that. The setting was more interesting to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  You you touch on kind of my thoughts around the dex before having played with it  Particularly now that I played with it. I like I get it a little bit more. I still don't understand why I would need it  but I think  Pegging it  Pegging it in the in the realm of this is good for travel people who travel a lot and they want to bring their desktop  Environment with them that never worked for me in my in my way of thinking because  There's so many components to make that possible and just the idea of bringing a monitor with you or securing a monitor  Wherever you happen to go seems like a challenge in and of itself let alone  I mean you can make a keyboard portable and obviously a mouse isn't really that big  I mean, it's more portable than putting a mac pro in my bag, I guess but  You know or like a big a full full size windows pc in my bag, but  But I don't know how that fixes anything. It still seems like a lot of inconvenient steps and I don't know what the payoff is necessarily  So how much does it cost I think it's 150 dollars  150 dollars only for the galaxy s8 and s8 plus if i'm not mistaken  Um  So, you know, you've got to really want this  Style of a device and i'm sure there are people out there that this is answering their back  They're answering their with their biggest wishes, you know, and they're like finally a limited number  Uh, but I don't think it's a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I don't either because you've got to plug in your keyboard. You've got to  Plug in your mouse because presumably

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you guys ever use docs back in the day laptop docs I had a doc once

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Didn't right it was once. Yeah once. Yeah once very briefly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know laptop doc doc for what?  You stuck your laptop on it. He's so young

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Back in the day my son  We carried these big eight pound laptops. Yeah, we got to the office. He would  In-house  Oh, you would plug it in and the whole thing would plug in at once to your monitor and keyboard and everything else

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, okay. I know what you're talking about  I was like, what are you what are you docking into your laptop?  But it's the other way around your laptop is docking into something else  um  Yes, i've definitely seen those before I never had one I never used one but  But I don't think I ever had those old school laptops either. So that that is definitely back in the day

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My first laptop was one of those and holy cow as a journalism student  I was like carting that thing all over the place. It was so expensive so cumbersome, but darn it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was mobile. Yeah, it came with you. It was portable in their quotes  Yeah, more portable than the the other options

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I still have the divots in my shoulders from my backpack  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm happy. I don't know about the audio listeners, but i'm happy jason

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your best idea was losing your identity. That was your best idea you've ever had that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I learned a lot of lessons  He did throughout that  there was even a story today about two factor about how the sms two factor was uh,  Was manipulated let's say to allow someone to steal a bunch of money from a german bank  So  there's that  To which I I wish that all you know sites and banks and whatever would move to the app  Method instead of relying on sms, but I realize  That perfect security, you know good security is is better than no security at all. So  But yeah, it's the ss7 flaw and uh, it actually requires a lot of manipulation in order to have pulled this off  This is a this was a flaw for a very long time  It was known that it was a potential flaw that could be manipulated by someone who could get access and intercept  The two-factor authentication codes in order to get in and apparently that's what happened  They were able to intercept it via sms

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh now I guess a bank makes for a good target  Yeah, yeah, I mean you wouldn't maybe work really hard for something lame, but getting into a bank

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I mean it required the hacker to  Lure their victims with malware, of course capture the account number id password and then work their way into the actual  Network the ss7 network, which I think requires  um  them to have access to the just  A deeper level access to the cell network from from the inside potentially in order to intercept those codes  So you'd have to go through a lot of work as as they did but they proved that it was possible and people have been warning  About this for years. So  There you go  But I guess the flip side of that is they've been warning about it for years and it's never happened because it's so difficult  So two-factor authentication with sms codes is better than no two-factor authentication  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anywho, uh, so jeff you have a number or uh, yeah, I actually have two of them awesome. So, um  Snap snap as it's now known  Um released its first or earnings as a public company  it's uh  in a disappointing 166 million daily users versus more than a billion for example for whatsapp and um  A growth rate of five percent  and uh  Year over year growth rate continued to slip falling to 36 percent year over year from 48 percent in q4 shares fell more than a quarter  Or almost a quarter 24 percent  Meanwhile, so like who does that get blamed on?  Instagram facebook. Yeah. Yeah, so then uh yelp  Also announced disastrous results to cnbc and lost one fifth of its value  And and so who gets blamed for that?  Facebook google google  Uh yelp's founder always say you failed the quiz. She's no treat for you. Stacey  No treat for you. I'm not looking at the screen cut  You're gonna have to uh roll over to get a tweet now, um, so uh  Yeah, I could just see this so yelp constantly complains about google  They they go after google in europe all the time. Uh, it's kind of an ally of google of european saying google is big bad and awful  and uh snap is not happy so it's it's the giants are having you know demonstrable impact  On these competitors and I suspect there'll be some more whining about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And some more numbers and some more effects, uh for other companies as a result. Yeah the snap  Snap especially because I mean man even a year ago the the hype train was moving  Very rapidly around snap and I feel like in the last couple of months  There have been there's been a lot of silence around it just in the fact that instagram has  I don't know. They've rolled out a lot of features and and regain recaptured people's  Imaginations and as a result, you know, i've actually talked to a lot of people just outside of the tech sphere  But that that use snapchat that had been lured back into the into instagram  uh because of those features and  I don't know at one point it really seemed like snapchat  just as a service  Had had captured magic and and really understood the market that it was appealing to  And then instagram all instagram had to do was copy a few of the features  And that was enough to pull people back over that doesn't that doesn't bode well for snap, but so instagram has 700 million

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  uh users  twitter has how many users

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  300 yeah, it's like  300 yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter's 328 so I I thought snapchat was was bigger by now  What are they? They're still innovative. They're still doing neat stuff. They still have loyalty what they do. They're still different for now, but 166  daily users is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's slowing right? That's what you're saying. Well, the growth is slowing right, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  um  So that was the you know, they went public now and came out with a kind of a call like that error  Mm-hmm  Volatile in the early goings. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  uh  Stacey was was the the treat yours or do you have something else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I I actually have a thing if you guys want to see it that is not a dog. Heck. Yeah  Okay  Like it won't be as cool, but you know speak stacy  This is the notify doorbell cam from heath zeneca  and this is interesting to people because  You don't have to wire it. So this is the doorbell part that goes wherever your doorbell is, right?  in this part  as I  Unbox this  Is the camera i'm going to pop this guy out  So you screw this into your light bulb a light fixture. Usually you have a porch light by your doorbell  And then you mount the camera up and the light bulb powers the camera  so your doorbell just sticks on there, right and then  It talks to your starry sticks where you want it to stick and this talks to everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is kind of wait a minute. I'm being dense here stacey being dense  the thing in your  Uh right hand is that the camera?  This is the camera. Yes. So the bulb is really just a bulb

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The bulb is a bulb. There's also a microphone in it. I don't know if you can see the the speaker perforations right there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there's a speaker right there. So what if it's inside one of those things?  Most most things are in a fixture. They're not light bulbs on their own

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You mount the camera outside the fixture but the but the microphone's inside the fixture it is  I'm gonna install this today and I will report back. So this is something I haven't installed yet  I just got to wait go ahead and do it  I'm like, I am so glad I wore pants today because i've been running up and down  And then here is the final piece  Is the doorbell chime  You'll plug this in and it'll it'll ring the doorbell  Okay, so that is my  She's just gonna do that eventually someone's gonna come home and she's gonna go crazy and you guys are really gonna regret that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She came back in. No, I love I love having you gotta have silvie all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you don't have much longer, she's she's doing good  So so the idea here is that you can turn any light bulb for the most part into a security device  Outside at the front of your door

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  With doorbell, okay. Yes, it's a video doorbell that doesn't require you to wire in the doorbell stuff  So if if wires scare you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although doorbell wires are not scary, you know, that's i've i've i have renewed um respect for  This type of product category where it where it allows you to not worry about wires in in one of my in  My daughter's bedroom  She has a light switch on her wall and it switches a very, you know  Switch is one of the switches  in the room, but that's not the right switch for it to to actually toggle and we keep  Meaning to you know, bring out an electrician or whatever to to do whatever their magic is to do that  But a you know that costs money and b it's inconvenient and c we it's just low priority  But we have um, we have the hue system at home and I realized that the hue switch  Which has like an on off and then it has little dimmer buttons in between  Like that allows you to go wireless. So I got one of those kits with a hue bulb put it in her room  Mounted that on the wall next to the other switch and it's like I didn't have to bring an electrician in it  It only costs like 45 and done  It's like the best thing in the world. It was like why didn't I think to do this sooner? This is awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is a fugly light switch. But yes, it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not it's not the most attractive light switch in the world  But it's better because I mean she's she's four and she could never reach the light to turn it on or off  Oh, that's a great use case  And so we're like, well this actually now she has the the power to do it herself  If you tap it once it's full brightness if you tap it again  It's like it's half brightness and the third time it's a night light. You got a treat. Yeah, right  Exactly. It pours out candy  Um  What is the color she wants I would I would never put a candy dispenser in my four-year-old daughter's room  That is that is basically clear here parent suicide  anyways, so I have new respect for for going around the electrical requirements of the home and just going wireless instead  That's really there you go. I love it  Um mine is actually an announcement that google  Um showed off this morning. It's not revolutionary  Necessarily, but it's it's an expansion of kind of what google's doing around its search as relates to events  uh google basically says that they are  um now going to  Have a new part of of the site both in the app as well as on the google search  uh in in a browser  That when it detects that you're searching for an event or if you put in a search query like events near me  As a new kind of way of presenting to you thanks to you know  It's it's tied into like eventbrite ticketmaster meetup vivid seats live nation a bunch of these other a stub hub  It has a new way to present to you  In a very nice kind of graphical way a calendar of events so that you can that you know can easily find  Uh events that are happening around you be you know live performances or or or plays or whatever the case may be  Google says uh, it's there's you know, they're not taking any commissions on ticket sales or anything like that  they're just putting a new kind of  Ui around what you get when you're searching for events so that because I mean if you do it right now  It's actually pretty ugly what you get back  You get a bunch of random broken kind of results this organizes things really neatly and then directs you through to the site  Uh to make your purchase through the site if you choose to do that. So  Um, you know anything that makes finding things to do a little bit easier  I I saw that and I thought that that looks pretty great facebook's been doing this for a while  Um been really involved in  Kind of managing events through pages and stuff. So this is google kind of getting in on that a little bit more

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I kind of wish  I don't often search for events  But I love that like when spotify because it knows who i'm listening to it will let me know when those artists are performing  in my neighborhood  And that feels a little bit less a little bit more useful because it's so tied to what I like already  So i'm kind of i'm trying to think of how often I guess as a parent  Especially when I had really like when my daughter was four  God, all I wanted to do was get out of the house. So i'd be like  Events near me anything. Yes. Yes, please show me something to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Please help me preferably that doesn't cost very much money

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah at a certain point I just gave up i'll fling money at it, whatever it takes  But I I wonder like  I guess i'm curious how useful that would be  Is is I guess or how?  How often I would use something like that. I'm just kind of thinking

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, yeah  Knowing that it exists. I suppose I would use use it with intent but really like I I think of  You know my history of searching for oh I heard this this band's coming to town or whatever  I put it into google and the results that i've gotten  Sometimes you have to go three four five deep before you finally find the ticket master link  Which is where you actually buy tickets or whatever and I don't know. It's just a I don't know if I necessarily would intentionally go  Google does events really well. So i'm going there right now to do this search. I would do that search there  Anyways, it's just now i'm getting a better a better format  Of results that hit me back so that I find quicker, you know  So that it's easier for my I don't know easier for me to discern what i'm actually looking at  Because you know, sometimes those results can be kind of confusing filled filled with a bunch of things that are like resellers as opposed to  Yeah, the actual event  Venue selling the ticket

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So stacy when I when I was on newspaper online sites  I'm working on those everybody would come in with a bright idea and say  I know what people want. They want to know listings of entertainment stuff  And uh, so we dutifully built those things and then hardly ever gotten a usage  Because you don't use it every night. You only use it when you're going out, right?  So you're right. I think the usage is not uh frequent. So it's hard to imagine that somebody gets in the habit of using it then  You know when it is an occasional thing unless you are really young and really hip which

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, which we all are  Oh  Okay, i'm sorry jason

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I I figure we're we're all in the young and hip category. Come on. Just live it just allow it to happen
