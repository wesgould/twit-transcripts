Marks is here. Great to have you from the UK.  Kevin has worked at Google and Apple  and British Telecom and The Beeb  and everybody else in between.  He's a grand partisan  of the independent  world wide web the way it was  in the good old days.  Hi Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kevin- Not in the way it still is.  It hasn't gone away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact I think all of this Facebook stuff  really has kind of been  good for the web.  Reminding people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's making people stop thinking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like a pendulum swinging back and forth.  Back and forth.  That's Stacey Higginbotham back.  We missed you so much.  Welcome back from beautiful Austin, Texas.  She is an IoT expert.  Stacey on IoT is her newsletter.  You of course remember her from GigaOM  and her Twitter handle still  reflects that.  She's a regular on the show. Jeff has the week off  but Mike Elgin is sitting next to me in his  stead.  So you're going to be the grumpy curmudgeon  who says Facebook's a good thing?  Yes. TechnoPanic etc.  I wish Jeff were here  because last week we had the massive  battle over  Facebook because I've become  fed up  with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I felt like Zuck had the opportunity to cast  many of these fears in the  realm of TechnoPanic.  Yesterday when he was asked by one of the senators  what hotel did you stay at last night?  I would have just said Hilton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Holiday Inn Express.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  Maybe it was one of them go to effort things  where he didn't want to admit it.  That was a good question.  Zuck said no I don't want to  tell you. The senator said  mic drop.  I don't know  Kevin have you been following  Zuck's testimony at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I haven't been  watching it because that's a bit deadly  but I have been following it on Twitter  and as people report on it.  I haven't watched the whole  six hours or whatever it is but I've  seen the gist of it. Deadly is a good word for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think it's going to change  anything. You get the usual  mix of grandstanding members of  Congress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's already changed things because  coming up into the thing they  scrambled together a bunch of little fixes  for Facebook. They changed things. They  had a bounty for people reporting others  who were doing bad things with apps  and so on.  That was a subtle  improvement just so he could face the senators  and be able to answer questions.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some of this is to get  ready for GDPR.  Some of this might be tiny little fixes.  I honestly  I try really hard.  I watch a little bit of the testimony but for the most part  I get so aggravated by testimony  that I don't  anybody's testimony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've had to watch it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so long but the whole time  I'm like yes let's  grow Mark Zuckerberg but good lord  let's talk about Experian  and all of the other things.  Let's pull this out from the Facebook microcosm  and actually talk about  privacy and data because it's everywhere  and yes Facebook is  appalling.  There's lots of legitimate questions here  but I'm like guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  None of them asked by the way.  A few of them have been asked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is the way  testimony goes.  I've watched  so much testimony and  the real stuff happens behind the scenes  with the aides as they're trying to  cobble together rules  and laws and that's politics.  That's a really

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  good point Stacey.  And Facebook's the poster child  which makes you think that companies like Google and  Amazon are going whew  but at the same time I feel like  this is just the beginning of a  sea change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't it?  First of all we've been talking about  privacy matters for  as long as this network  has existed.  It's a big issue for everybody who watches.  Washington has not been paying attention  for the most part.  And the public has kind of  responded with a collective shrug.  All the privacy  experts and people concerned about privacy  have been talking, talking, talking.  And the general public is like yeah so what?  I upload pictures, I share my location.  What's the difference? It doesn't matter.  And I think it's finally getting through to the public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think the public has  been as cavalier as you say.  I think they are making a logical  trade off between their data  and a service that they really want.  The problem is  because there's no regulation  there's no reason for someone to offer  a more private service.  There's no reason for us to even pay for it.  So it's kind of like  before there were rules about  before the FDA existed you could  sell people crappy meat. And some people would have  to buy the crappy meat because  they wanted meat even if it might kill them.  This is a really terrible analogy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No it's because Sinclair Lewis in the jungle  raised people's awareness.  The government  sat up took notice.  Made some laws. And the world  has much improved for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We got sterile hot dogs and things like that. It was a wonderful improvement.  But one of the things that I think  is just an exercise in  consciousness raising. For example  now all of a sudden in the public sphere  in the major news outlets we're  talking about shadow profiles for example.  They asked him about shadow profiles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He hadn't heard the term or he claimed  I don't believe that. Which is a little disingenuous.  What do you mean shadow profiles?  And then the congressman  explained it to him.  And he said oh  we don't do that.  Basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes you do.  So first of all shadow profiles  are two things. So one of it is  they have profiles. He says it's for security purposes.  But that was one of the  things. Only one of the things.  One type of shadow profile is somebody who is not  even on Facebook. They have a profile.  They have data on that person.  Which he claims is for security.  I would suggest that it's for other reasons as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He immediately pointed it  to say oh yeah we do that for  to keep track of terrorism. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But for the majority that is on Facebook  they also have shadow profile data points.  So for example if you shared with Facebook  your home phone number but not your mobile  number. A few of your contacts  but not all of your contacts. They have  invisibly behind the scenes in their databases  all your phone numbers all your  email addresses all of your contacts  all of it because your friends and family  and so on have granted Facebook permission  to upload their contact databases  and you're in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Senator Ben Lujan  from New Mexico. Facebook has detailed  profiles on people who have never signed up for Facebook  yes or no. By the way one thing  that makes this kind of a sham is that  the senators only have five minutes  the House of Representatives  only have four minutes to talk to these

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't want to give them anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good God no. Well they would grandstand  but at the same time there's no follow up.  You have to say things like  yes or no because Mark  has been well coached and is  attempting to use up the time as well.  Congressman I'm not familiar with that  says Zuckerberg. Or actually  Congressman in general we collect data on  people who have not signed up for Facebook for security  purposes to prevent  the kinds of scraping you were referring to  which is reverse searches based on public info like  personal numbers. So these are called shadow profiles  Lujan says. Is that what they've been  referred to by some? Congressman I'm not  familiar with that.  Okay I'll refer  I'll refer to them as shadow profiles for today's  hearing. On average how many data points does Facebook  have on each Facebook user?  Now this was the response  the smart response that Mark gave almost  the entire time which is  I'll have my team get back to you I don't know that off the top  of my head. Do you know how many  points of data Facebook has on the average non-Facebook  user? Congressman I do not know off the top of my head  but I can have our team get it back to you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  afterward. Was it Nixon that  did I can't recall? I can't recall  yeah. It was I can't it was Nixon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's been admitted by Facebook that you collect data points on  non-users. My question is  can someone who does not have a Facebook account  opt out of Facebook's involuntary data  collection?  Zuckerberg. Anyone could turn off  and opt out of any data collection for  ads whether they use our services or not.  I don't know how they would do that by the way.  In order to prevent people from scraping public information  we need to know when someone is repeatedly  trying to access our services.  You said that everyone controls  their data Mark but you're collecting data on people  who are not even on Facebook users who have never signed  a consent or privacy  agreement says Lou Jan.  It may surprise you that  when you go to Facebook's page and you say  I don't have a Facebook account and would like  to access all my personal data store  by Facebook it takes you to a form that says go to your  Facebook page and then download  your data so you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay so I know that they're upset  about this but this is exactly  what data brokers do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right and it's not just Facebook  and I'll channel Jeff  Jarvis. Leo this has been going  on for years. It's not bad.  Forever for decades.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And what's the harm? What's the harm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because it's been and then I use  the word weaponized because it's been weaponized.  They're really good at it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the eloquent  in the living room. This is like XKCD  743 isn't it?  Are we now to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  point where we tell it's like  the joke telling conference where  nobody sells a joke you just say the punch line.  XKCD 743  who can forget  infrastructures.  Is that it? Yes.  Did you get my  essay in 2003? Yeah it was good but it was  a doc you really should use it more open.  Give it a rest already maybe we just want to  live our lives and use software that works and not get wrapped up  in your stupid nerd turf wars.  I just want people  to care about the infrastructures we're building and who  no you just want to feel smugly superior.  You have no sense of perspective and are  probably autistic. That's in 2003.  2010. Oh my god  we had control of our social world to Facebook and they're doing  evil stuff. Do you see  this? It's the world's  tiniest open source violin.  This is what Cory Dock wrote today  in Boing Boing and I know you've been saying that you've been  beating this drum Kevin Marks.  This is what everybody's  saying is okay let's make  an alternative.  But where is the alternative?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's not make an alternative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my gosh. Let's make it better and not make rules.  You know what I don't have  much confidence that rules are going to happen very well  but alright go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay there's two things here. One this  cartoon is from 2010  and we already knew Facebook was evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is how long he's been doing the  I'm sorry we'll make this better thing.  No longer than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It goes back to when he was a freshman in the art room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's been collecting these.  Yeah that's true actually before even Facebook started  he was apologizing for the previous things he'd done.  So yes he has  a pattern here.  Do things, do as much  and get away with, apologize, say  you'll make it better, actually turn the dial  up again and iterate. So there's  that piece of it.  The other piece, the shadow profiles  piece there  that is, the subtle thing there  is that they're importing everyone's address books.  And they do their best to do that.  They bought OctoZen  which was the company that scraped address books  from everyone else around 2010.  And they  will happily, they have a large team who's job  is to get any kind of  address book data into Facebook.  There's no team to get it out again.  When you export from Facebook all that information  is gone, you just get people's names, you don't even get their  Facebook profiles, let alone  any other links or URLs  or phone numbers or emails or any other  the contact points they have. The export  dump is the flattest HTML  export ever. At least it's HTML  but it's not  a useful form.  So the Roche-Mittele thing is  spot on. They take stuff in, they never get it  out again. They  don't act as an agent for the user.  This is the subtle point.  One of the problems we've had with  doing permissions with software  is that it all goes back to Unix where  the assumption was the programmer was running on  behalf of the person running it  because everyone was a programmer and they understood what was going on  in theory. So when you run code it runs as you  and it can do what you can do.  And that sort of concept has transferred  into this world.  So Facebook says, I'm you, I will  connect to your phone and  your Google account and  your Microsoft account and draw  in the contact details of everyone you've ever  been in contact with and put that on the side  somewhere. And then when it comes to  time for you to look for friends, it'll suggest  them to you. But conversely  when anyone who's ever  been in that address book  signs up for Facebook, it'll recommend you as a friend to them.  Now that  feels like a comfortable thing for them  to do. When  I looked for Stacy Higginbotham, it found  me the right one just now even though Stacy and I  aren't friends on Facebook and I'm not even sure we have  shared phone numbers.  We didn't do enough analysis  because we both know  that it found us. So it  does a lot of this stuff in the background.  And that was Google probably, not  Facebook, right?  That was  Facebook. Kevin, I  had you. I went to Facebook.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean it's a lot of things. This is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  similar phenomenon as with  face recognition. So I  think it's much worse on Google  Photos, which I love Google  Photos, but the fact is that  other people can identify your  face with your name and your  specific user  personhood  beyond your knowledge or control.  On Facebook you can do the same thing, although with Facebook  they have tools that you can go and find out who's doing  this, you can opt out and things like that. With Google Photos, I don't  think you can. For example, I go into my Google  Photos, I got pictures of you in my Google Photos, and I say  yeah, that's Leo Laporte. Even if I'm not on Facebook.  Well, this is within Google,  you're on Google Plus, so  they know everything that Google knows about you.  So your search history, all that stuff  is now connected to your face, which I  have told them and you didn't know I did it.  And hundreds of people have done that. Go ahead, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I just want to clarify what Mike  is saying. So even if I never gave Google  my face, you basically gave up my  face to them. Exactly.  Friends of friends.  And they would know that that's me because  that face belongs with my account because  it's tied. You're just giving them my  name, you're not giving them an email, right?  So when I go to... When I tag a photo...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The whole point here is there's so much interlocking,  interlaced data. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, there is, but... No, they have changed that.  So  they were doing more of that before. The previous  version of the photos stuff did do  a lot more of that. And  so when you went to tag someone,  it would attach their email address to it  from your contacts. The new Google  photos stuff has taken a lot of that away  and it's doing less of that. So you're just putting  a label on that face for you,  but it's clustering in the faces. So here's the categorical  thing... I don't think it's doing as much across.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's the categorical issue  that probably won't be covered  by legislation, but absolutely  is the core issue here, which is  that other people can violate your  privacy, other users.  And this is the centerpiece of  the Cambridge Analytica situation.  It's with the face recognition,  it's with the... Now Facebook says, well, we turned that off

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in 2011. Okay, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it still happens. If I take  a screenshot from this show, which I will,  and I tag Stacy,  I will be tagging her Facebook account.  You're giving information to Facebook.  And I'm telling Facebook... About Stacy.  Not only what her face looks like,  what her clothes look like, what her office looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even if you're not connected as friends. You can do that.  So Facebook would see it, could take...  Wait a minute though, when you tag it on Facebook,  if you're not friends with Stacy, her name's not  going to pop up. Correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But she has friends who will tag her.  And again, if I tag her...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it has to be your friends who are your real enemies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We all have enough family and friends  and former high school people who will  tag us. We will be tagged.  Okay, Stacy, go ahead. Can I just make  one more thing? What I'm saying is  that a picture of her  empty office  will be registered by Facebook as Stacy.  Right.  The things on her desk  are part of this database. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody understands this. That's what I mean by weaponization.  The algorithm is good enough now and there's enough  data points now that really there's very  little that's not known. Go ahead, Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so while we're freaking out about this,  I'm just going to tell you about GDPR  because it is the most...  It's probably the  most comprehensive data privacy  rules out there. And so maybe  we can get to something like that. They actually have  secondary... They have a whole regulation  chunk about the secondary uses of  data. So  you have to  de-identified...  De-identified...  I cannot speak. Sorry.  This is data that can  no longer be attributed to a specific data  subject without the use of additional information  provided that such additional  information is kept separately and subject to  technical and organizational measures to ensure that  the personal data is not attributed  to an identified or identifiable natural  person. So that's exactly what we're talking  about. Using secondary data  from another source to identify  me. That is verboten.  It is not allowed.  So we're talking about this now. So I'm trying  to give you actual things that have happened  related to this so you know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't want to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  be that guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't want to be the guy with the roof hat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody has to be the guy. So I'm going to be the guy.  Okay. What about  the Peltzman model of regulation?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  This is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this is... Corey Doctorow pointed  to this.  Which is that  really these hearings aren't  about privacy or about technology  but about what politicians want.  Of course, right? The politicians are having the  hearings. Now if you're a real  cynic you'll go with Sam Peltzman's  economist wrote about this  10 years ago.  His position, and again  this is in fact this is economics.  It's just the  dismal science. The opposite of. The opposite.  Politicians use regulation to trade  off profits, which are which  firms want, lower prices, which  voters want, to maximize  what politicians want.  Power. Re-election. Re-election.  The key is they're diminishing  returns to politicians in both profits  and lower prices. Consider a competitive  industry. It doesn't do much for politicians  so they might want to regulate the industry  to raise prices and increase firm profits.  The now profitable firms  will reward the hand that feeds them  with campaign funds  and by diverting some of the industry's profits  to subsidize a politician's  most important constituents.  But wait, consumers now  are going to be upset by the higher price but if it's not too  much higher, the net gain  of the politician will be positive. They'll get more.  It's like we've all played those sim games.  It's like Civ 5, right?  What about an unregulated  monopoly like Facebook?  By the way, they asked  Mark Zuckerberg, are you a monopoly?  He said, no, no, no.  And then, was it, Blumenstein, I can't remember who said it.  Well, can you name your competitors?  And Mark

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  froze.  Well, the reason he froze is not that he doesn't have competitors.  This sounds ridiculous. Yeah, we're really  worried about Twitter. Twitter. Twitter is  a big problem for us. Google Plus is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  going to kill us. It's going to kill us. WhatsApp.  Politicians will regulate the monopolist  to lower prices, okay,  and then they're going to encourage a monopolist to divert some of its profits.  To who?  The politician and the politician's  constituents.  Monopolists will be upset by the lower price but  if it's not lower too much, maybe  below monopoly levels,  then that gain of the politician will be positive.  The monopolies won't mind too much.  With that as background, the Facebook  hearings are easily understood. This is actually  Alex Tabarrok who writes a blog  called The Marginal Revolution  University. I don't know what it's about.  Very important to this. Facebook is a very profitable  monopoly that doesn't benefit  politicians very much. Although  consumers aren't upset by high prices  since Facebook's free, they can be made  to be upset about the loss of privacy or other  such scandal. That's enough to threaten regulation.  The regulatory  outcome will be that Facebook diverts some of its  profits to campaign funds and to subsidize  important political constituents.  So, what you got to watch here  is who's going to be subsidized.  Be sure to watch the key players  as there's plenty to go around. The money's only begun to flow.  But aside from campaign funds,  look for rules, especially in the  political sphere that will raise the costs of advertising  to challengers relative  to incumbents.  Incumbents love the incumbency  advantage. Also watch for a deal, and this is the one  I'm worried about,  where government limits profit regulation  in return for greater government  access to Facebook data,  including by the NSA, ICE,  local and even foreign police.  Keep in mind, politicians don't really want  privacy. Congress held  hearings two years ago on privacy and technology.  Only those hearings were about how  technology companies kept their user data  too private.  So, wouldn't it be a shame  if the outcome of all of this is  okay,  it's good that you're gathering this information as  long as you hand it over to us  and let it be to our advantage.  Now, that's why,  Stacey, when you say regulation  is the answer, I agree, in a perfect  world, but I just  I don't have high hopes for it  happening in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, they will happen, and it will happen  the way it will likely  happen. So, a couple things.  One, I think you're totally on point. Congress  does not care about making laws.  However, there are  regulatory agencies, and those are the  people who pressure Congress  and have been. So, the FTC  in 2013  started looking at IOT  and social data and  everything, and they actually in 2015  came out with a report, I believe  it was in January 2015,  saying, hey, we should create  some rules around data. The  rules they suggested actually looked a lot like  what GDPR became. But  Congress was like, oh heck  no. So, what you're actually  going to see  is, I would look at Facebook  versus the ISPs  because right now the ISPs  are picking up the  privacy kind of  rules as something they're like, oh, hey  hey, we like privacy.  Let's talk about how we can use privacy  rules to disadvantage Facebook,  which is one of the scariest companies out there  in Google. So, that's  how the regulation is going to happen.  It's going to be  the ISPs versus  the companies that have basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  disintermediated the ISPs. Yeah, because as we've  said many times, it's the ISPs that really  are the ones who know everything about you.  And you'll see this. Although  let me ask how true that is because  when I use Google  for a variety of reasons, possibly to keep  the ISPs disenfranchised, Google encrypts  all my searches. When I use Facebook,  you know, it's fire sheep  and other hacks against Facebook  is protecting it, but it does encrypts everything  I do with Facebook. So,  what does the ISP know in this  day of HTTP S everywhere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, for starters, they know your  address. They know where I live.  They have credit cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They know exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  what devices you have in your house. They know  what websites you visit. They  know what kind of traffic  you're sending. So, they know what you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  doing. See, I'm thinking  maybe Google and Facebook are more of a threat than the  ISPs because Google sees all my searches  and Facebook, if you use it,  has all my data. Yes,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but you don't have to use any of those things.  I know. But you do. I mean,  you don't. You can use  that. You don't have to, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we do use them. I know.  I know, but there is a different

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  class of regulations for something that is  indeed,  what is the word I'm looking for?  It is something that you have. You have no  viable alternative.  You have to use,  you have to be on the Internet, right? If you want  to be on the Internet, you have to go to one  or possibly two ISPs. And there's a duopoly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, one of those ISPs, either your phone company  or your cable company is going to get all that data.  And we know they're terrible,  by the way, in all of this.  By the way, we also know, and I should point out,  that the FCC's privacy rules  were repealed very early on in this administration.  Yes, which is how I can tell you exactly  what they see

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and what they do. Right. It's one of the first things that happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just hope we don't go back and forth every time  there's a new administration in the White House.  A utility. Yes. Thank you, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In the chat room. I don't know why this  worked, but sorry. Yeah, one thing,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  there's a  temptation to glom  Facebook in with other companies  in various ways. But one way  that they stand apart is on the metric of  trust. Ricoh just published  a survey that they did  based on public trust of  various companies  in tech. And Facebook was like  ten times less trustworthy  than this number two, which was Google.  It's the least trusted by,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  look at this graph. I mean, that's just  I can't even fit the bar on the screen.  So they're in a class of their own.  So Facebook  is 56 percent  least trusted. Google five,  Uber three, Twitter  three, Snap two, Apple two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People trust Uber more than Google?  Isn't that shocking? I'm like,  Uber, I feel like would send  people to kill me based on where my  Uber driver is if I just  aggravated

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uber reminds me of Scientology  a little bit. Oh, yeah, that's a good

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  come. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Scientology. They have to. But also, I mean, they trust  Uber enough to get in the back of  it and be driven somewhere. That's the thing. That's  true. They are putting themselves  in Uber's hands quite a lot. Yeah.  Facebook, they feel like they have to do it. Uber, they  volunteer to use it instead of a bus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And also, well, there is a similarity  to Facebook, Google,  and Uber, maybe less than these  other ones. But those three provide  you with massive convenience and value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. Network of facts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Uber doesn't know what you're reading.  And they don't necessarily, I don't think they know  who your friends and family are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I don't. Well, you know, here's the weird  thing. Anybody who has an app  on your phone that is leaking  location information knows  your friends and family. They know who you sleep  with. They know who you have Thanksgiving  dinner with. And when you  combine location information,  I was talking about this with Lisa, it was one of the  reasons I  I love Android.  But Android is a sieve  when it comes to your location information. Apple  has been smart. I'm not  convinced it's not merely for marketing purposes,  but so what? When an  app uses your location,  you have to give it permission and it will remind  you several more times.  This app is still looking everywhere you're going.  That's really important.  I don't think most people understand how  valuable location information is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where you stand depends on where you sit. In Apple's  case, they don't need... Wait a minute, let me write that down.  In Apple's  case,  they don't need personal data for their business.  They sell super expensive phones  and they take a third of the revenue

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  from the apps. But their services,  their online services, $10 billion  last year. They're terrible, but they're also  very, very profitable. More profitable  than the Mac division.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they aren't data services. The online  services are them re-selling other people's stuff.  That revenue is that 30%.  It's not  anything they're providing you directly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Apple Music, and they'd like it to be  Apple TV. And by the way,  those will gather information about what you listen to and what you watch.  They're reseller models as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and if you  buy into the idea that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  if you buy  into the idea that customization  is going to be the thing  to get the next generation of people  online and sell to them and all of this,  then if you don't have a good data  acquisition strategy, you can't  actually compete in that world. And that's  the questions we all have right now about  Apple. They're doing just fine now.  But look at how the HomePod  did with crappy Siri on it.  No kidding. That's so great. Tanked.  So those are the kind  of...  We're moving to this era where every business  is being threatened with obsolescence  if they don't collect user data  and figure out ways to customize  and deliver products to them.  And just macro business trends.  Think about how often do you hear  consumers, millennials want  customization. They want to have these  personalized experiences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'm going to predict  something. Any minute now we're going to  see, we're probably seeing it right now with our audience,  privacy fatigue.  Like, oh, screw it.  That's going to happen soon.  I don't care. I like  riding an Uber. I need to use  Google for searching. I keep touch with my family  and friends on Facebook. I feel it inside of me.  It's fine. It makes me feel good.  What's the problem? Just...  It's XK... I might say,  XKCD 743 all  over again. Exactly.  Well said. The challenge

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  is we have to think  about how you want to regulate this.  So do you want to regulate the  outcomes? Like, okay,  we're going to collect all this data and  treat it well. And if  people use it in malicious or nefarious  ways that don't jive with  our sensibilities, do we punish that?  Well, that's the Jeff Jarvis

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  argument is that social morays,  social norms should govern  this.  Is that what you're saying, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sort of. There's  the idea that collecting data is fine.  Everyone should be able to collect data. I don't actually  agree with that. Jeff agrees or  Jeff will tell me if I'm wrong, I'm sure.  But it's fine  to collect data. It's what you do with it that matters.  He and I disagree with...  I think it's fine to  collect data, but you should treat the data  as sacrosanct, not  the use cases, if  that makes sense. So the user should have the option  to opt out of things. Even if  I decide, you know what?  I don't want my medical data to be helping  people with lung cancer. Screw  those people with lung cancer. I  should have that right. So here's how

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it goes down. So basically  the regulators responding to public  pressure say, okay, listen,  we want to regulate you guys  and you heard everybody asking if  Zuck supports  various types of legislation, as if that  should matter. But they say,  okay, we want to not let you do this.  And then the companies say, well, if you  don't let us do that, then these people  won't get these valuable services that they want.  Okay, well, in that case, what  you have to do is you have to make sure that they are  aware of everything  that they're opting into. And that'll be the law.  That's what's happening in Europe. And then once  you have been made aware,  everybody will disagree to it. Like when you're in Europe,  it's maddening to use the internet.  Because every page you go to, it says,  did you know cookies exist? Like  literally every page. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  insane. So Europe has more  than just notification and transparency,  Mike. It has the ability  to pull the data that you want,  or sorry, to pull the data that someone has on you.  You have the ability to opt out of them  keeping your data. It has the ability  to actually pause your data,  like, I don't know how they're going to do this, but  pause the use of your data  for a certain period of time. Like if you're applying for a home  loan, you can actually pull all of your  data and put a pause on people accessing it.  So, yes, it's  way more than what you're saying. And I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you're... No, it's a good point you're making.  It's a very good point you're making. But I guess my  point is that there  will be a series of opt-ins and  approvals and this sort of thing.  And people will, for the most part,  opt in and approve. So it's basically  the same stuff that's going to happen, but  people will be explicitly agreeing to it  for exactly the reason Leo was saying, which  is that people have privacy fatigue,  they don't really understand that  there will be a harm. And in  some cases, what is the harm, often,  to the average person?  Good advertising?  So I think that  we are, at the end of  all of this,  companies are going to be doing a lot of crazy stuff  with our data, except they'll also  have our approval to do it.  We will approve that stuff, because  we want the features, we want the benefits,  we want the apps, we want all of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that is the change.  That is the change, though. So what  GDPR changes is that you cannot  you have to...  There are strict terms on what you  can do.  The terms of service has to be concise,  transparent, intelligent, easy, accessible,  written in clear and plain language,  particularly if addressed to a child.  And it has to be  described what they're going to use it for, and you can't  use it for anything else, and it has to be revocable.  So there are  structural things that are defined by GDPR  that means you  can't just sign a  20-page TOS without reading it. They have to have  got explicit consent for the  use they're going to make of the data. They can't just  gather it and use it for something else later.  So that is a structural assault on what

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they're doing. Yeah, it can't be used for other purposes  unless you consent to that. What I'm saying is that  yeah, it'll be better, but it'll still  be more about consent  rather than... The data  will still move and be  shared and used  the way it is now, more or less.  But people will be  supposedly explicitly opting into it.  The point I'm trying to make  is that just because... And they'll be able to see

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the data that someone has  on you, which is really important because it's  one thing to consent to weird words  and it's another to go to your  profiles that they have on you and see the correlations

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that people are making. I'm not sure that's true,  Stacey. Google has been really good at  showing you the data they have on you and hasn't changed  anything. Everybody still uses  Google the same way. That is not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But people do go look and people  change things or they're at least explicitly  aware of, if I want this  service, I have to let them collect  this data. And I know people  who go in and delete their Google home  utterances. Yeah, because you know nerds,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey. The general public  is not going to go in...  still doesn't even know that stuff exists, probably.  You're right. We have  an absence of knowledge here. Somebody  should study this and find out  who's doing stuff. May

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  25th, after GDPR  goes into effect in Europe, what I  want you to look for is a bunch of journalists  are going to start requesting data.  So European journalists in Kevin Marks  are going to start requesting the data  various companies have on them. And they're going to  start writing stories saying, hey,  guess who knows this about me?  And people are going to become  informed, much like a bunch of people  downloaded the data Facebook has about them.  Will everyone? No. But is it a good start?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. I love your optimism.  Me too.  The FTC says

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you can remove... Kevin, please download

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  your data, by the way, and then come on the show and tell  us what you found. Yeah. Please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wish I had that before the  show. I've downloaded  what Facebook gave me already.  And it was  very anodyne. Basically,  it was conversations and things.  But you couldn't tell who the other person was half  the time. Or it would just give you a little piece.  So  are you getting different data in Europe

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  than we would be getting here?  I mean, are we not getting the same data?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not at the moment. But that will  change. That's supposed to change.  Zuck said, and that was a correction

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of an earlier article that, in fact,  the GDPR rules  would also be applied in the US  even though they didn't have to.  So we will presumably...  Okay, so I've been seeing all these people talk about their  data dump. So we're not  getting that full data dump yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think so. So there

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is now a requirement to provide personal  data in a structured, commonly used  machine-readable form.  That is part of the GDPR requirements.  So the Facebook export needs to be  in a useful form, must be free of  charge.  And it would make sense that it would be easiest

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for Facebook to provide it to everybody  if they're going to do it. Might as well just do it for everybody.  Unless it's so revealing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unless your business model is  dependent on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To me, that's the big problem. Anyway, I want to move on.  Go ahead.  Final thoughts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the other thing  that Zuck was playing in Congress  was very, very much this thing of  we want to take better care of your data, we want to make sure these  terrible third parties don't  take advantage of it ever again.  And was playing  into the idea that they  should be the sort of government  certified trusted guardians of other people's data.  Yeah, it's not that we're  collecting it that's bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's good that we're collecting it. That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good thing.  And there is the distinction, and this is the distinction  I was trying to make earlier about  Unix Access and so on, is  the distinction between an application that is acting on my behalf  that is doing something I want to do  and an application that's  acting on me to do  something else.  So if it's  just a game that I'm  playing but it siphons out my  contact details,  my text messages and  other things like that, that's not really  actually on my behalf. It's just doing that for its own  nefarious reasons. On the other hand,  if I would actually like to  extract the contact  information for my friends that I  uploaded before or a better  version of that where they've actually agreed  to share their phone numbers with me and draw them out, that  was there. There was a  it used to be, if you went to facebook.com  phonebook, it would give you  the phone numbers of your friends because it was actually very useful  to be able to do that. And that went away  fairly early on.  But they still have the information, they just don't  share it back with me. So I've  you know, Stacey will have  my American phone number, she won't have my UK phone number,  partly because I haven't given you facebook.  Don't challenge me Kevin.  It's not the same system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Alright,  we're going to, a little palate cleanser.  I'm a big believer in palate cleansers.  This is  an example  and it's actually from several years ago  of how we were talking about those  what were they called, real fakes?  The porn things. Here's an example.  Now this is only for the video  crew. This is George W. Bush  talking.  It's very important to fix a broken system.  To treat people with respect.  Hillary, Daniel Craig, Barack Obama,  Piers Morgan, Tom Sanks.  They're all saying the same thing.  There's a bunch of notable people.  And Ian McKellen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The uncanny valley is kind of strong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  But Schwarzenegger's smile was pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, that was a  palate cleanser. That's all it was. There was nothing else.  How about this one? Here's a second palate cleanser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not sure this is cleansing  my palate, Leo. This is doing something to my palate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which of these G's is  correct?  Don't say it out loud.  What's that?  That's the, which of these  G's is correct music?  G. Okay,  Karsten says three.  I'm with Karsten. Three? What do you say?  You say two? I say two. What do you say,  Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I say two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Alright, two and three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The answer is two.  But this is a study.  I know. Several of you got that wrong.  Karsten, you got it wrong. Even though you went to  the best college in Massachusetts.  This  is a study from Johns Hopkins University  in Discovery  Magazine. Only 25%  of participants in this study  chose two.  The correct answer. Almost everybody got it wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because nobody writes that G.  There's a different G altogether.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's one of the few lowercase letters where there are two versions.  And people can't write that one.  There's two lowercase  A's as well. But people didn't have the same  trouble with that. People knew how  funny lowercase the typography looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wasn't that the G that they had in the original  Google logo? Or am I mistaken about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh!  Maybe.  It's close to it. They had one that was quite like that.  All curlicued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But anyway, it's totally bizarre.  Apparently the origins of that date  back to medieval manuscripts  and people getting a little fancy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  with the pen. It's used in Times,  New Roman, Cambria, and Calibri.  And it's most printed in typed  material. The second, of course, the open  tail version, which is the one we all write.  Isn't that funny?  The loop tail is... People can't get  it right. It's weird.  Most people got the correct A, lowercase  A, even though  some people didn't even know there were lowercase

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  versions of A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are several. This is the  thing. There's different styles, depending  on...  That was another palate cleanser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, back to the news.  Back  to the news. FTC  has done a world of good  for the right to repair movement,  saying,  the warranty void if removed  stickers you see on every piece of electronics  gear is illegal.  It does not void  the warranty.  They put six companies on notice telling  them in a warning letter their warranty practices  violate federal law.  If, for instance,  you buy a car with a warranty, you take it to a  third party repair shop to fix it, then have to return  the car to the manufacturer. The car  company cannot deny the return because you took it  to another shop.  That's true of any consumer device that costs more than  $15. Remember that.  It's the Magnus and Moss Warranty  Act from 1975.  And we all have  every device in our house has this  warranty void.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Including the back of my phone.  But didn't Apple  their most recent iOS version brick  phones that have been repaired  by somebody other than Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was about a year ago.  iOS 11 did that.  They took it back.  They had actually a little bit of a more  I agree it probably was an economic  incentive but they were saying the problem is if you  fix the screen, the secure  enclave for the fingerprint reader is now  compromised.  So we didn't want people to be able  to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the devil in the details here with this  FTC ruling which is that  as things get more  complicated, they're going to require  special  like in Apple's case, special  electronics, maybe special tools, all  these kinds of things. So it's going to be  I guess this will all be settled in court  but if we want  similar to Apple's claim that  they have to glue everything  and make them unreparable because they want them  to be thinner, thinner, thinner. Well the market  wants thinner devices which is a questionable  assertion to a certain extent.  But it's  not as simple as that.  Consumers want super  thin devices but they also want  some of them want repairability. They want certain  types of screens but they also want  third party repairability. So it's going to be  tough to sort this out in the  world of consumer electronics. However  all these cushions and pillows, I'm  sick of it. The mattresses,  I'm done with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't remove under penalty  of law but that's not for you, that's  for the seller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Once you buy it, you can remove it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can do whatever you want. I don't like it, Leo. I don't like it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  one bit. So Motherboard  which wrote about this said  the FTC would not tell us which four companies.  Six. Six I mean  companies but Microsoft  and Sony perhaps because they do that with  Xbox One and PlayStation 4.  Apple, Motherboard points out  doesn't like stickers on stuff  so Apple won't do that. But the  geniuses are instructed to look for  signs of consumer  meddling and will sometimes decline warranty  service. Yeah the FTC

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  said the companies that were involved  quote, market and sell automobiles,  cellular devices and video gaming  systems in the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder who that could be.  Video gaming systems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not only should people be able to repair their  devices no matter what, that should be required  class in high school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  High school,  if I learned, what I learned to repair in high school would be  what a zero used to be now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good point too.  I have this battery powered alarm  clock I'd like to fix.  Actually there was a great  story Steve Gibson did.  Here's, okay maybe another palette  cleanser because this really is  but it's interesting. So there was  a dispute in  Europe between Kosovo  and  Serbia  on the power stations. They're both  on the European grid.  And for six years  they were running  the power slightly under  60 hertz which meant  that a lot of mechanical and  electronic clocks  were off by about six minutes.  The dispute was resolved recently  and they sped up the  generator just a little bit  and now everybody's  back on track. Unless  you said, hey this clock is six minutes slow  and fixed it. In which case

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you're screwed. Which everyone did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it was an Ars  Technica article on  the strangest thing. And it kind  of resonated with me because I'm going to Japan where part of  the country has 50 hertz  power and part has 60.  60 cycles. That's  how fast the generator spins. I didn't know this.  It's actually related to the spinning  of the generator. Yeah it's pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  crude at the end of the day how that  stuff works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to say it's engineers who  label these things. They're like how fast does it go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  50 times

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  50 revolutions per whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It can be whatever you want it to be. Let's call it that.  But a lot of  a lot of things take this very  seriously. It's the Serbian  Kosovo grid  dispute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you going to go nerd out in

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Akihabara? I am going to live  in Akihabara as much as I can.  That's for sure true.  So anyway  so congratulations  to  everybody who lives in Serbia and  Kosovo because they're now part of the continental  Europe power system. And Kosovo  has balanced its electrical supply.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Balance has been restored

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to the universe. Balance has been restored.  Another palate cleanser.  There's so many heavy subjects.  Are you avoiding them?  Well  okay this isn't heavy. This is good.  We're at Google IOs coming up.  And the  sessions that are coming out are hint at  according to Abner Lee  writing in 9to5 Google  exciting updates for Google Photos  and at the launch  of the .app domain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's going to be more secure and  it's going to be part of their  scheme to integrate the internet  with apps. So that should be good.  The Google Photos thing I think is going to be something  for developers. I think they're going to weaponize  Google Photos and make it something that can be integrated  into apps.  And that could be a very good thing.  I don't think there's going to be much  I could be wrong but  for consumers about Google Photos other  than maybe a couple of tweaks here and there.  I'd love to see them get better  for example better editing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  tools. Lens is finally I noticed  available  Google wide. Yeah. That's I'm glad  just in time for me to go to Japan and figure out what the  hell I'm eating. Yeah.  It's really you know what in Japan don't ask.  If it tastes good just eat it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Just go with it. Just go with

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it. I've eaten things in Tokyo where I didn't know  if it was plant or animal. It was  no way to know. It's like  it was good wasn't it. And it was pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  on the plate. So hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mary Jo Foley told me to eat octopus  balls but I'm really wondering what she means by

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that. Well the octopi  are against it. I'll tell you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here  this is from Google. It is  National Pet Day.  Sorry Kevin you don't get to participate.  Your poodles are in the UK  now. But in the  United States of America. America  we're honoring our pets and Google Photos  has put together some special  treats. Starting this week  if you take a lot of photos of your cat or dog  the Google Photos app  may automatically create a photo book

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  starring your pet. And this is all  without opt in or buy in by the pet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  itself. No the pet's not involved.  In fact you aren't either. Pets are property.  They don't have consent.  There you go. Thank you. So  we're small children.  They're not property.  Google Lens will now  identify popular  breeds. So if you see  a Pembroke Welsh Corgi just lying  around and you say what is that?  Aww you like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're cute aren't they? That's like my I have a Corgi calendar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love Corgis. My sister had a bunch  of them. I love the pixie dust  effect. I love that on Lens. It's  so satisfying. It does  absolutely nothing but it makes you think  it is doing something. It's thinking.  It's better than a status bar. Thinking.  Might as well say working.  Fairy dust. Fairy dust.  And you can create a  movie using the  meow movie or doggy movie  option. They actually have options.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh my god. Where are my photos? I have to do this right now.  You want to see it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  meow meow meow meow

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  meow meow meow  cat movie obviously.  My god.  Could that be more annoying?  Oh my goodness.  Now coming. Oh I'm going to get parent  points. So many parent points.  Oh yeah. It's right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's face identification  for dogs is not so good here. I'm looking  at this and it's mixing all my dogs up.  It's only found three instead of four.  Oh that's not good. And it's not found  and it's labeled my previous dog  with the name of the new dog.  It's a completely different color.  So you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  into assistant

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in your Google photos.  And then at the top you see movie.  Oh is this on my phone?  Oh it's a mobile. Yeah.  You might be able to do it. I don't know if you can do it on this.  I'm going to do it on the mobile.  They have in movies they have several  choices. They grow up so fast. Watch a child  grow up right before your eyes. Meow  movie. Doggy movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh my god. Doggy movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In loving memory. Celebrate the life of someone who has  died. I don't know how  how does Google know that? Selfie  movie.  Smiles of 2017.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You tell them that person has died.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or when there's a lack of activity  by that person they just assume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now it says works best  if you have a lot of photos of a dog. Okay there's a  dog. Oh you're supposed to pick all the  dogs. So you have a lot of  cats in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm doing it. We're going to  see what happens. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  maybe. I have a lot of photos of my

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  dogs. This is true. Well I do but I only  my dog is dead. I wonder if I can create  a photo of  my dead dog and have it  in both categories. In

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  memoriam. In the future you'll be able to  clone your dog from just the photo. It's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  just from the photo. Who  cloned their dog? Barbara Streisand.  And then  Barry Diller  did it too. Because Barbara  was so happy with the cloning.  Mother's Day movie.  Father's Day movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder how sexist  each of those are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh should we try? No.  So you have to select the mothers.  Okay.  I'll select mothers. Different mothers.  Megan's a mother. Alright.  I've got three mothers. They're not the same mother. Does that matter?  Oh it takes a while. You get a notification  when it's ready. It's a slow mother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm waiting for my dog.  It's very popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When my dog one comes I'll show you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like Google Photos I have to say.  It's really  good. Surprisingly addictive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's another  Roach Motel. Once you have six  terabytes of photos in there you're never  downloading those photos. It would be impossible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I do upload them also  to Amazon. As long as I'm giving my information  away. I give them to Amazon, Flickr  and Microsoft too. Just to be fair.  They all have that.  Must be some value in those.  You can do it.  Shutterfly.  Smug Mug.  A lot of people have all my photos.  Smug Mug?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love Smug Mug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo.Camera is my new site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't seen Smug Mug in years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo.Camera. Look at this. A beautiful site  with all my pictures on it.  Isn't that pretty?  So there's that.  So I got  that going for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you basically spend  all your time managing a photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Guys I got my dog movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How can we see it? Can you share it with me  and I can show it here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Probably. Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Share it with Laporte at Gmail.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hold on. I want to make sure there's nothing weird.  Like naked animal pictures?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Sorry.  Google by the way, if you want to do it  on the desktop, Google's  uploader no longer, it's been  deprecated. You got to use the Google Backup and Sync  tool which is kind of the universal tool for  everything. I actually use  that because now I have my Google Drive  and it backs up my photos.  This seems to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  okay. So let's see. Save.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then share with  Laporte at Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh wait. I'll name her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sophie. See how easy this  is? I actually  share photos all the time now  on Google Photos because  Apple's added that feature as well. Send a link and stuff.  That's really simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Share. And I'm sorry Leo, where are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Laporte at Gmail. I'm going to have  to do a photo album of this late relative.  I think it'll be  a nice video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember them as they are now instead of  as they were.  Karsten's not picking up on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was number two, Karsten.  He's not taking the bait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Grandma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Grandma, grandma, grandma.  That should arrive.  So I should get a notification  that Stacey  has shared  a wonderful movie with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the things that I use Google Photos  for, and it's a very, very small,  simple feature, but sometimes I, like I'll  do a newsletter, I do Mike's List newsletter, and  I want to show multiple pictures.  And so I just go in there and I create a collage.  Wait, that's not mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is my movie.  Oh, okay. I was like, that's not my dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's all the pictures of dogs I've ever  taken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you'll recognize these photos.  I should have refuted.  Oh, there's Ozzy at the  Quilt Studios.  I like the music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ozzy was everywhere  in our life. Oh, I kind of miss him.  Look at those  ears. Yeah, he had big ears.  He's a sweet doggy. I miss him.  All right, well, that's cool. Let me see if I can find yours though.  I don't know  where yours is.  I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  know either.  Probably the single thing I love best about Google Photos  is I can just take photos like, I'll take  ten photos, and I  forget it, and then I get a little movie. Love the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  burst mode. Yeah, I love that too.  Love the burst mode. It should have.  I did this with my son jumping up and down  on the sailboat  in the Caribbean.  I don't know. I don't know why I'm not getting it.  I don't know. All right. Well.  That's all right. We get the idea. I played mine instead of yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's going to space, Leo. Tweet yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who's going to space?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Elon Musk? The movie.  The movie's in space. There's a Louis C.K.  I guess. I know. It's going to space. It's going to space.  Can you give it a second? Give it a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here I am. I'm two thousand miles  away from Stacey, and I'm wondering where is it?  It's a 400 gigabyte movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Give it a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Give it a minute.  Pixel and Nexos.  Good reason to buy a Pixel phone or a  Nexus phone from Google. Their dialer  will now just send spam calls right to voicemail.  All the  carriers are now doing this.  I was working out the other day  at the gym and I got a phone call.  I pulled it out and said, oh, I got to call  I showed my trainer. I got a call from Spam Likely.  He said,  who's that? Yours doesn't  do that? I guess he's on a carrier that doesn't.  Most carriers now will say Spam Likely, right?  Well, Google takes the next step.  Google takes the next step. They're just going to send it right to voicemail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I still think there's nothing better than Google  Google is a voice  which you have to go and explicitly  block numbers, but when you block them  it will lie to them. It plays them  a this number is no longer in service  message.  Which is fantastic because then  hopefully they can automatically  detect that and say, okay, well take them off the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does, alright, now we're getting serious.  Does YouTube  violate the  Child Online Protection and Privacy  Act? Yes.  That wasn't that.  Wait a minute, how did they know I was in Petaluma, California?  That's amazing.  You know, I get this ad a lot.  This is the strangest ad and they keep changing the  people in it.  This unbelievable tiny company is disrupting  a 200 billion dollar industry in Petaluma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I get that all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's in Austin.  And it's just some random pictures of start-up  but they keep changing the people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They just plug in wherever you are.  And everybody gets the same news.  So stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  YouTube on Sunday,  a coalition of 20 child  advocacy, privacy and consumer groups  filed a complaint with the FTC saying,  please investigate YouTube for  violations of COPPA.  Common Sense Media,  Center for Digital Democracy, parents across  America. Particularly,  COPPA protects  children under 13  from having their data collected.  The crux  of the complaint is that those younger kids  watching YouTube videos,  even though the company says,  did you know this? I didn't know this.  YouTube's terms of service  forbids under 13 year olds from watching.  Yeah.  What do they have a children's channel for?  What do they have Peppa the Pig for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do they verify anyone's age?  It's all just a big  charade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that thing that don't do this if you're 13 is kind of one of those  wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's their acknowledgement of COPPA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the 12 year olds are like, oh, okay, well,  I'm not going to use YouTube then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's interesting is the FTC has actually come  out and said, is it the FTC?  That they don't view  children talking to smart  speakers as a violation of COPPA.  So, but YouTube,  I would  argue, since they have a kids channel,  they are pulling IP addresses.  You can say, oh, there's a kid  in this house based on it. I don't know. It's just  kind of like, oh, why  are they drawing the line there?  I don't know. What's the legal argument? I should read the case.  Well, what YouTube would have to then

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  do is they'd have to do,  as Facebook and others are supposed to  do, age  verification.  You don't have to have a Google account to watch.  You could just watch, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the real, the  problem is that they have  blatantly children related  content that is for kids.  They have a channel called YouTube Kids.  And every single one of the videos on YouTube  Kids is available on regular YouTube.  And probably the vast majority  of kids under the age of 13 who use  YouTube are not going through YouTube Kids.  They're just doing whatever they say. But they say, we're doing YouTube Kids

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because we're curating the content so you don't  see those weird  videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they're doing YouTube Kids so parents can  put their kid in front of YouTube Kids and  trust in it. They're not doing it to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  actually help kids. But just to be  clear. But wait, it says here, a safer online experience  for kids. But it's a problem that I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  not sure Google can solve because  any kid, you know, kids  have cell phones when they're five now.  It's their own cell phone. And  they have them when they're six and seven and eight and nine, ten,  all the way up to eleven. And parents just give them an iPad and say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  go away, don't bother me for a couple hours.  It's mommy and daddy's  party time. Exactly. So they go to, they

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  download the YouTube app. They go and they set up an  account. It says you have to be 13. They're like, yeah, I'm  13. And then they just use YouTube like everybody  else. So we're talking tens of millions  of kids  do this. I mean, I think actually there's some

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  legitimacy to this complaint. I mean,  who's watching?  What 13 year old is watching  this?  Happy birthday to you.  Wow.  I mean, if YouTube has this  on YouTube, oh, there goes the flying lemon.  Here comes the scary clowns.  This might actually be PewDiePie's channel.  Is this PewDiePie?  No.  So what is YouTube  going to do in response to this? Are they going to  do they? Well, they're going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  all they can do is beef up their, I mean,  they're not going to have a real names policy or any sort of verification.  Right. So  but they're going to beef up their  kids channel and make it human curated,  which is into weird territory  because Google's whole mission in life is to do  everything with machines  and not people. But they're going to do the kids  version with  human curated. No, but they can't let

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they can't. But yeah, I saw that. But  if you but they're  they're also not supposed to let people under 13  use YouTube. Exactly. So I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, even Facebook, which has a  ostensibly has a real names policy  doesn't can't  you know, you're supposed to be 13 to use

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook. But my kids used it when they were  they all do. They all do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My child is on it all the time and she's 11.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey, what kind of  mother are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I know what she's watching. Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that kind of mother YouTube still  gathering information about

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they are. But you know what? A lot of  information. They've got a  lot of information. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's take a break.  Our show today brought to you by  Rocket Mortgage.  I can't wait to the day when I say my house  brought to you by Rocket Mortgage  not because they're good by my house, but because  I will get my mortgage through Rocket Mortgage.  You know, the house we live in right now. We bought  about four years ago and we got the mortgage  as most people did until  recently from a bank.  Go to the bank, fill out a form. You get  20 pages.

It's like going on.  Actually, you know, Facebook would be really handy if they did  this. I wouldn't have to fill anything out at all.  Yeah. No, this is better  than that. This is better than  that. You also, by the way,  by the way, that takes a  long time. When we bought our house four years ago,  it took us more than a month. We thought,  oh, we'll be done. We're going on vacation a month. We'll be done by  then. We were faxing.  First of all, good luck finding a fax machine.  We were faxing stuff back to the bank  from a cruise ship.  We had to call Lisa's sister Debbie and said, could you  send this? They want  more documents. We almost lost the house.  Fast forward, quick and loans. Number  one lender in the country.

We thank them so much for their support  of this week in  Google. We're calling Kevin Marks back.  Gonna get him, see if he's  better on a 4G. I bet he's not.  But who knows?  We shall see.  New Chromebook from HP, the  Chromebook X2, which looks a lot like  my Windows 10  NVX2.  I bet you it's the same hardware.  The pen looks the same, the keyboard looks the same,  it's got the same B&O sound.  But unlike the not so great  Windows on ARM  that my $1000  NVX2 is running, this  Chromebook X2 is running Chrome OS, which  means it probably runs a lot faster.  Mine has a Snapdragon 835 in it.  It's plenty of speed to run a Chromebook.  2GB of RAM, 12.3 inch  screen,  599, I'm sorry I gave you the wrong  price, 599 basic configuration,  which competes very favorably  with an iPad Pro  and includes the keyboard  and the pen.  I think that's gonna, this is a new form factor  for Chrome OS,  is these two in ones. I like the two  in one. Certainly customers  with the Surface Pro and so forth have shown  that they're interested in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it seems like a great device and it's great  to see the great devices.  In the old days you had like  one or two super high end  devices and everything else was a piece of junk.  This is how people first were introduced  to Chromebook. Yeah, it's too bad.  Nowadays you have a device like this that's  significantly cheaper than your average  smartphone, high end  smartphone, and it's super high end.  Very high quality, so that's  exciting. And of course, the  more stories come out about  privacy violations,  about security violations,  if you listen to Security Now, you will be frightened  into buying one of these things, Leo,  because it is scary. I tell everybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  who, I tell everybody  who asks, if  you don't have a compelling reason to get a Windows or Mac  PC, if you're not designing rockets or editing  video or something like that, get a Chromebook.  It's what most  people, I bet 90% of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what my daughter's next computer's gonna be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My daughter loves, she's 26 and college,  she uses a Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's very happy. Well, my daughter uses a  MacBook Air that I got from GigaOm.  To oversimplify,  it's coming on time. It is time, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't know what a computing platform is gonna be like.  The way it feels is everything.  For example, this gigantic thing that you use here.  I love this Surface Studio. It's the way it feels.  That's the important thing. And what people,  here's the biggest misconception about Chromebooks, people  haven't used it, they think it's gonna feel bad  to use. The opposite is true.  The knowledge that it's all in the cloud, that you just log in,  you can log in to any other device, it's the same  log in. You don't feel disadvantaged most of the time.  You don't. But you feel  liberated by the fact that  you don't have apps to manage, you don't have all this  data, that you're not sure what's on there,  am I being backed up, this kind of thing.  It's all in the cloud and it's very,  it feels really good to  use a Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We got Kevin Marks back. Let's see how it sounds now,  Kevin. You're on your phone?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm on my phone now, yeah, so let's see if that works any better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a little bit of latency, but it sounds better, so that's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you on an Android or an iPhone?  I'm seeing the data rate dropping down a bit.  Yeah. An Android, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course. Well, you're not a teenager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  According to  Piper Jaffray's Teen  Survey, 82%  of teens own an iPhone  in the US. 82%.  By the way, they own a phone.  82%, by the way, they asked thousands  of kids across 40 states,  average age 16.  That's up from 78% last fall,  up 4%. It's the highest  percentage of iPhone ownership among teens  they've seen ever. And,  the good news for Apple,  84% of teens say their  next phone will be an iPhone.  So it's going to continue to grow.  That is dominant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is crazy. Although it makes sense.  They're easy to use.  Probably a lot of kids,  there's a lot better parental and safety  controls on an iPhone than  Android. So, and  they're more secure. So,  as a parent, you're just like, here.  And, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there you have it. There's also a huge, and I  see this with my kids, who are not teens  admittedly, but there's a huge  peer thing going on. Oh, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Brand and cache. That's true. It's like having  the right genes or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there's even some practical things, because  Apple's messaging program  works best with other Apple phones.  And that's a big deal for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And you use all the stickers and stuff in  iMessages is  one thing. Some of the new stuff, I mean,  not a whole lot of these teenagers have iPhone  10s, but things like  the Animojis and  stuff like that are going to be  popular. But yeah, it's a  status thing. And again, this is  a population of people who mostly don't have jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mom and Dad are buying these.  I was going to say, a lot of people give them their old  phones. And what I think will be really  interesting, because I was listening to some kids  talk about the iPhone 10  and they were like, oh, it's terrible.  And the best iPhone is, was it  the iPhone 6? Which one  took off the phone jack or the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  audio jack? Yeah, I think the 6S was the first. Maybe  it was the 6. No, the 6 has

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a jack, but the next one doesn't. There wasn't  a 7, right? It's a 7. Okay. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was a 7. We skipped

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  something. I don't know.  And so they were talking, they were like, oh, I hate  it because I can't use my headphones and the other ones are  so expensive so my parents won't buy  them for me. Oh, interesting. So  I do wonder, like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe that'll change. If that changes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  things as people are like looking at  the cost. I mean, yes, you can buy. Of course, they have  Beats headphones. Maybe not. I don't know.  I'm not spending a  thousand dollars to give my child an easily  lost, you know, phone plus  earbuds. Good call. Have you used

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the Echo announcement feature  yet to call your daughter to dinner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We use the broadcast  feature, which

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is very similar. Now you can say, Echo  announce, it's time for  dinner. Or  tell everyone, it's time for  dinner. And everyone  with an Echo will hear

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Okay. You could do that  with Google Home under broadcast  with the Echo. We just call  in. We hang out. Use drop in.  Yeah. Drop in. Thank you. Yeah. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this is a drop into every Echo in the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's inevitable.  It's not a drop in. It's not an announcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. The syntax would be  Echo announce that. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  time for dinner. And they all have to be on the same Wi-Fi network,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  right? Is that how it's  deciding what's in the house? No, I don't know if that's true. I think  that when you set up the Echo,  because I have  when I open my A-word app,  it shows the Echoes that are here and  at home. And I think I could  add them to a group. It'd be interesting if I announced it was time for  dinner and everybody at the studio came over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder how many households have  both multiple  Echoes and multiple Wi-Fi networks.  It's probably less common than you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do.  It's actually really confusing  on Sonos and other things. Because if you're  not on the same network, you can't see it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know, the features are just going to keep  coming on these devices. It's such a wonderful  thing. And I can't wait for the business  and enterprise versions of these. It's going to be  amazing. Imagine, for example, you have  Wait a minute. You think there'll be Echoes in business?  Oh, totally. I think that the slam dunk  And I hope that Amazon is  working on it. So they have these like  desktop phones that have benefits  on cell phones. And they're kind of going out of style  because everybody wants to use cell phones. But imagine  a device that is like  a landline phone  that has a screen and there's also an  Echo and is also  for conference calls. Because people do do conference calls.  They put a speaker and microphone in the middle of the table.  Do you remember the old days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if they still have this. But I saw  this on TV the other day.  It was on Curb Your Enthusiasm from  where the secretary or the receptionist  would press the button  and say, Mr. LaPorte,  your three o'clock's here.  It would appear  in your... You would just hear it and then you would  talk back and say, okay, I'll be right out.  And you wouldn't have to do anything?  I saw that on TV and I thought, I want that.  That was 20 years ago.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so Amazon has actually said  that they're going into business. Verner actually  earlier this year talked about Amazon  for business. Or Madam A for  business rather. So the big  challenge there, there's two big challenges.  And they're going to allow customized skills.  So if you're IBM, you can actually build IBM  focused skills for your work.  The question is  without credible biometrics,  so credible voice recognition,  which we don't have yet,  how do you do things  like sysadmin, not sysadmin,  Microsoft's admin, what's it called?  Active directory.  Sorry, they're active directory things.  So how do you do... How do you make sure someone  doesn't log in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why you need a screen and  it needs to be a video  conference system anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, we'll see. And that is the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The ones on the Amazon page are just dots  and echoes.  Here's an Echo Show on her desk.  But here's the conference  room and this is their new conference phone  is an Echo Dot. But that's a lot  cheaper than one of those fancy ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A dot with a fire TV.  Yeah.  Or not a fire TV. You still need a camera for the  people I guess. Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love... This just re-emphasizes...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't have enough microphones for that to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's array microphones are  every bit as good as the crazy  octopus that we have in our conference  room. What is that called?  Polycom. Polycom. That's the default  right everywhere. It is.  You can see why Jeff  Bezos, my good buddy Jeff  would like a little chunk of that business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This business is very  right for disruption. Imagine if Amazon could  get in every office, every  conference room in  the world that would be... Well Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  push something like this  a while back, didn't they? They did  Hangouts Hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. They did. For $5,000.  It

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  wasn't Appliancy. So the  thing with these is that they're appliances. You  plunk them down and they sort of...  But IT hates appliances. Yes, they do.  IT is going to look at this and hate...  IT hates almost everything, new  thing that has come out. But to answer your question, Stacy,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it looks like it does integrate with  the business systems. Here's  from Amazon's page on this.  A word for business...  I want to call it A word. A word  for business uses information  about the devices, user accounts, and skills in your  organization. When someone in your organization asks  A word a question, A word  uses this information  to respond and perform the requested action.  For example, when a user says  Echo start the meeting in a conference room,  Echo uses the location  of the device, the calendar information  for the room, and the type of video  conferencing equipment available,  all stored in your A for business account  to start the meeting. So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So starting a meeting is different. I think  starting a meeting is a killer use case for this  sort of thing. What I'm curious about,  what I've talked to people about, there are companies in the  database world who are actually integrating with  Matamé and what they... You can say  what were  our EMEA sales for Q2  2016? But  that kind of data  should not be... If I can walk into any  conference room and ask that kind of data,  that's not cool. But they have voice

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  recognition, so could you conceivably have  authentication?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not good enough for authentication yet.  Dude, my Echos don't know  who I am. I'm still very upset about this.  Yeah. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  not to be an A word. Who do they think you are?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're just like,  I don't know, but you're on Stacey's account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey, we feel like we don't know you anymore.  We've all gathered together  and want you to know that we love you. They already

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  have pricing. It's because you went and signed into Facebook, you see.  Yes, if you would just use Facebook.  Yeah.  By the way, as jokey as that is,  that's absolutely gonna... It's already happening.  In fact, when I got rid of my Facebook account,  people said, well, how are you gonna log... What happens to all the things  you use Facebook to log into with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you do that? Don't do that.  That's giving all of that  data to them. What are you... Well, I don't do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it anymore, obviously. What did I call you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  when you bought the wrong camera? A doofus?  Yeah, don't be a doofus, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't be  a doofus, be a gallant.  There you go.  Yeah, no, well, because it's convenient.  Now I use Google, so that's  not any better, I suppose.  Okay, see, convenience. Single sign-on is so nice.  That's why we have no privacy.  Remember, what was that,  Kevin Marks at Microsoft Passport,  right? Microsoft Passport. That was  years ago. Passport, yeah.  Didn't go anywhere. I don't know why. Doesn't Apple have one of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  those, too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I never see it anywhere, and now they can't, because  they've decided they're going to be the privacy masters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think Apple does  anymore, no.  I'm trying to remember. There was  something a long time ago, but yeah, it never  took off in the same way. Actually, Microsoft...  They never really picked up the whole Apple thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Microsoft kind of has it down, because  Microsoft will do the  push-to-your-phone notification  now. I don't even often  have to give Microsoft my password. It just says  what's your account?  I say, Leo, and then they say,  okay, we're going to push something to your phone,  and then you get a two-digit  number. It says which of these four  two-digit numbers did your phone say? And that's  it. You don't even have to do the passwords. It's  really convenient, and all you have to do is put  the Microsoft authenticator on your phone.  But then I have this definitely fear of losing  my phone. Everything's in here now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a slight problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Two authenticators on my phone now, I'm like,  I put a thousand dollar bill  in my phone,  so that way I won't lose it anymore. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's a great plan, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I probably shouldn't have announced that either.  My brain actually tried to  pass that, and I was like, nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That way I won't  lose it.  Yeah, well, that's there, too.  Seven dollars a device for shared  devices. Seven dollars a month  for shared devices.  Three dollars per user.  So,  enrolled users can use an unlimited number of  personal devices.  I think this, does this  only make sense if your company has the  horsepower to write its own  echo tasks?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No. It's not hard to do a skill.  A lot of people don't have skills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But even without skills, I mean,  as with so many things,  overwhelming use for almost anything  is pretty banal uses. I mean, people are calling  people, leaving voicemail  messages,  having conference calls, people doing  simple stuff. Yeah. And so the skills  are just icing on the cake.  Very important for the biggest companies,  of course, but I think that, I think there's  a real place for this. Have you written any

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  skills, Stacey? Has Kevin, is he,  I know he wants... Kevin has written skills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My Kevin has  written skills, too. Oh, I bet you, well, your Kevin's  a serious professional in the business.  Yes, and he's playing with that a lot.  Is it Python?  He was with, he was with,  first he was with Tinker, then he  was with Piper.  And now he's bootstrapping  his own startup. Good for him, I didn't know that.  Also in the education space. Tinker and Piper

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  were awesome. Yeah, they were. Tinker still  is around, it's the app that teaches kids how to  program on the iPad. That's right. And Piper  was to build your own computer, which was really

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  cool. And these companies are all doing very  well. But yeah, he's got some  great ideas and he's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but I wasn't asking about that. I was asking what  language it was. Is Python  the language? I think he's using  Python, yes. I know Kevin's a Pythonista.  Pythonista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kevin, Marks, have you done any,  there's so many Kevins. What do all the Kevins do?  Or a Madame A skill? I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I  have not, though my son is working  at a games company that's building  a game for Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is his name Kevin, too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm learning about it directly through him.  His name's Andrew.  My son Andrew. So it's a company sensible  object that does piece of balance.  But they're also working on  games for voice now, which is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  interesting. Yeah, I'm really kind of intrigued.  I feel like I should write a  twit skill of some kind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to write a hotter, colder game. You could hide  like a little beacon or something. I guess you'd need a  Zigbee thing for the Amazon F+.  You hide it and then you could play it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  colder, or she would play it with you. And then Madame A  could in her prissy voice say,  You're getting colder.  You're getting colder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My grandpa used to play that with me because he was  not a very mobile person. So  he would just hide it.  We would do that for hours. It's kind of a grandpa  game, actually. Yeah, it really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it would be a great  twit skill would be just to have  your, because you had this whole network with all these  things. I subscribe to the Everything  Firehose. Yeah. And  that would be an awesome  thing because the way I use it is I want to listen  to the most recent show, and then I want to go  to the second most recent, and that's how I do it.  I use Overcast for that. But on the A-word...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't do it. It's only the most recent show now.  On the Echo. Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if you had a special skill...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I could say, listen to this number, show number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or you know, it's just a way to listen to  all the programs. I'll do it while I'm in Japan.  That would be killer. That would be so much better than what we

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  have now. I need something to do while I'm on vacation.  Here's an example of how  out of control the  friend-to-friend thing was.  And this is...  We're going back to Facebook. Now that we've had the refresher.  But I was really amazed  by this. This is in  New Zealand.  So ten people downloaded  a quiz in New Zealand.  And Cambridge Analytica got  New Zealanders.  Because everybody in New Zealand knows

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  everybody else. But that implies  followers per person.  Per person. I mean that's  quite a lot.  And in New Zealand.  Presumably New Zealanders  have friends who are outside of New Zealand as well.  They're very social people.  Maybe that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe that's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  secret. Or are they  gathering friends of friends?  How many...  How far

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  does it go? It's just one degree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One degree. Wow. Now that's  no longer the case.  But still, this comes from...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's way beyond Dunbar's number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then what's the thing with the  unsending...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So how many does Zynga have? Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Zynga. Yeah, right.  Farmville. Zynga's probably got the entire network.  They know everybody. They have it all.  They have the whole network. Two billion people.  Words with friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's how my data... That's the last  thing I remember doing on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Incredible.  It's all out there. Your information  is out there. We should get Mark

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pinker's on it. I'll skip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's a great idea. He doesn't  have a dog in this hunt anymore. He's like  you know, he  could tell us the truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Any VCing? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He can say what's really going on.  Not his VCing.  Vivo's YouTube account got hacked  and the most popular, the  most watched YouTube  video of all time, Despacito, disappeared  after being defaced  by hackers.  The video's image was altered and replaced  with a masked gang holding guns.  And the description  was changed by hackers calling themselves  pro socks and  kuroish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And nobody noticed. Everybody thought Despacito  was just really cool.  Look at all the Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Drake, Selena Gomez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some of these videos are still  up with defaced videos  and thumbnail images.  They were all uploaded directly  to the artist's own Vivo  YouTube accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  don't know, don't know, and I don't  know if they've figured out  how it happened, but  that's not good. There's what Despacito  looked like. I wonder if the music  was the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And just the picture was... Please don't play it. Please don't play it.  Please don't play it. You love Despacito.  Admit it. It's always in my head.  Just don't start it. I know. It's hard not to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, that's why it's an earworm.  You can't get rid of it.  You think it's something else, not an earworm?  Nothing like that.  What else do we get on top of? Fast Company  says this picture of Zuck's notes  is more revealing than the entire  Senate hearing.  Because you can read the notes.  He was prepared to snap back and forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All the stuff.  The notes include their own version of the infamous

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do Not Congratulate Putin memo  for President Trump. It says  Do not say we already do what  GDPR requires. Do not...  Mark, whatever...  Do not say  we do what GDPR requires.  They don't have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does it say I hear you on there?  I hear you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hear you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It says, refer question  to your team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is an awfully clear image.  You can really read these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, cameras are amazing.  You can read it with the toys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He left it out when he went to the bathroom.  He left it out when he went to the bathroom.  And boom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does it say what hotel he's staying at?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a good note.  GDPR. Don't say we already do what GDPR requires.  Don't say that, Mark.  Yeah, he was...  We were told he was training over the weekend  with surrogates and practicing.  Brought in a team of people to make him seem like he was human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They taught him how to blink.  That is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is far from the course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I know. I know. I would do it too.  The minute they ask me to testify,  I'm going to get a team in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's not really robotic.  He's got an awkwardness about him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I...  This is probably politically incorrect to say,  but looking at this,  it feels like he probably is on the spectrum, actually.  That he's maybe a little Asperger's or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Something.  It's not really clear what's going on with him.  He's a classic programmer-introvert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's a nerd of the nth degree.  He's a nerd of the nth degree.  Kevin, as somebody who's run many teams,  I mean, this is not unusual  to meet people like that,  but it's unusual to see them  having full control of a two-billion-person customer company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of the biggest source of information in the history of mankind.  That's what's unusual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it kind of came home to me because  now I understand why he has this disconnect.  He keeps saying, we want people to connect.  He doesn't understand why people are bothered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He just doesn't understand it at all.  I think that's disingenuous because he does understand it.  He keeps his data private.  That's... I mean, if he were out living the same life  and saying the same things, fine.  But he is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He bought every house around his house  so that nobody would look in the windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is actually not uncommon  with the crazy rich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if I had the money, I'd do it.  I've often fantasized about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like my neighbors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'd move you all in.  I'd make it the twit cul-de-sac.  Anyway,  your thoughts, Kevin.  I asked you a question and I didn't give you a chance to answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this is  Maciej Cziklowski's  Mormon bartender thing.  He says the only people who try to solve this problem  are the people who aren't qualified to do it  because they don't realize how complicated it is.  The Mormon bartender.  I like it.  He accused me of that a few years back.  We had a nice chat about it.  It is a challenge  in that you can't represent the nuances  of human communications in code.  We eventually realized that  and just try and provide a connection  between people.  That's what the social stuff is about.  But there is a...  You know,  what Facebook has done  has been very, very focused on connection  at the expense of everything else.  I'm sure you had the Bosmer one last week  and talked about that.  That was very much...  Yes, he was overstating it  for effect, possibly, but  it was a very good summation of Facebook position, I think.  It was the most important thing is...  It's like these sort of  tendentious AI arguments that Maciej goes after  very well as well, which is like the most important thing  is connecting people, therefore everything else is  subordinate to that.  And it's like, no, actually, that's not the most important thing.  At some point, you can have too much  connection and that's bad  and people want to start backing away.  You obviously believe that, or you wouldn't create  the algorithmic feed in the first place.  Part of it is that they have an  existential problem, which is their mental  model was they were growing all the time.  They kept doubling. They kept growing  year on year, they were getting bigger and bigger.  And they can't anymore because they run out of people.  And they started collecting  extraneous data to  try and keep the  sort of growth of the information they were gathering  to try and make sense of things  going up. And they've  crossed that saturation point now and they're going to have to rethink  what they're doing. And it is a  it's an identity crisis for them in many ways as well.  That's the other part of it from the  Facebook point of view, is that they are  they've gone through the  saturation point and they've got to do something else now.  There's a wonderful piece in The New Yorker

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  called The Infuriating Innocence  of Mark Zuckerberg.  And they  have this great phrase  ambient dislike.  People just don't like him.  That's not his fault.  They're trying to put his finger on it.  But the thing that they say is the  infuriating innocence  is this fact that whenever he's  apologizing, which he does frequently  it seems to be a major part of what he does  for a living,  it's not that he's  he never looks like he's remorseful.  He never looks like he's  guilty. He never looks like he's innocent.  He just is slightly sad  that things turned out the way they did.  And I think this is a hint to  the strangeness that is Mark Zuckerberg  and Facebook, their whole culture  is sort of this, they're not  immoral, they're sort of amoral.  Morality is just this  thing that is a PR problem.  If it goes south, the reason  he's always apologizing is that  they keep trying everything.  And if nobody  makes a stink about it, that makes  it ethically okay. If they make a stink  well we need to do better and think  about the broader picture and we need to refer to my team  and all the stuff that they do.  But the reality is that they  just seem to be mechanically  amoral. There's no  moral compass or ethical  guideposts at this company  whatsoever. Even at a company  like Microsoft or Google or Apple,  there's a sense of basic  doing the right  thing to a certain extent.  Whereas at Facebook there doesn't seem to be any  knowledge or awareness that that even  exists. It's like a program.  I've heard it described as they treat ethical issues  as if it's a programming problem.  It's an engineer's mindset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the Mormon bartender.  People who don't have friends  trying to figure out what a  friends graph is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's also  the McCrusty's problem. It's the idea  that they're so focused on  the model that stuff doesn't fit the model as an  error rather than a failure of the model.  The real  names thing has  been that for years. It's like, oh you must have a  name that we think looks like a name. What do you mean  your name is only one word? What do you mean  your name is fake?  That can't be real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a failure to recognize  and understand that there are  other points of view in the world and  other experiences which is why  people can argue for diversity in  tech or whatnot.  So yes,  you've basically created this monoculture  and it's an amoral monoculture.  And now we're all like, ah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the most chilling part of this  whole testimony in Congress that  nobody freaked out about but we should all start  really panicking about this. Which is  basically they're saying, well what about all this stuff?  Can't you have AI to  deal with some of the objectionable content  and all this stuff? And he's like, oh we got AI  to the point where we're like 90, 95 percent.  But in just a few years AI will  instantly censor things based on  Is that all realistic?  It's realistic and that's a problem because  when they make errors and objectionable  content gets on there and Russian  government does, you see  it. But if it's AI that makes it  invisible. They will be deleting things  and we will never know what's deleted. I feel like this is one of the hardest

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  things for a computer to do. This is what people have been  complaining  about this for. It's true. It's a legitimate  problem. People have been talking about it forever  starting with biases in their friend  feed. So people weren't aware that  Facebook was determining what you saw  based on a bunch of, an algorithm.  But what Facebook is trying to do  and this gets to Kevin's point  about reaching a saturation point.  Facebook needs to do things at  scale. Two billion people scale.  And they can't do that with actual humans  so they get as much  data as they can to try to replicate  the sense  that humans would have.  The ways we deal with things.  They just optimize  for things that not everyone would  optimize for. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But even humans can't do  things the way that humans want  them to go. This is what this whole thing  is about. And the thing that, the  categorical distinction that I  would make here is that when things happen  in darkness  and you have no way to know  Facebook is a black box.  Their algorithms that determine  these things and their AI are  and will be company secrets.  So we're talking about a censorship  machine that nobody  can see,  can know about, know how  it works, knows what censors and what isn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  censored. Facebook and Facebook did  promise that they would let researchers  start. For a long time they actually  didn't let researchers scrape Facebook's data  for their research. It was verboten.  So it violated their terms of service.  So that's actually, they're putting  in place mechanisms to stop that.  What's  hard is we're asking  machines in AI  to do things that people can't actually  do. And this gets to,  we have this utopian vision of  what machines can offer us.  But people, like  my favorite example is my Nest thermostat.  People are like, oh it'll know who you are and it'll give  you the right temperature when you get home.  And I'm like, yeah, it's a beautiful vision except for  my current comfy temperature is  77 and my husband's is like  72. The Nest, I  can't mediate that. We can't mediate  that. The Nest has no chance in  hell. So, and imagine  that writ large across  Facebook and  trying to figure out what people want.  It's a lose lose game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's a article by  Brian Krebs which just gives you an idea  of both the problem  and how hard, how intractable  it is. He's writing, don't give  away historical details about yourself.  And he's pointing  out that there are many quizzes  on Facebook which people gleefully  answer that ask you the same exact  questions that your secret questions  are going to ask you.  Good old days. What was your  first pet and what was its name?  Tell us the name of  your special furry friend.  Women working.  From SpringChicken.co.uk  an e-commerce site.  It asks users to  tell them, what street did you  grow up on? What's the first address you  remember living at? Let's see if we can put some  SpringChicken in touch with old friends. What could possibly  go wrong?  What was your first job?  What's your mother's maiden name?  Practically your high school  mascot. What's your password?  How long have you and your spouse been together?  Where did you meet?  From AntiAcid. These are all  Facebook quizzes folks.  68,000 Facebook users  answered this question. What's your favorite  I'm sorry, 6800  Facebook answers to. What's your favorite movie of all?  Time. This is from the  Women's Working Facebook page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what this does though? These security questions  are just absolutely asking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really? That's the problem I have to say.  It's not so much that they're asking these questions  it's obvious why they are. But it's a terrible  I tell everybody I know to not answer  security questions with real

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  answers. Remember Sarah Palin's  email was hacked because  she used a password that referenced  her past and he just looked  up her Wikipedia page. Paris Hilton used her dog's name

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to her secret question to  her Apple account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even Apple uses  secret stuff like that.  No one should use secret questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because everybody does. Authentication is  a problem. That's a big problem. But because  everybody does, just use your last pass  generate Garbally Gook  and keep track of it.  Garbally Gook is a good strategy. That would be the answer  to all my secret questions. Several times I've

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  had to go in and produce  this content at Apple and it's like what was your  favorite teacher? And I'm like I hated them all.  I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What you should probably do is go to the Good Old Days page where you  probably answered this question.  Exactly. Well they're not going to give you that data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're not going to tell you what you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is Garbally Gook  I think that's a good  neo-logism.  Is it Garbally?  It's Gobbledy. But I think Garbally Gook

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It sounds encrypted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  United Airlines, Patrick Delahanty  is telling us, has only a few  security questions and then asks you to pick your answer  from a list.  It's making it even worse. You can't put in  Garbally Gook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's your favorite singer?  From a list of five or something. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They do, literally.  It's all Garbally Gook. All the way down.  Kevin Marks, always a  thrill to have you on. I really appreciate you taking time.  It's practically the middle of the night where you are.  Tell us something  good and wonderful that you want to share with  the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the  IndieWeb.org of course is the ongoing thing  that everyone should look at. It's particularly  relevant in the world of Facebook. We've seen lots of  people suddenly picking up on this  and saying, oh wow, maybe we should do more of this ourselves.  So it's a  movement to say, you should have your  own website. You should work on that.  There are regular meetings  in multiple cities.  The evening ones, the homebrew website  clubs. I think the next one's  next week on Wednesday.  And then there's  which is the sort of more  intense IndieWebCamp, which was how  the idea started.  I can't remember where the next one is because  I don't have  the screen up. But go there and have a look.  And there's also  a continuous chat going on there  that's in IRC  and on the web and  in Slack in parallel, where  we talk about these things and what we're doing.  One of the things that's going on at the moment is  there's a lot of work going on  about building readers,  building a UI for reading things  that is  a combination of  stuff you've published,  news feeds and  social feeds as well. So that's  an ongoing discussion. So if you're thinking about those things, pop in and see what's going on.  Nice. And I see that  it's very apropos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They just concluded the Internet Identity  Workshop in Mountain View,  which I take it is...  Oh yes, I missed that this time. Yes.  Other great stuff is coming up, though.  It's all in the calendar at IndieWeb.org.  Mike Yelgin,  share something with me.  Okay, I've got something to share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there is  this whole category of productivity apps  about which I tend to be obsessed.  And I gave a big plug to Noto yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fantastic.  On iOS today. I made it in my app cap.  It's really cool. Let's you email yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With a swipe. It's just like Tinder without the consequences.  And one of the things  that's great about Noto also  is that when you are on other apps  or on a browser or something, you hit share  and choose Noto. That's the end of it.  There's no further dialogues and nothing.  It just goes right to your email. Anyway, so here's  another productivity app that I really, really love.  It's called TaskAid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the one I didn't like.  But that's only me.  TaskAid? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because it gives you a timer.  No, that's not the one.  You're thinking of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had two apps I can't live with that. It was a to-do list  that started a timer.  I love that one.  You get things done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So TaskAid has no timers.  Basically, this is like Trello or Zenkit  or any of these, but it's more simple.  So it's TaskAde.com.  Check it out.  This is available on Android, IOS.  It's a desktop.  And it's also, best of all,  it's a Chrome plugin so that  when you have a new tab, it shows you  your tasks. It's not just to-do.  It's lists. It's lists,  bullet lists, and  it's for groups  as well. So you can have one for yourself  for work. You can have another group  for yourself for personal stuff. You can have one for your  group of people and then you can have one for  your weasel club or whatever it is you do.  And the data  from each platform  shows up on the others. It's completely free.  There's no cost at all to this.  It's a completely free thing. They use  a lot of like...  It's colorful and  almost cartoonish. They use  little icons  and pictures and  stuff like that. And they automate the list to a  certain extent. You can sort of select  a list and then just share it on other  media.  It's just great in every way. If you want to keep track  of what you're doing, maintain lists, have  things at your fingertips. It's great to be able  to put things into a browser, be reminded  by the browser when you open a new tab  every time you open a new tab. And then also  you're out and about and you're like, what was that thing? You just  whip it out on your phone and the data that you entered  on your desktop is right there on the phone. So it's  collaborative.  It's cross-platform.  I can't believe it's free.  It's completely free. Now they're going to monetize,  they say, by in the future,  at some time in the future, they're going to have additional  features. But they say that all the  existing features will remain free forever.  So it doesn't have  a deadline on using this thing. It's going to be  free forever. And if you want to upgrade to the  features in the future, which by the way,  don't sound all that compelling. Some of them involve  stickers and things like that. Wait, did you read the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  privacy policy? Oh, dear.  And the data collection vote? I'm just asking.  I'm just asking if you're going to use

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the tools or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I'm going to try to get a little bit of  clarity with this.  I'm going to start with the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  data collection.  We can not complain if we do not tell

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  people in the media when we recommend this  stuff that.  That's true. I like to replicate the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ordinary user experience. So no, I didn't read it.  As a member of the media,  I do think it's your job.  All right. We need to do better.  Where is the privacy stuff?  It's private.  There's usually two. There's terms of service.  We collect and manage user data  according to the following privacy policy.  With the goal of incorporating  our company's values, transparency,  accessibility, sanity, usability.  We collect anonymous data,  anonymous for every visitor to monitor  traffic and fix bugs. Of course they do.  We ask you to log in and provide personal  data such as name and email  address in order to be able to save your profile.  They got to do that. You could make that be fake.  In order to enable these or any  login based features. We use cookies.  Sure you do. Because you have to.  You can block or delete cookies and still use task aid.  Although if you do, you'll be asked for your username and password  every time.  You could  provide us with other personal information  but you don't have to. That's up to you.  We only use your personal information  to provide you with the task aid services  or communicate with you. Let me see what the  third party stuff is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is really good actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm glad you asked.  This is how most of these start.  We do not share your information with third parties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Our only aggregated and  anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services  to help us improve the website and service.  That's what Tinder did.  But it's anonymized.  We use the social login buttons but Stacy  I'm not going to use those anymore.  I'm going to go through the trouble of creating a password  and all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have last class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. I could just do that.  We may choose to buy or sell assets.  If we or  substantially all of our assets were acquired  or if we go out of business or bank or so, user information  would be one of the assets that is transferred  or acquired by a third party.  You acknowledge that such transfers may occur  and that any acquirer of us  may continue to use your personal information  as set forth in this policy.  But you know what? This looks pretty good. I have to say, Stacy.  I don't see any big gaps.  I'm not saying it's evil. I'm just saying we need to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the right  response to my unbridled  enthusiasm about this app.  I didn't read the privacy policy. It could have been horrible.  I've done that before. I used to  recommend U-roll.  Unroll. Unroll me.  That was a bad one.  My son is like, you use  Unroll Me? What are you, nuts?  Well, they got in trouble.  Just to circle back on what we were  talking about before. The app  that I loved and you hated is called  Effortless. It's for Mac OS  only. It's for the desktops. They don't even have a mobile  version. But you have a to-do  list and you put a number at the end, which is the number of minutes.  It has a timer, which annoys you.  So annoying.  I like it because I need a timer.  It's like having your mother in your computer.  I need my mother in my computer. Have you finished that yet,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Michael? Finish that  article, Michael.  There's no other way I'm going to finish that article.  That's me.  That's me.  Exactly what I will do.  Screw you. I'm going to go watch  TV.  Stacey Higginbotham,  your pick of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you asked me, I guess, two  weeks ago, I had gotten the Nestor bell  and I showed that to you guys. So I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.  But I also, The New Yorker  did an article, I think it's their April 2 issue.  Oh, my family's home.  So are we already living in virtual reality?  What's cool about this is I'm not super excited  about virtual reality, except  this made a really good case  for psychology  in this concept of embodiment  in terms of widening people's horizons,  in terms of giving  people legitimate other points of view.  And even like they have this guy  doing an interview with himself  that made him look at his whole  dilemmas and the way he  talks to himself differently.  So I looked at this as like  a psychological tool  and like maybe a tool to  encourage empathy. And I  had never really thought about it that way. So I just thought it was a really  interesting,  to me, mind-opening article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is interesting. In the meantime, we have literature  to, to, and talking  to yourself. Okay, so what they,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so what they did, and  we do have that, and I think that works  for some people, but what they do is, it's not just  virtual reality, they actually, physically  take your motions  and put them, like, if I'm doing this,  they could show me in virtual reality  a, a man.  And then by virtue  of syncing my movements with  him, I actually, and then they change the  first, yeah, I lose body awareness,  and then they change my perspective, so I'm  taller, or, you know,  I have a different, so they actually  did a thing where they put men  who abused women, and  they, they did that, and put them  in a woman's, a virtual woman's body.  A virtual woman's body.  And it actually, the results  were great. They, they changed their perspective  entirely, and six weeks later  it was the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's another story. Yeah.  No, this is really interesting. It sounds fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've known about this for some time. It's really interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  research. I was, I had no  idea this was happening, and I was just super

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  excited. And I'm sorry, Stacy, that was a  piece in The New Yorker? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. It's the April 2nd  New Yorker, Joshua Rothman.  Fantastic. Are we already living in virtual reality?  I'm going to read this  cover to cover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In actual reality. In actual reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In actual reality. Yeah, the whole, the whole  issue was about the mind. There was some sort  of metaphysical, like, extension  of yourself, and I kind of lost that.  Yeah. But, let's talk about the nest.  Yes. Okay.  Let's see. Oh, I should see if I can,  oh, it's an iPad. So,  forgive me, because I'm using my iPad, because it's  bigger. Well, we can see it better that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so let me, let me.  It's a little dabba-doo-ya, a little dooby-dabba.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just have to make it work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Meanwhile, I'll  install this Taskade.  Now that I feel like the privacy  policy is, you know,  it's pretty good. It's not bad.  Good. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't make fun of me, but I'm having a hard time working  finding things on the iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like, oh, Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, this is, this is the,  it's the new doorbell from the Alphabet  company, Nest. Actually, now it's a Google company,  Nest. And it's much like  our sponsor, the Ring Video Doorbell. It's a camera.  You could see who's  at the door. You could talk to them. You can listen to them.  I already have  a Nest installed. Should I, I mean,  I'm not a Nest, a Ring  installed. Should I,  why would I, that's actually, I guess, question  number one. Is it different?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's very similar to the Ring  Pro. It is  The Ring Pro, I believe, is $250.  The cool thing is  they have the facial recognition  feature. If you have  a Google, so, a couple things. If you are  in a Google home, I would  actually pick this over the Ring Pro.  When,  with the facial recognition turned on,  when it sees me, it can  actually, I have it set up so it'll  announce me on the Google Home and  Google Assistant devices in my house,  and it'll say, Stacey's home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So like on Downton Abbey, when somebody  shows up to the party, like it'll  announce,  the Russia's Earl  and,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, and here, I have

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to show it on my, I can't work the  iPad out because I'm an idiot, but  okay, here we go. Can you  see? That's my  door.  And then here is,  my family coming home right now, like a few  minutes ago, I got a notification, that's them.  So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is that a balloon? It is a balloon. It's my  birthday balloon! It can handle  mylar balloons, Leo. This is way better than.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just spoiled their  birthday balloon. You don't have to tell  them.  Okay, anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You invaded your own privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait, did we see a cake? Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, stop looking. Stop.  Stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stop. Looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, the camera quality is great.  The integrations with

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  other Google stuff is pretty cool. It

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  actually makes me want to, and  I'll tell you guys, because

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  next week, or later this week, the rest of  this week, I'm Google-ifying my house.  So, next week, I can actually  show you some very cool things that I'm trying to  do. And I'm doing it in preparation for  the smart displays from  Google Home. Nice. So, coming  this summer. So, basically,  I don't know what you want to know about this.  The install is very similar to the Ring Pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you're in a Google household,  I would definitely go with  this over the other. I  like the look of the doorbell a little bit better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can set, I don't think the  motion detection is as  granular as  the Ring Pro, which gives you all the very cool,  like you can block out on the  screen what you don't want.  But it does give you, with the Nest,  they have a subscription. So, it gives you  access to all of this. And I think the facial recognition  is actually really kind of cool. Stacy, what is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the price of the cloud storage for  storing videos  if there is a subscription? I think it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yeah, Nest Aware, I  think it's $10 a month, but let me just double-check.  That's what Nest is in general. I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you maybe pool it with all your other Nest  stuff, maybe giving you a say?  $30 a month for 30  days, $10 a month for 10 days.  10 days is enough. $100 a year.  Yeah, 5 days is fine. 5 days is enough, really.  That's $5 a month.  That's a good price, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or $50 a year. So, I like that.  And it's very reasonable.  And it's half off for Nest  Aware for additional new cameras. So, if you already have  it,  if you have two, it's going to be  $7.50 for the cheapest. If you have three cameras,  it's going to be $10, etc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would like to get like five or six  of those and put them all over the house and announce  everywhere I am. Mike is  going down the hallway. Mike is  entering the bedroom. That wouldn't be too annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You go for them.  And how much? $2.99 you said?  $2.39. That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I will say, though, the install, just like  the Ring Pro, they have a  chime that you're going to have to install on your doorbell,  like the actual physical door  chime that's in your house.  And this is a wired doorbell.  And, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Say hello, even when you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And, oh yeah, it's  two-way audio. And actually, it can always be  listening. So, it  came in handy because my  FedEx guy came and I had a  I got the Ecobee switch that just arrived today.  And he knocked on my door, except he  didn't. But he said he knocked because I  caught him after he was like.  And then he's like, I knocked. And I was like,  I believe you. And then I go  and I look. So, did you confront him?  No, I'm not going to confront a FedEx guy. His life

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is miserable. No. How does that work  if it's always listening? You end  up with 24 hours of audio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I can just listen in on it.  Oh, I see. Just live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  I bet that's the case because you wouldn't want it streaming the whole  time. That's a lot of data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a lot of audio. Yeah.  A lot of birdsong in my neck of woods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stuff that you don't really care about.  It might be nice to do this sort of like  the dash cam thing where it  records and then overwrites its own  data so that you can say, you know what, give me the last  hour. Well, you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  can do that with the Nest. If you're familiar  with the Nest Aware stuff, so  the timelines that they have, I think they call it Sightline.  So, you can actually scroll  back through your timeline.  I don't know if you can  see. So, this is  my timeline down here.  So, I can scroll through  and see what's  happening. Oh, nice.  And it's showing me motion. Like, that's when my  family just came home. That's cool.  I like that. It's showing you. Yeah, the Nest cameras

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  do that too. I really love that  feature, I have to say, because you can quickly  go to motion and  see what's going on. It's also fun for  a time lapse of the sun coming up.  I really enjoy that. Yeah.  And we look for, Lisa uses it to look for  her cats. Yeah.  See what they're up to.  There you go. Thank you for the review. And I  presume you're going to, are you going to write this  up in Stacey on IoT, your fabulous  free newsletter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How are the blinds working, by the way? Are they going up and down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They are. The blinds are still  working. I did dump my IKEA  trod-fee lights because they do not work  with Betama-A, so. Oh, that's too bad.
